The barley disease ramularia is potentially resistant to 3 key fungicide groups according to recent findings. Testing in southern Germany by Bayer has confirmed 2 new mutations [with] effect on SDHI and azole fungicides. Resistance to strobilurins has previously been confirmed.

The mutation in the target site for azoles has been found to severely affect the performance of all actives in this group. The SDHI mutation has led to full resistance to all members of that group. Where these mutations have been found, no SDHI or azole fungicide will now control ramularia, even when used at full rates.

It leaves the multisite chlorothalonil as the only effective chemical option. The German authorities are now advising [its] use in all applications in barley. Bayer is awaiting the results of the UK samples from 2016 [and] adds that this serves as a warning about the need for best practice stewardship of fungicides in all crops.

[Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) of barley is caused by the fungus _Ramularia collo-cygni_. It is considered an emerging pathogen of increasing importance on barley crops, especially in Northern Europe. Symptoms including small brown rectangular lesions with yellow margins within leaf veins, premature leaf senescence, and loss of plant vigour. RLS can cause extensive damage to the upper leaves in spring and winter barley once crops have finished flowering, which can lead to extensive losses in yield and quality. RLS is often found in association with other leaf spots such as sun burn, agrochemical scorch or nutritional stress.

The fungus is spread with infected plant material and wind. It can also affect some other graminaceous hosts, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It can be detected on seeds and in symptomless leaves and may spread in crops sometimes without causing severe epidemics. The fungus has a long endophytic growth stage before becoming an aggressive pathogen. It poses the greatest threat to spring malting barley, and resistant varieties are being developed. Disease management at present relies mainly on fungicide treatments, with correct timing being critical. As stated above, rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is vital to extend the useful life of any of the compounds.

The related species _Ramularia beticola_ causes leaf spot disease on sugarbeet.
