Farmers in the Mtubatuba district of KwaZulu-Natal are "hoping and praying" that the foot and mouth disease (FMD) case detected at a dip tank in the previously reduced disease management area (DMA) does not mean the disease has spread further.

This was according to PJ Hassard, president of the KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Union, responding to a recent report by the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (agriculture department), which indicated that while 2 locations affected by the original outbreak in May 2021 were recently removed from the list of those affected, a new location had been added. [The new outbreak is presented in map 2 in the official report; see in commentary. - Mod.AS]

Serological and clinical surveillance of animals had been ongoing since last year [2021], and observations at the 2 previously infected feedlots indicated that there had been no active disease-spread among animals for a period of more than 6 months. The quarantine restrictions had also been lifted on feedlots, and slaughterings for the local market in the DMA were continuing.

The new positive location reported earlier this month [February 2022] fell within the reduced DMA. Clinical inspection and sample collection were being intensified in the newly identified infected area to determine the true extent of the disease, the agriculture department said in a statement. "We are eagerly awaiting the results of the tests that were done at the affected dip tank [FMDV SAT-2 has been identified; see commentary. - Mod.AS]. This is a stressful time, and our sincere hope is that the disease [has] not spread from the reduced DMA to the surrounding surveillance area. The FMD outbreak had a terribly negative impact, [both] financially and economically, on the entire agricultural value chain in the region," Hassard told Farmer's Weekly.

According to him, communal farmers were bearing the brunt of the financial impact. While commercial farmers had, to some extent, the means and infrastructure to register feedlots and to have animals slaughtered at FMD-registered abattoirs, communal farmers did not. They were thus often forced to move their cattle surreptitiously and illegally.

The agriculture department declared a DMA in KwaZulu-Natal on 30 Jun 2021 after the outbreak of FMD, which was reduced in size in September 2021. This reduced DMA, with all of its control measures, was still in place. This included restrictions on the movement of cloven-hoofed animals and their products and genetic material out of, into, within, or through the revised DMA, the statement said.

[On 31 Jan 2022, Rep. South Africa's directorate - animal health in the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development published an 'Update report / Foot-and-mouth disease outbreak / KZN / Mtubatuba / 27 Jan 2022, available at https://nahf.co.za/update-report-foot-and-mouth-disease-outbreak-kzn-mtubatuba-27-january-2022/. These are monthly reports.

Selected excerpts follow:

"This report includes all information as available by close of business on 27 Jan 2022. All the updates contained in this report may not currently reflect on the OIE WAHIS system due to technical difficulties with the OIE reporting system."

"Current status: Since the previous update report of December 2021, there has been a change in the number of FMD-affected locations in KwaZulu-Natal Province. At the time of the last report, there were 26 affected locations. Since then, 2 locations have been resolved and closed with the OIE, and one new location has been added. There are therefore currently 25 affected locations. Serological and clinical surveillance is ongoing. Movement control measures remain in place in the reduced disease management area [DMA]."

"Affected locations: Clinical and serological surveillance at the 2 previously infected feedlots indicated that there was no active disease spread amongst animals for a period of more than 6 months. Quarantine has been lifted on both feedlots, and slaughtering is continuing for the local market.

"The positive dip tank locations identified in 2021 encompass 2 clusters in communal grazing land. A new positive location was reported between the 2 main clusters in January 2022, still within the DMA. Clinical inspection and sample collection is being intensified in the newly identified infected area." [Map 2] indicates the two clusters of infected dip tanks in Nongoma and Hluhluwe, as well as the newly identified positive dip tank in the Hlabisa area."

"Clinical and serological surveillance is ongoing to provide as much information as possible regarding the newly infected area. The use of vaccination may be re-considered after gathering the relevant information about the recently affected location."

"Epidemiological investigation: Clinical and serological surveillance around the affected areas continue, with intensified inspections around the newly identified infected dip tank. The virus involved in the newly affected area is the same SAT 2 serotype that was involved since the start of the outbreak in May 2021. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as serological detection of antibodies against the virus at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research OIE Reference Laboratory - Agricultural Research Council confirmed all infections to date.

"Since the start of the outbreak in May 2021, samples have been collected from 421 locations in the province. Two rounds of serological surveillance have been completed and a 3rd round is underway, which will mainly focus on the newly identified positive dip tank. [Map 3] indicates all surveillance that has been done since the start of the outbreak. The red dots and star indicate the positive locations, while green dots/stars indicate negative locations as tested in the different surveillance rounds.

"Trade implications: There has been no change in the trade implications since the previous report. Most trade partners retained the agreements negotiated in 2019, following the loss of South Africa's FMD-free zone status, for commodities processed to ensure inactivation of the FMD virus and for pigs, pig semen, raw pork, and pork products from known FMD-free pig compartments."
