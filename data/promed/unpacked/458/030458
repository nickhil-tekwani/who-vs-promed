In June, The Southern Nevada Health District opened an investigation into 2 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported in guests who stayed separately at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV in March and April [2017]. Now 5 months later, health officials say the case tally has risen to 7, with 29 additional suspected cases.

According to a Las Vegas Review-Journal report this week [week of Sun 12 Nov 2017], The Rio hotel disinfected the Ipanema Court and Masquerade Village towers in June [2017]. Since then, the staff has been cleaning and testing the premises to make sure the disease is wiped out.

"In a situation like this, part of the process of these investigations on an environmental aspect is continued testing and monitoring," said Robert Cole, the health district's senior environmental health specialist. Often the process, which includes precautionary disinfection of water systems, will continue for up to a year, Cole said.

The report also states that a recent health department report said there were 56 suspected cases of influenza-like Pontiac fever, a milder illness caused by the same bacteria, at the hotel, for a total of 92 confirmed or suspected cases related to the outbreak.

The main causative organism is the bacteria, _Legionella pneumophila_. The _Legionella_ bacteria are found throughout nature, because of this most people become exposed to it but few develop symptoms. The primary place in nature it's found in water sources particularly at warmer temperatures; lakes, rivers and moist soil. It is also found in man-made facilities (frequently the source of outbreaks) such as air-conditioning ducts and cooling towers, humidifiers, whirlpools and hospital equipment. People get exposed through inhaling infectious aerosols from these water sources. There is no transmission from person to person. The infection can appear in 2 clinical forms: Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever.

Both conditions are typified by headache, fever, body aches and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhea. Legionnaires' disease is the cause of pneumonia, where a non-productive cough is typical. Pontiac fever is a self-limiting flu-like illness that does not progress to pneumonia or death. Diagnosis is usually made by typical symptoms in an outbreak setting. Certain health conditions make you more susceptible to infection to include increasing age, smoking, chronic lung disease, malignancy and diabetes mellitus. Legionnaires' disease is treatable with antibiotics.

To following things can be done as preventive measures: cooling towers should be drained when not in use and cleaned to remove scale and sediment and biocides can be used to limit bacterial growth. Tap water should not be used in respiratory therapy devices.

Up to 5 months after an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease was reported at the Rio [Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada], the number of confirmed cases of the pneumonia-like bacterial illness among guests has risen to 7, with 29 more cases suspected, the Southern Nevada Health District said [Tue 14 Nov 2017].

Meanwhile, cleaning and testing of the hotel's water system is continuing to ensure the disease has been eradicated. That's a normal timeline for a Legionnaires' outbreak investigation, health experts say. "In a situation like this, part of the process of these investigations on an environmental aspect is continued testing and monitoring," said Robert Cole, the health district's senior environmental health specialist. Often the process, which includes precautionary disinfection of water systems, will continue for up to a year, Cole said.

The investigation began in June [2017] after 2 people who stayed at the Rio separately in March and April [2017] tested positive for the disease. The hotel's Ipanema Court and Masquerade Village towers, on the building's south end, were disinfected in early June [2017].

Since then, the health district has received notifications of the illness among guests who left Las Vegas and were diagnosed in their hometowns, according to Kimberly Hertin, the health district's disease surveillance supervisor. The timing of those exposures is not clear, so the district leaves the investigation open while those reports trickle in, she said.

In addition to the Legionnaires' outbreak, an October report from the health district said there were 56 suspected cases of influenza-like Pontiac fever, a milder illness caused by the same bacteria, at the hotel, for a total of 92 confirmed or suspected cases related to the outbreak.

Rio staff launched a 3rd disinfection procedure on [Fri Nov 3 2017] as a precaution. All recent tests of the hotel's water systems showed low or no presence of the _Legionella_ bacteria, and guests are not currently at risk for infection, Cole confirmed. Results from the latest disinfection will be available by the end of the month, Cole said.

[Rio Las Vegas is an all-suites hotel and casino near the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_All_Suite_Hotel_and_Casino). The hotel consists of the Ipanema Tower opened in 1990 and the Masquerade Village tower and casino opened in 1997. There are several private villas on the property and the Rio Pavilion convention center.

The timeline of the outbreak spans 9 months, with one case in March 2017, one case in Apri 2017, followed by another 5 confirmed and 29 suspected cases of legionnaires' disease occurring in the subsequent 7 months; presumably 5 confirmed and 29 suspected cases occurred after the hotel's Ipanema Court and Masquerade Village towers, on the building's south end, were remediated in early June [2017]. The locations in the hotel where the cases had stayed are not given, nor are the dates of onset for the cases or the _Legionella_ species causing their disease given. We are also not told the results of environmental sampling for _Legionella_. Genotyping of _Legionella_ clinical and environmental isolates would help establish transmission pathways. In addition, 56 cases of Pontiac fever occurred at the hotel, but no specifics are given. A more detailed description of this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that is less severe than Legionnaires' disease, and develops from hours to 2 days after initial infection with fever, malaise and muscle aches. Symptoms resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment. Attack rates are high; up to 95 percent of exposed persons become ill. Unlike, legionnaires' diseases, there appear to be no predisposing host conditions for Pontiac fever. Pontiac fever takes its name from an outbreak in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan.

Both Legionnaires' disease and presumably Pontiac fever is acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, water fountains, and cooling towers. Why some persons exposed to contaminated aerosols develop legionnaires' disease and others develop Pontiac fever is unknown.

The diagnosis of Pontiac fever is usually made on the basis of epidemiologic, clinical, serological, environmental microbiology findings, and, in a variable portion of the affected people, the development of antibodies to the bacterium isolated from the environment. Urinary antigen for _L. pneumophila_ serogroup one is uncommonly positive, and cultures are rarely positive for legionella in patients with Pontiac fever. For a discussion of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of Pontiac fever, see Edelstein PH. Urinary antigen tests positive for Pontiac fever. Clin Infect Dis 2007; 44:2229-31. - Mod.ML
