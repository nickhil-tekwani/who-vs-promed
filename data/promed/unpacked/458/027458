[The report, which includes an interactive map, addresses outbreaks
allegedly starting between 18 Dec 2010 (the earliest one) and 29 Jan
2011 (the most recent one covered in the report). The 1st outbreak,
reportedly starting on 18 Dec 2010 and resolved 15 Jan 2011 (probably
end of quarantine status), affected a Taechon pig farm, Taechon
county, P'YONGAN-BUKTO province, where 3969 out of 4200 susceptible
swine died (map at <http://healthmap.org/r/0vgw>). These are
exceptionally high mortality figures.

The 2nd outbreak, reportedly starting a day later, namely on 19 Dec
2010 and resolved 20 Jan 2011, similarly affected the Jangchon
cooperative pig farm, Sadong, P'YONGYANG-SI province, where 63 out of
104 susceptible swine died. The fact that these apparently
simultaneous 2 1st outbreaks were reported from pig farms situated in
different provinces may be interpreted as indicative of a possible
earlier start of the epizootic in N. Korea, and/or a common source for
the 2 outbreaks.

There have recently been several alarming media reports claiming that
"the regime has stopped issuing travel permits to Pyongyang from
provinces" and that "a guard post between Pyongyang and Pyongsong is
preventing vehicles from entering the capital;" (for example, see
<http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/02/21/2011022101243.html>).
While the accuracy of this information is not verified, it may reflect
a grave, deteriorating situation.

On 10 Feb 2011, it was published that N. Korea applied for the
support of FAO concerning its FMD situation. On 11 Feb 2011, it became
known that the FAO was about to dispatch "3 to 5 experts, including a
veterinarian," to N. Korea during the week of 14 Feb 2011 (see
postings archived 20110210.0457 and 20110211.0470). Results of the
said mission are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
