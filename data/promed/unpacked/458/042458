State Veterinary Service: 176 000 head of cattle have been infected with bunyavirus virus in Azerbaijan
------------------------------------------------------
The State Veterinary Service (SVS) under the Ministry of Agriculture has today held a press conference on bunyavirus disease among cattle, APA reports.

SVS sector chief Ramiz Salmanov said that medicines have already been offered for the 1st veterinary aid: "We have handed the list of necessary medicines to the Ministry of Health. Those medicines will be sent, if necessary."

Salmanov addressed the citizens that these medicines are not so expensive: "They can buy these medicines for treatment of animals. The most expensive of these medicines is AZN 2. We don't advise to use the meat of dead animals. At the same time, it is not advised to cut animals that have recovered within 3 days, because the treatment of this virus lasts long."

SVS official said hat 176 000 animals have been infected with this virus, 52 head of cattle died and 59 head of cattle faced miscarriage: "But these facts of death are not related with this virus. I'm sure that these animals died of fever disease."

He also noted that meat will be monitored seriously before going on sale.

[According to a media report of 22 Aug 2013 by the Azeri, Russian-language Salam News Agency (see 20130823.1898252), citing Azerbaijan's Head of the State Veterinary Service Sial Rustamov, Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was "spreading rapidly", identified in "22-25 percent" of the cattle in 26 districts (out of a total of 66 districts, nationwide). The named districts were Aran-Imishli, Neftchala, Salyan, Sabirabad, Kurdamir, Beylagan, Ismayilli, Gabala, Agsu, Astara, Khojavend and Gobustan.

The current report, published by another (similarly independent-private) press agency, in English, SBV is not named; instead, the source, an official of the State Veterinary Service, named in press conference a "Bunyavirus" as the causative agent allegedly causing infection in 176 000 animals, including 52 deaths and 59 animals "facing miscariages". This may indicate that the virus, suspected to widely spread in Azerbaijan, may not (yet?) have been definitely identified as SBV. The family _Bunyaviridae_ contains numerous medically important viruses. It includes the genus _Orthobunyavirus_, in which the Simbu serogroup includes Akabane, Aino, Shamonda and Schmallenberg viruses, which are known pathogens of ruminants and which are predominantly spread through biting midges of the _Culicoides_ species. Simbu group viruses have been isolated from hematophagous insects, fowls, and mammals in Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America.

The situation is furthermore, the currently unfolding cattle disease situation in Azerbaijan is confised by referring the Azerbijani public to a list of medicines which may be applied in relation to the massive outbreak. The only veterinary preparations which may be seen as relevant to the handling of SBV are arthropod repellents or insecticides, and/or a vaccine. Details on the method by which 176 000 cattle (out of the country's total of about 2.6 million) have been found to be reportedly infected, signs of clinical disease in case observed, results of PM investigations in the 52 dead animals, as well as explanation to 59 animals allegedly "facing miscarriages" --are in urgent need.

Such explanations will, hopefully, become available when Azerbaijan follows OIE's requirement as laid out in its Code article 1.1.3, namely to submit an immediate notification on an event which can be defined as complying with the definition of an 'emerging disease'. "Emergency disease" is "a new infection or infestation resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known infection or infestation spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the first time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health".

Such notification is of particular interest to neighbouring countries. The Republic of Azerbaijan is the largest country in the Caucasus region, bordering Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west, and Iran to the south. Its exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having a short borderline with Turkey to the
northwest; map at https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html. - Mod.AS.]
