Agriculture officials clueless about dying mandarin trees
---------------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Pemagatshel [district] will be relieved to learn that
mandarin trees in the district are dying not because of Huanglongbing
(HLB) as was thought. 19 samples from badly affected orchards tested
negative for HLB by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conducted in
December 2009 at the National Plant Protection Centre (NPPC).

While the report provided some relief, it leaves farmers and
agriculture officials clueless as to why mandarin trees are dying.
The report, however, mentioned the presence of the vector _Diaphorina
citri_. "We are still going ahead with mass spraying campaigns
against the vector. This will be followed by pruning," said district
agriculture officer Kiran Subedi.

He said that, as recommended by the NPPC, samples from the trees
showing signs of greening will be sent for tests every 3 months.
Meanwhile, there are now more questions than answers and experts will
be called in to ascertain the cause of mandarin tree death.

Some villages in the district have maximum numbers of orchards
producing substantial amounts of fruit. How ever, the crop production
this year [2009-10] was dismal with trees showing symptoms like
wilting, leaf drop, malformation of leaves, and incorrect chlorophyll.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, citrus greening), is one of the most damaging
diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In Asia, it is
caused by the phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter
asiaticus, which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina
citri_). For more information on HLB see links below.

HLB has been reported from other areas of Bhutan, and the presence of
the vector in Pemagatshel adds to the risk for that district. Under
these circumstances, the regular PCR tests mentioned above are
appropriate for HLB monitoring. It remains to be seen if future test
will detect the presence of HLB, and whether other pathogens or
perhaps different factors may be contributing to the poor state of these trees.
