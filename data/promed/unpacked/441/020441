INFECTION CONTROL: NEW GUIDEINES (2)
====================================
[In response to Scarborough's questions regarding CDC Guidelines
Isolation/Hospitals; see archives 960615]
>
>Is anyone using the latest Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in
Hospitals? (published January 1996, Inf Control and Hosp.
Epidemiology, and Feb.1996 AJIC).
>
>Any thoughts about the guidelines at this point?
>
We are in the process of revising our manual and will be implementing [them]
over the next 3 months at Bellevue in New York.
1. Implementing contact precautions for resistant organisms will be very
difficult, given facility constraints (lack of private rooms). We are likely
to modify the indications slightly.
2. We have never employed a system where you get to choose if you should
wear a mask (respirator) if you are going to go "near" a patient, inasmuch as
we don't think staff know just where they are going to go before they enter
the room. We either do or don't use respiratory protection, and assume that
anyone entering may be going close to the patient in the course of business.
