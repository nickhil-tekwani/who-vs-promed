[During the last 2 months, the number of patients with brucellosis reported
from the Osh region of Kyrgyzstan has increased by 200 persons. It is not
specified in the posting which forms of the disease have been recognized or
when the symptoms began. Most frequently, however, this disease is
diagnosed after transformation into the chronic form, with a high
percentage of physical disability in the patients and social and economic
losses. Preventive maintenance in the care of cattle and universal
vaccination are not carried out. - Mod.NP
