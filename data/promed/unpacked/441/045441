Fungus Attacks East, Midwest [USA] Pumpkins
-------------------
[Plectosporium blight of cucurbits, caused by the soilborne fungus
_Plectosporium tabacinum_ (formerly known as _Microdochium
tabacinum_)] is attacking fields of pumpkins in the eastern third of the
country, covering acres of Halloween gourds with white spots. Some
pumpkin farmers in Ohio have lost as much as half their crop.
The fungus has long been found in Europe but didn't appear in the
United States until [1988], when it was found in Tennessee. It has since
spread into big pumpkin-growing states in the Midwest and along the
East Coast.
[Mac Riedel, a vegetable pathologist at Ohio State University, doesn't
know why the disease suddenly appeared]. ... The fungus seems to
attack and spread when the weather is cool and wet. It first targets the
pumpkin's stems and leaves, making the stems brittle, and then covers
the gourd with a scabby surface of white and tan spots. "Once the
cosmetic value is destroyed, it's a total loss," said Riedel.
Illinois lost half of its crop a year ago, but the impact has been much
less dramatic this season. While the fungus was first found in the
South, it has crept into isolated fields as far away as Massachusetts in
the past year.
At least 10 different diseases can turn a bright orange pumpkin patch
into a field of decaying black and green gourds. Most can be treated
with sprays and fungicides. [But] it's not that simple with [the blight].
[However,] some farmers have been able to fight the disease with
regular use of a fungicide, said Mary Ann Hansen, manager of the plant
disease clinic at Virginia Tech University.

[Subsequent to its first occurrence in Tennessee in 1988,
_Plectosporium _ blight has been reported in several eastern states
(New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia, Indiana,
Illinois, Delaware, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Ohio).
Unfortunately there are no resistant cultivars available. Bravo and
Mancozeb are effective fungicides*. According to FAO, the total
world production of pumpkin, gourds and squashes in 2000 was 15.56
Mt. Major production areas are India, Africa, and Asia.
