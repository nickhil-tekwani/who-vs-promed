At least 12 students in the Delaware Valley School District have been diagnosed with hand-foot-&-mouth disease (HFMD), a viral illness that can cause fever, poor appetite, and painful sores, blisters, or rashes.

Delaware Valley Superintendent John Bell said 4 football players at the Dingman-Delaware Middle School were diagnosed with the illness last week [week of 10 Sep 2012], causing school officials to cancel a scheduled game on 13 Sep 2012. Notes about the disease have been sent home to parents of middle school players afterward, Bell said.

Bell said 5 football players and one cheerleader at Delaware Valley High School later came down with the illness. On Wednesday [19 Sep 2012], 2 students and possibly a third in the elementary schools also showed signs of infection.

Bell said symptoms include fever, sore throats, and skin rashes. The illness spreads through direct contact.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HFMD is caused by a coxsackievirus. It's rarely serious, but the virus can remain in the body for weeks after symptoms have gone away.

Bell said that no one has been hospitalized, and the football players first diagnosed were on the road to recovery. Bell said custodial crews sterilized equipment and sports facilities last week and asked all football players to clean all their clothes and equipment. Custodial crews also have cleaned areas frequently touched, such as light switches and door handles. Custodians will clean elementary school classrooms where kids have been diagnosed. "We'll continue to sterilize everything every night this week, spraying and wiping," said Bell.

[Hand-foot-&-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults. Symptoms of HFMD include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina), and a skin rash. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_ of the family _Picornaviridae_. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most common cause of HFMD in the United States, whereas enterovirus 71 has also been associated with more serious forms of HFMD in China and South-East Asian countries. HFMD is quite common. It is moderately contagious and is spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva, or feces of an infected person. It typically occurs in small epidemics in nursery schools or kindergartens, usually during the summer and autumn months. The usual incubation period is 3-7 days. Due to the way the infection is spread, outbreaks can occur in environments where there are groups of small children who require nappy changing, such as in a nursery or childcare centre.

It has been rarely reported as a sports-associated infection. It is possible, however, to get HFMD more than once, although not during the same outbreak. Most children will eventually develop immunity against most of the viruses that cause HFMD as they get older.
