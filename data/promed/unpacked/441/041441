Background data on shigellosis in Indonesia and Taiwan
--------------------------------------------------------
Shigellosis in Indonesia
_Shigella flexneri_ accounts for 80 percent of isolates, _S. sonnei_
12 percent, and _S. dysenteriae_ 8 percent (1998 to 1999).
From 1998 through 1999, Shigella was implicated in 5 percent of
severe diarrheal illness in hospitals throughout Indonesia (Medan,
North Sumatra; Padang, West Sumatra; Batam, Riau Island; Jakarta,
Java Island; Denpasar, Bali; Pontianak, West Kalimantan; and
Makassar, South Sulawesi).
_S. dysenteriae_ reemerged in Bali, Kalimantan, and Batam and was
detected in Jakarta after a hiatus of 15 years (last previous cases
in 1985).
Shigellosis accounts for 8.5 percent of diarrhea in sub-districts of
North Jakarta, Tanjung Priok and Koja (2001 to 2002).
Shigellosis in Taiwan-
192 cases were reported in 1988; 141 in 1990; 88 in 1992; 208 in
1993; 112 in 1994.
562 cases were confirmed in 1995 (81.2 percent below age 14 years):
71.4 percent in Taoyuan County and 81.5 percent due to _Shigella
sonnei_.
372 cases were reported, and 253 confirmed in 1996 (51.2 percent
below age 14 years and 15.2 percent imported): 27.3 percent in
Tauyuan County and 61.7 percent due to _S. flexneri_.
495 cases were reported, and 405 (including 15 imported cases) were
confirmed in 1997; 485 (423 confirmed) in 1998; 213 in 1999; 321 in
2000.
644 cases of 'dysentery' were reported in 2000; 1 632 in 2001.
2 fatal cases (1990 and 1992) were reported during 1990 to 1998.
Notable outbreaks-
1996 - An outbreak (41 cases) of _Shigella flexneri_ infection was
reported in Nantou County.
1997 - An outbreak of 127 cases of _Shigella sonnei_ infection at a
primary school in Kuanshi was acquired from contaminated underground
water.
1998 - An outbreak of 69 cases (3 hospitalized) was reported among 2
primary schools in Taoyuan.

Regarding the posting on Shigella in Bali, I thought the following
might be of interest to your readers.
This study published in 2001 reports the reemergence of _S.
dysenteriae_ in Bali, West Kalimantan, and Batam as well as in
Jakarta after a hiatus of over 15 years.
Subekti D, Oyofo BA, Tjaniadi P, et al: _Shigella spp_. surveillance
in Indonesia: the emergence or reemergence of _S. dysenteriae_ Emerg
Infect Dis. 7:137-40, 2001
Abstract: From June 1998 through November 1999, a total of 3848
children and adults seeking treatment for debilitating diarrheal
disease were identified from 8 hospital sites in Medan, North
Sumatra; Padang, West Sumatra; Batam, Riau Island; Jakarta, Java
Island; Denpasar, Bali (2 hospitals); Pontianak, West Kalimantan; and
Makassar, South Sulawesi. Rectal swabs were obtained from patients in
the study before antibiotic therapy was administered.
Overall, bacterial isolates of Shigella spp. were identified in 180
(5 percent) of 3848 rectal swabs. The proportional contribution of
_S. flexneri_, _S. sonnei_, and _S. dysenteriae_ among shigellosis
cases was 80 percent, 12 percent, and 8 percent, respectively. No _S.
boydii_ was detected. The percentage of representation among the 3
species did not vary substantially by geographic location.
Notable was the reemergence of S. dysenteriae in Bali, West
Kalimantan, and Batam as well as in Jakarta after a hiatus of greater
than 15 years. The proportional distribution of _S. flexneri_, _S.
sonnei_, and _S. dysenteriae_ for the 5 to 12-year-old
and >12-year-old groups was similar. There appeared to be no
consistency in the seasonal distribution patterns of _Shigella spp_.
The study concludes that the reemergence of _S. dysenteriae_ from
several locations in Indonesia should prove cause for concern to
health officials, particularly in monitoring acute, debilitating
diarrheal outbreaks. The epidemic potential attributed to _S.
dysenteriae_, as documented in Central America, Asia, and Africa, in
conjunction with notably high death rates, warrants close attention
to this reemerging pathogen in Indonesia.
