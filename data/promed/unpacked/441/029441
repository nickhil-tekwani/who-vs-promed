Over 50 pig farms in Australia diagnosed with JEV
-------------------------------------------------
On 29 Mar [2022], the Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) and American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) hosted a webinar focused on the recent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs and people in Australia. Veterinarians from Australia along with US-based experts shared field experience, epidemiology and potential risks for transboundary introduction of JEV into the United States.

The webinar offered a snapshot of the current situation and provided information to improve the identification and management of an unexpected outbreak. SHIC remains attentive to emerging swine disease issues around the globe to inform the US pork industry for better preparedness and response activities; 183 participants from 21 countries joined the webinar live.

Kirsty Richards, a veterinarian with the SunPork Group in Australia, shared background information on JEV in their country webinar. A flavivirus, JEV is in the same family as West Nile virus, St Louis encephalitis virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. The virus is maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, mainly ardeid birds such as herons, egrets and bitterns. JEV spills over into other species including pigs, humans, horses, and other domestic animals. Humans and horses are considered dead-end hosts because they usually do not develop high levels of viremia, while pigs are an amplifying host. Richards noted human cases have been diagnosed, with some mortalities, in Australia as well as cases of reproductive and neurological disease in pig herds.

In February 2022, JEV genotype 4 was identified in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia. As of [29 Mar 2022], more than 50 pig farms across the eastern seaboard of Australia and in South Australia were diagnosed with JEV. As of [31 Mar 2022], the Australian Government/Department of Health is reporting 34 human cases, 24 confirmed and 10 probable.

Richards said Australia is addressing the outbreak with a One Health approach, combining human and animal response protocols. Current activities at infected premises include mosquito trapping and control, vaccination of people working at and residing on those premises, and risk-assessed movement of pigs and semen.

Her colleague at the SunPork Group, Bernie Gleeson, shared clinical and pathological findings reported at the JEV-affected farms. They have observed apparently healthy sows with abortions and delayed farrowing, greater than 118 days [normal pig gestation 112-114 days https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Pig_Development. - Mod.SH] Aborted litters had fetuses with domed heads, subcutaneous oedema, ascites and arthrogryposis. Necropsy of aborted piglets revealed the absence of forebrain, hindbrain, and cerebellum. Some affected piglets born alive were shaky with poor survival.

Leela Noronha, with the Foreign Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Unit at USDA's National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, in Manhattan, Kansas, said the United States has the necessary components for JEV transmission -- competent insect vectors and susceptible vertebrate maintenance and amplifying hosts. Concern over JEV is based in part on the precedent set by West Nile virus which grew exponentially since being introduced in 1999. However, there is no active surveillance in the United States for JEV at this time. JE is a reportable disease in the United States.

Insect vectors of JEV are numerous though it is primarily transmitted by _Culex spp_ mosquitoes. In experimental conditions, a few North American _Culex_ species and others have been shown to be competent insect vectors. Avian hosts of JEV can serve as mobile virus reservoirs which are typically asymptomatic. Noronha said wild and domestic North American species have demonstrated susceptibility experimentally.

JEV-affected swine play an important role in virus amplification. Wild pigs are wildcards that can impact transmission since they represent a rapidly expanding, free-range population of vertebrate hosts. Clinical presentation in swine varies by age and prior exposures. In adult swine, JE is primarily a reproductive disease, though affected adults may present with nonspecific transient febrile illness. Sows can exhibit abortion, stillborn, fetal mummification, or subsequent production of weak piglets. Boars exhibit orchitis and infertility. In piglets, non-specific signs and wasting are evident as are neurologic disease and high mortality.

Natalia Cernicchiaro, Kansas State University, presented information on the risk of introduction of JEV in the continental United States. Maps illustrated the global expansion of JEV from Asia to northern Europe to Africa where competent vectors and hosts exist. The fact that the United States shares similar climate and environmental conditions with countries where JEV is epidemic and has competent vectors and hosts as well as increased travel and trade from and to JEV-affected regions since World War II, along with the fact that there is no active JEV surveillance program in the United States, make this region susceptible to a JEV incursion.

Cernicchiaro and a team of experts have conducted a qualitative and quantitative risk assessment addressing the likelihood of JEV reaching the United States. This risk assessment addressed probability of entry, probability of transmission, probability of establishment, extent of spread, likelihood of persistence, and impact of disease.

In the study, aircraft and cargo ships emerged as the likeliest pathways of introduction for JEV via infected adult mosquitoes. The probability of introduction of JEV through infected adult mosquitoes via aircrafts was deemed very high whereas the probability of entry via ships/containers was considered of low to moderate risk. The probability of transmission was deemed to depend on the US area of introduction and the season, but under current conditions, the probability of JEV establishment in the United States is considered negligible because of the low availability of amplifying hosts (pigs) and the limited contact rates between infected mosquitoes and hosts in airports and seaports, areas at high risk of introduction of infected vectors.

Given the study findings, prevention and control should be directed towards the aircraft pathway and include aircraft disinfection in the countries of origin, or when arriving at the destination. Cernicchiaro also said the study results point to active surveillance programs on the east and west coasts of the United States as being warranted.

SHIC, launched by the National Pork Board in 2015 solely with Pork Checkoff funding, continues to focus efforts on prevention, preparedness, and response to novel and emerging swine disease for the benefit of US swine health. SHIC is funded by America's pork producers to fulfil its mission to protect and enhance the health of the US swine herd.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) continues to spread among piggeries in eastern Australia with sporadic human cases. Although the introduction of JE V into North America seems unlikely, the risk is not zero. The introduction of West Nile virus into New York City in 1999 is an example of how very unlikely events can really happen when all the essential factors for transmission -- competent mosquito vectors and ample bird hosts -- are present. Those factors are present in the USA for JEV. Only the virus is missing so far. Surveillance for early detection is essential. - Mod.TY]

Japanese encephalitis virus detected in feral pigs in the NT's West Daly region
-------------------------------------------------------
Key points:
- JEV isn't transmitted from person to person or from eating infected meat
- Active cases have been detected in a small number of NT pigs
- A fatal human case of JEV took place in the Tiwi Islands in March 2021 but wasn't confirmed until mid-2021

The first active cases of Japanese encephalitis (JEV) have been detected in the Northern Territory, after a small number of feral pigs in the West Daly region have tested positive for the virus. JEV is a serious disease spread through mosquitoes, which can infect humans and animals, including pigs, birds, and horses. The virus has been spreading throughout piggeries in southern parts of Australia since February [2022] and 35 cases have been confirmed in humans to date, leading to the deaths of 3 people.

NT's chief veterinary officer, Sue Fitzpatrick, said there had been no cases recorded in the territory since a person in the Tiwi Islands died with the virus in March last year [2021]. Since then, the Northern Territory has increased its surveillance program in its animal population. Dr Fitzpatrick said the virus was detected "during a routine survey" in the West Daly and the pigs were asymptomatic. "While there was evidence of [JEV] exposure last wet season, we haven't been able to detect any active infection until this, the feral pigs in the West Daly region," Dr Fitzpatrick said. To date, all mosquito samples tested in NT have been negative for JEV.

Nina Kurucz, director of NT Health's medical entomology unit, said JEV couldn't be transmitted from human to human, or by eating meat from an infected animal. "JE infection in humans is most commonly asymptomatic but, on rare occasions, it can result in severe disease and even death," she said. "Symptoms can include fever, headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, confusion, seizures, and paralysis." Dr Kurucz urged Territorians to stay vigilant and take precautions against mosquito bites.

Dr Fitzpatrick said it was also important for people to understand the potential risk for their animals. She said the main animals infected were pigs and horses. However, she said the virus could kill horses, and symptoms presented as "nervous or neurological signs."

Pig owners should be "highly vigilant" for signs of the disease, Dr Fitzpatrick said, and should report any "unexplained pig miscarriages or stillbirths or neurological signs in young piglets". She said pigs presented a higher risk for transmission, so owners should "take steps" to control mosquitoes around pig pens. "If they are infected, they can have quite large viral loads in their blood and when the mosquito bites the pig, they can then infect another person or another animal," Dr Fitzpatrick said.

Animal owners and hunters can report suspicious or unusual signs in animals to the Emergency Animal Disease Watch hotline on 1800 675 888.

There is no specific treatment for the virus, but vaccination [for humans] is available.

[The report above does not indicate if the feral pigs were positive by virus isolation, PCR, or antibody presence. Antibodies would indicate infection sometime in the past, but not specifically when. Nonetheless, positive feral pigs indicate that there is or has been Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus transmission in the area.

Ongoing surveillance of domestic pigs and mosquitoes will provide essential information about when and where the virus is being transmitted. - Mod.TY
