A serious outbreak of tuberculosis in cattle in Tailevu [Central division] has been detected by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Ltd (FCDL) says the outbreak will likely cripple the dairy and cattle farming industry in Fiji if not controlled soon.

Cattle farmers in Tailevu have stressed the seriousness of the disease and the recent increase in the number of infected cattle in just a few months. Ministry of Agriculture principal veterinarian officer Dr Stephen Angus, when asked what will happen to the infected cattle, said the ministry was trying to control the spread of TB. "The cattle that are infected are taken to the abattoir where they are inspected and the infected parts are removed," Dr Angus said. "If it's a generalized TB infection in the cattle then the whole carcass is condemned. "The outbreak of TB is normally caused by direct contact of a cow that is infected with those not infected, it normally happens when herds are moved together."

FCDL director Kashmir Singh of J Singh Farm in Waimaro said he had 800 stock and 26 of them had been infected with tuberculosis. "In the last test conducted we had only 12 infected cattle but now we have 26 cattle infected," Mr Singh said. "This is a huge problem because we produce milk and beef and it can affect our production." Responding to questions on whether the outbreak had the capacity to cripple the Fijian dairy and cattle farming industry, Mr Singh said: "Yes it would cripple the industry."

Harness Farms Ltd manager Martin Compain said many dairy farmers in Tailevu faced the same problem and were worried about their cattle stock. "Nobody has given us an explanation on the increase of TB infected cattle around the area and we have more than 50 cattle infected from the recent tests conducted," Mr Compain said. "We can't get any authority to come and talk to us about the increase in TB infected cattle in our area."

[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other species of mammals. This disease is a significant zoonosis that can spread to humans, typically by the inhalation of aerosols or the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. In developed countries, eradication programs have reduced or eliminated tuberculosis in cattle, and human disease is now rare; however, reservoirs in wildlife can make complete eradication difficult. Bovine tuberculosis is still common in less developed countries, and severe economic losses can occur from livestock deaths, chronic disease, and trade restrictions. In some situations, this disease may also be a serious threat to endangered species.

Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by _Mycobacterium bovis_, a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex of the family _Mycobacteriaceae_. _M. bovis_ can be transmitted by the inhalation of aerosols, by ingestion, or through breaks in the skin. The importance of these routes varies between species. Bovine tuberculosis is usually maintained in cattle populations, but a few other species can become reservoir hosts.

Tuberculosis is usually a chronic debilitating disease in cattle, but it can occasionally be acute and rapidly progressive. Early infections are often asymptomatic. In countries with eradication programs, most infected cattle are identified early and symptomatic infections are uncommon. In the late stages, common symptoms include progressive emaciation, a low-grade fluctuating fever, weakness, and loss of appetite. Animals with pulmonary involvement usually have a moist cough that is worse in the morning, during cold weather or exercise, and may have dyspnea or tachypnea. In the terminal stages, animals may become extremely emaciated and develop acute respiratory distress.

Bovine tuberculosis can be controlled by test-and-slaughter or test-and-segregation methods. Affected herds are retested periodically to eliminate cattle that may shed the organism; the tuberculin test is generally used. Infected herds are usually quarantined, and animals that have been in contact with reactors are traced. Only test-and-slaughter techniques are guaranteed to eradicate tuberculosis from domesticated animals.

While there is a vaccine to control brucellosis in bovines, until recently there has not been a vaccine for tuberculosis in bovines. A vaccine showing promise is under development.
