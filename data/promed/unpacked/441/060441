In response to a number of questions submitted from the ProMED-mail
Moderator to the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),
Veterinary Services (VS) with regard to the outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic
disease (RHD) that occurred in rabbits in the domestic area of an exotic
animal facility in NY, I offer the following:
1. Currently available epidemiologic information about the outbreak of RHD
that occurred in the affected facility is insufficient to ascribe an origin
for the rabbit calicivirus isolated. We have information that rabbit meat
from US-origin suppliers who receive rabbit meat from many sources
including rabbit meat imported from China was prepared for the zoo
carnivores in the same kitchen in which the rabbit diets were prepared.
Food and other samples from the kitchen have been received and tested for
rabbit caliciviruses at the USDA, APHIS, VS, Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory, Plum Island, NY. While RHD virus was isolated from
the rabbits in the petting zoo, all samples from the kitchen have been
negative for rabbit caliciviruses. USDA, APHIS does not regulate imported
commercial rabbit meat.
An alternate scenario is infection from rabbit owners who visited the
petting zoo. However, we have had no recent reports of RHD virus
infections in rabbitries in the United States. In short, we have no
unequivocal epidemiologic information on which to make a determination of
the origin of the virus.
2. USDA, APHIS has not issued any alerts attributing the RHD outbreak at
the facility to RHD-virus infected rabbit meat because we have insufficient
information to make such a recommendation. It would be less than
responsible to warn of "RHD virus-infected rabbit meat" when we have no
idea if that is true. US experiences with RHD have involved backyard
"herds" and now, the petting zoo.
3. USDA, APHIS has no indication that RHD virus-infected rabbit meat has
been imported into the United States. However, the rabbit meat suppliers
receive their supply from various companies, including one company that
imports rabbit meat from China.
4. USDA, APHIS has no data to suggest that US-origin rabbit meat is fed at
the affected facility. This is unclear because the company from which the
zoo purchases is of US origin but receives meat from China through a chain
of suppliers. There is no way to determine how much meat was directly from
China and how much meat was of US origin.
5. The RHD viruses are considered exotic to the United States. As stated
previously, "commercial" rabbit producers have not reported disease.
Extensive tracebacks from this and earlier outbreaks have not yielded any
indication of an associated origin from US rabbit raisers, including
commercial producers. Therefore, no meat from infected rabbits reaches
commercial distribution. It is improbable that US origin rabbit meat
infected with RHD virus has been marketed to wholesale or retail outlets.
