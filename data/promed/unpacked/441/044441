New bird flu vaccine capable of prevention
-----------------------------------------------
Chinese scientists claim to have developed a vaccine to prevent the spread
of the killer bird flu. The Ministry of Agriculture says its new vaccine
can effectively "cut a key link in the transmission chain of highly
pathogenic avian influenza among water fowl."
Using a technique called reverse genetics, scientists at the Key Laboratory
of Animal Influenza, affiliated with Harbin Veterinary Research Institute,
altered the genome sequence of the virus to construct a vaccine that is
believed to be safe for both poultry and mammals. The vaccine will be
administered to fowl in the country's key water areas, including rivers and
lakes, a ministry statement released yesterday [6 Feb 2005] said.
Laboratory tests show the vaccine enabled ducks and geese to fight H5N1,
the highly lethal strain of bird flu, 3 weeks after the flocks were
vaccinated, the statement claimed. The new vaccine also provides at least
10 months of protection for chickens, 4 months longer than the existing
bird flu preventive drugs.
"China has developed and mass-produced shots targeting H9 and H5N2, the
less dangerous subtypes of avian influenza," Xu Shixin, a division director
of the Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, said yesterday [6
Feb 2005]. The bureau has released a certificate for the new vaccine as a
registered veterinary drug.
Ministry sources said the new vaccine had overcome the bottleneck in the
technology of developing a remedy for preventing "highly pathogenic bird flu."
Apart from the encouraging laboratory test results, field tests also
indicate that upon receiving 2 shots of the vaccine, ducks and geese can
each produce antibodies effective for 10 months and 3 months, respectively.
The birds could then fight the H5N1 strain of the virus. "The vaccination
thus makes it impossible for ducks and geese to become the load of H5
subgroup bird flu virus. Therefore, it can cut a key link for the highly
pathogenic avian influenza to spread," said the ministry statement.
China developed advanced bird flu virus test technology (RT-PCR reagent
kit) last April 2004. This can detect H5, H7 and H9 subgroups of the bird
flu simultaneously in several hours.
Vaccination is a must for water fowl and poultry farms in Chinese regions
at high risk, according to a national teleconference in bird flu prevention
on 28 Jan 2005 in Beijing.
Elsewhere in Asia, the Cambodian Ministry of Health and the World Health
Organization (WHO) confirmed on Saturday [5 Feb 2005] that a 25-year-old
woman from Kampot Province, who died of respiratory illness in Viet Nam on
30 Jan 2005, was infected with avian influenza. This is the 1st human case
of avian influenza in Cambodia, according [to] media reports.
Hundreds of wild birds have died of avian influenza in central Thailand in
the past 2 weeks.

[Mass-application techniques for live vaccines are preferred by today's
large poultry operations, worldwide. The goal for mass vaccination is to
deliver a minimum of one dose of live vaccine to each bird. Live virus
vaccines may be administered to birds by incorporation in the drinking
water, delivered as a coarse spray, or by intranasal or conjunctival
instillation.
Application in drinking water offers the advantages of lower labor costs,
minimal bird stress and -- generally -- stimulation of good immunity. This
administration technique is applied for various commercial poultry
vaccines, against Newcastle disease, Infectious Bronchitis, Avian
Encephalomyelitis, Infectious Bursal Disease and Infectious Laryngotracheitis.
The efficacy of such vaccines depends, besides the immunogenicity of the
vaccines themselves, upon their stability in the drinking water (i.e. in
the presence of certain chemicals or in adverse pH or temperatures), the
water intake of the birds (sometimes requiring initial water withdrawal)
and other factors.
Though administration by drinking water or by aerosols could have been
extremely helpful for mass vaccination of mammals as well, especially small
ruminants in extensive husbandry systems, such mode has been rarely applied
so far. An exception is the Brucella suis S2 live vaccine, developed in
China since 1952 and widely used there since the beginning of the 1970s to
vaccinate sheep and goats. The vaccine is administered through drinking water.
Regarding the published data on the new, genetically modified Chinese AI
vaccine, its application by drinking water for farmed poultry might be
perfectly feasible, and its use in the field might be a true and much
needed achievement, provided the vaccine's safety for animal and man and
its efficacy have been satisfactorily secured and tested. However, putting
the vaccine into "rivers and lakes" is another story; it will be
interesting to get more information on the research and tests which will
enable such an application.

[The influenza viruses are negative-strand RNA viruses, and, as such, lack
the ability to interact by intermolecular recombination. As a consequence,
the controlled modification of the genetic properties of such viruses by
the introduction of specific mutations into the viral genome has been
difficult to achieve by classical genetic techniques. (The production of
the standard human influenza vaccines depends on the fact that the
influenza virus genome exists in the form of a complement of subunits, and
intact whole genes can be exchanged between viruses multiplying in the same
cell substrate, thereby allowing the rapid selection of progeny virus with
different combinations of antigens, a process known as reassortment. The
final product is used as an inactivated vaccine). The technique of reverse
genetics depends on the synthesis of an infectious DNA copy of the
negative-stranded RNA virus genome, which enables the standard genetic
methodologies of directed mutagenesis and manipulation of DNA genomes to be
applied to an RNA virus. At first, it proved difficult to obtain infectious
DNA clones of negative strand RNA viruses, but the technical break-through
was achieved by Schnell et al. in 1994 with rabies virus, and infectious
DNA clones of most types of negative-strand RNA viruses are now available.
Early progress in the design of an H5N1 vaccine for use in the human
population has been documented previously in ProMED-mail: see, Avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus, human vaccine pros... 20040125.0300 to Avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus, human vaccine (06) 20040410.0975. The scientists
at the Harbin Institute have clearly mastered the technology of reverse
genetics and produced a candidate live attenuated vaccine virus. It remains
to be seen whether they have modified the virus sufficiently to allow it to
be administered to different species and to obtain protective immune
responses without exacerbation of disease. - Mod.CP]
