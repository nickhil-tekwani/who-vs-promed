Unidentified illnesses reportedly kill 10 at Dutch nursing homes
Health authorities Tuesday were reportedly investigating 10 deaths in two
Dutch nursing homes caused by illnesses with influenza-like symptoms. Five
victims died within the last 10 days at the Duinstede
Nursing Home in this suburb of The Hague, said Johan Versteegen, a
physician with the regional health department.
Another five residents died over the last two weeks at the Casa Bonita home
in Twello, about 75 miles east of here, Dutch television reported. Ten of
the 120 mostly elderly and disabled residents of the Duinstede home were
still seriously ill and being treated in a hospital, Versteegen said.
"We're looking at a pulmonary infection that causes flu-like symptoms: sore
throat, coughing, fever and there were a few cases of pneumonia,"
Versteegen said. "And, of course, this is a high-risk population."
Preliminary examination of blood and urine samples have virtually ruled out
salmonella infections or
Legionnaires' disease, he said.
