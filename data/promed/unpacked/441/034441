Cocoa farms in southwestern Nigeria, the country's main growing region, have been bit by outbreaks of a fungal disease identified as dieback, which causes plants to wither and die.

"The trees are drying off from their tops and progressively through the stems and down to the roots," said a farmer, adding that about 125 neighboring plots were also affected. The Cocoa Farmers Association has received reports that about 2500 cocoa trees have the disease in Ogun state. The estimated loss from the infections in the area could reach 750 metric tons of cocoa.

Dieback disease is prevalent in regions that have a shallow rock depth, denying tree roots access to nutrients in the dry season and leaving them vulnerable to fungal attack, according to the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria.

[Dieback symptoms on cocoa have been attributed to a number of diseases and environmental factors. In addition, physiological stress (as may be due, for example, to shallow root systems as mentioned above, lack of shade or poor plant nutrition) are likely to increase susceptibility of the trees to pathogens. Cocoa dieback syndromes due to a complex of pathogens have also been reported and it is thought that more than 80 fungal species may be associated with them. Cocoa swollen shoot disease (caused by badnaviruses), black pod (caused by fungus-like _Phytophthora_ species) and black root rot (caused by fungi of genus _Rosellinia_) are known to occur in the region and may also include dieback symptoms on leaves or branches. (For more information on these diseases see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives)

Reliable diagnosis of pathogens and identification of other factors contributing to the problems above are essential for designing management strategies.
