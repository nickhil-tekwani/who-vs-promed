Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak Reported in Southwest PA; Health Department
Confirms Six Cases in Monangahela Valley
HARRISBURG, Pa., July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Pennsylvania Health
Department today reported six cases of Legionnaires' disease, or
legionellosis, near the Southwestern Pennsylvania borough of North Belle
Vernon, Westmoreland County.
Although the source of the outbreak has not yet been identified, department
epidemiologists are testing likely sources, such as large air-conditioning
cooling towers and condensers, fountains and ponds, and other places where
the _Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria may be found.
The Health Department also is working closely with area hospitals to notify
local physicians of the outbreak and quickly identify any more cases that
may occur.
Each of the six cases identified to date occurred between June 15 and June
30 and required hospitalization. All but one of the patients, the one most
recently infected, have been discharged. The Monongahela Valley Hospital in
Monangahela identified and treated all cases.
Initial symptoms usually are flu-like with muscle aches, exhaustion,
headache and fever with dry cough, followed by high fever, commonly from
102 to 105 degrees; chills; and, possibly, diarrhea.
The disease is treated with antibiotics. Although the disease can be fatal,
most people treated with appropriate antibiotics recover completely.
Health Department officials urge anyone experiencing symptoms of
legionellosis, who lives in or recently visited the affected area, to seek
medical attention immediately. The area includes the borough of North Belle
Vernon and Rostraver Township, both in Westmoreland County, and the
neighboring borough of Belle Vernon, Fayette County.
Persons with symptoms such as cough and fever, who believe they may have
legionellosis but do not have a regular family doctor or may not have
access to a physician, can go to any hospital or health-care facility in
the area.
