The dairy industry organisation Dairy NZ is warning South Island farmers to be on the lookout for the cattle disease _Theileria [orientalis_] Ikeda because it has now become established there. The Ministry for Primary Industries [MPI] says the blood-borne parasite, spread by ticks, has been confirmed in a dairy herd on the West Coast. The disease has already infected about 1000 herds in the North Island.

Dairy NZ technical veterinary advisor Dr Nita Harding said the only South Island case seen previously was linked to cattle that had come from the North Island. "This particular infection has almost certainly been picked up in the South Island, rather than being North Island cattle that have come to the South Island, so _Theileria_ is no longer a North Island only disease," she said. Dr Harding said the particular animals that were diagnosed with _Theileria_ had also grazed in Canterbury [east coast of South Island]. "MPI think the disease may have been picked up in Canterbury rather than on the West Coast. There's still a bit more work to do to get to the bottom of this, but it does show that _Theileria_ is a possibility in those areas."

[Some North Island cattle are suffering anaemia as the result of infection with a strain of the parasite _Theileria orientalis_, called Ikeda. The infection is spread by ticks.

The issue first appeared in Northland in August 2012 and since then cases have been found across the North Island, but predominantly in the upper island. The bulk of cases appear in areas where ticks are very prevalent. It appears tick populations increased rapidly as a result of last summer's [2013] drought and the mild winter may mean they have survived and become active early this season [2014].

MPI, the New Zealand Veterinary Association and the beef, dairy, and farm industry bodies are monitoring the situation closely and providing information to farmers and veterinarians.

It would not be possible to eliminate this parasite from New Zealand because the cattle tick which carries the parasite is widespread. In tick areas of the North Island, farmers should work with their veterinarians or farm health advisors to plan the best approach to recognising cattle that might be ill and providing treatment where necessary.

Where herds are infected with the ikeda strain, the impacts can vary greatly depending on a number of factors including animal health, nutrition, stress, and previous exposure to _Theileria_. Most cattle will not show obvious signs of illness. A very small proportion of cattle in a herd will suffer severe anaemia, which if left untreated, could lead to the death of the animal.

What is _Theileria_?
--------------------
_Theileria orientalis_ is a parasite that is transmitted by ticks when they feed on the animal's blood.

Cattle are at risk of infection when they are moved to areas where infected ticks are present. Likewise, if an infected animal is transported, it can spread infection to ticks in the new location, in turn spreading disease to uninfected animals. In areas where the disease is known to occur there may be outbreaks in resident cattle in times when there are sudden increases in tick numbers.

The disease is not spread by direct animal-to-animal contact in the absence of ticks. There are no human health or food safety risks associated with _Theileria_.

What to look out for -- information for farmers and veterinarians
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The signs of anaemia in cattle include straggling on the walk to the shed, pale rather than healthy pink vulva, and pale udders noticed at milking.

Farmers may notice animals lagging behind the rest of the mob when being shifted or lying down in the paddock.

Try not to stress and move affected animals, as their reduced capacity to transport oxygen around the body can lead to collapse and death if you stress or move them quickly.

Affected animals should be rested, given high quality feed and water, and handled only when necessary.

There are a number of causes of anaemia and its signs can be similar to those of other diseases.

Farmers who suspect they have animals with anaemia should contact their vet for advice.

Advice on prevention and control for _Theileria_
------------------------------------------------
Ticks are considered the main means of spread of _Theileria_.

The control of ticks is strongly advised. Farmers in affected areas should be regularly checking their stock for ticks and treating animals as necessary.

Treat any new animals -- make particular effort to treat cattle before moving from one property to another.

Manage the tick population -- inspect cattle for presence of ticks. Tick treatments can be useful to reduce the tick load and the severity of the disease.

Ease underlying disease or stress -- for example, transition management, trace element deficiency, BVD (bovine viral diarrhoea), and facial eczema.

While the Ministry for Primary Industries has put this out with regard to the North Island, it now appears it may equally apply to the South Island.

Please note, as this diseases appears to be endemic, according to the MPI, then unless the disease demonstrates a change of character, or location, or a cure or treatment it found, it is unlikely that ProMED-mail will post every outbreak or announcement of this disease.
