Three people in southeast Michigan have been diagnosed with tetanus,
the Department of Community Health said today [28 Jul 2011]. There was
one case each in Detroit, Oakland and Wayne counties.

Also known as "lock jaw," tetanus is caused by a bacteria commonly
found in soil and can enter the body through wounds contaminated with
dirt, feces, soil, or saliva. Those affected have difficulty
swallowing and can end up with breathing problems, muscle spasms and
seizures. Left untreated, it can be fatal.

DCH officials said teens and adults should get the Tdap vaccine, which
also protects against diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough), or a
booster shot every 10 years. "The best treatment for this disease is
prevention through immunization," said Dr. Dean Sienko, DCH's Interim
Chief Medical Executive.

The 3rd person with tetanus also lives in southeast Michigan, but
department spokeswoman Kelly Niebel wasn't sure which county. The 3
cases so far this year [2011] match the number of cases reported in
all of 2006. Last year [2010], only 2 cases were reported; none were
reported in 2009, one in 2008, and none in 2007.

Three recent cases of tetanus infection have prompted the Michigan
Department of Community Health [MDCH] to remind adults that
immunizations aren't just for kids. Tetanus, also known as "lockjaw,"
is an infection caused by bacteria. Tetanus bacteria are commonly
found in soil and can enter the body through wounds contaminated with
dirt, feces, soil, or saliva.

Tetanus infection can cause a person's neck and jaw muscles to lock,
making it hard to open the mouth or swallow. It can also cause
breathing problems, severe muscle spasms, and seizures. Tetanus is a
serious disease from which it can take months to recover. If left
untreated, it can be fatal.

"It is important for teenagers and adults of all ages to get
vaccinated against tetanus," said Dr. Dean Sienko, Interim Chief
Medical Executive, MDCH. "The best treatment for this disease is
prevention through immunization." MDCH urges teenagers and adults to
get vaccinated with Tdap vaccine, which protects not only against
tetanus but also diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough).

Because immunity to tetanus decreases over time, most adults need to
get a booster shot every 10 years to stay protected. Adults who
haven't received Tdap vaccine should receive Tdap instead of their
next regular tetanus (Td) booster. Adults who have contact with
infants should get Tdap vaccine as soon as possible because being
vaccinated against whooping cough will prevent them from spreading the
disease to vulnerable infants. It's a good idea for adults to talk to
their doctor about what vaccines they might need. "Vaccination is a
lifelong process," Sienko said. "It's important that adults of all
ages get vaccinated against serious diseases, such as flu, tetanus,
and whooping cough."

[Tetanus is a potentially fatal disease characterized by skeletal
muscle rigidity and painful convulsive spasms, which are caused by a
potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, produced by the vegetative form of
_Clostridium tetani_, an anaerobic spore-forming Gram-positive
bacillus. _C. tetani_ is a member of the normal intestinal flora of
animals, including humans. Tetanus usually occurs following
contamination of wounds by soil or animal feces in which the spores of
_C. tetani_ can be found.

Tetanus may follow surgical procedures, burns, deep puncture wounds,
crush wounds, otitis media, dental infection, animal bites, abortion,
and pregnancy. The presence of necrotic tissue and/or foreign bodies
increases risk for tetanus because they favor growth of _C. tetani_.
Tetanus can also follow injection of contaminated illicit drugs.
Neonatal tetanus occurs usually in developing countries in infants
with infection of the umbilical stump who are born to a non-immune
mother. Infants of actively immunized mothers acquire passive immunity
that protects them from neonatal tetanus. Tetanus is not directly
transmitted from person to person. However, the mode of transmission
for the Michigan cases is not specified in the news releases above.

Tetanus occurs in people who are inadequately immunized, i.e., people
who have not completed the primary series and received appropriate
boosters. Recovery from tetanus is not necessarily associated with
immunity, and primary immunization is indicated after recovery from
tetanus. A discussion of wound management and treatment of tetanus can
be found at:
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf.

The following is extracted from the CDC vaccination recommendations
for tetanus
(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/tetanus/default.htm):

"There are 4 combination vaccines used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus
and pertussis: DTaP, Tdap, DT, and Td. Two of these (DTaP and DT) are
given to children younger than 7 years of age, and 2 (Tdap and Td) are
given to older children and adults. Several other combination vaccines
contain DTaP along with other childhood vaccines.

Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following
ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months and 4-6 years. DT does not contain
pertussis and is used as a substitute for DTaP for children who cannot
tolerate pertussis vaccine.

Td is a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine given to adolescents and adults as
a booster shot every 10 years, or after an exposure to tetanus under
some circumstances. Tdap is similar to Td but also contains protection
against pertussis. Adolescents 11-18 years of age (preferably at age
11-12 years) and adults 19 through 64 years of age should receive a
single dose of Tdap. For adults 65 and older who have close contact
with an infant and have not previously received Tdap, one dose should
be received. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not
fully immunized against pertussis. Tdap can be given no matter when Td
was last received.

[Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses
of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine.
Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and
pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP
and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component
contains only a part of the pertussis organism.]."
