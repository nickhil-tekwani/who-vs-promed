UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS, AVIAN - AUSTRALIA (03): (NORTHERN TERRITORY), CORRECTION

If I am not mistaken, the locations identified in the above reference
post are not from the Northern Territory. They appear to be along the
eastern seaboard, with several in the immediate vicinity of the
Sydney metro area in the State of New South Wales. I believe that
there are several potential "Avalons" in Australia, with arguably the
best known near to Melbourne in the State of Victoria.

[Mr. Thomson is correct. This post archive 20101003.3591 should have
said New South Wales, not Northern Territory.

This moderator apologizes for the error. - Mod.TG]
