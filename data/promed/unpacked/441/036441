Egypt: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 10
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has announced a new
human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The patient is
a 2-year-old male from Al-Honsanya, Sharkea Governorate. He developed
symptoms on 13 Apr 2008 and was hospitalized on 14 Apr 2008 and is
currently in hospital. The patient was confirmed as being infected
with A (H5N1) by the Central Public Health Laboratories and by
Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3).

Investigations into the source of his infection indicate a history of
contact with sick and dead poultry.

Of the 50 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 22 have been fatal.

Clinical trial for pre-pandemic influenza vaccination - Japan
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan (MHLW) has
announced on Wed 16 Apr 2008 that it would organise a clinical trial
for pre-pandemic influenza vaccines against H5N1 on 6400 volunteers
to further make sure its safety and effectiveness which had already
been tested for a smaller number and been approved by the national
regulatory authority. The 6400 volunteers will include quarantine
officers, health care workers and emergency response workers.

MHLW will consider expanding pre-pandemic vaccination to wider
prioritised targets up to 10 million if the trial proves its safety
and effectiveness. It would also consider increasing its stock of
pre-pandemic vaccines in addition to the current 20 million
stockpiles of Viet Nam, Indonesia and Anhui [China] strains as bulks.

In the meantime, MHLW is always endeavouring to improve the safety
and effectiveness of vaccines, and their manufacturing process
including introducing cell-culture-based vaccines to increase the
speed of their production.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Kenichi Tsujii for sharing this
information with our subscribers. The nature of the vaccine is not
disclosed, but it is likely to be a whole virus inactivated egg-grown
vaccine without adjuvant. We look forward to hearing results of this
vaccine trial as they become available. However, it is not clear how
the efficacy of the vaccine is going to be assessed, and what
controls are in place. Further information would be welcomed. -
