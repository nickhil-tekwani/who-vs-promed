The last update shows an accumulated number of 59 bluetongue (BT)
outbreaks, an increase of 17 infected premises since the last ProMED-mail
posting of 12 Sep 2005.
The new outbreaks by region/province are:
Extremadura 6 (Caceres 4, Badajoz 2)
Andalucia 9 (Huelva 5, Sevilla 4)
Castilla y Leon (Avila 1)
Castilla la Mancha (Toledo 1)
Total accumulated [since the beginning of the current season] (not
including 6 registered in January 2005):
Extremadura 22 (Caceres 10, Badajoz 12)
Andalucia 35 (Huelva 18, Sevilla 17)
Castilla y Leon (Avila 1)
Castilla la Mancha (Toledo 1)
2 new provinces have been affected with 1 outbreak each: Avila and Toledo.
This autumn the areas where the virus has been detected are further north,
compared with last year's epidemic. In 2004, the index case originated in
Cadiz, the southernmost province of Spain, where 141 outbreaks were
registered. This province has not reported any cases during the current
epidemic.
The BT virus has been detected now in several localities situated at 40 deg
latitude north, in the fringes of the Sistema Iberico, a mountainous system
that crosses the Iberian peninsula from east to west. In the recent weeks
it has also been detected moving westwards along the Tagus river basin into
central Spain, affecting several localities in northwestern Caceres and
Avila. [For a map of the Tajo (Tagus) river, see
<http://www.grid.unep.ch/product/map/images/basin_tagusb.gif>].
All the outbreaks are in cattle, except for one in goats. This stands in
clear contrast with the 43 outbreaks in bovine, 200 in ovine, and 77 in
caprine detected during 2004.
As cattle are usually an asymptomatic carrier, this could indicate that
most of the cases were detected by serosurveillance. Many of the positives
[referred to as "outbreaks"] may have been detected within a compulsory
testing scheme covering cattle bred for bullfighting.
The 2 regions affected in 2004 followed different sheep vaccination
strategies. The vaccination in Andalucia involved sheep in an area of 20 km
around the infected premises; in Extremadura the entire sheep population
was vaccinated.
According to information dated 1 Aug 2005, available on the Portuguese
website of the Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives (Confagri) in
Portugal has vaccinated (sheep?) within an area of 20km from the outbreaks
detected in Spain. See

[Bovines are subclinical sentinels of bluetongue (BT). The seasonally
renewed activity of the BT virus in southwestern Spain would have remained
unnoticed had no serological tests been carried out in cattle. Most
probably, BT has become endemic in the area. It would be interesting to
note whether serosurvey has been undertaken in Portugal's southeastern
regions, which are situated within the same ecosystem.- Mod.AS]
