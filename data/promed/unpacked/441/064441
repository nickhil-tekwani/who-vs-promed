[Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans. The virus is particularly present in the saliva and brain of infected animals. It is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal, most often a dog. The incubation period varies from several days to several months. Once symptoms are present, the disease is fatal for both animals and humans.

Rabies is still a pervasive global threat. Half of the world's population live in an endemic area, and more than 80 percent of deaths occur in rural areas, where access to health education campaigns and post-bite prophylaxis is limited or inexistent. Africa and Asia are the continents with the highest risk of human mortality, with more than 95 percent of the world's fatal cases. These regions are also those where canine rabies is controlled the least http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/rabies-portal/about-rabies/. - Mod.CRD
