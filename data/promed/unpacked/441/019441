The Ohio Department of Health [ODH] on Wednesday [2 Apr 2014] declared cases of mumps in Delaware County are now considered part of the community-wide outbreak in central Ohio.

A total of 10 cases have been reported to the Delaware General Health District [DGHD] as of Wednesday afternoon, none of which have been confirmed by lab results. Until ODH made the announcement Wednesday, the cases in Delaware County were considered suspect -- clinically presenting as mumps but unconfirmed by labs -- and were not counted as part of the outbreak in Columbus and the surrounding areas. The change occurred as more cases are reported outside of Ohio State University [OSU], where the outbreak began. "We believe that there is an exposure going on outside the university now," said ODH spokesperson Melanie Amato. "We're getting more information on cases now."

Columbus Public Health also announced an increase in cases Wednesday, with 24 community cases in Columbus and Franklin County and 95 cases reported in Franklin, Fairfield, Licking, Union and Hamilton counties related to the OSU outbreak, for a total of 119 cases. Until the announcement Wednesday, individual health departments were tracking community cases if not related to the OSU outbreak. Amato said local health departments will still track and record the cases within their area, but ODH will track the outbreak as a whole and report compiled numbers to the media in the mornings.

The 1st cases of mumps, a viral illness spread from person to person by droplets from the nose and mouth, were seen at OSU in February [2014]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), close quarters in university dorms makes spreading the virus easy. In March [2014], cases began appearing in other communities without ties to the university outbreak.

DGHD director of personal health Joan Bowe said recommendations for Delaware [County] residents have not changed: get vaccinated. Children should be vaccinated with MMR [measles mumps rubella vaccine] on or after their 1st birthday, followed by a 2nd dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Adults may receive a booster, which is recommended for post-secondary students and health care workers, according to the CDC. Adults born before 1957 are considered to have natural immunity as most had the virus before the vaccine was introduced to the public.

The 10 cases in Delaware [County] have occurred in residents ranging in age from 11 to 47. Cases at OSU have occurred in men and women between the ages of 18 and 58, while the other cases have shown up in residents of Columbus and Franklin County between the ages of 2 and 55.

"Mumps is a reportable disease, which means physicians are mandated to contact the health department to report a suspect case and to let us know if they are sending blood in for lab work," said DGHD spokesperson Traci Whittaker. "We work with our local healthcare providers throughout the investigation, including receiving updated lab results as they become available."

The [OHD] defines a mumps outbreak as 3 or more probable or confirmed cases clustered in a time and place, and the cases are likely related. Prior to lab confirmation, mumps reports are considered suspect -- unless an outbreak has been declared. In the event of an outbreak, all cases without confirmation are considered probable.

Symptoms include fever, body aches, fatigue, swelling of salivary glands, or pain with chewing or swallowing. Up to 15 percent of people with mumps may also experience stiff neck and headache. Men may also experience orchitis, a testicular inflammation that causes pain, swelling, nausea, vomiting and fever. Some women may experience symptoms of inflammation of the ovaries and breasts. Symptoms usually begin 14 to 18 days after catching the virus, but the virus can be spread to others before symptoms even occur, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Transmission is likely before the salivary glands begin to swell and within 5 days after the swelling starts.

About 1/3rd of patients will show mild symptoms or no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, residents are encouraged to contact their primary care provider. Residents can contact their primary care provider or the [DGHD] for vaccine availability at 740-368-1700.

DGHD also recommends prevention through frequent hand washing, covering mouth and nose during a cough or sneeze, and not sharing cups or utensils. CPH recommends staying home and away from others for 5 days after symptoms begin.

From 2004 to 2013, Delaware [County] had 5 cases of mumps reported -- the most recent of which was in 2009 -- and all were classified as suspect. No confirmed or probable cases of mumps were reported between 2004 and 2013 in Delaware County, and no mumps outbreaks were recorded in Delaware County during that time.

More information about mumps is available from the CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/mumps.

[ProMED-mail recently posted a report of the mumps outbreak on the OSU campus in the city of Columbus, Ohio, at which time there was a total of 13 confirmed cases of mumps -- 7 women and 6 men between 18 and 22 years of age (ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA: (OH) university students 20140308.2321285). Now there are 24 community cases in Columbus and 95 cases reported in Franklin, Fairfield, Licking, and Union counties that surround Columbus in central Ohio, and Hamilton County (the county seat of Cincinnati in southwest Ohio) for a total of 119 cases, plus apparently an additional 10 cases in Delaware County, another county that surrounds Columbus. Columbus, the county seat of Franklin County, is also the capital of and the largest city in the US state of Ohio.

The Ohio State University (OSU) is a large public research university in Columbus, Ohio, with about 28 000 undergraduates and more than 35 on-campus residence halls, with additional separate housing for graduate and professional students, plus multiple extra-curricular organizations where social mixing can occur to facilitate spread of the disease (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University).

The mumps vaccine was licensed in 1967 and is usually administered as part of a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4708.pdf). Live mumps virus vaccines in the US are derived from the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine strain. Post-licensure studies in the United States demonstrated that 1 dose of mumps vaccine was 78-91 percent effective in preventing clinical mumps with parotitis; a study from the United Kingdom indicated a vaccine effectiveness of 88 percent for 2 doses of MMR vaccine compared with 64 percent for a single dose (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5522a4.htm). The MMR vaccine in the United States is given in 2 doses: The 1st dose is given at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose before entering school, at 4-6 years of age (http://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/mumps/index.html).

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).

The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrollment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). Immune globulin is not effective postexposure prophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). In an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus. The CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm). During both outbreaks, targeted vaccination was followed by a decrease in mumps incidence among the target group. - Mod.ML
