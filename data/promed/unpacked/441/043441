Pseudorabies suspected in hunting dogs at Corbett WMA
-----------------------------------------------------
Biologists with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
(FWC) are warning hunters using the JW Corbett Wildlife Management
Area (WMA) in Palm Beach and Martin counties to be cautious about wild hogs.

"At least 3 hunting dogs have died after displaying signs consistent
with the pseudorabies virus (PRV) after tangling with wild hogs,"
said Dr Mark Cunningham, a veterinarian with the FWC. "Tests to
confirm the diagnosis of PRV are pending, and we are investigating
unconfirmed reports from hunters that other dogs have died of the disease."

No new cases have been reported to the FWC since [7 Nov 2008]. The
disease is no threat to humans but always fatal in dogs.

Reports indicate the dogs that died were in the area between trails 1
and 2, behind "N" camp, and south of Corbett's south check.

Pseudorabies has been present in this country the past 150 years and
claims a small number of hunting dogs every year. Wildlife officials
are unsure of the cause for the spike in cases at Corbett, but it may
be due to environmental stress.

There are no plans to cancel the WMA's hog hunt, which will end [16 Nov 2008].

PRV is carried by wild hogs and is always present throughout Florida.
The virus also has been reported in at least 10 other states. Moving
hogs to new areas can spread the disease.

PRV is an extremely contagious herpes virus. Despite its name, PRV is
not related to rabies, and it is not contagious to humans; however,
other animals and pets, particularly dogs, are susceptible to infection.

"Only dogs that are directly exposed to feral swine or consume raw
feral hog meat are at significant risk for pseudorabies," Cunningham said.

Dogs can become infected with PRV after exposure to infected hogs.
Clinical signs seen dogs include scratching themselves
uncontrollably. Death normally occurs within 48 hours.

It is unlikely that dogs or other animals would be in danger of
contracting PRV unless there has been direct contact through a bite
wound or through consumption of raw wild hog meat.

Hunters can minimize risk by keeping their dogs away from hogs and
from hog carcasses.

A modified-live vaccine is labeled only for domestic swine and is
available only to veterinarians through the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services. Consult a licensed veterinarian
for further information regarding vaccination and prevention for
domestic swine.

[If the dogs acquired pseudorabies from wild hogs, then any swine
owner with swine outdoors should be concerned as those wild hogs can
pass the disease to the domestic swine.

Pseudorabies in dogs is fatal with clinical signs generally lasting
from 6-96 hours. Prior to death dogs are ataxic, anorectic, pruritic,
vomiting, and dysphagiaic, and they have muscle spasms. There may be
neurological situations such as blindness, facial paresis, head
tilts, or head-pressing and abdominal pain. - Mod.TG
