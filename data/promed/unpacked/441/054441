Pennsylvania: Hepatitis A Cases Now Total 240
---------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed hepatitis A cases linked to a Beaver County
restaurant outbreak has risen to 240, a state Health Department official
said today, up from 185 on Fri 7 Nov 2003. Chi-Chi's Inc., the owner of the
restaurant, issued a statement late on Friday in which it stated that 6
employees were among the confirmed cases -- the number previously reported
by the state was 4. No cause has been determined in the outbreak, but
investigators believe it was more likely a problem with food-worker hygiene
than a food item that arrived at the restaurant already contaminated.
The restaurant apologized to patrons and said company policy prohibits sick
employees from coming to work. "However, given my understanding of the
incubation period, several employees may have worked not knowing that they
had been infected or could pass on that infection to others," said Bill
Zavertnik, the company's chief operating officer, in a news release.
Hepatitis A virus is present in feces, and an infected person can shed the
virus for up to 2 weeks before symptoms appear. Transmission of the virus
from person to person requires more than just casual contact. Typically, a
person is exposed to the virus by eating a contaminated food item or
placing a contaminated utensil or other object in his mouth.
Central Blood Bank reported today that it has removed from its supply 4
units of blood from people who ate at the Beaver Valley Mall Chi-Chi's in
October and then donated blood. The blood bank announced on Friday that
there is a minimal risk that donors exposed to hepatitis A could transmit
the virus through their donation.
A child sick with hepatitis A was discharged from Children's Hospital over
the weekend, said spokesman Marc Lukasiak. 2 new hepatitis A patients
arrived over the weekend at UPMC Presbyterian and both were listed in fair
condition. The hospital is currently treating one other outbreak patient in
fair condition and 2 others in critical condition, said spokeswoman Maureen
McGaffin. One person died Fri 7 Oct 2003. Many patients have sought care at
The Medical Center Beaver, but a spokesman said the hospital is not
releasing any information about how many people are being treated.
