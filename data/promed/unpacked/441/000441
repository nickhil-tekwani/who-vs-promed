[The latest avian influenza update situation in the UK is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#history (last 8 Mar 2022).

Since October 2020, Europe has experienced the most severe avian influenza epidemic to date. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in its spread and maintenance. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses.

The red-breasted goose (_Branta ruficollis_) is a brightly Eurasian bird classified as vulnerable. In the boreal summer, it breeds in Arctic Siberia, and in winter most migrate to the northwestern shores of the Black Sea in Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine.
