Two Canadian provinces, at least, have initiated surveys for Chronic
Wasting Disease in wild deer. Alberta began a survey last year and
Saskatchewan is in the collection phase of its first survey year. British
Columbia has made some preliminary plans for such a survey. A great many
wild deer brains have been examined over the past 30 years by Canadian
veterinary pathologists, both wildlife disease specialists and general
veterinary diagnosticians familiar with the lesions of scrapie, the
equivalent disease in domestic sheep. No lesions typical of CWD have been
detected except as reported previously for a small number of captive mule
deer and one captive elk. Thus, there is some background evidence that the
disease does not exist in wild cervids in Canada at a prevalence detectable
under current conditions of surveillance. Further surveillance is
justified, however.
Health Canada recognizes its responsibility with respect to public safety
and zoonotic diseases and is expanding its activity in this area. We are
indeed fortunate to have Dr. Harvey Artsob and his group and can look
forward to expanded activity in zoonotic diseases when that group is
relocated to its new facility in Winnipeg.
Contacts regarding Health Canada's program are Dr. Artsob or Dr. Robert
Clarke (Robert-Clarke@hc-sc.gc.ca)

>This would mean that 1% of the elk that people eat from this region carry
a potentially transmissible dementia.
Before anyone gets paranoid, a moment's thought. If CWD is an old disease
that has been endemic for millennia, and this would seem the most likely
scenario, look for similar TSE's and see the effect.
One immediately thinks of scrapie, endemic in UK sheep flocks for at least
200 years. The observed net effect on humans of consuming very large
numbers of scrapie infected UK sheep over centuries has been zero.
So far as we can tell this is the same effect of consuming the species
involved in CWD in North America.
For peace of mind, one might discard the head before consumption.
