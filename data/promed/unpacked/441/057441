[This newswire gives more detail than was provided in ProMED-mail post Americas (Canada, USA) bat, fox, human 20190718.6574088. - Mod.TG]

A bat flew into the hand of a B.C. man who died of rabies infection. NM, a martial arts instructor, died Saturday [13 Jul 2019] after he had a random brush with a bat on Vancouver Island in May 2019.

NM was not doing anything out of the ordinary on that mid-May 2019 day that he had a brief but fatal encounter with a bat infected with rabies.

A family member said NM, 21, had been driving and pulled over on the side of the road on Vancouver Island when a bat flew into him.

Health authorities confirmed the patient was outdoors and in broad daylight when the nocturnal creature "struck" his hand then flew away.

"He wasn't doing anything risky that would put him in a position where he would encounter bats," said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s chief provincial health officer. "This is an incredibly unfortunate strange circumstance for this young man and his family."

NM had no visible puncture wound or scratch marks, something that's not unusual because bat scratches can be microscopic, said Henry. He developed symptoms of rabies 6 weeks after exposure.

According to an online fundraiser set up to help NM and his family, he was taken to the intensive care unit at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver where doctors treated him for swelling on his spinal cord and brain.

He died Saturday [13 Jul 2019], the 1st confirmed death from rabies contracted in B.C. since 2003 when a 52-year-old man died after developing arm weakness progressing into paralysis.

Tributes have poured in for NM, a much-loved taekwondo instructor at Cascadia Martial Arts in Parksville. Many described him as a hard worker and stellar teacher who had a tremendous impact on his community, including his students.

"NM was an absolutely wonderful young man, and we always admired how amazing he was with all the children he taught; he was truly talented," said one commenter. "His patience and kindness were appreciated and will be remembered."

"We all will miss him, and the sudden loss of such an incredible role model will be felt deeply by this entire community, young and old," said another.

Health minister Adrian Dix extended his condolences to NM's family, calling the young man's death "an extraordinary tragedy."

Deaths from rabies infection are extremely rare. NM's death is the 2nd case in B.C. and the 25th in Canada in the last century.

Rabies is a virus attacking the nervous system. Often introduced through a bite or scratch, it stays in the infected area, multiplying stealthily before traveling into the nerves, spinal cord and brain.

Once symptoms appear, it is usually too late for effective treatment.

About 200 people in B.C. receive [post exposure prophalaxis] vaccines against rabies annually because they may have been exposed to bats or other wild animals, said Dr. Eleni Galanis, physician epidemiologist at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.

"It's an excellent and effective vaccine," she said. "But if you don't get the vaccine, and once symptoms start, nearly everyone dies from the infection, and there is no treatment."

Worldwide, only 5 or 6 people have survived a rabies infection.

Danielle Dagenais, Metro Vancouver/Squamish coordinator for the B.C. Community Bat program, said most human contact with bats occurs in mid-July to September when new pups are learning to fly.

It is also unusual for a bat to be flying during the day and could be a sign it is infected with rabies. Anyone who spots bats in daytime should take extra precautions.

B.C. is home to 17 species of bats, with 10 species found in Metro Vancouver.

The risk from rabies and bats is everywhere in B.C., noted Henry. But it's very small.

About 13 per cent of bats tested in the province tested positive for rabies. Among bats in the wild, the rate is about one per cent.

In 1985, a 22-year-old student was bitten by a bat while working at a forestry camp in Alberta. This student also died.

According to Dr. Eleni Galanis, B.C. Centre for Disease Control, here is what to do if you are exposed or think you may have been exposed to rabies:
- wash the exposed body part with soap and flush with warm running water for 15 minutes
- seek medical attention immediately
- if deemed to be at risk, the doctor would give one shot of a rabies immune globulin that provides antibodies to neutralize the virus before it becomes established and a series of 4 doses of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccine over 2 weeks.

Symptoms of rabies, which has an incubation period generally of 3-8 weeks:
- in initial stages, pain, numbness, tingling at the site of the wound
- paralysis of the limbs or facial muscles
- difficulty swallowing and/or excessive drooling
- aversion to water [individuals do not have an aversion to water, rather are unable to swallow, and water is generally what is offered in a hospital. - Mod.TG]
- in later stages, spread of paralysis, confusion, difficulty breathing, and coma

[2] New Brunswick - bat, human exposure
Date: Sat 20 Jul 2019

https://ca.news.yahoo.com/rabies-infected-bat-came-contact-190116014.html


TD was shocked to find out a bat that bit her son tested positive for rabies.

The mother said her 4-year-old son [A] was bitten by a bat while sleeping in their Hartland, New Brunswick home early Monday [15 Jul 2019] morning.

"My husband and I were sleeping, and we heard a big thump and then a scream," said TD, who initially thought her son fell out of his loft bed.

They ran into the room, turned on the light, and saw A still in the bed. That's when they noticed the bat.

"I took the kids to my daughter's room and shut the door and my husband's trying to get the bat. And that's when my son told me he was bit."

TD suspects their cat, who was sleeping with their son at the time, swatted the bat and that's when it bit A.

After killing the bat, TD's husband Robert rushed their son to the emergency room to get his rabies shots.

TD took the bat to the department of agriculture to get tested and was informed Thursday [18 Jul 2019] the bat was infected with rabies.

That's when her husband went to get vaccinated as well as a precaution. TD took her cat to get vaccinated too.

She thinks the bat came into the house through the chimney since the cap blew off during the winter.

In a statement to CBC News, the Department of Health confirmed that a big brown bat that came into contact with people in Carleton County has tested positive for rabies.

The incident happened just days after a 21-year-old man in British Columbia died of rabies after coming into contact with an infected bat.

TD said the death of the B.C. man was on her mind during the ordeal.

"We saw the article of the man out in B.C. and I'm just like 'how is this posting at such an ironic time,'" said TD.

The department said contact between rabid bats and humans is rare, with only 4 reported incidents in the province taking place since 2017.

The department suggests anyone who has come in direct contact with a bat, or any suspected rabid animal, should contact TeleCare immediately.

It also recommends pet owners who suspect a rabid animal has come into contact with their pet contact a veterinarian.

"If possible, do not harm the suspect rabid animal," said the department.

[3] South Carolina - raccoon, 5 humans exposed

https://www.aikenstandard.com/lifestyle/raccoon-found-in-aiken-potentially-exposed-five-people-to-rabies/article_f4c8959a-a8d3-11e9-a05a-078ef79a0675.html


A raccoon found in Aiken County could have exposed 5 people to rabies, according to a press release sent Wednesday [17 Jul 2019] from the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).

The raccoon was trapped in Aiken County on 19 Jun 2019. It tested positive for rabies after being submitted to DHEC for testing on 15 Jul 2019.

The raccoon was the 5th animal found to be infected with rabies in Aiken County this year [2019]. South Carolina averages nearly 108 rabid animal cases per year.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal; however, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division, in a press release.

When suffering a bite from an animal, the injured area should be immediately washed with soap and water and disinfected. If there is a possibility the animal was carrying rabies, patients should seek help from a health care provider at once.

Anyone who believes they have been exposed to rabies is advised to call Aiken's Environmental Affairs Office. Normal business hours for the office are 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

To report a potential rabies exposure on the weekends or during holidays, contact DHEC's after-hours service number.

State law requires pets to be up to date on their rabies vaccinations. According to DHEC, this is one of the easiest ways to stop the spread of the disease.

The raccoon was receiving treatment at a local wildlife facility.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space," Vaughan said. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it, and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

[4] Alabama - Bat, 47 humans exposed
Date: Fri 19 Jul 2019

https://www.trussvilletribune.com/2019/07/19/health-officer-47-children-received-rabies-vaccine-after-alabama-day-care-bat-infestation/


A bat infestation at a Union Springs day care last month [June 2019] resulted in 47 children receiving treatment for possible rabies exposure, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.

The bats, including 2 dead ones in living areas of the childcare center, were reported in June 2019, and state health officials responded immediately.

"We would normally test any dead bats to determine if rabies is present, but these bats had already been discarded by the facility staff before we were notified," Alabama Public Health Officer Scott Harris told Alabama Daily News. He praised the department and other agencies' response to the situation. It was reported to ADPH [Alabama Department of Public Health] by the Alabama Department of Human Resources.

The daycare was temporarily closed but has re-opened.

"When we are unable to test whether a bat has rabies, we always err on the side of safety and proceed with vaccination, since rabies is uniformly fatal," Harris said.

The situation was particularly complicated because of the age of some of the children, he said. Even if a small child were bitten or scratched by a bat, they may not be able to communicate that to an adult.

"If you had a bat in the house and you said you didn't touch it, we'd believe you," Harris said. "But you can't really trust a 3-year-old to say that when there was a dead bat in the room."

Each child required a dose of rabies immune globulin, which involves 1 or 2 separate injections, then was required to begin the rabies vaccination that totals 4 more shots spread over about 2 weeks, Harris said.

He stressed that only a small percentage of bats are thought to carry rabies.

The department recommends if exposure to people or pets is suspected, dead, sick, or easily captured bats should be tested.

Rabies is a viral infection in mammals transmitted by bites, scratches or other contact with infected saliva. Rabies virus is present only in saliva and nervous tissue; it is not transmitted through contact with feces, blood or urine from infected animals.

Harris said the USD 170 000 cost was only for the vaccines and did not include personnel time or any other expenses.

Harris said a total of 54 children were exposed to bats, and communication efforts continue with parents of the 7 who have so far not received vaccinations despite the department's recommendations.

[5] Texas - kitten, human exposure
Date: Mon 22 Jul 2019

https://www.easttexasmatters.com/news/rabies-case-confirmed-in-central-texas/


A kitten diagnosed with rabies is raising concerns in a Central Texas city.

The City of Valley Mills put out the word after someone found the animal. Officials are urging everyone to be careful when coming in contact with an animal that is not their own.

"It's really amazing we don't have more rabid animals presented than we do," says Cary Bielamowicz, a local veterinarian.

The kitten was found on Thursday [18 Jul 2019], and the search is on to find out whether it spread the disease to its littermates and any adult cats.

Valley Mills officials are urging everyone to remain cautious when coming in contact with a strange animal.

"The most important thing is to stay away from it. Just monitor where it's at. Contact the local authorities. Most everybody has a local rabies authority they can get a hold of or a sheriff's department, the county," Bielamowicz says.

If you think you've found an animal with rabies, you should report it, but don't touch it.

"There are 2 different forms. There's dumb rabies ... they're just very dull. And then of course you've got rabies where they actually show pretty severe neurological signs," Bielamowicz says.

If you're a pet owner, you should make sure your 4-legged friend is protected from the disease.

"Vaccinate pets at 3 months of age, and then a year later. Most vaccines are 3-year rabies vaccines," Bielamowicz says.

Once your pet is vaccinated, always make sure to have their vaccination tag on their collar.

"Pets are being allowed into motels, national parks, state parks, so it's very important to keep that paperwork with you. I highly suggest also getting them micro-chipped so you can associate the rabies vaccine with the microchip and the owner," Bielamowicz says.

[6] North Carolina - fox, human exposure
Date: Mon 22 Jul 2019

https://www.wsbtv.com/news/trending-now/man-fights-off-rabid-fox-with-hammer/968892209


A North Carolina man had to resort to a household tool to fend off a rabid fox that attacked him.

WFMY reported RJ was sitting on the front porch of his mother's Lexington, North Carolina home Tuesday [16 Jul 2019] when he heard rustling in nearby bushes.

"I didn't see anything, and then the next thing I know, I feel something hitting ... my side," RJ told WFMY. "And it was a fox."

RJs said the animal weighed about 25 to 30 pounds and wouldn't let go.

"He was holding on for dear life," RJ said.

WGHP reported RJ screamed for his sister to get something she could fight him off with. She grabbed a hammer and repeatedly hit the fox with it as RJ held the animal down. JRJ said they fought with the animal until it was dead.

The Dispatch reported officials with the Davidson County Health Department confirmed Thursday [18 Jul 2019] the fox tested positive for rabies. RJ was bitten in the stomach and legs, WGHP reported. Officials with the Lexington Police Department said no skin was broken, but he suffered scratches and his clothing was bitten, according to The Dispatch.

WFMY reported that after RJ and his sister fought off the animal, they called paramedics and went to a hospital, where he got 17 rabies shots. [Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14.

If a person has previously received post-exposure vaccinations or received pre-exposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).

[The 17 shots mentioned here do not seem in accordance with the CDC recommendations. However, I suppose the immunoglobulin may have been given in multiple sites. - Mod.TG]

"I had my 2nd session of shots today," he told WFMY Friday [19 Jul 2019]. "I just got back from the hospital. I only had one (shot), but any needle is painful."

RJ is due back for a 3rd and 4th round of shots later in the month. His sister was not bitten in the incident.

[These postings should drive home the message of caution. Any bat may have rabies. Extreme caution is required around these animals.

Vaccination of your pets is part of building a wall between yourself and the virus, and it is a measure to protect your pets.
