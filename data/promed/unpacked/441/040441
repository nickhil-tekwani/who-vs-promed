BSE in the Czech Republic confirmed
----------------------------------------
A German laboratory in Tubingen confirmed BSE in 1 cow from Dusejov,
Jihlava district, Czech Republic. 134 cows from the herd have been
destroyed. All animals killed were 1 year younger or older than the
positive cow and all were BSE negative, Minister of Agriculture J.
Fencl said. The possible source of the disease is being researched by
the veterinary
authorities.
Imported meat and bone meal or milk replacers are supposed to be the
source of the disease.

British officials on Friday confirmed a case of mad cow disease
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) in an animal born after
controls on feed were introduced to eradicate the illness. The cow was
born 27 May 1997, almost 10 months after mammal meat and bone products
were banned from animal feed, the Department for the Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs said.
It was the second such confirmed case. Scientists believe ground up
sheep tissue in animal feed was the agent for spreading BSE. The
development of the disease in an animal born after the August [1996
feed restrictions suggests the ailment may have been transmitted from
its mother. It may also have come from feed introduced before August
[1996.
Experts have predicted there could be a small number of BSE cases in
cows born after the August [1996 measures were introduced. Officials
said the infected cow was 48 months old when it was slaughtered, and
there was no danger it could have entered the food chain. Meat from
cows more than 30 months old may not be sold for human consumption.
The number of BSE cases in Britain continues to decline, with 1311
confirmed during 2000, 42 percent fewer than in 1999.
