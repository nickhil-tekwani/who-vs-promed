Orange rust spotted in crops
-------------------------
Orange rust, the fungus which devastated Mackay's sugarcane crop in 2000, has been spotted in Queensland crops once again.

Canegrowers chairman Paul Schembri said although the fungus packed a serious punch, Mackay growers were not at a high risk yet. "In 2000 it took a lot of yield out of the crop," he said. After that season cane growers changed from the Q124 variety to Q208 which now makes up 24 percent of the state's crop.

When the sugar industry is threatened by pests or disease it combats the issue by diversifying the varieties of cane. "The BSES [Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations] found orange rust on some plantations of Q208, [but] it was only a small amount," Mr Schembri said. "I don't think this will be the end of the Q208 variety just yet."

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop. Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Disease development is favoured by rain and by warm, humid summers and cool autumns.

The rust spores are rapidly spread by wind, as well as by mechanical means and with contaminated materials. Disease management includes fungicides and development of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for more than 100 years but it had rarely caused significant economic crop loss. An outbreak of orange rust occurred in Queensland in 1999-2000 which was attributed to the appearance of a new race of _P. kuehnii_. The most widely grown commercial cultivar Q124 (accounting for 45 percent of the total crop at the time) was totally devastated and the industry suffered yield losses of over 150 million Australian dollars . Initially, the disease was controlled with fungicides because of the lack of sufficient resistant planting material. New resistant varieties have since been developed to replace Q124, including Q208. From the report above it appears that the resistance of Q208 is breaking down. This would indicate the possible emergence of a new fungal strain necessitating the replacement of Q208 by other varieties which are still resistant to the pathogen.
