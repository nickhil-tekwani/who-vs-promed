The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) has ruled out Ebola and Marburg viruses in blood samples taken from suspected patients in Trans Nzoia county.

On [Tue 31 Oct 2017] 4 people from Bwayi area of Kwanza constituency were quarantined over a suspected outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever that had many fearing of an Ebola outbreak. It had been reported that the 4 were infected by suspected patients from neighboring Uganda who had arrived in the area on [31 Oct 2017] seeking treatment for a "strange disease" from a local herbalist.

According to Trans Nzoia County Medical Superintendent Emmanuel Wanjala, blood samples taken from the herbalist and her husband tested negative of the deadly diseases.

Wanjala says that 7 more patients are under medical investigation, insisting that all precautions to contain a possible Marburg fever outbreak have been undertaken. The medical officer rues the ongoing nurses' strike as a challenge in the whole process.

This comes even after World Health Organization (WHO) issued an alert on the outbreak of the disease in Uganda, describing it as; "Marburg virus disease (MDV), formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever which is severe, often fatal illness in humans."

[Finding that tests on samples from the individuals under quarantine in Kenya are negative is good news indeed. One hopes that the remaining 7 who are under investigation turn out to be similarly negative. Kenya health authorities and the KEMRI Laboratory are to be commended for their very fast response to this situation.
