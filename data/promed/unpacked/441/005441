Reports of the little known Q fever on the Coffs Coast [New South
Wales] are causing concern to residents and health authorities. There
are unconfirmed reports of up to 6 cases presenting at the Coffs
Harbour Health Campus during the past 6 weeks.

Q Fever is a disease contracted by infection from bacteria found
typically in the urine, feces, or milk from cattle and sheep. The
director of public health for the North Coast, Paul Corben, said there
was a vaccine available for those working with animals, like vets and
abattoir workers, but it was a 2-step process which involved a skin
test and blood sample before the doctor made a decision, because if
the person showed evidence of prior immunity, the vaccine caused "a
nasty local reaction."

Mr Corbin said while they had seen a couple of probable or confirmed
cases of Q fever from south of Coffs Harbour to as far north as
Woolgoolga, there was nothing that warranted extra follow-up or
indicated a higher risk than normal. He said the North Coast averaged
about 40 confirmed cases of Q fever annually.

A reader who contacted The Advocate said one man from Emerald Beach
had died and she had almost lost a friend this week [week of 28 Mar
2011], who was now in the intensive care unit. She believed the cases
were focused on the northern beaches. "It is not where you would
normally find Q fever," Mr Corben said. "But it is a hardy bacterium
and very persistent in the environment. We have done normal follow-up
and there is nothing that links those people together. We are still
waiting for some lab reports. You traditionally think of Q fever as
associated with farm areas but there have been recent outbreaks in
other areas.

Mr Corben said Q fever was particularly likely to be associated with
animal birthing times.

[Q fever was first described in Australia where this posting
originates. It was called "Query fever" because the causative agent
was initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was
discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to
heat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A
single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in
[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was
found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including
other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does
not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion
in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.
Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.
Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high
numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with
contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication (along with the less resistant
large-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

The Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,
although not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail
in a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,
including tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.

An earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was
tied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for
at least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).
