Following a meeting on St. Barths [St. Barthelemy] on 3 Dec 2007 to
assess the dengue situation there, the working committee of experts
on infectious diseases and the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (IVS) of
French St. Martin have declared St. Barths and St. Martin in an
"epidemic alert phase."
Meanwhile Health authorities on Dutch St. Maarten announced on 27 Nov
2007 that the country was on a "pre-alert phase" for dengue in the
wake of lab confirmations of 18 cases on that day. The authorities
put out a cautionary note that the situation could turn into an
"epidemic phase" if all criteria for observation and tests were met.
French St. Martin health officials noted that the number of suspected
clinical as well as confirmed biological cases [presumably laboratory
confirmed. - Mod.TY] to and exceeded the pre-alert phase between
September and the end of November [2007]. They would not reveal the
total number of suspected cases they now have. But they did say that
9 cases, 7 adults and 2 children, were hospitalized. One of the
confirmed cases may well have progressed to the DHF stage of the
disease. There was no word of a DHF confirmation for that case. Based
on the history of this dengue event, it would be expected that all of
the patients were stricken with the dengue 1 virus serotype, the
predominant virus type on St. Martin. [Are other dengue virus types
in circulation there, as well? - Mod.TY]
The Dengue situation on St. Barths has been even more dramatic with a
sharp increase in suspected dengue in the last 2 weeks --
[epidemiological] weeks 47 and 48. By the very last week of that
month, the best estimate of suspected dengue on St. Barths was 50
cases. Several of them have been confirmed biologically, of these, 2
were reportedly in serious condition. It was unclear as to which
[dengue virus] serotype is in circulation on St. Barths.
At the beginning of the month [December 2007], the country was in the
pre-alert phase. This profile could well change as French experts
embark on a dengue review. Of the other adults with classic dengue, 5
were deemed to be severe, while the 6th was filed under serious.
Back on mainland St. Maarten, this time on the Dutch side, Health
Commissioner Maria Buncamper-Molanus has acknowledged, in essence,
that the dengue outbreak there is worsening. She has admitted that
the 18 cases they have recorded in the past 11 months is the highest
ever, even though slightly, since [the time that] data has been
collected and kept. And the numbers are climbing still on account of
the physician sentinel protocol already in place. St. Maarten has a
commitment from 7 physicians who issue weekly reports on communicable
diseases, including dengue, to the Health Commissioner.
A fogging exercise in conjunction with a public awareness campaign
has since gotten off the ground on the Dutch side. The focus of the
awareness campaign is to provide the public with detailed information
on what they should do to prevent the proliferation of the dengue
vector, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
The Dutch St. Maarten Hygiene and Veterinary Department is also
charged with the responsibility of doing contact tracing, which
entails the inspection of the living quarters and general premises of
the persons diagnosed with the disease and their immediate
neighbourhoods. Commissioner Buncamper-Molanus provided the rationale
for this saying that the public awareness programme "will have a
positive effect, as far as reducing the chances of further spreading,
but the public has to take the necessary action. We cannot
underestimate the importance of the public's role in keeping this
disease from spreading. It is we, the people of St. Maarten, who have
the biggest positive effect in stopping the spread of this disease."

The number of people in Zulia ill [from dengue virus infection]
increased from 8181 in 2006 to 18 405 so far in 2007. Preventive
action is urged. The mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_] is adapted to the
urban environment and does not distinguish among social classes.
In 2007, 77 269 cases of classical dengue fever and DHF were
registered, an increase of 94 percent, which classified the disease
as epidemic, according to information from the Ministry of People's
Power for Health [MPPH]. The dengue cases in Zulia represent 24
percent of the national total and dengue increased 125 percent in the
region [over 2006]. The World Health Organization considers that [the
current epidemic] is related to the El Nino phenomenon.
Of the total of 77 269 dengue cases registered nationally, 18 405 are
in Zulia [state], a number which reflects more than double the cases
with occurred in Zulia last year [2006] during the same period.
According to the data provided by the Directorate General of
Epidemiology, Zulia leads in the number of dengue cases in the
country in marked contrast to the following states: Miranda (5.584
cases), Guarico (4.938) y Anzoategui (4.419). All [these] have been
declared dengue epidemic states.
The simultaneous presence of distinct [dengue virus] serotypes in a
given region increase the risk of possible outbreaks of DHF, of which
Zulia also has the greatest number: 1346 cases [of DHF] of a national
total of 6145.

[Like much of tropical Latin America this year, Venezuela appears to
be experiencing a serious dengue epidemic. It would be interesting to
be able to plot the distribution, and if possible movement, of the
various dengue virus types throughout the western hemisphere this
year. Molecular epidemiological analysis could provide a powerful
tool to track that movement, the accompanying changes in the viruses
over time and changes in virulence associated with those changes.

The most recent figures indicated that in Carabobo state 2750 dengue
cases have been reported, of which 2420 are positive [presumably
laboratory confirmed. - Mod. TY] and 35 await results.
The Governor of Carabobo, Luis Felipe Acosta Carlez, indicated that
the community councils, health committees, PSUV members,
communication media and other public and private institutions must
incorporate themselves in a united front to fight dengue. He issued
this call due to the increase in dengue [cases] and said that he
considers that, "the fight against dengue requires the participation
of all the organized sectors."
Atypical climatic conditions which have affected the entire country
have increased the breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito
that transmits [dengue virus] in diverse communities in Carabobo,
mainly in the zone north of Valencia's where the greatest number of
[dengue] cases have occurred.
The Governor indicated that printed and audiovisual materials are
available for orientation about the prevention of dengue, treatment
and care of [patients] which this disease deserves. In coming days,
the Carabobo Health Institute will strengthen the [dengue] preventive
campaign in the 14 municipalities of the state and activate the
telephone number so that cases can be reported and the foci of cases
attacked more efficiently.
Humberto Trejo, President of the Health Corporation of Aragua,
although unable to indicate the exact number of dengue cases,
estimates that there have been at least 3000 dengue cases in the
entire state this year [2007]
He indicated that the 5 deaths due to dengue (4 were children) in the
state were caused by dengue [virus] 2, considered by the authorities
to be the most aggressive [virulent] and erratic with a tendency to
rapidly change [from dengue fever] into DHF. Comparing this year
[2007] to 2001, [he said], "there were more [DHF?] cases this year
because [in 2001] the virus was dengue 3, so the mortality [rate] was
not so high". [Because there are significant differences in virulence
both within and among dengue virus serotypes, these types of
generalizations oversimplify relationships of virus type and severity
of disease. Unfortunately there is no satisfactory animal model that
mimics human disease to explore virulence of different dengue virus
types and isolates. - Mod.TY]
Trejo does not discard the proliferation of the mosquito vector of
dengue [virus] _Aedes aegypti_ due to drinking water scarcity, which
obligates citizens to store water in kegs in an inadequate way so
that they become mosquito breeding sites.
Since July [2007], when the epidemiological alert began due to the
increase in [dengue] cases, health authorities have developed plans
to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The [authorities] activated
the plan "Operation Cachivache" which consists of community
elimination of all types of trash which could serve as mosquito breeding sites.
Trejo indicated that "we have achieved important successes related to
the prevention of the disease, although problems continue in the
zones of greatest human population, such as the municipalities south
of Maracay. The jurisdictions where the greatest concentration of
[dengue] cases are found continue to be Girardot and Marino.

At least 48 deaths were attributed to mosquito-borne dengue fever in
this city this year [2007], with 101 more residents falling ill
because of the virus, health officials said.
As of 18 Dec [2007] the City Health Department recorded a total of 48
deaths in Cebu City.
There were 1946 cases recorded from 1 Jan - 18 Dec [2007]. Despite
the continuous increase in the number of cases, the Cebu City Dengue
Task Force decided not to heed the mayor's suggestion of pouring used
oil into a suspected breeding site of dengue-carrying mosquitoes in
Barangay Labangon [a barangay is a defined neighborhood. - Mod.TY].
Instead of using used oil, the City Health Department and the task
force will use chlorine or larvacide, whichever is more effective and
economical and safer to use. Assistant City Epidemiologist Durinda
Macasoncol said the task force advised against the use of used oil
after sanitary inspectors visited the lagoon in Labangon.
The lagoon, measuring some 1.4 hectares [3.46 acres], is suspected to
be the major breeding site of mosquitoes in Labangon, which has the
highest number of dengue cases among all 80 barangays.
"We were supposed to pour used oil in the lagoon but it did not push
through because we learned it could be harmful to the ecosystem.
We're still studying what is the more effective and economical way of
doing it, either we use chlorine or larvicide," Macasocol said.
The lagoon, which was originally a deep excavation for a building the
Gaisanos planned to build, will also have to be drained, she said.
But Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmena was irked upon knowing the task
force did not heed his order to pour used oil on the pond and
threatened to fire personnel in charge of the campaign against dengue
fever. "My God, we already lost 50 lives and they're talking about
saving the earth," Osmena said.
Although pouring used oil in the lagoon will kill the mosquitoes,
Masacol said they opted not to push through with the mayor's
suggestion because it will only be good for one to 2 days. "Whatever
we put there, it will only be good for a couple of days because the
water continuously flows out of the lagoon. We are studying this so
we can come up with something that has long-term benefits," Macasocol added.

[This is an example of inappropriate action being proposed by a
political leader based on incomplete or inaccurate information. While
the lagoon may indeed be a breeding ground for mosquitoes, it is
highly unlikely that the dengue virus vector mosquito, _Aedes
aegypti_, is breeding there. _Ae. aegypti_ requires fresh water
catchments, usually in and immediately around houses and other
buildings. Efforts at control of dengue virus transmission should be
aimed at these _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites. This report
illustrates the need for scientists to work closely with policy
decision makers, and for both to engage the public in elimination of
these mosquito vector breeding sites in their houses and other buildings.

The Health Service of Central Java (DINKES) released the dengue fever
(DBD) data from January up until December 2007; there were 11 636
inhabitants infected including 217 people who died.
The DINKES head, Dr. Hartanto, mentioned that the number of people
who had dengue from 2006 only reached 10 924, including 220 who died.
The incidence of dengue cases in Central Java during January-November
2007 was 4.95 per 10 000 inhabitants, higher when compared with 2006,
which was 3.37 per 10 000 inhabitants. Thus, numbers of dengue cases
over the past 2 years have increased.
The spread of the [dengue] epidemic was greatest in 35 regencies in
the city. In [case] mapping by the Health Service, the epidemic area
currently spreads in 33 regencies of the city except Banjarnegara and
Wonosobo. This does not mean that Banjarnegara and Wonosobo have been
completely dengue free. Although there were some infected people, the
case number did not reach the numbers for epidemic status, he continued.
With the current spreading, the epidemic area was no longer in the
urban areas such as Semarang City, Solo, Salatiga, Kota Tegal, Kota
Pekalongan, and the Magelang City. However, currently the rural areas
have not escaped breeding of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.
Dr. Hartanto said that the eradication of the dengue could not only
rely fogging or fumigation as these actions only killed mature
mosquitoes, not larvae. Therefore, community efforts with the 3M
approach was needed: drain [water catchments], close breeding sites,
bury [articles than can hold water], and completely clean out larval
mosquitoes.
