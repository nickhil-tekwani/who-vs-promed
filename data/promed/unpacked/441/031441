In the Saratov region, veterinary activities worth 4.1 million rubles [USD 62 127] have been applied in agricultural and domestic animals.

In areas bordering with Kazakhstan, vaccination against foot and mouth disease [FMD] is being carried out; 383 500 head of cattle and small ruminants have been vaccinated.

According to the information from the Saratov veterinary department, 1.2 million vaccinations were given against anthrax, and 467 600 against nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease (LSD)].

Rabies vaccination has been applied in 65 300 dogs and 47 200 cats. Also, 600 000 rabies vaccine baits have been distributed in natural areas.

[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Russia: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6153837,22949. For the location of the Saratov oblast, bordering West Kazakhstan oblast, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/ZaAux11vBV92; HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Kazakhstan https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6153837,18269.

According to Kazakhstan's most recent annual report to the OIE (2017), FMD has not been recorded in this country since July 2013, and LSD not reported there since 25 Nov 2016.

The West Kazakhstan oblast, bordering Russia's Saratov oblast, is one of 6 oblasts in Kazakhstan (the others are Karaganda, Kostanay, Mangystau, Pavlodar, and North Kazakhstan), which have been recognised by the OIE since 2014 as "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised". A relevant OIE map, updated May 2017, showing Kazakhstan's "FMD-free" zone, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Kazakhstan.jpg.

The discrepancy between the Russian FMD vaccination efforts along Kazakhstan's border and the official FMD-freedom status in the latter, is remarkable; it may be indicative of concerns about the actual situation in the region.

The apparent absence of LSD cases in West Kazakhstan's (according to official information, unvaccinated) cattle, while on the other side of the border, in Russia, numerous LSD outbreaks have continuously been reported, is similarly remarkable; see OIE's global LSD map since October 2017, at https://tinyurl.com/y7eq9cat (click on the cluster along Kazakhstan's north-western border, zoom in).

RFI's re Kazakhstan's LSD situation have been published in 3 postings during 2017, and again, recently, in 20180804.5947342. - Mod.AS]
