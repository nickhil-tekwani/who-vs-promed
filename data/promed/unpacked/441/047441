If indeed we are dealing with iodine, these symptoms may simply reflect
overdose. Acute overdose is associated with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal
pain, metallic taste; and occasionally fever, anuria, delerium and death from
uremia. Temporary enlargement of the salivary glands may be encountered, and
the urine often contains protein, casts and erythrocytes.
