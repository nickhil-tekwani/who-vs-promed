Vibrio illnesses after Hurricane Katrina -- Multiple States, Aug-Sep 2005
---------------------------------------------------
Hurricane Katrina made landfall on 29 Aug 2005, with major impact on
the Gulf Coast of the USA. During 29 Aug - 11 Sep 2005, surveillance
identified 22 new cases of Vibrio illness with 5 deaths in persons
who had resided in 2 states (Figure 1) [For all tables and figures,
consult original URL above - Mod.LL]. These illnesses were caused by
_V. vulnificus_, _V. parahaemolyticus_, and nontoxigenic _V.
cholerae_. These organisms are acquired from the environment and are
unlikely to cause outbreaks from person-to-person transmission. No
cases of toxigenic _V. cholerae_ serogroups O1 or O139, the causative
agents of cholera, were identified. This report summarizes the
investigation by state and local health departments and CDC,
describes 3 illustrative cases, and provides background information
on Vibrio illnesses. Results of the investigation underscore the need
for heightened clinical awareness, appropriate culturing of specimens
from patients, and empiric treatment of illnesses (particularly those
associated with wound infections) caused by Vibrio species. No
confirmed cases of illness have been identified with onset after 5
Sep 2005; additional Vibrio cases are under investigation.
A case of post-hurricane Vibrio infection was defined as clinical
illness in a person who had resided in a state struck by Hurricane
Katrina (i.e., Alabama, Louisiana, or Mississippi) with illness onset
and reporting during 29 Aug-11 Sep 2005, where Vibrio species was
isolated from a wound, blood, or stool culture. Among cases, a
wound-associated Vibrio case was defined as an illness that likely
resulted from infection of a wound or abrasion acquired before or
during immersion in floodwaters.
Wound-Associated Illnesses:
18 wound-associated Vibrio cases were reported, in residents of
Mississippi (7) and Louisiana (5); in persons displaced from
Louisiana to Texas (2), Arkansas (2), and Arizona (1); and in a
person displaced from Mississippi to Florida (1). Speciation was
performed in clinical laboratories for 17 of the wound-associated
cases; 14 (82 percent) were _V. vulnificus_, and 3 (18 percent) were
_V. parahaemolyticus_. 5 (28 percent) patients with wound-associated
Vibrio infections died; 3 deaths were associated with _V. vulnificus_
infection, and 2 were associated with _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection.
Age of patients with wound-associated illnesses ranged from 31 to 89
years (median: 73 years). 15 (83 percent) were male. The majority of
patients were hospitalized; admission dates ranged from 29 Aug to 5
Sep 2005. Not all patients were initially hospitalized because of
their wounds. An underlying condition that might have increased risk
for severe Vibrio illness was reported in 13 (72 percent) of the
patients with wounds; these conditions included heart disease (7
patients), diabetes mellitus (4), renal disease (3), alcoholism (3),
liver disease (2), peptic ulcer disease (1), immunodeficiency (1),
and malignancy (1).
Non-Wound-Associated Illnesses:
4 persons were reported with non-wound-associated Vibrio infections
(2 in Mississippi, 1 in Louisiana, and 1 displaced from Louisiana to
Arizona). Information on the Vibrio species and clinical illness was
available for 2 of these patients; the species were nontoxigenic _V.
cholerae_ isolated from patients with gastroenteritis. One of the
infections occurred in a boy aged 2 months with diarrhea whose stool
culture yielded both Salmonella group C2 and _V. cholerae_ non- O1,
non-O139. He was hospitalized for 2 days in Mississippi.
The other _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 isolate was from a stool
specimen from an adult who was not hospitalized. No deaths were
associated with the non-wound cases.
Case Reports:
To illustrate the rapid onset and severity of Vibrio wound
infections, brief descriptions of 3 of the cases are provided.
Patient A. A man aged 60 years with a history of stroke,
hypertension, and alcohol abuse arrived in Texas on 31 Aug 2005,
after spending 3 days wading in the floodwaters of New Orleans,
Louisiana. He was not housed at an evacuation center. On 1 Sep 2005,
the man visited an emergency department with bilateral ankle wounds
and diarrhea; he was treated and released. No details regarding
treatment were available. Blood cultures subsequently yielded _V.
vulnificus_. The patient was located and admitted to the hospital on
2 Sep 2005. He died the next day.
Patient B. A man aged 61 years from Mississippi with human
immunodeficiency virus infection, coronary artery disease, and
hyperlipidemia was examined on 29 Aug 2005 and determined to have
hypothermia and multiple 2nd- and 3rd-degree abrasions on his trunk.
_V. parahaemolyticus_ was isolated from his blood. Despite receiving
antimicrobial therapy with levofloxacin, he died the next day.
Patient C. A woman aged 49 years reported by her family to have
hepatitis C was evacuated from New Orleans after a boat rescue. She
visited an Arkansas hospital on 4 Sep 2005 with bullae, septic shock,
and necrotizing fasciitis on her left leg, which was extensively
debrided. _V. vulnificus_ was isolated from her blood. As of 12 Sep
2005, she was being treated with ceftazidime and doxycycline and
remained in critical condition.

MMWR Editorial Note:
After natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, the risk for
illness related to infectious diseases is a public health concern.
The findings in this report describe illnesses caused by Vibrio
species, including wound infections resulting from post-hurricane
exposure of wounds to flood waters. These findings underscore the
need for prompt recognition and management of Vibrio wound infections
by healthcare providers.
When the number of illnesses from infectious diseases increases after
a natural disaster, they usually are caused by infectious agents
normally present in the community or local environment (1).
Nationwide, an average of 412 cases of noncholeragenic Vibrio (all
Vibrio species other than toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 or O139)
illnesses were reported each year during 2000-2004, including an
average of 146 cases reported from the 5 Gulf Coast states (2). The
most frequently reported Vibrio species are _V. parahaemolyticus_,
_V. vulnificus_, and nontoxigenic _V. cholerae_. Vibrio illnesses in
the USA are seasonal and peak during the summer (Figure 2). During
2000-2004, in the month of September, an average of 14 (range: 11-18)
noncholeragenic Vibrio infections were reported from Gulf Coast
states; an average of 7 cases (range: 4-8) were wound-associated.
Except for toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 or O139, Vibrio illnesses are
not nationally notifiable in the USA, and the actual number of
noncholeragenic Vibrio illnesses is likely greater than the number
reported.
Cholera is a severe diarrheal illness caused by _V. cholerae_
serogroups O1 or O139, which produce cholera toxin (i.e., toxigenic
_V. cholerae_ O1 or O139). A small endemic focus of toxigenic _V.
cholerae_ O1 exists in the Gulf of Mexico (3). During 2000-2004, a
total of 16 cases of cholera were reported in the USA, and 13 (81
percent) of these infections were acquired during overseas travel or
by consumption of imported seafood. Only 3 (19 percent) infections
were acquired in the Gulf Coast states, all in the year 2000.
Therefore, the risk for acquiring cholera associated with Hurricane
Katrina is extremely low.
Since 2000, at least 7 noncholeragenic Vibrio species (_V.
vulnificus_, _V. parahaemolyticus_, nontoxigenic _V. cholerae_, _V.
alginolyticus_, _V. fluvialis_, _V. mimicus_, and _V. hollisae_) have
been reported as causing illness each year in the USA. Although these
organisms and those that cause cholera are grouped together under the
genus Vibrio, they cause distinctly different illnesses. In the USA,
noncholeragenic Vibrio usually are either foodborne, (e.g., resulting
from eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters, or
other contaminated foods) or wound-associated (e.g., resulting from
exposure to seawater or brackish waters where the organism naturally
occurs). The incubation period for noncholeragenic Vibrio infection
usually is 12-72 hours but can be as long as 1 week (2).
Noncholeragenic Vibrio illnesses are not transmitted easily from
person to person. Outbreaks, which are rare, usually are the result
of consuming contaminated shellfish.
The most frequently reported post-hurricane Vibrio illnesses were _V.
vulnificus_ and _V. parahaemolyticus_ wound infections. These cases
represent an increase over the normal reported incidence of Vibrio
wound infections in Gulf Coast states and are consistent with
exposure after hurricane landfall. Although precise exposure
histories are not yet available for all patients, the infections
caused by _V. vulnificus_ likely resulted from wounds exposed to
flood waters among persons with medical conditions that predisposed
them to Vibrio infections. No evidence has been found of increased
Vibrio gastrointestinal illness.
_V. vulnificus_ wound infections can begin as redness and swelling at
the site of the wound and rapidly progress in patients at high risk
to cause systemic illness, including sepsis. Whether acquired through
wound infection or ingestion, _V. vulnificus_ typically causes a
severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and
chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blood-tinged
blistering skin lesions (hemorrhagic bullae) (Figure 3). Persons with
chronic liver disease or immunocompromising conditions are
particularly at risk for severe _V. vulnificus_ infections (4,5).
_V. parahaemolyticus_ typically causes gastroenteritis after
consumption of contaminated shellfish. Less frequently, _V.
parahaemolyticus_ causes wound infections that are generally less
severe than _V. vulnificus_ wound infections. However, in persons
with liver disease or immunocompromising conditions, _V.
parahaemolyticus_ wound infections can lead to death.
Nontoxigenic _V. cholerae_ causes primarily gastroenteritis, but
unlike toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 or O139, nontoxigenic V. cholerae
do not cause epidemics. Illness caused by this organism ranges in
severity from mild diarrhea to severe watery diarrhea. Fever and
bloody diarrhea are not typically observed. Immunocompromised persons
and persons with liver disease can experience a more severe illness,
including fever, chills, and septic shock. This organism has rarely
been reported to cause wound infections.
Vibrio infections are diagnosed by culture of wound, blood, or stool
specimens. For stool specimens, a selective medium of
thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS) is recommended. If
clinical suspicion of enteric Vibrio infection exists, the
microbiology laboratory should be notified so that TCBS media will be
used. Clinical laboratories should send all Vibrio isolates to state
public health laboratories for confirmation. CDC continues to work
with local and state public health officials to investigate
post-Katrina Vibrio illnesses.
Persons working in hurricane-damaged areas, especially in areas with
standing brackish water, should wear boots and other protective gear
to prevent wounds and to prevent exposure of broken skin to
contaminated water. To prevent Vibrio infections, persons with open
wounds or broken skin should avoid contact with brackish water or
seawater, especially if they have preexisting liver disease or other
immunocompromising conditions. Injury prevention is especially
important for persons in these high-risk populations. Healthy persons
are at much lower risk for Vibrio infection. In areas where flood
waters have receded and surfaces are dry, Vibrio should not be a
concern because the organism is killed rapidly by drying (6).
To reduce the risk for Vibrio wound infection, persons should wash
all wounds that have been exposed to sea or brackish waters with soap
and clean water thoroughly as soon as possible and seek medical care
for any wound that appears infected. Clinicians should be vigilant
for Vibrio infection in hurricane evacuee populations, particularly
in patients with infected wounds and especially if the patients are
in a high-risk group. If _V. vulnificus_ is suspected, antimicrobial
therapy should be initiated immediately; prompt treatment can improve
survival. Antimicrobials effective against Vibrio infections include
doxycycline, 3rd-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftazidime),
fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides (7). Wound infections also
should be treated with aggressive attention to the wound site;
amputation of the infected limb is sometimes necessary. Additional
information regarding management of _V. vulnificus_ wound infections
is available at
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/Katrina/vibriofaq.asp>.
For Vibrio gastroenteritis that is mild and self-limited, treatment
with oral rehydration usually is sufficient. Antimicrobial therapy
might be helpful for patients with severe or prolonged diarrhea.
