Malaysia warns of smuggled chicken
-------------------------------------
Malaysia is stepping up vigilance over poultry smuggling amid fears
that frozen chicken meat is being illegally shipped from China and
other countries hit by bird flu, a news report said Thursday. Customs
officials have destroyed 28 tons of frozen chicken meat worth USD 29
500 that were seized Sat [21 Apr 2007] from a truck that entered
Malaysia's southern Johor state from neighboring Singapore, the _New
Straits Times_ newspaper reported. The report quoted Johor Customs
Deputy Director Rumainor Sarif as saying officials were concerned
that the meat could have come from a country hit by bird flu.
Government offices were closed Thu [26 Apr 2007] for a national
holiday, and no one at Johor's customs department could immediately
be contacted for comment.
Several international syndicates are suspected to be involved in
poultry smuggling, raking in profits because frozen chicken meat,
particularly from China, is substantially cheaper than Malaysian
poultry, the report said. The meat is believed to be repacked in
Singapore before being smuggled through southern Malaysia and sold to
food processing companies and restaurants, the report added.
China has suffered dozens of bird flu cases in its vast poultry
flocks. Millions of birds have been destroyed to contain outbreaks on
farms. Malaysia was officially declared free of bird flu in June
2006, 3 months after the last outbreak of the virulent H5N1 strain
was detected in chickens in a northern Malaysian village.
Bird flu has killed at least 172 people worldwide since it began its
spread through Asian poultry in 2003, according to the World Health
Organization. Most deaths come from contact with infected birds, but
experts fear it could mutate into a form that spreads easily among
people.

[This is unfortunately a run-of-the-mill report these days. It is
being posted because as Malaysia manages to stop the smuggling in of
poultry meat from China via Singapore, the syndicates will look
elsewhere to send it. So for the next few weeks customs officials
might want to take some extra interest in refrigerated containers
from Singapore and confirm that they don't contain poultry meats,
whatever the shipping documents say. - Mod.MHJ]
