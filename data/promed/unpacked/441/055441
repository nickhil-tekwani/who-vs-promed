A 16 year old youth was reported to have died of suspected
rabies-related disease at Buleleng Regional Hospital on Thursday [5
May 2011], adding to the island's 147 victims of rabies since the
deadly disease emerged in November 2008.

The victim was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday [4 May 2011] when
he exhibited symptoms of rabies such as difficulty breathing,
hydrophobia, and a sore throat. The hospital director said that the
patient's family stated the boy had been bitten by a dog in his
village in Banjar about a year ago.

I Nyoman Sutedja, head of the province's Health Agency, said that dog
bite cases in Bali remained high, with 130 cases per day despite the
province's ambitious target to eliminate its rabies outbreak by the
end of 2012.

[The case described above is unusual with respect to the lapse of a
year between dog bite and appearance of symptoms in the victim.

Merritt Clifton has provided the following commentary on the above
press report: "The good news is that there are still no human rabies
victims from the Bali mainland who are known to have been bitten
within the past 8-plus months. The total number of confirmed and
suspected human rabies fatalities, mid-2008-present, remains between
150 and 180. The figure of 147, stated above, appears to omit the 5
fatalities that occurred in 2008."

On the other hand, there is some bad news from Janice Girardi,
founder of the Bali Animal Welfare Association, who has coordinated
the island-wide [canine] vaccination drive that on 5 Apr 2011 reached
the goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of the Bali dog population,
cutting the number of identified canine rabies cases by 45 per cent
and cutting human deaths by 48 per cent over a year's time. Merritt
Clifton has forwarded also the following commentary from Janice
Girardi:

"We have had an informal FAO meeting today. They are also frustrated
that the provincial government is killing the dogs that have been
vaccinated. They are trying to get an agreement of some kind that if
they manage the available funds that the vaccinated dogs will not be
killed.

"We all agree with humane population control and education, but it
takes time, of course. And at the moment, 300 000 dogs for a human
population of almost 4 million is not excessive, especially
considering the Balinese culture, where each family compound must have
a dog; farmers need dogs, etc. We would like vaccinated, healthy and
cared for dogs, of course. After Balinese people had their dogs
killed, they went and bought new puppies, often from infected pet
markets, etc., and they subsequently hide the puppies, which means
they go unvaccinated and the cycle starts again. We are now doing a
study on the effect culling has on the Balinese population. How many
new puppies are brought in, how fast, etc. There is too much to do,
too little time, and never enough funding!

"The logic of killing vaccinated dogs, unfortunately, has nothing to
do with effective rabies control, and -- in my observation not only in
Bali but in similar situations around the world -- everything to do
with the opportunity for politicians to pass out patronage jobs as
dogcatchers to their supporters.

"This was also the unfortunate reality in much of the US before
vaccinating dogs became routine about 50 years ago, and [canine]
rabies diminished as an imminent threat. After that, patronage-hired
dogcatchers largely vanished in favor of animal control officers who
were trained to do code enforcement as well as catching and usually
killing dogs.

"Along the way, however, a myth developed that reducing the
population of dogs at large had something to do with the US success in
eradicating rabies. This myth continues to cause governments to waste
endless resources trying to reduce dog populations through culling,
without any lasting success where the habitat supports high dog
fecundity, instead of just accomplishing saturation vaccination, to
build and maintain herd immunity.

"What the historical record shows occurred in the US is rather
different from the myth: a dog population estimated at about 20
million circa 1900, all free-roaming, when rabies was barely
controlled if at all; 30 million circa 1950, including 10 million
street dogs, virtually all of whom were still allowed to roam free;
few street dogs left by 1960, and [canine] rabies nearly gone, but
still about 30 million dogs roaming free, out of a total pet dog
population of about 36 million; about 40 million dogs by 1970, about
2/3rds still roaming free, with canine rabies rare; 45 million by
1980, half often roaming free and about 10 per cent picked up by
animal control agencies each year for roaming at large, with canine
rabies eradication beginning to look possible; about 55 million by
1990, with the roaming population in steep decline; 60 million by
2000; and 70 million by 2010.

"The US free-roaming pet dog population rapidly dropped from 1980 to
1990, and is probably by now under 5 per cent of all pet dogs. But
that would still be 3.5 million dogs. The final eradication of canine
rabies in the US did roughly coincide with allowing pet dogs to roam
becoming socially unacceptable, but by far the greatest part of canine
rabies eradication in the US was achieved through aggressive promotion
of vaccination decades earlier, while the US population of dogs
roaming at large was still as large as it had ever been."
