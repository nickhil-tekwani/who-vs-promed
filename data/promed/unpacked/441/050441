Negative laboratory results
---------------------------
The issue most concerning the veterinary profession over the past two weeks
has been the negative diagnoses. About 30 per cent of the sample sets
received by the Pirbright Laboratory have been negative for foot and mouth
disease (FMD), which has caused much publicity and anguish.
Pirbright performs a variety of tests on the samples submitted from
suspected cases. Not all reported cases are sampled: indeed, only about a
third of all reported suspects are diagnosed with FMD, the remainder are
cleared [on the basis of clinical examination.
Pirbright then look for virus in the epithelial tissues and blood and
antibody in blood. Detection of virus is by an enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) backed by tissue culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
FMD results in the production of large amounts of virus in clinically
affected animals and, if the correct samples are taken at the right time,
the lab tests are reliable.
The virus is also very sensitive to disinfectants, however, and obtaining
the correct samples from sheep is not easy. The sheep have been the problem
with diagnosis. Over 90 per cent of cattle samples submitted have been
positive, but only about 60 per cent of [samples from sheep. Many cases
were diagnosed simply on classical clinical signs and samples were not
sent. The positive diagnosis rate would have been much higher if these had
been included.
The level of negatives is hardly surprising, and most clinicians would be
proud of a 70% positive diagnostic rate based on clinical signs. There is
nothing for the veterinary profession to be defensive about, particularly
considering the pressure of time placed on the clinicians in the field.
While those farms [whose stock have been slaughtered after which test
results were negative may have hard feelings [about what was done, the
situation would have been considerably worse if positive cases were allowed
to generate virus while lab results were awaited. The early delays while
suspects were confirmed by a prolonged report and sampling procedure were
heavily criticized, and probably led to spread in the first weeks of the
epidemic.
About 30 flocks have now been found with positive antibody. These have not
registered as infected premises, and there is some dispute as to how they
are handled. Currently, they are described as dangerous contacts, and
slaughtered as such. In some regions they are probang tested for the
presence of virus, and if found they are recorded as infected premises and
dealt with as such.
The issue of what constitutes an infection, or an infectious risk, is still
under discussion at various levels. Total seroconversion may indicate an
animal has recovered and is no longer infectious, [but the Italian
experience where clinically free sheep brought back onto farms generated
disease causes us concern. A perception that figures are being massaged is
developing, and cannot be allowed to jeopardize credibility in the control
and eradication.
Of the 28 deer samples tested at Pirbright, none have shown the presence of
virus. A short communication in the Veterinary Record [has suggested
[that airborne spread from infected herds and flocks was minimal and
questioned the need for a contiguous cull. However, 80 per cent of recent
infected premises (IPs) have been within 3km of a previous IP, and 30 per
cent to 40 per cent (depending on the region) of all IPs are within 1.5km
of a previous case. So, if these were not infected by airborne virus, how
were they infected? The translation of distance from an IP to the field
where contiguous has been defined by a shared boundary has been illogical
in many instances.

[Finding the right set of cost effective rules is more than a
[mathematical modeller's "3 kms". This article generates both questions
and answers. It raises valid points about the interpretation of negatives,
but these data taken back to the field should tell us what spread really
occurred, over what distances, and in which circumstances. They are a
treasure trove of information. Ultimately, this entire episode points to
the need for continued vigilant observation for diseases and accurate and
timely reporting. - Mod. MHJ/TG
