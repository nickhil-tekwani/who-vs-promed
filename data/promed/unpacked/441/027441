The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area's [YNAA ] reserve of vaccines -- about 900,000 doses -- will be enough to inoculate the entire local reindeer population of 730 000, the YNAA official website reports.

Test inoculations were performed in the Priuralsky, Nadymsky, Krasnoselkupsky and Tazovsky districts. The vets staged a campaign in the cold season to find out how the animals react to being inoculated in winter and early spring. Their conclusion is that the vaccine can be used in March and April. The main events are scheduled for the summer of 2017.

This year [2017], the YNAA veterinary service is planning to microchip all reindeer, whose ear tags will contain an animal's sex and age data and identify its owner and grazing area.

Yamal is implementing a roadmap to rationalize reindeer herding. Among other things, the program sets the volumes and timeframes for a mass anti-anthrax vaccination of reindeer. As of 2017, it is intended to inoculate the entire population, including young animals born in 2017.

[Microchipping caries many advantages starting with a save & secure doorway into a complete identification and history record for each animal. If Ted Turner can microchip every one of his bison on multiple ranches, the folk in Siberia should also succeed. And the vaccination should provide adequate cover during the summer anthrax season. But one has to be careful that the herding and vaccinating does not induce abortions in the pregnant female reindeer. - Mod.MHJ
