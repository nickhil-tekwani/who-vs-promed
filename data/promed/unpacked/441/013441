[According to the preceding ProMED-mail report from Tatarstan (Hemorrhagic
fever w/renal synd. - Russia (08): (TT) 20101029.3928) the cumulative
number of HFRS cases in Tatarstan up to the end of October 2010 was 17. The
total of 12 cases over only a single week reported above signifies the
start of the epidemic season for HFRS in Tatarstan, which is explained by
the increased reproductive activity of voles, the main carrier of HFRS. -
Corr.VM

Although not specifically stated, it is likely that Puumala virus is the
specific hantavirus responsible for this outbreak of HFRS in Tatarstan, and
the rodent reservoir is the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_).

The Republic of Tatarstan is located in the east-central part of European
Russia. The Republic lies in the middle Volga River basin around the
confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers. A map of the Republic of Tatarstan
