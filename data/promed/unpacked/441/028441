A Mendocino County child is recovering and doing well after being
diagnosed with infant botulism earlier in April 2007, the Public
Health Department reported Tue 17 Apr 2007. According to a press
release, the child's mother reported that, in addition to being
breastfed, the infant was fed Earth's Best Organic baby food.
While there is no confirmed link between this case and the baby food,
the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has initiated an ongoing
recall for the following jars of Earth's Best baby food because of
the risk of contamination with _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium
that can cause botulism.
The affected baby food is:
- Earth's Best Organic 2 Apple Peach Barley Wholesome Breakfast, 4.5
ounce jars, expiration date 17 Sep 2008.
- Earth's Best 2 Wholesome Breakfast Variety Pack, 12 pack,
expiration date 13 Sep 2008.
- Earth's Best Organic 2 Apple Peach Barley, 4.5 ounce jars within 12
pack, expiration date 14 Sep 2008.
According to Marvin Trotter, MD, of the Public Health Department,
"The most frequent cause of botulism in infants is from honey and
soil; in fact, infant botulism is rare."
Production and distribution of the baby food has been suspended and
the company has initiated a recall of the food.

[In this case, there is a possible link to the recalled baby food
mentioned but cases of infant botulism have occurred in totally
breast-fed babies. This report does not specifically state that the
baby food was part of the February 2007 recall.
The following is abstracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in
New York City (ProMED-mail posting: Infant botulism - USA (New York
City) 20030117.0144):
"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the
USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually.
Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this
form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism -
Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial
production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _C.
botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been
proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable
source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure
generally is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and
often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a
cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the
mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.
Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged <12
months who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking,
swallowing, or crying; hypotonia; and progressive bulbar and
extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical
ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging
generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other
causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local
and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange
diagnostic stool testing."
