>From August 1997 up to 9 February 1998, a total of 14,679 cases with 477
deaths (case fatality rate 3.2%) were reported. During the last week of
January a total of 1,657 cases were reported corresponding to an attack
rate of 4.1%. Most of these cases occurred in Beira City, Sofala Province.
Over 800 cases with 80 deaths were reported in a 48-hour period in the
current week and 900 patients are currently being treated in the only
cholera ward available in the city. The situation in other affected areas
(Gaza, Manica, Maputo City and Maputo Province) appears to be stable.
Neighbouring countries (Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi) have been alerted to
the need to strengthen surveillance for early detection of cholera coming
via the Beira corridor.
