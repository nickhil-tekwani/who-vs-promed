Two new cases of measles in one-year-old infants were added yesterday
[13 Jun 2011] to the outbreak that occurred last week at a nursery
school in Alicante affecting 6 children under 15 months of age.

The Department of Health has diagnosed so far this year [2011] 14
cases of this disease, which WHO had expected to have eradicated in
2005, but which has recurred now in Spain and more especially in some
other European countries, such as France, where this year [2011] there
have been at least 5000 cases, with 3000 of them in March 2011 alone.

Although the virus has only now arrived in this autonomous territory,
the situation is worrisome, said a spokesman for the Department of
Epidemiology, who stated that 14 diagnosed cases have occurred in 2
areas, Alcoy and Alicante, and that the disease has affected 2
unconnected groups. Measles virus infection has spread to 8 young
people between 18 and 20 years of age who had received only one dose
of vaccine and, as a result, are less protected against the pathogen.

In Alicante, epidemiologists are looking for the index case, who is
thought to have brought the virus from another neighbouring autonomous
region. The Department of Health will advance the administration of
MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination to 12 months instead of
the current 15 months.

A measles epidemic in the Republic of Congo has infected 800 people
and killed 32 in Pointe-Noire, the country's economic hub, a newspaper
reported on Friday [17 Jun 2011]. "This is really disturbing given
that a vaccination campaign (against measles) could only begin on 22
Jun 2011," said Alexis Elira Dokekias, the director general of health
services in the Central African country.

Measles is a highly infectious disease that mostly affects children.
It is characterised by a rash, runny nose and high fever. It reduces
children's resistance to illness and makes them more likely to die
when they are malnourished and suffering from other diseases. The
disease can be prevented through vaccination. The World Health
Organization (WHO) says recent immunisation efforts have resulted in a
74 per cent reduction in measles deaths globally.

However, Dokekias said there has been poor vaccination coverage in
the Pointe Noire Kouilou region in southern Congo, which explains the
current outbreak, according to the report in the Les Depeches de
Brazzaville.

The measles outbreak comes at a time when the country's health
services are trying to deal with an epidemic of chikungunya fever
which has infected more than 4000 people in the southern districts of
the capital Brazzaville.

83 cases of measles have been registered in Kyrgyzstan as of 9 Jun
2011 according to the press service of the Ministry of Health. A total
of 66 of the cases have been registered in Osh oblast, 16 in Bishkek
and one in Naryn oblast.

Specialists on immunization intend to appeal to WHO representation in
Kyrgyzstan with the suggestion to initiate measles vaccination of
children at 6 or 9 months of age, the reason being that infants are
now more often appearing among those affected.

Health officers in Cotabato City fear a possible measles outbreak at
evacuation centers amid 2 suspected cases of the disease. Some 8000
families were forced to leave their homes and transfer to evacuation
centers as floods submerged Cotabato City, affecting over 25 000
families in 33 out of the city's 37 barangays [suburbs].

Seven were reportedly killed in North Cotabato, while another person
is missing in Cotabato City due to the floods. An estimated 140 000
people have been affected by the floods, more than half of the city's
population. Floodwaters have also entered the town proper.

A state of emergency was declared in Pikit, North Cotabato, Cotabato
City and in Maguindanao last week following incessant rains.

Almost a decade ago, measles was declared eradicated in the Americas,
thanks to widespread vaccination efforts. But outbreaks in Quebec and
several of the United States show that Western Hemisphere countries
are still not immune to the virus, which can be imported by travellers
and quickly infect pools of the unprotected. And the number of those
vulnerable to measles may, in fact, be growing, as some parents choose
not to vaccinate their children for various reasons, among them fear
of possible side effects or a belief that measles and other infectious
diseases are merely a benign rite of passage in childhood.

Quebec's outbreak, which began early this year [2011] and this week
jumped to 330 confirmed and suspected cases, has been traced to a
traveller from France, where uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella
[MMR] vaccine hovers around 60 per cent of the population, far below
the 90-plus per cent rate in Canada. Information provided by Quebec
health authorities shows most of those infected were unvaccinated or
inadequately vaccinated, making them easy targets for the highly
infectious virus, said Dr John Spika of Canada's Public Health
Agency.

While vaccination schedules vary across the country, many
jurisdictions call for a 1st dose at 12 months old and a 2nd before
admission to elementary school. "We're looking at a problem that is
primarily in high schools," said Spika, director general of PHAC's
Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases. "Most of
their cases, over 60 per cent, are between the ages of 10 and 19. The
data that we have received would suggest that a high proportion of
those high-school-aged children may not have received any vaccine. Was
it because they're Quebecers born and raised whose parents refused
vaccine or did they immigrate to Quebec after the school-entry check
and never received vaccine in their home country?"

What is known is that it takes 2 shots of the MMR vaccine to fully
protect against measles. In 1995-96, before Canada moved to a 2-shot
schedule, there was a large outbreak that public health officials
predicted would have risen to 20 000 cases if the 2nd-dose program
hadn't been introduced. And Quebec's epidemic may not be an isolated
occurrence in Canada, said Spika, noting that a small outbreak
occurred in Vancouver during the 2010 Olympics, resulting from the
importation of 3 different strains carried by overseas visitors to the
games. "The 3 strains spread and then died out because there weren't
enough susceptibles," he said. Cases could still pop up anywhere in
the country, he said. "If measles got into an unimmunized or
inadequately immunized group of kids, yes, that could happen."

Far from being a trivial disease, the respiratory infection marked by
a widespread skin rash can result in often severe complications: ear
infections that in some cases cause permanent hearing loss;
potentially fatal pneumonia; and encephalitis, or inflammation of the
brain, which can lead to life-long cognitive impairment or even
death.

In fact, measles kills about 165 000 children a year worldwide,
primarily in low-income countries. While that number is still
unacceptably high, infectious disease experts say it is a far cry from
the 750 000 deaths reported in 2000, which predated a massive global
immunization push.

So why would anyone hesitate to have their child vaccinated? A study
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published this
week by the journal Health Affairs, suggests parents have a number of
concerns that undermine confidence in vaccines. In the authors' survey
of parents, most reported at least one worry over immunization,
including that children: (1) suffer physical pain from shots, (2) get
too many shots in one doctor's visit, (3) have too many vaccines
before age 2, and (4) receive vaccines containing unsafe ingredients.
One of the most controversial issues related to the MMR vaccine is the
fear that the inoculation can lead to autism spectrum disorder,
despite repeated studies that have shown no causal link between the
vaccine and the developmental disorder.

Over the last decade, there was a resurgence of measles -- and mumps
-- due to a dramatic drop in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom
and some other European countries following a 1998 paper in The Lancet
that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The journal retracted the paper
by Andrew Wakefield and colleagues in early 2010 after the data
presented was discredited. An investigation published by the British
Medical Journal in January 2011 showed that the research by Wakefield,
who has been stripped of his licence to practise medicine in Britain,
"was an elaborate fraud."

Yet vaccination rates have been slow to rebound in those countries,
in part because some people continue to distrust the vaccine. Dr Heidi
Larson, a senior lecturer at the London School for Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, suggests that part of the reason the notion about
autism persists "is there's a very proactive group of parents who have
autistic children or have neighbours who have autistic children and
who are absolutely convinced that that's the cause of it. This is what
they believe," said Larson, who published a study in The Lancet this
week looking at the reasons behind an apparent loss of public
confidence in vaccines. "And I think we understand the power of
belief," she said in an interview from London. "From a medical
perspective, you want to believe that if we've got the scientific
evidence, that's enough. And it's just not enough for a lot of people.
It's challenging, but I think the medical community needs to come to
terms with the fact that it's not going to be resolved by giving
better facts to each parent about who can benefit ... What's really
important is that we change the way of interacting with those who are
still vaccinating and make sure that they are confident and that their
questions are being answered."

In his view, said Spika, the autism link has been "totally debunked",
and the best way for parents to protect their children is to ensure
that they've had 2 doses of the vaccine. "The measles vaccine is quite
safe, and there's no reason why one shouldn't give the vaccine."

Health officials say that 118 cases of measles have been reported
already this year [2011]; that's the highest number of measles cases
to be reported this early in the year since 1996.

On Tuesday [14 Jun 2011], The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention released the count for 1 Jan -- 20 May 2011. Cases were
seen in 23 states. None of the patients died, but about 40 per cent
were hospitalized.

The US normally sees about 50 cases of measles in a year, thanks to
vaccinations. About 90 per cent of the cases this year [2011] were
unvaccinated. Measles is highly contagious and up to 90 per cent of
people exposed to an infected person get sick. The virus spreads
easily through the air and in closed rooms; infective droplets can
linger for up to 2 hours.

North Dakota has its 1st confirmed case of the measles in nearly a
quarter-century, while South Dakota officials say there is the
potential for a case in that state because of an out-of-state visitor
with the virus. Officials in both states are urging people to make
sure their vaccinations are up-to-date.

The North Dakota case is in a Cass County man who is in his 50s and
was not vaccinated, the Health Department said in a statement Monday
[13 Jun 2011]. He most likely caught the virus on an airline flight
and was not in North Dakota while contagious, officials said.

Measles is highly contagious and can cause permanent brain damage and
even death. Symptoms include a rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation
and fever. The last case of measles in North Dakota was in 1987.

North Dakota reported its 1st case of measles since 1987 [see above
report], an unvaccinated adult who traveled in South Dakota during his
infectious period. "We're asking health providers to be on the alert
for measles symptoms, and we're contacting individuals who had
exposure to this case during his time in South Dakota," said Bonnie
Jameson, disease prevention administrator for the Department of
Health. "This is a good reminder of how important vaccination is, and
we would encourage South Dakotans to make sure they and their children
are up to date on their immunizations, including measles."

Measles is a highly contagious virus transmitted from one person to
another by direct contact or airborne by droplet spread. Symptoms
include rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and fever. It can lead
to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and death. A
serious illness, measles causes permanent brain damage in one out of
every 1000 patients and is fatal in 2 out of every 1000 patients.

The best protection against the disease is the measles vaccine (MMR).
For full protection, 2 doses of the vaccine are recommended, the 1st
at 12 months of age and a 2nd dose by age 4. Two doses of the MMR
vaccine are required for school entry in South Dakota. South Dakota
reported its last case of measles in 1997. Parents in need of vaccine
for their children can contact their usual health care provider or
check the list of childhood vaccine providers on the department's
website: http://doh.sd.gov/LocalOffices/Vaccine.aspx.

State lab results on a possible case of measles in Westborough are
inconclusive, Paul McNulty told Westborough Patch. "They will be
sending the results to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) in
Atlanta for interpretation," said McNulty, Westborough director of
public health. "This is an unusual situation."

An employee of the Bose Corporation at 9 Technology Dr. in
Westborough reportedly showed signs of the disease around Wed 1 Jun
2011. McNulty explained that when a doctor suspects a case of measles,
it is reported to the state, which is what happened in this case. The
state then notifies the local board of health. "The incubation period
for measles is about 14 days, so we're just about there," McNulty
said.

Despite inconclusive results, Bose will be holding a vaccination
clinic for its employees, McNulty said. The clinic will offer 300
doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. The vaccine is
sent to the Board of Health office in Westborough from a state lab in
Jamaica Plain and will be delivered to the Westborough location of
Bose.

"I recommend they get the shot," said McNulty when asked what he
advises for the employees of Bose. He did not recommend the general
public seek the vaccination because of this incident. The vaccination
is commonly given to children in 2 doses by age 6. CDC recommends that
anyone 18 or older who was born after 1956 get at least one dose of
the MMR vaccine unless they can show that they have had either the
vaccines or the diseases.

The agency does not advise the vaccine for people who have ever had a
life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomysin
or to a previous dose of the MMR vaccine. Those who are ill and
pregnant women should also wait to get the vaccine. CDC recommends
that patients with HIV/AIDS, a disease that affects the immune system,
cancer, or a low platelet count consult a doctor before getting the
MMR vaccine.

CDC has confirmed that the suspected case of measles at Bose
Corporation, 9 Technology Drive, is positive. "The test has come back
with a positive result from the CDC," noted director of public health
for the Town of Westborough, Paul McNulty. "Effective today, if a Bose
employee cannot provide proof of [vaccination], they must immediately
get vaccinated or be excluded from work," McNulty said. "The clinic to
receive the MMR vaccine began at 8 a.m. this morning [17 Jun 2011] (at
the Bose Corporation) with 300 doses of the MMR."

An employee of Bose Corporation 1st started showing signs of the
disease on 1 Jun 2011. According to McNulty, when a doctor suspects a
case of measles, it is reported to the state, which is what happened
in this case. McNulty does not recommend that the general public need
to get re-vaccinated, but he did note that a booster is never a bad
idea if you are older.

"If you have been immunized already or if you are over 57, you are
considered to be immune," McNulty explained. "It is a good idea to get
a booster if you are older, but it is not required." McNulty explained
that we are seeing a resurgence in measles as several people fell prey
to fear of the links between autism and the MMR vaccine. "While
speaking with the CDC," McNulty said, "They explained that people come
from Europe infected, and then the disease is spread here." Many in
Europe were not immunized due to a widespread study done by Doctor
Andrew Wakefield that linked the MMR vaccine and autism.

The incubation period for the measles is about 25 days. "The
infectious period will end at Bose on 26 Jun 2011," McNulty said. If
you are ill, pregnant, allergic to gelatin or have ever had a reaction
to a previous dose of MMR, you should wait to get vaccinated.

Normally, children receive the MMR between 12 and 15 months and a 2nd
dose between the ages of 4 and 6. "We are lucky in this country that
most do get vaccinated," McNulty said. "I absolutely recommend that
children get immunized," McNulty said. "No vaccine elicits a good
response in 100 percent of the population. Over time, the immunization
wanes and may get weaker. It is not a bad idea to get a booster, but
check with your doctor."

The Department of Health is alerting the public to an increased risk
of measles cases in WA [Western Australia], following the
identification of 4 cases in early June 2011. The warning comes after
one adult returned from the Philippines with the disease, and an
unvaccinated child was infected in Thailand and then passed the
infection to his 2 younger unvaccinated siblings.

Director of communicable disease control Dr Paul Armstrong said a
large number of people were potentially exposed to infection at
several locations, including the emergency departments of Joondalup
and Princess Margaret hospitals, at north metropolitan general
practice surgeries where the infected cases were seen, and at schools
and clubs the cases attended while infectious. "As a result, public
health staff has [sic] been contacting exposed individuals who may be
at risk and providing advice," he said.

Measles is contagious for up to 5 days before the development of the
rash and for 4 days after it starts, and both children and adults who
have been unwittingly exposed are at risk of developing measles if
they are not immune.

"A person is considered immune to measles if they have received 2
doses of the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine or were born before
1966," he said. "Individuals who may have been exposed and who develop
a fever and cough or runny nose in the next 2 weeks should stay at
home and promptly consult their doctor. The patient should mention
their possible contact with measles when they call so they can be
isolated when they arrive at the surgery and prevent the potential
spread of measles to other patients."

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can cause serious
disease. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes
followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later. Naturally occurring
measles has been eliminated from WA for over a decade, but occasional
cases and small outbreaks occur associated with tourists or WA
residents returning from overseas.

Complications following measles can be very serious and may include
ear infections and pneumonia in about 10 per cent of cases. Around 50
per cent of cases may require hospitalisation, and about one person in
every 1000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.

17 people have been confirmed as having measles in Auckland, the 2nd
large outbreak in the city this year [2011]. Auckland Regional Public
Health Service (ARPHS) medical officer of health Richard Hoskins said
all cases were linked to Oratia Primary School in west Auckland, with
3 people requiring hospitalisation. Almost all of those struck by the
illness were not immunised.

Dr Hoskins said ARPHS was trying to trace people who may have been
exposed to the infection. More than 200 individuals, as well as large
groups such as schools, had been traced so far, with some instructed
to isolate themselves.

"Measles must be taken very seriously, especially as we are seeing an
increase in the number of cases presenting. It is a disease that can
have severe complications, especially in vulnerable groups in the
community, including children too young to be immunised, pregnant
women, and those with suppressed immunity."

Dr Hoskins urged those who had been isolated to remain at home and
avoid contact with other people. "And as always, we urge people to be
vigilant if they suspect they could have measles, or have been exposed
to someone who could have measles. Getting measles can be avoided by
immunisation with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, which is
typically given in 2 doses, at 15 months and 4 years of age.
Immunisation not only protects your child from serious illness, but
also protects more vulnerable children and members of the community
who could suffer more serious illness or death."
