----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The case was in my hospital [São José do Rio Preto Base Hospital, São Paulo (SP) state]. It was a classical YF [yellow fever] presentation. The diagnostic was done by serology and RT-PCR in the liver of the patient (in autopsy material). The diagnosis was made almost 14 days ago, not this week (as in the post). The diagnosis was made by Instituto Adolfo Lutz.

2. The patient came to the city a few months before. He did not get YF vaccination.

3. He went to Mata dos Macacos [São José do Rio Preto municipality] several times. THIS IS NOT a remote area. In fact is less than 10 miles [16 km] from downtown São José do Rio Preto, which has 500 000 habitants.

4. The Mata dos Macacos (or "monkey forest") is known by the large presence of NHP [non-human primates] (this is why it has this name).

5. YF circulation is know in this region of SP State for centuries. In fact YF vaccination is part of the regular schedule. It was a major mistake to live in this region without YF vaccination.

6. The last human case of YF in the region was in 2001 and not 2008. In 2008 we had NHP YF detection.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Maurício Lacerda Nogueira for correcting several errors in the previous post concerning this yellow fever case. His report indicates that the YF diagnosis was made promptly and competently. He makes a very important point -- individuals who venture into areas where there is sylvan YF circulation should be vaccinated at least 10 days beforehand.
