The Ministry of Health and Medical Services yesterday [11 Jul 2017] confirmed there were 5 cases of meningococcal disease at St John's College in Levuka [Lomaiviti province, Ovalau Island]. A student also died at the beginning of this term, after the disease outbreak at the school.

Health Ministry permanent secretary Philip Davies said they approached the World Health Organization (WHO) to support vaccination of students. When contacted yesterday [11 Jul 2017] for a comment, WHO said it would comment on the issue later. Mr Davies also gave his assurance the ministry was well placed to manage the risks associated with the outbreak.

He said there was ongoing monitoring of public health activities at the college and providing factual information to the broader community to allay concerns and ensure there was no stigmatisation or discrimination of college students.

According to WHO, meningococcal disease is a severe but uncommon infection that occurs when meningococcal bacteria invade the body from the throat or nose.

Although most people who have these bacteria in their throat or nose remain quite well, they are able to spread the bacteria to others and a few of these people may subsequently become ill.

No comments could be obtained from the school or the Ministry of Education regarding the outbreak of the disease at the institution.

[The news report does not specify the meningococcal serogroup involved in the outbreak at St John's College. The serogroup is important as the outbreak serogroup should match the serogroup in the meningococcal vaccine that is being used to halt the outbreak.

In the US, serogroups B, C, and Y are the major causes of meningococcal disease in the United States, each being responsible for about 1/3 of cases (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm). In infants aged under one year, over 50 per cent of cases are caused by serogroup B, and in people over 11 years of age, 75 per cent are caused by serogroups C, Y, or W. Serogroup B meningococci have also been responsible for several outbreaks and isolated cases on US college campuses in the past several years (http://www.nfid.org/idinfo/meningococcal/meningococcal-b-college-outbreaks.html).

The CDC defines an outbreak of meningococcal disease as the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is approximately 10-fold greater than the normal occurrence (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

St John's College is a Roman Catholic secondary school located in Cawaci, on the Fiji island of Ovalau. In 2015, 590 students were enrolled, the majority coming from Papua New Guinea (http://www.sjcawaci.school.fj).

Cawaci is about 7 km (4.3 mi) north of the town of Levuka, formerly the capital of Fiji; Levuka has a population of 1131 residents in 2007 (3266 residents in the peri-urban area) on the east coast of Ovalau, in Lomaiviti Province, in the Eastern Division of Fiji (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levuka).
