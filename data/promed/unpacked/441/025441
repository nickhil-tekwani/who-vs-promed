Egypt reports new bird flu case in poultry
------------------------------------------
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been reported in a domestic poultry farm in
southern Egypt, the 1st time the highly pathogenic virus was detected in
the country in months.
The new case was reported in the village of Al-Rakakna, in the Sohag
province, some 490 km (305 miles) south of Cairo, a statement from the
agriculture ministry said on Sunday [3 Sep 2006].
All poultry on the farm was slaughtered and tests were under way to check
that none of the people who had been in contact with the infected animals
were contaminated.
The last human case of H5N1 reported in Egypt dates back to May 2006. Out
of the 14 human cases of avian influenza that have been reported among
Egyptians since mid-March 2006, 6 turned out to be fatal, and 8 people
recovered after being treated with the drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir).
