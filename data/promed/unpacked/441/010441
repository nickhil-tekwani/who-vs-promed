Local authorities have acted promptly to contain a new bird flu outbreak in
Kamphaeng Phet, announcing that an outbreak identified in 4 districts has been
contained.
The provincial governor and local health officials visited Ban Sabmanao in
Klongthalung district to cull chickens and spray disinfectant after native
chickens in the village were found to be infected with the H5N1 avian flu
virus.
Provincial animal husbandry officials were quoted by the Thai News Agency as
saying Friday [2 Sep 2005] that the province has enforced preventive measures
to ban moving poultry in the 4 districts.
The cause of the new outbreak may be the movement of fighting cocks from other
areas where they had contracted the disease, the official said.
There is no report of the deadly disease in chickens raised in closed farming
systems or free-range ducks, he added.
The poultry have been under close surveillance and free-range ducks are
registered with the authorities.

[Thailand has been meticulously sending to the OIE detailed weekly disease
information updates on avian influenza since 12 Mar 2004. The disease was
reportedly absent between 12 Apr 2005 and 5 Jul 2005, when new cases were
reported from native poultry and fighting cocks in villages where biosecurity
is minimal. These findings resulted from a nationwide active surveillance
campaign conducted since 1 Jul 2005. The purpose of this surveillance is to
evaluate the present status of highly pathogenic avian influenza after the 2nd
wave of outbreaks between 3 Jul 2004 and 12 Apr 2005.
As a result of this 2-month campaign, 29 new outbreaks have been confirmed in
4 provinces:
Affected province/ No. of outbreaks
Ayudhaya/ 1
Chainat/ 1
Kampaengphet/ 8
Suphanburi/ 19
All cases involved either free-range poultry or poultry raised in farms with
traditional husbandry practices with poor sanitation and insufficient
biosecurity, notably in the 3 outbreaks involving quail.
Further details on the said surveillance campaign, as well as the last follow-
up report (No 66) notifying data on 6 outbreaks which had started between 23-
30 Aug 2005, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_55.htm#Sec3>.
An administrative map of Thailand is available at
<http://www.visit-thailand.info/information/political-map-of-thailand.htm>.
Thailand seems to have successfully eradicated the disease in commercial
flocks, without vaccination, in an effort to restore exports (applying the
zoning/compartmentalisation principles, this might be achieved). The struggle
to control the continued infection in small holdings has to be continued. -
