For the first time, scientists have reported mapping the genes of a
bacterium which causes a plant disease, an advance that could lead to new
approaches to fighting a scourge that ravages orange groves and other
crops. The work also sheds light on the way bacteria infect both humans and
plants and thwart their defenses.
Research sponsored by the State of Sao Paolo Research Foundation in Brazil,
involving 200 scientists in 34 molecular biology labs working for two
years, resulted in the sequencing of the complete genome of the bacterium
_Xylella fastidiosa_.
Charles J. Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell
University, was quoted as saying, "This sort of information is going to
open up crop protection strategies the way genome sequencing is opening up
new pharmaceutical strategies to control infectious diseases" in people.
The report, published in Nature (Nature, 13 Jul 2000), states that research
group was able to identify the function of 47 percent of the bacterium's
2904 genes, offering researchers targets for developing cheaper ways of
controlling the disease, known as citrus variegated chlorosis, or CVC.
Joao Carlos Setubal, who led the study as coordinator of the Bioinformatics
Laboratory at the University of Campinas in Brazil, was cited as saying the
project made Brazil a new force in the international genome arena, after
starting from a position of practically no local expertise. The scientists
also reported finding at least 83 genes in _Xylella fastidiosa_ that came
from other bacteria, including some that help fight off a plant's natural
defenses.
Arntzen was further quoted as saying, "This is the strongest story we have
had in the plant biology area or non-human medicine for gene transfer
across bacteria," adding that it gives scientists a better understanding of
how germs and evolve along with the plants they infect. The finding also
sheds light on how bacteria that cause human diseases develop resistance to
antibiotics, he added.
Carried by insects called sharpshooter leafhoppers, the bacteria infest the
xylem, the tubes under the bark of a tree that transport water. By blocking
water absorption, the disease causes the fruit to be small, hard and
commercially worthless. Related strains of the bacteria attack coffee,
almonds, pecans, grapevines, alfalfa, peaches and other plants.
The disease was first identified in Brazil in 1987 and causes $50 million a
year in damage to orange groves there, which produce half the orange juice
concentrate in the world, Setubal said.
The strain of bacteria was chosen for the genome project because it is
expensive to combat with current means, which include insecticides, pruning
and replacing trees.

[The completion of the genome sequence of _X. fastidiosa_ represents a
milestone in phytobacteriology. The bacterium is vectored by two species
of sharpshooter (blue-green, _Graphocephala atropuctata_ and glassy-winged,
_Homalodisca lacerta_). Pierce's disease of grapevine is caused by _X.
fastidiosa_, and grapevines on the North Coast area and Riverside County in
California have been heavily diseased in recent years. Officials in
California are calling for genetic engineering as the best means of
effective disease management. - Mod.DH
