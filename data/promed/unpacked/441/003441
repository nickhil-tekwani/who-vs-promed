Power line blamed for bird kill in Louisiana
--------------------------------------------
Louisiana's state wildlife veterinarian says at least some of an
estimated 450 birds that died near Baton Rouge may have flown into a
power line.

Jim LaCour said Tuesday [4 Jan 2011] the grackles, starlings,
brown-headed cowbirds and red-winged blackbirds had broken beaks and
backs. He says some live birds had broken wings but ran too fast to catch.

The bird deaths Monday came a few days after about 3000 blackbirds
fell from the sky in central Arkansas. Scientists there say
celebratory fireworks on New Year's Eve likely sent the birds into
such a tizzy that they crashed into homes, cars and each other before
plummeting to their deaths. Officials say such massive wildlife kills
are not uncommon.
