The Allegheny County Health Department has confirmed the death of a
95-year-old Monroeville woman from Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia.
Spokesman Guillermo Cole said the woman died Sept. 9 at a local hospital.
She was a resident of the Sunrise Assisted Living Center. Another female
resident who is 89 is being treated for Legionnaires' disease at an
unspecified local hospital.
"This is not considered an outbreak," he emphasized. "We've had clusters
before. We have not recommended moving the residents. The facility is
well-managed and well-maintained."
The county has averaged about 36 cases of Legionnaires' disease annually
since 1993. It is caused by the _Legionella_ bacteria found in hot water
systems, humidifiers, water taps and shower taps and is usually transmitted
by the inhalation of airborne water droplets. Nationwide, it accounts for
up to 8 percent of all cases of pneumonia.
Deaths are unusual, Cole acknowledged, but noted that elderly people with
weak immune systems are particularly susceptible to the _Legionella_ bacteria.
Cole said the Health Department has gathered water samples at the Sunrise
home for testing but won't know the results until next week. Meanwhile,
health investigators are confident that no one in the home is in danger and
noted that the home's management has been cooperative during the
investigation.
