A 17-month-old toddler [in Pryor, Oklahoma] has contracted the potentially very serious raccoon roundworm, _Baylisascaris procyonis_.

A pediatric neurologist after a period of time diagnosed the boy with the dangerous parasite. The child is in rehab and should be home in several weeks.

_B. procyonis_ is a roundworm found in the small intestines of raccoons. They excrete the eggs of this parasite in their feces. The eggs can survive in the environment for years under favorable conditions. There can be millions of eggs shed by the raccoon, with high densities in the feces and the soil surrounding it.

Humans and animals get infected by accidentally ingesting eggs from the environment, from raccoon feces, contaminated water, or fomites. Raccoons typically defecate in favored areas called latrines. Common latrines include the bases of trees, raised forks of trees, fallen logs, rooftops, woodpiles, and decks.

The infection can be severe and even fatal if the roundworms enter a person's eye, organs, or brain. _Baylisascariasis_ does not spread person-to-person.

Symptomatic infection in humans is relatively rare with less than 3 dozen cases reported; however, new University of Georgia research suggests there can be asymptomatic infections.

[Exposure to _Baylisascaris procyonis_ eggs in the gut may elicit an antibody response even without an invasive infection. _B. procyonis_ infections in humans, especially meningitis, are almost always fatal and difficult to treat (Langelier C et al. _Baylisascaris procyonis_-associated meningoencephalitis in a previously healthy adult, California, USA.
