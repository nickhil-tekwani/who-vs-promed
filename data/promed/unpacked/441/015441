A total of 18 more dead birds found in Chicago and various Cook and DuPage
county locations have preliminarily tested positive for West Nile virus,
bringing to 25 the number of birds that have either been confirmed or are
possible positives since the virus was first detected in the state on 5 Sep
2001, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced today.
The 18 dead birds were identified as preliminarily positive by the Illinois
Department of Agriculture lab in Galesburg. Samples from the birds have
been shipped to the U.S. Geological Survey lab in Madison, Wis., for
confirmatory testing that may not be completed for several weeks.
The dead birds, crows and blue jays, were collected between 5 and 7 Sep
2001 in the following locations with collection dates in parenthesis: 3
crows from Arlington Heights, Cook County (5 and 6 Sep); a crow and blue
jay from Chicago (6 Sept); a crow from Elmhurst, DuPage County (6 Sep); 2
crows from Glendale Heights, DuPage County (7 Sep); a blue jay from Glen
Ellyn, DuPage County (6 Sep); a crow from Glenview, Cook County (6 Sep); a
crow from Lombard, DuPage County (6 Sep); a crow from Midlothian, Cook
County (6 Sep), 5 crows from Mount Prospect, Cook County (6 Sep); a crow
from Palatine, Cook County (5 Sep); a crow from Park Ridge, Cook County (6
Sep); and a crow from Wheeling, Cook County (6 Sep).
In addition, 2 new pools of mosquitoes collected in Cook County suburbs are
preliminarily positive for West Nile virus. The preliminarily positive
mosquitoes were collected on 10 Sep 2001 in Palatine, Cook County, and in
the Cook County Forest Preserve's Allison Woods (located between Arlington
Heights and Glenview) by the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District. Samples
of the mosquitoes will be sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention laboratory in Colorado for confirmation. A third pool of
mosquitoes, collected in Palatine, Cook County, that tested preliminarily
positive were reported by the Department on 10 Sep 2001.
A complete recap of the positive birds and mosquitoes identified so far in
Illinois is on the Department's Web site at .
