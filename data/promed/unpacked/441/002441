Avian Influenza
---------------
On Thu, 17 Apr 2003, a 57-year-old veterinarian died in the Jeroen Bosch
Hospital due to serious pneumonia. Since fowl-plague (Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza -- HPAI) virus was detected in the lungs while no other
possible explanation for the described disease picture was found, there is
a strong indication that the man's death is the outcome of infection with
the HPAI virus.
The veterinarian became sick 2 days after working on an infected farm. He
did not use antiviral preparations. According to the Outbreak Management
Team (OMT), which held a meeting Friday, 18 Apr 2003 evening, this is a
very rare situation. Until now, HPAI has been causing only conjunctivitis;
the death of the veterinarian is an exceptional course. He had no
conjunctivitis. Investigations should find-out if the virus has undergone
changes which might explain this serious development. These are being
carried out in the National Influenza Centre (Erasmus Medical Centre) in
Rotterdam.
Following the advise of OMT, the close contacts of the veterinarian are [as
a precaution being] treated with the antiviral preparation oseltamivir
(Tamiflu). This is meant to prevent any further spread of the virus,
including close family members, engaged physicians and medical personnel
from the relevant hospital's departments and the pathologists.
The OMT indicates that the antiviral prescription is effective in
preventing human infections with the HPAI virus. They stress the necessity
of all those involved in the culling activities and those living or working
on HPAI infected or suspected premises, to apply the prescribed protective
measures and take the antivirals. During the last 2 weeks, only few
infection cases were recorded in culling personnel, mostly in persons who
did not apply sufficient protective measures. Taking oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
for extended periods has no drawbacks.
The Municipal Health Services in the relevant regions will provide the
antiviral preparations, as well as flu vaccines, to all those directly
engaged with suspected poultry farms and people coming in direct contact
with infected chickens.
Netherlands maintains an intensive influenza monitoring system which is
engaged -- cooperatively with the practitioners -- in the detection of flu
infections, including avian flu viruses.
On Tue, 15 Apr 2003, the Minister of Agriculture, Nature Management and
Fisheries [LNV] informed you about the detection of antibodies against
avian influenza in pigs in 5 mixed farms in the Gelders Valley. Following
the advise of OMT and BAO (Board of administrators; see footnotes), and
after consultation with NLV, it has been decided to remove pigs from the
relevant farms. This has been already begun in 4 of those farms -- the 5th
to follow.
Further investigations on those farms have shown that no further spread of
the virus has occurred; no influenza virus was detected in any pig.
Investigations on mixed farms where culling [of poultry only?!.- Mod. AS]
had already preventively been carried out, as well as in exclusive-pig
farms, show that spread seems most unlikely. The matter is under further
investigation. The monitoring is continued on mixed farms.
The movement restrictions, applied by LNV in pig farms within the
protection and buffer zones, are to be maintained.

[Obviously, the recent death of a veterinarian involved in the HPAI control
activities, has triggered the final decision to cull pigs on infected mixed
farms. The letter includes additional data on the fatal human case, as well
as new epidemiological data on the situation on pig farms, where
investigations are still continued.
Communicable disease control in the Netherlands is undertaken by municipal
health services (GGD). Coordination between the 54 municipal health
services and the national service has since 1995, been controlled by
Landelijke Coordinatiestructuur voor de Infectieziektenbestrijding (LCI),
which draws up guidelines and coordinates outbreak management. LCI consists
of a professional advisory team (Outbreak Management Team, OMT, consisting
of five permanent members with clinical, microbiological, and public health
backgrounds and sometimes other specialists), a board of administrators
(Bestuurlijk Afstemmings Overleg, BAO), and a small professional helpdesk
(bureau LCI). The OMT advises the Permanent Secretary of Health (Minister
van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport) through the Bestuurlijk Afstemmings
Overleg. Local professional clinical, microbiological, and public health
staff report data and join in the discussions of the OMT. The BAO check
advice for practical feasibility and decide on the policy to be implemented
(under the responsibility of Minister van Volksgezondheid). - Mod.AS]
