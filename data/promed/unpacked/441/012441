SUMMARY
-------
System description
-----------
Influenza surveillance in the WHO European Region is based on nationally organized networks of primary care physicians, mostly general practitioners (GPs), covering at least 1-5 percent of the population in their countries. Depending on the country, physicians report the weekly number of patients seen with ILI or ARI, or both, to the national focal point for influenza surveillance. Primary care surveillance for influenza in the Region is mostly based on sentinel systems (i.e., data are collected and reported only from selected facilities), although some countries collect data on ILI or ARI from all health facilities in the country (universal surveillance). A subset of specimens from sentinel ILI and ARI patients is tested for influenza and RSV infection. In addition, some countries, mainly in the eastern part of the Region, are conducting sentinel surveillance for hospitalized cases presenting with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), according to standard case definitions. Depending on the country, all, or a subset of, SARI patients are tested for influenza virus infection. A subset of countries reports laboratory-confirmed influenza-positive hospitalized cases every week. Case definitions, populations under surveillance and data formats differ among these countries. Most countries also report on additional semiquantitative indicators of intensity, geographic spread and trend of influenza activity at the national level. Table 5 shows the types of surveillance carried out by countries in the WHO European Region.

National influenza centres (NICs) are institutions designated by countries' ministries of health and recognized by WHO to participate in the work of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. NICs receive respiratory specimens from a range of sources in their countries (so-called non-sentinel sources, such as hospital laboratories, outbreaks in schools, nursing homes and similar settings) and provide virological data on the characteristics of circulating influenza viruses according to influenza type and subtype (A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09) or lineage (B/Victoria or B/Yamagata). A large proportion of influenza A viruses from non-sentinel sources is not subtyped, in contrast to viruses from sentinel specimens. In addition, influenza viruses are assessed each season for their antigenic and genetic characteristics to determine the extent of their similarity to the viruses included in the seasonal influenza vaccine. The prevalence of mutations that affect pathogenicity or are associated with reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs is also determined. Furthermore, susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals is assessed by phenotypic tests.

Data are reported at the national level to ECDC and to the WHO Regional Office for Europe through The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on a weekly basis during the influenza surveillance season (week 40 to week 20 of the following year).

Data - Week 13/2015 (23-30 Mar 2015)
-------------------
Influenza activity continued to decrease in most reporting countries, although the proportion of influenza-virus-positive specimens remained high (37 percent). Since week 51/2014 (15 weeks) the positivity rate has been over the threshold of 10 percent, indicating seasonal influenza activity. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses continued to circulate in the WHO European Region, but type B viruses accounted for 70 percent of detections for week 13/2015.

Half of hospitalized influenza cases were reported mainly among people aged 65 years and over. Excess all-cause mortality among people aged 65 years and over, concomitant with increased influenza activity and the predominance of A(H3N2) viruses, has been observed in most countries participating in the European Monitoring of Excess Mortality for Public Health Action (EuroMOMO) project but currently seems to be decreasing in many, but not all countries (see EuroMOMO website).

About 2/3 of the A(H3N2) viruses characterized to date show evidence of antigenic differences from the virus included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. These differences may have contributed to the observed reduction in effectiveness of the A(H3N2) component of the vaccine and to the excess mortality reported among older age groups. The A(H1N1)pdm09 and B components of the vaccine are likely to be effective. There are no indications of reduced sensitivity of influenza A or B viruses to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamavir.
