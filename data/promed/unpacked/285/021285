The world's COVID-19 cases declined last week for the 5th week in a row, but hotspots remain in a handful of countries, especially in Asia, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest weekly update.

Cases declined 5% last week compared to the week before, marking a smaller decline compared with earlier weeks over the past month. Deaths also fell, declining by 8%.

More than 10 million cases were reported to the WHO last week, with South Korea, Germany, Viet Nam, Russia, and Japan reporting the most. There were more than 52 000 new deaths, and the United States continues to report the most COVID-19 fatalities of any country.

In the WHO's Western Pacific region, rising cases were driven by surges in South Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and New Zealand. South Korea today [9 Mar 2022] reported a new record high, with 342 466 new cases, as did Hong Kong, with 58 757 new cases. Elsewhere, China's cases reached a new 2-year high, with 555 new cases, and health officials in Shanghai are battling an uptick in asymptomatic cases by doing mass testing, delaying some large gatherings and shutting some public spaces, according to Reuters (https://news.yahoo.com/shanghai-steps-defences-against-wave-070017082.html).

Of sequenced samples over the past month, 99.7% were the omicron variant, and, of those, 34.2% were the more transmissible BA.2 omicron subvariant. The WHO said its technical advisory group is aware of reports of recombinants of delta and omicron and of BA.1 and BA.2, which it said isn't surprising.

So far, however, sequencing hasn't identified any signs of rapid transmission or changes in illness severity. And only a few recombinant clusters have been reported, with little sign of spread.

At a briefing today [9 Mar 2022], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said though cases and deaths are declining and countries are loosening restrictions, the pandemic is far from over. "The virus continues to evolve, and we continue to face major obstacles in distributing vaccines, tests, and treatments everywhere they are needed," he said (https://bit.ly/3i2uvUw).

Tedros also said the WHO is concerned that several countries have drastically reduced testing, which he says clouds the ability to see where the virus is, how it's spreading, and how it's evolving.

In a related development today [9 Mar 2022], the WHO posted interim guidance on the use of rapid tests, which it says should be offered as part of overall COVID-19 testing services. The guidance addresses implementation considerations, including prioritizing populations, test accessibility, and reporting (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ag-RDTs-Self_testing-2022.1).

[B] Hawaii: mask mandate
Date: Wed 9 Mar 2022

Yesterday [8 Mar 2022] Hawaii became the final US state to announce that indoor mask requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic will end; the step takes effect on 26 Mar 2022. Puerto Rico announced earlier this week that all mask mandates on the island would be ending this week [10 Mar 2022].

New cases of COVID-19 continue to drop across the country. The United States reported 29 805 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [8 Mar 2022] and 1532 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 38 239, with 1398 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker (https://wapo.st/3w3Z0l5). In total, the country has seen 79 385 516 COVID-19 cases in the past 2 years, including 963 079 deaths.

Widespread infection with the omicron variant and vaccination has helped raised immunity in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.6% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.1% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

As the country moves on to the next phase of the pandemic, both the White House and public health experts are touting a test-to-treat program that pairs positive COVID-19 tests with antiviral drugs. Pfizer today [9 Mar 2022] launched a phase 2/3 study of its approved antiviral, Paxlovid, in kids ages 6-17.

"There is a significant unmet need for outpatient treatments that can be taken by children and adolescents to help prevent progression to severe illness, including hospitalization or death," said Mikael Dolsten, chief scientific officer and president of worldwide research, development and medical at Pfizer in a press release (https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-23-study-novel-covid-19-oral).

"Paxlovid is already authorized or approved in many countries around the world, with more than 1.5 million treatment courses delivered thus far and 30 million expected by July [2022] to help combat this devastating disease."

The United States reported more deaths from COVID-19 last Friday [4 Mar 2022] than deaths from Hurricane Katrina, more on any 2 recent weekdays than deaths during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more last month [February 2022] than deaths from flu in a bad season, and more in 2 years than deaths from HIV during the 4 decades of the AIDS epidemic. At least 953 000 Americans have died from COVID, and the true toll is likely even higher because many deaths went uncounted. COVID is now the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, after only heart disease and cancer, which are both catchall terms for many distinct diseases. The sheer scale of the tragedy strains the moral imagination. On 24 May 2020, as the United States passed 100 000 recorded deaths, The New York Times filled its front page with the names of the dead, describing their loss as "incalculable." Now the nation hurtles toward a milestone of one million. What is 10 times incalculable?

Many countries have been pummeled by the coronavirus, but few have fared as poorly as the United States. Its death rate surpassed that of any other large, wealthy nation -- especially during the recent omicron surge. The Biden administration placed all its bets on a vaccine-focused strategy, rather than the multilayered protections that many experts called for, even as America lagged behind other wealthy countries in vaccinating (and boosting) its citizens -- especially elderly people, who are most vulnerable to the virus. In a study of 29 high-income countries, the United States experienced the largest decline in life expectancy in 2020 and, unlike much of Europe, did not bounce back in 2021. It was also the only country whose lowered life span was driven mainly by deaths among people under 60. Dying from COVID robbed each American of about a decade of life on average. As a whole, US life expectancy fell by 2 years -- the largest such decline in almost a century. Neither World War II nor any of the flu pandemics that followed it dented American longevity so badly.

Every American who died of COVID left an average of 9 close relatives bereaved. Roughly 9 million people -- 3% of the population -- now have a permanent hole in their world that was once filled by a parent, child, sibling, spouse, or grandparent. An estimated 149 000 children have lost a parent or caregiver. Many people were denied the familiar rituals of mourning -- bedside goodbyes, in-person funerals. Others are grieving raw and recent losses, their grief trampled amid the stampede toward normal.

After many of the biggest disasters in American memory, including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, "it felt like the world stopped," Lori Peek, a sociologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies disasters, told me. "On some level, we owned our failures, and there were real changes." Crossing one million deaths could offer a similar opportunity to take stock, but "900 000 deaths felt like a big threshold to me, and we didn't pause," Peek said. Why is that? Why were so many publications and politicians focused on reopenings in January and February [2022] -- the 4th- and 5th-deadliest months of the pandemic? Why did the CDC issue new guidelines that allowed most Americans to dispense with indoor masking when at least 1000 people had been dying of COVID every day for almost 6 straight months? If the United States faced half a year of daily hurricanes that each took 1000 lives, it is hard to imagine that the nation would decide to, quite literally, throw caution to the wind. Why, then, is COVID different?

Many aspects of the pandemic work against a social reckoning. The threat -- a virus -- is invisible, and the damage it inflicts is hidden from public view. With no lapping floodwaters or smoking buildings, the tragedy becomes contestable to a degree that a natural disaster or terrorist attack cannot be. Meanwhile, many of those who witnessed COVID's ruin are in no position to discuss it. Healthcare workers are still reeling from "death on a scale I had never seen before," as an intensive-care nurse told me last year [2021]. The bereaved face guilt on top of sadness: "I think about the way it would run through families and tight-knit groups and the huge psychological toll as people think, Am I the one who brought it in?" Whitney Robinson, a social epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me. And though 3% of Americans have lost a close family member to COVID, that means 97% have not. The 2 years that were shaved off of the average life span undid 2 decades of progress in health, but in 2000, "it didn't feel like we were living under a horrible mortality regime," Andrew Noymer, a demographer at UC Irvine, told me. "It felt normal."

No one knows how many people will die from COVID in the coming years. The number will depend on our collective behavior, how many more people can be vaccinated or boosted, the length and strength of immunity, what new variants arise, and more. Andrew Noymer, the demographer, thinks that COVID will kill fewer people per year than it has in the past 2, but will probably still be more lethal than the flu, which sets a plausible and very wide range of somewhere between 50 000 and 500 000 annual deaths. (COVID will also continue to cause long-term disability.)

How much of this extra mortality will the United States accept? The CDC's new guidelines provide a clue. They recommend that protective measures such as indoor masking kick in once communities pass certain thresholds of cases and hospitalizations. But the health-policy experts Joshua Salomon and Alyssa Bilinski calculated that by the time communities hit the CDC's thresholds, they'd be on the path to at least 3 daily deaths per million, which equates to 1000 deaths per day nationally. And crucially, the warning lights would go off too late to prevent those deaths. "As a level of mortality the White House and CDC are willing to accept before calling for more public health protection, this is heartbreaking," Salomon said on Twitter.

An ongoing swab testing study that's been underway for the last 2 years to monitor COVID-19 spread in the United Kingdom revealed that, although cases are declining, they remain at a high level, with signs of a potential increase in older age-groups. The UK REACT study, done by a research team based at Imperial College London, has been tracking disease levels with swab tests.

Public health officials have urged countries to continue population monitoring for COVID-19 to assess who is getting infected and where the virus is spreading. Also, health officials closely watch patterns in Britain and other European countries because their COVID-19 trends have been a harbinger of how outbreaks could unfold elsewhere, including in the United States.

For the latest study, the group analyzed the results of nearly 95 000 swab tests that were conducted across the country from 8 Feb to 1 Mar 2022 (https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/95323/2/REACT_R18_and_SI.pdf). Since the last report that covered roughly January [2022], prevalence of COVID-19 dropped from 4.41% to 2.88%. The researchers noted, however, that, at 2.88%, prevalence is still high -- at the 2nd-highest level since the study began in March 2020.

Their analysis of genetic sequences from 1195 samples showed that all but one was the omicron variant, and, as of 21 Feb 2022, they estimate that nearly half (47.2%) were the BA.2 subvariant, which is more transmissible than the parent omicron virus. In their last report, released in late January [2022], they found that only 6 sequences were BA.2 (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233381/fall-coronavirus-infections-england-have-stalled/).

Infection rates varied by age and region, and the team noted that levels were flat or possibly rising in people ages 55 and older. Also, the team saw high infection rates in London, followed by the southwest.

Jenny Harries, MD, chief executive of the UK's Health Security Agency, said in a statement that the data confirm that cases have declined since the omicron peak. "However, the increasing presence of the BA.2 sub-lineage of omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over 55 shows that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID-19 circulating at high levels."

Paul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, who directs the REACT program at Imperial College London, said the possibility that infections are rising in older adults indicates that a high number of infections will lead to more illnesses, even though the group is highly vaccinated. "So it's important that people continue to follow public health guidance to avoid fueling further spread of the virus."

Surges continue in omicron hot spots: Hong Kong leaders appear to be stepping back from mass testing as part of handling its surge of cases, with more than 31 402 cases and 180 deaths reported today [10 Mar 2022]. Chief Executive Carrie Lam today said Hong Kong won't lift its ban on flights from 9 countries and reopen the city until its surge is under control, according to Reuters (https://reut.rs/3t2mNjl).

China's rise in COVID-19 activity continues, with 402 more local symptomatic cases reported as well as 435 more local asymptomatic infections, according to the National Health Commission. The largest portion were from Jilin province, which had 165 of the symptomatic cases and 179 of the asymptomatic cases (http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-03/10/c_85882.htm).

In Germany, cases topped 250 000 for the 1st time during the pandemic, according to Deutsche Welle, which said the coalition government has settled on new COVID measures to replace ones that expire on 19 Mar 2022. The new ones include basic steps such as masking on public transport and limiting regular testing to nursing homes and other vulnerable settings, though states can institute other measures if they experience future spikes (https://www.dw.com/en/germany-new-daily-covid-19-infections-pass-250000-for-first-time/a-61075687).

New Zealand, which is experiencing its worst surge, is feeling COVID-19 pressure on doctor's offices and hospitals, according to Radio New Zealand, which said general practice clinic workload has increased 50% and patient loads at Auckland hospitals are already above their worst-case scenarios (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/463054/watch-live-covid-19-briefing-it-is-still-going-to-be-messy-for-the-next-couple-of-weeks).

The House of Representatives failed to include a USD 15 billion coronavirus pandemic package when it approved a USD 1.5 trillion spending bill yesterday [9 Mar 2022], signaling a major setback for the Biden administration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a separate COVID relief bill will be introduced, The Hill reports (https://thehill.com/homenews/house/597589-pelosi-says-separate-coronavirus-relief-bill-will-be-put-on-the-floor).

For weeks the administration has petitioned lawmakers to increase funding for pandemic-related relief packages, but the war in Ukraine and plummeting case counts have pushed the pandemic to the political back burner. The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 37 685, with 1369 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

In related news, a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) shows that 40% to 60% of Americans missed work during the omicron surge, and 6 of 10 Americans who earn USD 40 000 or less a year reported missing work owing to the most recent surge of the virus. Twenty percent of those polled said missing work had a significant impact on family finances.

As the nation enters the 3rd year of the pandemic, many companies continue to change pandemic policies. United Airlines, one of the 1st major companies to announce vaccine mandates last summer [2021], announced it will allow workers who haven't been vaccinated against COVID-19 for religious or medical reasons to return at the end of the month [March 2022], the Wall Street Journal reports (https://on.wsj.com/3tSo6AC).
