Penang has reported 2 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the locality of Sungai Bakap, Seberang Prai Selatan.

The last time authorities detected JE in Penang was in 2018.

For the uninitiated, JE is caused by a type of virus related to dengue and is spread in a similar manner too, via mosquitoes. There is no cure for JE, but safe and effective vaccines are available.

According to the World Health Organization, common symptoms of JE are mild, and include fever and headache without any other apparent symptoms. However, the fatality rate can be as high as 30% (compare that to the fatality rate of Covid-19 which is just 1.4%)

About 20-30% of survivors suffer from permanent intellectual, behavioural, or neurological effects, including paralysis, seizures or the inability to speak.

In children, JE symptoms can include stomachaches and vomiting. Severe JE is characterised by high fever, headaches, disorientation, coma, and seizures, among other scary symptoms.

In the past, Malaysia has had one JE scare in 1998 when the Nipah virus outbreak occurred in the country. At the time, authorities 1st thought that JE was the cause of infection. This affected deployment of effective control measures to prevent the spread of the Nipah virus before it was identified by a local virologist.

Speaking of the current rise in cases, the Penang state Health Department said that all health facilities in the state have been put on alert to track down new JE cases and put a halt to the outbreak, especially around the Sungai Bakap locality and Seberang Prai Selatan district.

In an effort to do this, staff from the Seberang Prai Selatan Health Office will begin active case detection through house-to-house visits within the area.

The Health Department will also be tracking down individuals who have reported any fever and neurological symptoms since 12 May [2020]. These symptoms include headaches, fainting, disorientation, coma, paralysis, loss of coordination and cramps.

The State Health Department is advising the public to do their part to stop the spread of the disease by keeping your housing area clean through gotong-royong activities [an activity, usually cleaning a place together as a community, such as with neighbors, schools, etc.], and to adopt the 3C concept: Avoid crowded and confined spaces and close conversation.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is endemic in peninsular Malaysia, including Penang, and cases occur sporadically there. In 2014, a student from Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Selamat in Tasek Gelugor, Penang was admitted to the hospital after being infected with the JE virus.

Because sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) occur in Penang and the rest of Malaysia, vaccination is the best preventive measure. Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Peninsular Malaysia is well within the JE virus endemic area. Control of vector mosquitoes is difficult. Elimination of breeding sites around buildings and avoidance of mosquito bites are prudent preventive measures. However, because vector mosquito control over large areas is difficult and expensive, vaccination is perhaps the most effective measure to prevent cases of JE.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts. - Mod.TY
