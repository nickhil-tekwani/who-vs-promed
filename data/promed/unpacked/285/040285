Low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] has been detected in a poultry
farm with some 28 000 chickens, in Deurne. This mild version hardly
makes birds sick and is not dangerous to humans. It is a variant of
H7 and not the H5N1 strain, mainly prevalent in Asia, which is
dangerous to humans. To be on the safe side, the infected holding
will be culled today [Sun 16 May 2010] and precautionary measures
undertaken within a zone of about 3 km around the infected farm.

Any transport of poultry and live birds, hatching and table eggs,
litter and manure is prohibited from, to and within the zone. All
poultry should be kept indoors.

The transport of mammals (including cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and
horses) is banned as long as such animals originate from
poultry-keeping holdings or are intended for entering such holdings.

Fairs, markets, exhibitions and other gatherings of poultry or other
captive birds are prohibited within the zone. Visitors' entrance into
commercial poultry plants is restricted. By commercial companies, the
visiting rules are in force.

There are 20 other poultry farms within the said zone. These farms
will be screened during the coming days. In addition, premises which
may have had contact during the recent period with the infected farm
will be investigated.
