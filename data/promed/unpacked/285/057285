Shizuoka Prefecture announced on [Fri 18 Oct 2019], that one wild boar whose dead body was found in Fujieda City was [confirmed as] infected with [classical] swine fever [CSF]. This is the 1st CSF case in the prefecture Shizuoka since the start of the event in September 2018. The prefecture has begun preparations for vaccination of all pig farms in the prefecture.

According to the prefecture, the dead boar was found by a passerby on the road of Nodazawa, Okabe-cho, Fujieda City on [17 Oct 2019]. The prefecture's genetic test gave a positive result on the same day, and it was confirmed on [18 Oct 2019] by the national examination. No other infection has been confirmed in 120 pig farms in the prefecture.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries added Shizuoka Prefecture, on [18 Oct 2019], as a "recommended area" for vaccination. The prefecture has also started creating a program to check the procedures for inoculation.

[Since the start of the CSF epizootic in Japan, 1267 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, most of them in wild boars (a total of 1264 animals, of which 387 found dead, confirmed as infected). From the wild boars, CSF spread to domestic pig farms (40 of them, so far). A summary of the event since its start on 3 Sep 2018, links to the 38 reports, and a map presenting all outbreaks in domestic pigs and wild boar, updated 11 Oct 2019, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27871 (zoom in on the map for the required resolution). The outbreak in Shizuoka will be added to the map when notified to the OIE.

The CSF epizootic has earlier spread to 10 prefectures in Honshu, Japan's main island: Aichi, Fukui, Gifu, Ishikawa, Nagano, Niigata, Shizuoka, Toyama, Yamanashi and Saitama. For a map presenting Japan's regions and prefectures, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan.

Reportedly, vaccination of wild boar by oral vaccine baits has been introduced to the affected regions earlier this year (20190223.6333082, 20190330.6395122). Details on the outcome of the project in field conditions will be useful.

In September 2019, in view of the continuing CSF spread into hitherto uninfected prefectures, including commercial farms, the Japanese authorities revised their non-vaccination policy in domestic pigs. Vaccination against CSF affects export due to international animal-health requirements, but Japan is a major importer of pork. During 2018, it imported the highest dollar value worth of pork globally, estimated USD 4.4 billion (15.5% of world's total pork imports; http://www.worldstopexports.com/international-markets-for-imported-pork-by-country/). - Mod.AS
