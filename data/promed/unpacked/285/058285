Recently, two European Commission Decisions of December 31st, 1997
(97/878/EC) and January, 16th 1998 (98/84/EC) banned import of fresh fish
and restricted import of fish products to the European market from four
countries from East Africa due to an on-going cholera epidemic. Today
(March 25th), FAO issued a press release based on a technical note on
cholera and fish trade. FAO's position is in line with that released
recently by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the same topic. The EC
Decisions will be remain in force until the end of June 1998.

Press release : PR98-21E
FAO: IMPORT BAN ON FISH PRODUCTS FROM
AFRICA NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE ANSWER
Brussels, 25 March - The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
considers a ban on fish exports from East African countries affected by
cholera -not the most appropriate response,- the organization said in a
statement released today, asking instead for improvements in good hygiene,
safe water supply, fish processing and storage.
Epidemiological data suggest that the risk of transmission of cholera from
contaminated imported fish is negligible. Only rare and sporadic cases of
cholera have occurred in developed countries as a result of eating fish
transported across international borders by individuals,- FAO said.
The World Health Organization has not documented a significant outbreak of
cholera resulting from commercially imported food, according to FAO. The UN
Agency noted that the Cholera bacteria does not survive proper cooking or
drying, and cooked, dried or canned products are considered safe with
regard to cholera transmission.
Introducing import restrictions on fish products from affected countries
will not prevent the transmission of cholera but will disturb international
trade and may encourage illegal trade, posing a potentially higher threat
to consumers,- FAO added.
The European Union (EU) imposed a ban on fresh fish imports from several
African states in late December and will review it by the end of June. It
currently affects Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique. The ban, which
followed a cholera epidemic sweeping much of East Africa in recent months,
did not affect frozen fish. Frozen fish can be sold if shipments are free
of Cholera and Salmonella bacteria, both of which can cause illness. At
present the EU requires frozen fish products from East Africa to be checked
at ports of entry to control possible microbial contamination. FAO pointed
out that microbiological testing of end products has serious limitations as
a control option.
The best way to ensure food safety and quality and freedom from pathogenic
micro- organisms is by applying internationally recommended preventive
measures and good hygiene and manufacturing practices, FAO said,
recommending better control of the safety of water supply to fish
processing factories of exporting countries and better monitoring of health
conditions and the hygiene practices of personnel handling and processing
fish products.
FAO called on fish-exporting countries to upgrade their landing, processing
and storage facilities and said donor countries and international
organisations should increase their assistance in achieving this goal. FAO
for many years has assisted developing countries in adopting effective food
quality and safety programmes. A Technical Co-operation Project is being
prepared by FAO to assist these four countries to deal with food safety
problems associated with the Cholera outbreaks.
The [fish exports of Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda and Tanzania to the EU
amounted to around 55,000 tonnes in 1996 worth $230 million. The EU is
their most important market for these products.
