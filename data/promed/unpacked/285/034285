A case of yellow fever was confirmed in the northern district of Agago
---------------------------------------------------------------
In Agago, district officials say, despite a mass vaccination against yellow fever [virus] in the past year [2011], the disease has reoccurred. The deadly disease, which doctors say can kill in one week, is recurring in Uganda after almost 40 years. It was last in Uganda in 1972.

The patient, admitted to Dr. Ambrosoli Hospital in Kalongo on 24 Sep [2012], was earlier suspected to be carrying Ebola virus but he instead tested positive for yellow fever.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected female mosquitoes.

Patients experience fever, muscle and back pain, headache, shivering, loss of appetite and vomiting. Some of the patients develop yellow eyes, abdominal pain and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes and stomach.

Dr. Emmanuel Otto, the Agago district Director of Health Officer (DHO) said, "The single case should not be treated as an outbreak, but we are still investigating, it should not panic the population," Dr Otto said. He said a verification team has already been sent to monitor any new cases.

[Although the population should not panic as Dr. Otto suggested, the risk of a significant yellow fever (YF) outbreak should not be underestimated. The concern is that there may be other cases, as yet undetected or in the incubation period and not yet showing signs of infection.

The rapid response to the situation by district health authorities is commendable. The statement that Uganda has not had YF cases in 40 years is not correct. In 2010-2011, there was an outbreak in this same area with 224 cases and 53 deaths beginning in the Abim and Agago districts, with later spread to Kitgum and other 10 districts in northern Uganda (see ProMED-mail citations below). At that time, the Uganda Ministry of Health planned a massive YF vaccination campaign in the area. If that campaign was successful, one hopes that the risk of ongoing YF virus transmission is very low, and no additional cases will occur.

ProMED will be interested in further developments concerning the YF situation there, if any additional cases do occur. - Mod.TY]
