ProMED-mail would like to thank Charles Chambers <ayo6@CDC.GOV> for
pointing out that while the report of this outbreak of sodium nitrite
poisoning was issued by the Kyrgyzstan consulate general's office in Alma
Aty, and involved Kyrgyzstani citizens, the actual location of this
outbreak was in a town near Alma Aty (Alma Ati) in Kazakhstan.
ProMED-mail apologizes for any inconvenience caused by this error.
