Mallard ducks in Maryland have tested positive for bird flu, apparently a
common, less pathogenic strain that poses no risk to humans, the United
States Agriculture and Interior departments said on Friday.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus was found in fecal samples from "resident
wild" mallards in Queen Anne's County in Maryland, on the US central
Atlantic coast.
"Testing has ruled out the possibility of this being the highly pathogenic
H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe and Africa," said
the United States Department of Agriculture. "Test results thus far
indicate this is low pathogenic avian influenza, which poses no risk to
human health."
Five to 10 more days will be needed for definitive tests to confirm whether
low pathogenic H5N1 bird flu was found in the US for the 2nd time in 2006.
On 14 Aug 2006, the virus was found in 2 mute swans in Michigan. Scientists
say low pathogenic avian influenza commonly occurs in wild fowl.
The Maryland mallards did not appear sick so the samples, collected on 2
Aug 2006 as part of a research project, were not given high priority when
sent to USDA labs for testing. "The birds are alive and well," said a USDA
spokeswoman.
The low pathogenic strain of H5N1 has been found 6 other times in the US
since 1975. Mild and low pathogenic strains of bird flu are common in the
US and other countries.
The H5N1 bird flu strain has killed an estimated 141 people and forced
hundreds of millions of birds to be destroyed, mostly in Asia. As a
precaution, the US government stepped up testing of wild birds for avian
influenza in the continental US this year.

[Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) strains vary by a number of amino
acids. Although there can be mutations, it is rare that the normal low
cycling of LPAI alters to be highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). It
is also good to know that the surveillance is being done, and the results
reported. - Mod.TG]
