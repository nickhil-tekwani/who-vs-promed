[The previous ASF event started in July 2015. For this event, one outbreak was detected and was resolved on 22 Sep 2015. The final report for this event was submitted to the OIE on 23 Mar 2016 (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=19900). Although this event has been reported as resolved, it does appear that ASF virus continues to circulate in that part of the country. The current outbreak is located in the Kiambu district, the same district where the previous outbreak was identified. This district is located in the Central Province of Kenya. See map of Kenya at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/kenya_map2.htm.

ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect [human] public health. - Mod.CRD
