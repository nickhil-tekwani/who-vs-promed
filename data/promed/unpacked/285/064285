Six more anthrax cases detected in Koraput village
--------------------------------------------------
With 6 fresh cases reported on Thursday [25 Jun 2015], the number people affected by anthrax at Biriguda village in Laxmipur block [Koraput district, Odisha state] has gone up to 12. On Monday [22 Jun 2015], 2 persons died of the disease. "We have shifted one patient to Koraput district headquarters hospital as his condition deteriorated. Others are being treated in the villages by our mobile health units," said additional district health officer (public health), Koraput, Anand Kumar Padhi.

According to sources, the affected villagers killed a sick cow few days ago and consumed its meat which might have led to the outbreak of the disease. "During our visit we found around 30 villages had consumed the meat of a dead cow. The patients developed abnormal swellings and boils on their body and they have been given medicine by our team," said Padhi.

On Thursday [25 Jun 2015], a special team of health officials arrived in the village from Laxmipur to treat the patients and monitor the situation. Fresh cases of anthrax have sparked off a debate on the effectiveness of the administration's strategy to contain the disease.

"Each year fresh cases are reported in the district. Vaccination of cattle has not started except in a couple of blocks. The awareness drive against the disease is a non-starter. Except for blaming the lifestyle of the tribals, the officials concerned do nothing to counter the disease," said Prasant Tripathy, a Jeypore-based social campaigner.

Officials said we are creating awareness among people through posters and wall paintings not to consume the meat of dead and sick cattle. "Information, education and communication programmes against the disease has been launched. The veterinary department has been asked to vaccinate all the cattle," Padhi said.

[This ongoing epidemic of human anthrax reflects a global problem. Rural folk in 3rd world countries are poor. They might see meat on their plate maybe twice a year. Therefore a moribund animal is a financial problem -- loss of livestock capital -- but why not consume it and make the best of a bad situation? And the Indians have shown that these communities develop over time a measure of immunity to gastrointestinal anthrax. Death is not guaranteed. So they slaughter, butcher, and eat these animals. And the worse the cooking the more likely the meat is somewhat over-cooked and the pathogen killed in the pot. But cases do occur, either in the handling or the eating, and people die. And the only way to protect these rural populations is by vaccinating their livestock, not lecturing them. Many public health and veterinary services have yet to learn this. - Mod.MHJ
