Another chikungunya outbreak has been laboratory confirmed in this region
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been a chikungunya health emergency in Kebumen Regency. The

namely the Jintung Village, Kalibangkang and Watukelir.

The number of residents who have been attacked by the illness reached
hundreds of people. In the Argosari Village and Jintung, the number
of sufferers chikungunya [virus infection] that have been detected

around 50 people are suspected of having been affected by chikungunya [virus].

The Kebumen Regional Government, through the Health Service, stated

Argosari Village, was [designated] an extraordinary incident [emergency].

Health officials are following up by carrying out various steps,
including wide-spread mass medical treatment, fumigation (fogging)
and counselling of local villagers as well as a demonstration of
abate [application of larvacide] that was carried out symbolically by
the Regent. A previous entomological investigation was carried
out. Results of that survailence found mosquito breeding sites in
this location.

The Head of the Health Service doctor, HA Dwi Budi Satrio MKes said,
"After the blood samples were sent to the Hall of the Health
Laboratory in Yogyakarta, positive results for chikungunya were
received. This was done to be able to confirm that a chikungunya
outbreak had occurred in Argosari Village," said Budi Satrio.

The head of the Field Control for Health Problems, Kusbiyantoro SKM
MKes, added, "This is just the 1st time that an outbreak of
chikungunya has occurred in Kebumen. There has not been a report of
cases of chikungunya before."

As for the risk factor, most residents have created pools when the
rainy season arrived, which provided a place for expansion of
mosquito breeding sites," said Kusbiyantoro.

Regent Kebumen KH Nashirudin Am made a plea to the residents to
continue to actively eradicate mosquito breeding sites, because, that
was a very effective way to combat illnesses [viruses] that are
spread by mosquitoes, such as [that of] chikungunya and dengue fever.

detected since 30 Nov 2008. The amount [of cases] continued to
increase and spread. Moreover information that was received by the
Independent Voice CyberNews indicated that the same [chikungunya
virus] cases have emerged in the Jabres Village in the Sruweng
Subdistrict. However this situation, according to Kusbiyantoro, has
not yet been reported officially to the Kesehatan Service.
