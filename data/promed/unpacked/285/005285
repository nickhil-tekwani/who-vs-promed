Survival rates are low in the current European atypical myopathy
outbreak, according to an alert group led by Belgian researchers.

To date, at least 49 horses have died from the disease, as opposed to
only 4 confirmed survivals in a total of 83 reported cases, said Gaby
van Galen, DVM, MSc, Dipl. ECEIM, a primary researcher for the
Atypical Myopathy Alert Group (AMAG) at the University of Liege.
"We're still waiting for information about the others," she said.

France continues to have the vast majority of reported cases at 61.
The United Kingdom is now reporting 7 cases and Germany 4. The
Netherlands has at least 3 but will be sending in more files soon,
van Galen said. Belgium and Switzerland both have 3 cases each, and
Sweden has only had one report so far.

The survival rate at this time is only 5 percent, based on the
statistics of the reported data. The previous epidemic ended in
December 2009 with a survival rate of 22 percent.

"This is a lower survival percentage than last autumn [2009], at
least for the moment," van Galen said. "But this is no reason to
panic right away. Cases keep on being reported, and we are still
waiting on complementary information for several. So this percentage
might still change over time."

European horse owners are urged to follow preventive methods to
protect their horses, according to van Galen and her research
partner, Dominique Votion, DVM, PhD. These include keeping at-risk
horses indoors, ensuring regular vaccinations and deworming, and
providing concentrated nutritional supplements. More information is
available at the AMAG website.

[According to the Atypical Myopathy Alert Group web site
<http://www.myopathieatypique.be/fr/produit.php?sscategorieID=50>:

"Equine Atypical Myopathy, also called Atypical Myoglobinuria, is a
frequently fatal condition affecting grazing horses in autumn and/or
spring. The clinical signs of this myopathy seem to appear after
typical climatic conditions. The condition has been recognised for
the 1st time in 1984 and since then, several clinical cases have been
described in different countries in Europe. Belgium was confronted
with the disease for the 1st time during the year 2000. In France the
1st cases have been described in the autumn of 2002.

For the moment, the cause (aetiology) of atypical myopathy remains
unknown. After analysing the information obtained since autumn 2000,
several hypotheses proved valuable and others were rejected.

The most probable hypothesis concerning the aetiology of atypical
myopathy is the one incriminating a toxin (phytotoxin, mycotoxin or
bacterial toxin), eaten and absorbed directly or produced in situ.
The intoxication with accidental ingestion of food destined for other
species (for example, food for cattle that may contain antibiotics
responsible for severe myopathies in the horse) and the intoxication
with toxic substances in fertilizers or weed killers were rejected
based on the collected information.

The hypothesis of a nutritional myopathy (due to vitamin E/selenium
insufficiency) is not likely as a primary cause, but it cannot be
excluded that a synergic action between a nutritional insufficiency
and a certain toxin can result in a specific metabolic problem as
atypical myopathy.

Atypical myopathy can be suspected when a horse that lives most of
the time on pasture shows one or more of the following clinical
signs: - weakness, - horse found laying on the grass (or dead), -
difficulty to get up, - dark colored urine, - stiffness, - red or
purple mucosae, - depressed, - muscle tremors - difficulty to stay
standing, - difficulty or inability to walk, - increased heart rate -
difficulty to breath, - sudation, - hypothermia, - colic, - horse
that still wants to eat.

At the clinical exam of a horse suffering from atypical myopathy,
tachycardia (abnormal high heart rate), polypnea, (abnormal high
respiratory rate), and/or dyspnea (difficulty to breath), more
expiratory distress than inspiratory distress (difficulty to exhale),
myoglobinuria (production of abnormal dark colored urine), injected
or cyanotic mucous membranes and hypothermia (rectal temperature too
low, i.e. under 37 C) are in general encountered. Gut sounds are
usually normal.

In a horse suffering from atypical myopathy, the results of the
haematology (determination of each cell population usually found in
the blood) are quite inconsistent: some confirmed cases have a normal
haematology, whereas some others present an abnormal increase of
white blood cells due to an excess of neutrophils. The haematology
doesn't help a lot in the diagnosis of atypical myopathy but has to
be performed for a complete differential diagnosis.

When muscle destruction occurs, enzymes, which are normally present
in the muscle cells in important amounts, are released and can be
measured in the blood. The activity of these enzymes in the blood
reflects the importance of the muscle destruction. [There is] a
spectacular increase of the serum activity of creatine kinase (CK)
and of other enzymes present in muscles in significant quantity (i.e.
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Literature suggests the presence of significant muscle destruction
when the activity of the CK is 10 000 IU/L (normal value: 50-200
IU/L). When the increase is about 1000, the muscle destruction can be
considered as minor (a 3 to 5 times increase of the superior normal
value corresponds to a destruction of about 20 g of muscle). Some
laboratories aren't able to give an exact value of the CK activity,
and the information will correspond to the detection limit of their
analyser (e.g.: "CK is higher than 2000 IU/L"). Making a good
differential diagnosis can be difficult with these insufficiently
precise values. In fact, when a horse is laying down for a few hours
due to another disease process, his CK value can be around 1000 IU/L."

Presently, it sounds like there is not nearly enough known about this
disease, but it does appear to be different from equine exertional
rhabdomyolysis (ER), or tying up, or Azoturia, or Monday morning
disease. In ER, these horses have been worked and are now allowed to
rest while ingesting the same "hot" working ration. With atypical
myopathy, horses already at rest experience signs.

We certainly hope answers will be found soon.
