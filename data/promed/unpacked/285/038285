Fleas in Arizona have tested positive for the plague and could spread the deadly disease to humans, according to officials.

The plague, which famously killed millions of Europeans during the Black Death, is most commonly carried by fleas and rodents. Prairie dog deaths at Picture Canyon in Arizona alerted officials to the possibility of an outbreak.

Fleas from the preserve near a water treatment plant in Flagstaff were found to carry the illness.

Human cases have developed from close contact with cats who have preyed on infected vermin, and residents in the Southwest have been warned about dangers of the disease while camping.

The Southwestern US is similar to the plains of Central Asia where plague began, Professor David Wagner of Northern Arizona University told the Arizona Daily Sun.

Plague is still contracted by as many as 2000 people a year, according to the World Health Organization, though the vast majority of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar.

Prairie dogs are particularly susceptible to illness because they live in social burrows, and 90 percent of the furry creatures' colony can eventually be wiped out if plague infects one member. The disease's rodent host dies, when fleas will look for more blood to feed on, including from people.

Insecticide has been sprayed in prairie dog burrows in Picture Canyon to halt the plague's spread.

Clinical signs in humans include fever, chills and muscle pain. At later stages the disease causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to 7 days.

Modern medications are effective in fighting bacterium that causes plague, _Yersinia pestis_, though it can be deadly if left untreated.

The last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Plague originally came to North America via rodents on steamships from Asia.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infected fleas. Though the bacterium is not native to North America, when it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice have been suggested as reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. Dogs and cats may bring infected fleas to their homes, so flea control is advised for pets and the house environment.
