The number of patients with syphilis has been increasing in Hiroshima Prefecture since the mid-2010s. In 2021, medical institutions reported 185 patients, the highest number since 1999, when the current tabulation based on the Infectious Diseases Control Law began.

From the beginning of January (2022), the number of people reported for two months has risen to 75, exceeding last year's [2021's] rate. Medical personnel warn that "it is not an overseas or old illness".

[The total number of cases of syphilis in Japan has risen each year since 2010 and exceeded 1000 in 2013 for the first time since current statistics began in 1999; of the total cases in 2013, 95% were men, presumed to be men who have sex with men (MSM), similar to the situation in the US and other countries at the time (ProMED post Syphilis - Japan: increased incidence, MSM 20140412.2400101).

In 2015, the total number of syphilis cases continued to increase to 2037 cases (as of October 2015) from 1617 cases in 2014, but the number of cases in women also began to rise rapidly: of the 2037 cases, men accounted for 1463 (72%) and women 574 (28%); 437 (76%) of the female cases were of child-bearing age [15 to 35 years] (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/24/national/science-health/syphilis-cases-rise-sharply-japan-especially-among-women/). The increase in the incidence of syphilis in women of childbearing age was associated with a rising incidence of congenital syphilis in Japan (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif).

The total cases of syphilis increased in each subsequent year, with 4575 total cases in 2016, 5826 in 2017, 7007 in 2018, 6577 in 2019, and 6923 cases in 2020. From the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) table, in recent years, about 70% of the total cases of syphilis each year in Japan were cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the most contagious stages of syphilis (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif).

We are not told in the news report above the demographic characteristics of the affected population in Hiroshima Prefecture, the geographic distribution of cases within the prefecture, the stages of syphilis in the reported cases, or the factors contributing to the increase in cases. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The city of Hiroshima (estimated population about 1.2 million residents in 2019) is the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture (about 2.8 million residents in 2019) in the ChÅ«goku region of western Honshu, the largest and most populous main island of Japan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima).
