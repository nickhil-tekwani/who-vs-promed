The Saudi authorities on Monday [2 Aug 2021] returned a ship loaded with more than 7000 head of sheep to Sudan.

Sudanese livestock exports to Arab countries face major problems, especially those heading to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA], which insists on an adequate vaccination rate against Rift Valley fever [RVF]. This has [caused] the economically stricken country a loss of millions of dollars.

Reliable sources in the Sudanese livestock sector told the "Sudan Tribune" on Monday that "the Saudi authorities returned the 'Mabrouka 10' ship, which was carrying 7853 head of sheep."

This is the 5th shipment returned by the Saudi authorities after the resumption of exports between the 2 countries in January [2021]. The sources indicated that the ship was returned for violation of health requirements and the presence of immune bodies for foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] after samples were taken and sent to the laboratory.

In early May [2021], the Saudi authorities returned the 'Mabrouka 11' ship, carrying 7228 sheep and 114 camels to Sudanese ports, for violation of the requirements of the efficiency of vaccination for Rift Valley fever.

On [10 Mar 2021], the Saudi authorities returned a ship carrying more than 13 000 head of sheep, also due to lack of immunity. The Saudi authorities stipulate that livestock immunity should not be less than 40%.

At the beginning of the same month, the Saudi authorities returned the ship 'Al-Baraka 7' with a load of 9000 head of sheep to Sudanese ports due to the animals' lack of immunity, days after returning the ship for the same reason.

In mid-February [2021], the Saudi authorities returned to Sudan a shipment of 5155 head of sheep, more than a month after the resumption of exports between the 2 countries.

Statistics for exporters estimate that over 40 ships have been returned by the Saudi authorities during the last period.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF), named after the site of the initial identification of the virus in Kenya (1931), has been known for decades to circulate exclusively in Africa's sub-Saharan countries and in Sudan. In 1977, RVF spread for the first time into Egypt, causing a major epidemic, severely affecting humans and animals. Its first spread beyond Africa took place in September 2000, when it caused an epidemic in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It was suspected that the RVF virus had been introduced into the Arabian peninsula in 1997/1998 during an RVF epidemic in East Africa, via the introduction of infected imported livestock or windborne infected mosquitoes, and that climatic conditions promoted sufficient vector populations to support transmission in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

In animals, the vectorborne RVF virus, causes outbreaks of abortions and deaths of young livestock (predominantly sheep, goats, and cattle). Exacerbations occur following rainy periods. Humans become infected from contact with infected tissues of livestock, and less frequently from mosquito bites.

Sudan, a major exporter of animals for slaughter to Saudia and other Middle Eastern countries, suffered its most recent RVF outbreak, in its Red Sea and River Nile states, in late 2019. This was followed by export restrictions in the importing countries (see 20191019.6736571, 20191025.6745546). The subsequent renewal of veterinary import permits by the latter included a requirement that all exported animals, on top of being selected from unaffected regions, should be vaccinated against RVF before their loading. As it appears from the media report, the Saudi authorities rejected several consignments due to "violation of the requirements of the efficiency of RVF vaccination" and "lack of immunity" (which "should not be less than 40%"). It will be helpful to note what period, before embarkation, was required for the vaccination being applied, and which tests and criteria have been used to check the animals' immunity status.

Details about the requirements related to FMD will be appreciated as well. - Mod.AS
