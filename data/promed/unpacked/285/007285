[In 1999 a massive fish-kill around islands of the southern Caribbean was
traced to the bacterium _Streptococcus iniae_, which was previously known
to infect only freshwater fish in the Amazon. Outflows of fresh water from
the Orinoco as a result of unusually heavy rainfall brought not only silt
and extra fresh water but also the bacteria -- to Trinidad, Barbados,
Grenada, and St Vincent. In the past 2 weeks more fish are dying off the
east coast of Barbados and this has again been traced to _S. iniae_. - Mod.TG
The fish kill on the east coast is continuing and officials say it is
concentrated off Skeete's Bay, St Philip. Preliminary laboratory tests show
the dead fish were infected with _Streptococcus iniae_, the same bacteria
that killed thousands of fish in the southern Caribbean in 1999. Unlike 2
years ago, however, this kill was localized only on reefs off Skeete's Bay
and no other island in the southern Caribbean was affected.
The only fish affected were reef fish such as trunk fish, soap fish, chubs
(parrot fish), pawgies, and pilchards. Some of the dead fish from Skeete's
Bay was being washed ashore at Consett Bay and Bath, St John. "This is a
low-level impact, with just a trickle washing ashore and nowhere near the
thousands which died last time," said one official. Sources said since the
bacteria arrived from the Orinoco in 1999, they remained present and were
triggered by environmental stress.
The exact stress was still being investigated, but officials believe a
higher-than-normal seawater temperature was a strong possibility. Water
temperatures are being measured as one theory triggering the bacterial
stress and growth. A task force of key government agencies [has been
convened to deal with the matter, including the Fisheries Division, the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Coastal Zone Management Unit, the Ministry of
Health, the National Conservation Commission, and the Natural Resource
Management Programme of the University of the West Indies.
Sources said since the bacteria remained, key issues facing officials
included: whether these fish-kills would become cyclic events triggered by
environmental factors; what were the possible environmental triggers; which
reefs they were likely to affect; and to what extent should this be
factored into the economic life of Barbados.
