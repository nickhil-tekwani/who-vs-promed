Uganda: livestock disease hits Isingiro
---------------------------------------
Foot and mouth [disease, FMD], a deadly cattle disease locally known as
Ejjwa, has broken out in Isingiro, the district veterinary officer, Dr
Bruhan Kasozi, has said. "The disease crossed with the infected cattle in
Karagwe district in northern Tanzania to Endiizi and Mbale sub-counties in
Bukanga County (near) the Uganda-Tanzania border," he said.
Speaking to The New Vision on phone on Thursday [24 Jan 2008], Dr Kasozi
said they had imposed a quarantine on cattle and stopped livestock markets
in the district so as to contain the disease. "Besides, we have ordered for
60 000 doses of vaccine from the ministry (of agriculture) to carry out
massive vaccination," he said.
Dr Kasozi added that they had asked the Tanzanian authorities to also close
their livestock markets but this had not been done, thereby leading to the
spread of the disease to Uganda. "We closed our 2 livestock markets here
but Ndyabatuura market in Karagwe is still operating. We asked the Tanzania
authorities to shift it at least 15kms [9.3 miles] inland but they did
not," he said.
According to the state minister for animal industry, Major Bright
Rwamirama, anybody found transporting cattle without a permit would be
jailed for 7 years. He said besides affecting the country's trade in the
international market, the disease had led to low production of milk and meat.
Dr Kasozi said traders transporting cattle illegally would pay a sh2m fine
[USD 1170.00]. But he added that corruption at the border was affecting
enforcement of the fine. "Some police officers take bribes to allow
infected cattle cross to Uganda."

[Concerns about the possible spread of FMD from neighbouring Tanzania have
been expressed by Ugandan experts previously; see posting 20080113.0159.
According to the data of the World reference laboratory for FMD at
Pirbright, the disease is endemic in Uganda with the following serotypes
identified (in brackets, year of last occurrence): O (2006), A (2002), C
(1971), SAT1 (1999), SAT2 (2002), SAT3 (1997; only in African buffalo).
A laboratory confirmation of the disease, including the subtyping of the
FMD virus involved, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
