Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [Mon 21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.
- The next scheduled SIA activity will take place at the beginning of November [2017], using bOPV [bivalent oral polio vaccine - contains OPV1 and OPV3. - Mod.MPP] vaccine to protect over 10 million children under the age of 5 years from polio.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- In Chad, the AVADAR project is being introduced in the Hadjar Lamis region. This is a mobile-based surveillance application developed by eHealth Africa, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, WHO, and Novel-T, which allows users to easily report cases of acute flaccid paralysis in health facilities and local communities. The programme is already in operation in other regions in Chad, as well as in Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria.
- Planning continues to ensure that immunization days in early November [2017] in all Lake Chad Basin countries go ahead as planned. Countries are conducting meetings to incorporate lessons learned from previous campaigns into the November [2017] campaigns.
- A large livestock vaccination campaign targeting international nomads is planned for the end of November [2017].
- Preparations continue for the 2nd Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) for the region. This is taking place from [29 Oct 2017 - 10 Nov 2017] in the Central African Republic and in Nigeria, and from [1-15 Nov 2017] in Chad and Niger.

- The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year [2017] is 9, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (7 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [Thu 27 Jul 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017]).
- Outbreak response continues to take place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- This month [October 2017], over 10 million children were immunized as part of a bOPV subnational immunization campaign, facilitated and led by volunteers and staff from WHO, UNICEF, and partner agencies.
- The next immunization activity, taking place in November [2017], is a mop-up campaign of Tshopo province, and several provinces in the south of the country. Using mOPV2, vaccinators aim to protect over 800 000 children from polio.
- In Haut Lomami and Maniema social mobilization is being used to show parents how important it is for their child to receive polio vaccine.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.
- The country office continues to be supported by HQ to ensure the close analysis and mapping of cases and outbreak response.

Middle East
- In Syria, No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week [week of Sun 22 Oct 2017]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in this outbreak remains 52. All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis between [3 Mar 2017 and 25 Aug 2017]
- The bulk of all cases continue to be from 2 districts in Deir Ez-Zor governorate; Mayadeen (42) and Boukamal (6).

Post Campaign Monitoring results for the 2nd Raqqa round are still being compiled into a final report. However, initial data suggests that 84 percent of children were reported as vaccinated through market surveys.
- IPV campaign activities aiming to reach children aged between 2-23 months in 2 districts of Raqqa governorate (Raqqa and Thawra) have also now concluded. Work is on ongoing to start this activity in Tell Abyad district as quickly as possible.
- A 2-day workshop was held at WHO offices Amman on [15-16 Oct 2017] to review the ongoing risks of continued polio transmission in Syria and develop contingency plans for any potential breakthrough cases in known outbreak zones or spread of virus to new areas of the country. Draft plans developed outline the steps needed, if further polio transmission is detected, to ensure rapid and effective vaccination of Syrian children no matter where in the country they live. This was a key recommendation of a series of meetings to review the cVDPV2 outbreak response, held in Beirut on [Sat 30 Sep 2017].

[The key walk away message of this week's [week of Sun 22 Oct 2017] update is that the WPV is still circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan as evidenced by:
- the isolation of WPV1 from environmental specimens in both countries, and
- the confirmation of a WPV1 case in Afghanistan with date of onset of paralysis 2 Oct 2017

While there have not been any newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed in Syria or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is too soon to declare the outbreak(s) as over. (The most recent ReliefWeb SitRep update for the Syrian outbreak is dated Tue 17 Oct 2017).

The good news was the outpouring of commitments from most countries in support of the Polio Eradication effort on World Polio Day this year (Sun 24 Oct 2017).

One question that keeps coming to my mind each time I am preparing these updates is what are the results of environmental sampling for WPV1 (and possibly cVDPV) in Nigeria, and other countries that have had cVDPV outbreaks. How comfortable are we at the international level that there isn't silent transmission of the WPV1 or cVDPV in areas with sub-optimal vaccination coverages?

A map showing the global distribution of all WPV1 associated cases and cVDPV associated cases can be found at http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.
