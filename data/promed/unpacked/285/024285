Animal Disease Outbreak Rocks Katsina Area Council
--------------------------------------------------
No fewer than 300 goats and sheep were reportedly killed by the outbreak of an infectious animal disease at Majen Gobir Village of Rimi local government area of Katsina State.

Sources said the outbreak has remained a cause for worry to the villagers, who mostly rear animals.

A farmer, Alhaji Musa Sagir, who reportedly lost over 30 animals to the disease, told our correspondent that the outbreak of the disease was the first to be experienced in the area, adding that the incident was strange to them.

Sagir said: "We just woke to see our animals dying mysteriously of an ailment we still have not really uncovered."

However, the Transition Management Committee chairman of Rimi, Nasiru Ala-Iyatawa, who confirmed the outbreak of the outbreak of the disease, said the council had commenced vaccination
of all animals, so as to stop the spread of the disease.

Iyatawa said the council has procured drugs and other medical equipment worth N1.4 million, assuring that adequate arrangements had been made to address the menace,

[In the absence of information on clinical signs, PM findings, duration of the disease, morbidity and mortality rates (denominators), age of affected animals, possible presence on the premises of other (unaffected?) species, the vaccine applied etc, the list of possible etiologies becomes rather lengthy. Of OIE-listed diseases which can seriously affect sheep and goats, peste des petits and foot & and mouth disease are known to be present in Nigeria and deserve exclusion. In fact, non-infectious etiology should be excluded as well.

The above details, as well as results of veterinary investigations, will be appreciated .- Mod.AS
