Experts studying the West Nile virus (WNV) in Punjab have seen it show up in 3 blood donors, raising worries the infection is going undetected in transfusions.

The WNV is a mosquito-borne virus. It has strains from up to 9 lineages. Of these, lineages 1, 2, and 5 have been linked to encephalitis or brain inflammation outbreaks in humans. Roughly one in 150 infections leads to encephalitis or brain inflammation.

The Pakistani virus was discovered to be lineage 1, along with other highly pathogenic or disease-causing strains from other regions.

Ten experts, including those from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, captured a total of 4150 mosquitoes in Punjab during 2016-2017 using carbon dioxide traps. They also studied 1070 serum samples from humans during the years 2016-2018. The results of their study were published in April [2019] in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

They found that the Pakistan virus strains were genetically similar to those found in Xinjiang, China and Kerala, India. The virus has already been reported both within Pakistan and in adjacent countries such as Iran, China, and India.

An outbreak in humans was recently documented in Karachi, but investigators could not detect it genetically. Although humans catch the virus mostly through mosquito bites, they can get it from blood transfusions and organ transplantation.

Three blood donor specimens tested positive for WNV in Punjab, but it did not show up in mosquito pools. "This suggests that acute WNV infections may remain undetected and have the potential to be transmitted through blood transfusion," the experts wrote.

The transmission of WNV like this poses a serious health risk, especially for elderly patients. Recipients and blood banks need to be aware of this possibility. "To the best of our knowledge this is the 1st report on the circulation of lineage 1 WNV in Pakistan," they added.

Lineage 1 is responsible for the majority of outbreaks in Australia, India, Europe, and the Middle East.

The study results highlight the need for "urgent, nationwide, coordinated surveillance" to assess the distribution and impact of the WNV in Pakistan. The experts recommended public health measures to prevent viral transmission, including vector monitoring and control, information campaigns to improve personal protection, and district-level deployment of screening tests for blood and tissues.

["West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne 50-nm enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It was 1st isolated in 1937 from a human patient in the West Nile region of Uganda. WNV has since been found in various parts of North America, Africa, Australia, Central and Southern Europe, and the Middle East. WNV infection recently emerged in North America, where it is now endemic.

"While birds are the natural host of WNV, the virus also infects other animals (e.g., horses and dogs) as well as humans, who are considered dead-end hosts. Transmission is by mosquitoes, mainly _Culex_ spp., particularly _Culex pipiens_. Human-to-human transmission is not believed to occur in natural situations.

"Most human WNV infections are asymptomatic. Approximately 20% of human infections will result in a mild febrile illness (West Nile fever) for 3-6 days, while severe neuro-invasive disease (West Nile neurological disease [WNND]) is reported in less than 1% of all infected persons. The case fatality [rate] in this group of patients is around 10%.... Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation and specific laboratory tests." (https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/blood_tissues_organs/docs/wnv_preparedness_plan_2012.pdf).

Based on European standards for blood safety, all EU Member States should apply the EU Directive 2004/33/EC. Annex III of this Directive establishes the eligibility criteria for donors of whole blood and blood components, including the deferral criteria. Regarding infection with WNV, this Directive specifies a deferral period of 28 days after leaving an area with ongoing transmission of WNV to humans.

The available data on WNV from Pakistan are limited, and active as well as passive surveillance programs must be initiated to evaluate the burden of this infectious disease, as other vector-borne infections such as dengue and chikungunya are highly endemic.

The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) has developed a WNV risk assessment tool that can be used by countries facing vector-borne diseases (https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/media/en/healthtopics/west_nile_fever/risk-assessment-tool/Documents/west-nile-risk-assessment-tool.pdf). - Mod.UBA
