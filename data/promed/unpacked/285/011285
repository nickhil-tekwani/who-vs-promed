[The West Nile virus surveillance reports are up-dated to 20 Oct 2000. The
number of human cases has increased to 18 with one death. The patient with
dual residency in New York & New Jersey is now listed under New Jersey;
therefore the distribution of cases is Connecticut 1, New Jersey 4 and New
York 13. Please note that the USDA report includes confirmed findings only
up to 17 Oct 2000. As of 18 Oct 2000, Health Canada has not confirmed any
West Nile virus-positive findings in Canada. - Mod.CP

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 49 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of West Nile virus
(WNV). To date, 4 tests were positive, 28 were negative and 17 are pending.
These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV
testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties
where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered.
New Jersey's positive human cases include an 82-year old Little Falls man
who became ill on 3 Sep 2000, was admitted to a hospital 3 days later,
and died on 14 Sep 2000. New Jersey's other human cases include a 43-year
old Jersey City man, a 54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn,
N.Y., and Cliffside Park, Bergen County, and a 72-year old Bayonne woman.
All 3 individuals have either recovered or are recovering.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, the Department of Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton has
accepted 1882 birds for testing. A total of 1104 birds (1101 crows, a
blue jay, a great horned owl and a cockatiel) found in 18 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Atlantic (2), Bergen (196, including a great horned owl), Burlington (14),
Camden (8), Cape May (5, including a blue jay), Essex (102), Gloucester (5),
Hudson (64), Hunterdon (6), Mercer (11), Middlesex (226), Monmouth (156,
including a cockatiel), Morris (57), Ocean (20), Passaic (84), Salem (1),
Somerset (37) and Union (110) Counties. In addition, avian testing conducted
through the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife has detected WNV in 3
wild bird specimens: an American Kestrel found in Cape May, a blue jay in
Middlesex, and a Cooper's Hawk found in Union County.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing
A total of 52 mosquito pools collected in Bergen (22), Essex (2), Hunterdon
(1), Middlesex (3), Monmouth (3), Ocean (1), Passaic (11), Sussex (6),
Union (1),
and Warren (2) Counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV. In
total, 14 200 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been collected by the
Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by the Department of
Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
Blood samples are taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all 21
counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture for the
presence of WNV. To date, 4 chickens, stationed in Essex, Middlesex, Morris
and Sussex Counties, have tested positive for WNV. The National Veterinary
Services Lab (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed the test results.
Horse Testing
A total of 15 horses from Atlantic (2), Burlington (2), Cape May (1),
Hunterdon (1), Monmouth (4), Ocean (2) and Sussex (3) Counties have tested
positive for WNV. Equine testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department
of Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and results are sent to
NVSL for confirmation. A total of 7 horse deaths have been attributed to the
virus.
Late Season Surveillance & Testing Plans
As mosquito season draws to a close and the potential for WNV infection
ends, state-wide surveillance and testing activities for the year will be
discontinued. Active human surveillance (a weekly hospital reporting system
of suspect human cases) will end 31 Oct 2000, and state lab testing for WNV
in humans will end 30 Nov 2000. Crow submissions from northern and central
counties (including Mercer and Monmouth) will end 31 Oct 2000, and
submissions from southern counties will continue through the end of
November. Routine WNV mosquito surveillance for the season will be
discontinued this week.

A total of 6 more horses were classified as having confirmed cases of West
Nile virus (WNV) infection, including 2 horses each from Connecticut
(Fairfield and New Haven counties), New Jersey (Monmouth County), and New
York (Nassau and Orange counties). This brings to 29 the total number of
equine cases of WNV infection in 2000. The National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) found all 6 horses to be WNV-positive on a 1:100
dilution (or greater) of serum on IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Five of the 6 horses also had WNV-positive results on a
1:10 dilution (greater) of serum on a plaque-reduction neutralization test
(PRNT). Two of those 5 also had WNV-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on
IgM-capture ELISA; one of the 2 had brain tissue positive for WNV by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and had WNV isolated from brain tissue.

The European Union previously issued import restrictions, effective 15 Sep
2000, for horses originating from the 5 States that have had an equine case
of WNV. No other countries have notified the USDA of any WNV-related
restrictions on the importation of horses.
One new human case of WNV infection was reported from Norwalk (Fairfield
County), Connecticut. The woman (no age reported) had two days of headache
with no other signs of illness and has now recovered. This is the first-ever
case of WNV infection detected in a Connecticut resident. The total number
of human cases for the year 2000 is now 18, including one death. (Note: one
case has been moved from Kings County, New York, to Bergen County, New
Jersey, as the patient was resident mainly in the latter although he was
diagnosed in the former.)
One skunk, collected on 27 Sep 2000, was reported as WNV-positive in
Fairfield County, Connecticut.
There were 636 more birds reported as positive for WNV during the period.
The first confirmation of WNV activity in Vermont (Windham County) and
Virginia (Prince Edward County) was reported, as a dead hermit thrush and a
dead crow (respectively) tested positive for WNV. Over 3600 birds have now
been documented as infected with WNV in 10 States plus the District of
Columbia in the year 2000.
Three new sentinel chickens were confirmed as WNV-positive in 3 different
counties of New Jersey (Essex, Morris, Sussex). The total number of sentinel
chickens found WNV-positive in 2000 is now 6.
A total of 9 new counties in 2 States reported at least one WNV-positive
mosquito pool: New Jersey (Hunterdon, Union) and Pennsylvania (Chester,
Dauphin, Delaware, Lehigh, Philadelphia City, Schuylkill, Union, Wyoming).
The WNV-positive mosquitoes reported from Pennsylvania are the first ever
detected in that State; they were collected from 14 Sep to 3 Oct 2000 and
included a pool of _Culex pipiens_ collected within half a mile of the
equine case in Dauphin County. A total of 18 new positive mosquito pools
were reported, bringing the overall total for this year to 389.
A total of 125 counties in Connecticut (8), District of Columbia (1),
Maryland (7), Massachusetts (11), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (18), New
York (61), Pennsylvania (12), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (1), and Virginia
(1) have had confirmed findings of WNV in some species of bird or mammal
since 1 May 2000. Of the 125 counties, 119 have detected at least one
positive wild bird, with 103 counties in Connecticut (8), District of
Columbia (1), Maryland (4), Massachusetts (8), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey
(17), New York (55), Pennsylvania (5), and Rhode Island (3) reporting two or
more confirmed findings of WNV-positive birds. Sussex County, New Jersey,
and Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, have had at least one positive horse and
at least one positive mosquito pool, but no birds reported as WNV-positive
to date; in fact, Sussex County has now had positive horses (2), positive
mosquito pools (2), and one positive sentinel chicken, but no positive wild
birds detected. A total of 24 counties, 2 in Connecticut (Fairfield, New
Haven), 2 in Massachusetts (Norfolk, Suffolk), 7 in New Jersey (Bergen,
Essex, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Passaic, Union), 11 in New York
(Bronx, Columbia, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Queens, Richmond,
Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester), and 2 in Pennsylvania (Chester,
Philadelphia City), have now had at least one wild bird and at least one
mosquito pool reported as positive.
The following is a summary of all West Nile virus-positive findings from 1
May 2000 through 17 Oct 2000: 18 humans, 29 equines, 26 other mammals, 3634
birds, 389 mosquito pools, and 6 sentinel birds. [In the USDA Report these
positive findings are further broken down by county and the species of
mosquito, where known , is listed. A comprehensive map can be accessed from
the site.

West Nile virus in Virginia
---------------------------
The inevitable has occurred. The first West Nile virus (WNV) positive crow
has been identified in Virginia. The bird was submitted to the Lynchburg
Regional Animal Health Lab on 29 Sep 2000 and was found in southern Prince
Edward County, just north of the Charlotte County line along Route 668.
Samples were sent to the Norfolk Public Health Lab for virus isolation and
PCR testing. After a suspect positive was detected, samples were forwarded
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta for confirmation. Positive
confirmation was received on Fri 13 Oct 2000.
Although it was no surprise that we eventually picked up a WNV positive bird
in the state, the first positive occurred further south than we expected.
This may be due in part to the fact that there are a huge number of birds
(hundreds) from northern Virginia in the testing pipeline and this one just
got tested first. On the bright side, it certainly reaffirms the benefit of
conducting surveillance simultaneously state-wide.
Given the geographical hop that this first positive in Virginia took, and
the fact that no mosquito pools, either in Virginia or Maryland, have turned
up positive for WNV yet, one possibility is that this represents the fall
movement of migratory birds and the virus is not necessarily "endemic" in
Virginia, yet. Nevertheless, VDACS labs will be adding WNV to the
differential list for all cases with Central Nervous System (neurologic)
symptoms from now on. This includes all mammals and birds.
All mammalian neurologic cases will first be screened for rabies before WNV
testing is carried out. Practitioners are reminded that an IgM Capture ELISA
for WNV antibody is now available for horses only. The test is done on serum
(red-top tube) and is free of charge but will only be run on horses with
compatible clinical signs of ataxia, lethargy, fever etc. Please contact
your nearest Regional Animal Health Laboratory for more information.

[The last paragraph provides me with an opportunity to insert, somewhat
belatedly, an observation passed to me by fellow Moderator Martin Hugh-Jones
of the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine."It is important to re-emphasize the
need to check horses for rabies when an encephalic condition has been
diagnosed. We recently had a clinical "EEE" horse come in and the usual
brain samples were taken using high speed bone saws to get through the
skull. But it was rabies. Caused quite a fuss and reinforced the need to
check that the pathology resident and veterinary students were up to date
on their
rabies vaccinations." - Mod.CP
[After this summary was prepared, 2 subscribers reported that the news
media indicate that a dead crow found in North Carolina has tested positive
for West Nile virus. More information will follow in subsequent summaries.

Response to Human Morbidity Query
---------------------------------
In West Nile virus surveillance - USA ( 42), Meredith Golden
<mgolden@ciesin.org> requested information concerning human morbidity.
As I recall, Dr. Marcelle Layton of the New York City Department of Health
presented some data on persisting neurologic deficits in survivors of West
Nile encephalitis during her presentation on "West Nile Encephalitis in New
York City: The Public Health Perspective" at the Emerging Infections I
Symposium at the 17-20 Sep ICAAC in Toronto.
