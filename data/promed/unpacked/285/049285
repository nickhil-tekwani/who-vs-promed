2 cows at a small cattle farm at Kadamankulam, near Kallooppara, in Mallappally taluk [administrative division, Pathanamthitta district, Kerala state] died of anthrax on [Wed 22 Jul 2015].

The Animal Husbandry Department (AHD) has swung into action following confirmation of _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterial infection in the deceased cattle by the Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Thiruvalla on [Wed 22 Jul 2015] itself.

The cattle casualty was reported from the farm belonging to [BA] at Kadamankulam. He said he had reported the sudden death of the cows immediately to the government veterinary surgeon at Kallooppara, George Varghese, who rushed to the spot to find bleeding from the natural orifices of the deceased animal. The carcasses were scientifically buried, using lime and common salt, in a 6-foot [about 2 m] deep pit on the farm premises on [Wed 22 Jul 2015]. The cattle shed and the premises were well disinfected, later.

A team of AHD officials led by Mathew M., Assistant Director, Clinical Laboratory, and Mini Sarah, taluk coordinator, Animal Disease Control Project, visited the farm on [Thu 23 Jul 2015]. All the 7 in-contact animals at the farm were administered with [penicillin-streptomycin] injection and the cattle shed was disinfected with Lysol and bleaching powder.

Veterinary surgeon George Varghese took an awareness class for farmers at the Kallooppara milk cooperative society, later.

The AHD sources told The Hindu that vaccination of all cattle in the 2 km [about 1.2-mile] radius of the farm will commence from [Fri 24 Jul 2015]. The vaccine from the Veterinary Biological Institute at Palode in Thiruvananthapuram [capital of Kerala state] is expected to reach Kallooppara by Friday morning [24 Jul 2015]. No other death of cattle has been reported from any other part of the district as on Thursday afternoon [23 Jul 2015].

There were also suspected anthrax cases reported from Mallappally taluk, earlier, a decade ago. The sudden death of 2 cows at Kottangal and Mallappally reported way back in 2004 was suspected to be caused by anthrax. There were also suspected cases of anthrax reported from certain places in the Ranni-Perinad panchayat [local self-government council] adjoining the forest areas of the Goodrickal elephant reserve in 2007.

The Forest Department had insisted compulsory vaccination of all the cattle in the village areas lying on the forest fringes, in the light of the suspected anthrax outbreak in certain part of the village, then.

[Burying anthrax carcasses in quick lime was the traditional method of disposing of them. But then the light came on that adding calcium to the carcass might not be a good idea as the spores like high calcium levels. So bury them as deep as you can, making sure not to have done a necropsy. Otherwise the Kerala authorities have responded well, having disinfected the cattle shed, treated the other cows in the herd with streptomycin penicillin to stop any incubating infections, and they and the neighbouring herds are due to be vaccinated today (24 Jul 2015). That the vaccine had to come from the Veterinary Biological Institute at Palode tells one that the clinical veterinarians do not normally stock this vaccine, which indicates infrequent vaccination.

Anthrax is sporadic in Kerala. OIE records show bovine outbreaks in 2004, 2005 (1), 2006 (ProMED but not OIE), 2007 (ditto), and 2014 (2). Kerala is in SW India; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg.
