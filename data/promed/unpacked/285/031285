U.S. Health Officials Call Cruise Ships Safe
--------------------------------------------
Despite recent outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness on cruise ships,
federal health officials pronounced the ships safe yesterday and said they
would not advise people to delay or avoid taking cruises. The officials said
passengers could avoid illness by washing their hands frequently and keeping
their hands out of their mouths.
But while the government was holding its news conference, executives of the
Disney Cruise Line made an announcement of their own, canceling the next
cruise of a ship that now has sick passengers on board. The ship, the Disney
Magic, will finish its current trip but will then be kept in port for 7 days
without passengers so that it can be disinfected to get rid of Norwalk
virus, which causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
sometimes fever and headache.
As of noon Wed 27 Nov 2002, 104 of the 2485 passengers on the Disney Magic
were ill, along with 19 of the 1003 crew members. Tests performed on the
first group of people to get sick [confirmed Norwalk virus infection].
Disney said that it had offered to fly sick passengers home but that only
one couple had accepted. The ship was docked yesterday at Cozumel, Mexico.
It is scheduled to be back in Port Canaveral, Fla., on Saturday.
Another ship, the Amsterdam, owned by the Holland America line, is also
being kept in port, in Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to be
disinfected. On its last 4 cruises, more than 500 passengers and crew
members fell ill, also as a result of Norwalk virus infection. Like Disney,
Holland America decided to cancel a cruise to clean the ship. The
disinfecting includes spraying or wiping down surfaces with solutions of
bleach or other chemicals and steam cleaning or throwing away items like
pillows and books that cannot be disinfected.
At a news conference yesterday, David Forney, an expert on vessel sanitation
from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that
although the virus could be spread by food and water, they were not found to
be the source on these ships. Rather, Mr. Forney said, the virus was
probably brought on board the ship by an infected person and then spread
from person to person. Infected people who do not wash their hands after
using the toilet may contaminate surfaces they touch, like handrails and
door handles, which may then infect other people who touch the same surfaces
and put their hands in their mouths or eat without first washing their
hands.
The virus may be able to survive on surfaces for weeks, said Dr. Marc
Widdowson, a scientist at the disease control agency. In addition, Mr.
Forney said in an interview, "We've had reports of, for lack of a better
term, public vomiting, and, in essence, you're aerosolizing the droplets,
which can then be inhaled and ingested by people who may be in the area."
Public vomiting occurs because the virus can cause sudden, severe nausea, he
said.
Some passengers have expressed fears that people with weakened immune
systems from cancer, chemotherapy, or HIV infection might be especially
vulnerable to the virus. But health officials said that was not the case,
unless a patient already had diarrhea or a gastrointestinal problem making
dehydration more likely. Nonetheless, Dr. Gianna Zuccotti, a physician at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who advises cancer
patients about traveling, said patients taking cruises should drink bottled
water and avoid ice cubes and salad as a general precaution to avoid
infections.
Outbreaks of Norwalk virus are not unique to cruise ships. They are common
in places where many people live in close quarters for extended periods,
like nursing homes, hospitals, army bases, and camps. Part of the problem on
ships, Mr. Forney said, may be that people who have booked cruises and then
feel ill at departure time may not want to cancel, and so they board anyway.
He added that it was important for passengers to tell medical departments on
the ship if they became sick, but said that they might be reluctant to do so
for fear of being confined to their cabins after having paid large sums of
money for the trip.
When people fall ill, crew members try to disinfect ship surfaces while
cruising and while the ship is docked between cruises. If that does not
work, Mr. Forney said, experience has proved that the best solution is to
take the ship out of service for 7 to 10 days and disinfect it.
