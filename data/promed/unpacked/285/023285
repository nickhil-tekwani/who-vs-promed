A male (buck) deer harvested on 1 Dec 2012 at the Pine Ridge Hunting Preserve in Davis County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). This is the 2nd positive test for the fatal disease at this facility. The initial positive sample was confirmed in July 2012 and was submitted from a deer shot in December 2011.

As part of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources' CWD response plan, the hunting preserve has been providing test samples from each deer shot at its facility. So far, 151 deer and 5 elk have been taken according to the depopulation agreement with the landowner. Clients at the hunting preserve are allowed to take only the cape and antlers attached to a clean skull plate from the facility.

The Department of Natural Resources is continuing to collect samples of wild deer harvested from the 5 mile zone surrounding the facility with a goal of 300 samples. Iowa's deer seasons available in Davis County run through 20 Jan 2013.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources [DNR] reported on Thursday [13 Dec 2012] that for the first time in Adams County a deer has tested positive for chronic wasting disease.

A bow hunter harvested a 3 year old buck in early November 2012 in central Adams County and took it to a cooperating taxidermist who provided a sample for testing, said Kris Johansen, area wildlife supervisor in the DNR's Wisconsin Rapids office. "Being the 1st CWD positive in the county makes this noteworthy but not unexpected," Johansen said.

The Adams County CWD deer was south of Lake Arrowhead and east of the Petenwell Flowage when it was killed. That is about 38 miles north of the nearest previous wild deer testing positive for CWD and 25 miles from a Portage County game farm near Almond where CWD deer were found several year ago.

The positive test results won't prompt any immediate restrictions, Johansen said. Adams, Wood, Juneau, Marathon, Portage, and Waushara counties have been closed to deer baiting due to the CWD deer that were found near the Almond game farm.

This year [2012], the DNR has collected 72 samples in Adams County through voluntary efforts and will continue to collect and sample deer through the end of the archery season.

DNR staff members will process all CWD samples collected in Adams County from the 2012 deer hunting season. Any further response to this new positive will be addressed once all results are analyzed.

"Until we get a better picture, we want to do more surveillance. We'll continue to ask for cooperation from hunters and taxidermists, and we'll keep the public informed as we go forward," Johansen said.

Adams County bow hunters interested in volunteering deer for sampling can contact Jon Robaidek, local DNR biologist, at 608-339-4819 or DNR conservation warden Wade Romberg at 608-339-2965 for more information.

CWD, a disease of the brain that affects deer, was 1st discovered west of Madison in 2002, and the DNR set up eradication and reduction zones in an effort to control its spread.

A deer tested positive last fall near Shell Lake in northwest Wisconsin, but after nearly 1000 samples of other deer in the area, no further positive test results have occurred, Johansen said.

CWD can be fatal to deer, but there is no scientific evidence that CWD is transmissible to humans, according to the State Environmental Resource Council. Still, the SERC advises against consuming venison from deer that have tested positive for CWD.

[Issues in Iowa are still becoming known. It is likely to take some time to develop a plan on how to proceed.

Iowa may be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2ovI.

The Wisconsin county case seems to represent an expansion of territory of the disease. Deer generally do not range more than a few miles from their home territory, but this illustrates that deer and diseases have no respect for borders.
