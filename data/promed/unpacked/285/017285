Scarlet fever seems to be making the rounds in the province [Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada] but Health PEI does not track the numbers because it is related to strep throat, which is easily treated with antibiotics. But don't panic, it's not as scary as it sounds.

The illness is actually a manifestation of a strep [streptococcal] infection. Parents have reported to The Guardian that an official with the new 811 telehealth line has told them anecdotally that scarlet fever is going around in PEI.

Dr Lamont Sweet, PEI's deputy chief public health officer, said Monday [20 Jan 2014] the strep infection only manifests as scarlet fever when it is the 1st time a person has contracted the illness. "Scarlet fever is your 1st attack of strep throat," he said. "Usually it has a red rash, a fever, swollen glands in the neck, and then the tongue is usually involved with either a white coating or raised bumps in which case it can be quite red and they call it a strawberry tongue." The red, or scarlet, rash is caused by a substance released into the blood from bacteria from the infection.

The good news is, after you've had this rash once, your body becomes immune to it in future. So, if you contract strep throat again, it will not be accompanied by the scarlet rash.

The Health Department does not track cases of strep throat in PEI, as it is a common illness that is easily treated with antibiotics. The reason it has a bad reputation is because strep throat, or scarlet fever, used to be accompanied by rheumatic fever. "Strep has changed in that we almost never hear of rheumatic fever," Sweet said. "No one really knows too much about why this happened. Fortunately the strep has been less likely to cause trouble . . . we've just not been getting the major complications that we used to get."

[Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococci (GAS) (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, or the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever). Scarlet fever usually occurs in children. By the age of 10 years, most people will have developed immunity.

Scarlet fever is highly contagious. Transmission occurs via airborne respiratory particles dispersed from infected patients by coughing or sneezing, usually in the colder winter months, or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. Those who carry the bacteria in the nasopharynx or on the skin but have no symptoms are less contagious (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm).

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1 percent. Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as happened in Hong Kong in 2011; (see prior ProMED-mail posts in 2011 on scarlet fever in Hong Kong).

For a more detailed discussion of scarlet fever, please see the prior ProMED-mail posts Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - Guernsey 20110217.0521 and Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever, fatal - China: (HK) RFI 20110622.1906.

The news report above gives no absolute number of cases of scarlet fever, and no indication of its severity. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Prince Edward Island (PEI), with 145 855 residents in 2011, is 1 of 3 Canadian Maritime provinces, is located about 124 miles (200 km) north of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and consists of the island itself, plus 231 minor islands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island).
