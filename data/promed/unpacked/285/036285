A Jacksonville seafood worker died Friday from exposure to _Vibrio
vulnificus_ found in brackish water. He was the second Duval County
resident to die this year because of _Vibrio vulnificus_, a common
microorganism that can be lethal to people with weak immune systems.
His wife said she thought the infection happened while he was working for
an acquaintance who operates a small roadside seafood stand. He was
apparently infected by water that seeped into a cut on his foot. It spread
through the leg, which doctors amputated. He had been undergoing treatment
for 10 days at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville. An Army
veteran, he had suffered hepatitis and cirrhosis and was in chronically
weak health from exposure to the chemical Agent Orange during the Vietnam
War.
Three people are known to have been infected with vibrio in Duval County
this year, said Amy Burns, a program manager for the Duval County Health
Department.
A 75-year-old Jacksonville Beach man was hospitalized in May after a blue
crab scratched his hand. Doctors controlled the bacteria with antibiotics
and used skin grafts to repair damage to his hand and arm. He returned home
about two weeks ago.
Burns said another person was infected in July and later died.
Burns said people with weak immune systems should avoid brackish water,
which is common in rivers and creeks, if they have open cuts or sores. For
people handling seafood, "It might be a good idea to wear gloves," she
said.
Burns said most people have nothing to fear from the bacteria, and that it
is not a sign of any environmental problem in the St. Johns or other rivers.
