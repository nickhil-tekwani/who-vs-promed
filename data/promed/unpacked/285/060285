The highly transmissible delta and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants caused 3 and 10 times the rate of COVID-19 infections in pregnant women compared with other strains, with most cases among unvaccinated mothers and their newborns, found a prospective study published yesterday [24 Mar 2022] in JAMA (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2790609).

University of Texas researchers studied the outcomes of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 at a Dallas healthcare system. The study spanned the pre-delta period (17 May 2020-26 Jun 2021), the delta period (27 Jun-11 Dec 2021), and the omicron era (12 Dec 2021-29 Jan 2022). COVID-19 vaccines became available in December 2020.

A total of 2641 maternal COVID-19 infections were diagnosed, with 1298 pre-delta (median per week, 17), 431 in the delta period (14), and 912 during omicron (138).

Two infected mothers (0.15%) had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccine series before the emergence of delta, while 49 (11.4%) and 256 (28.1%) did so during the delta and omicron periods, respectively. Of the 2641 infections, 112 (4.2%) were severe or critical, including 53 (4.1%) before delta (0 vaccinated), 51 (11.8%) amid delta (2 vaccinated), and 8 (0.9%) during omicron.

Relative to the pre-delta period, the delta and omicron eras were tied to increased maternal infections (incidence rate ratios, 3.07 and 10.09, respectively). While delta was associated with greater illness severity (odds ratio [OR] 2.93), omicron was linked to milder infections (OR 0.20) after adjustment for vaccination.

Of 1919 newborns, 1015 were tested for COVID-19, with 32 (3.1%) testing positive (pre-delta 13; delta 8; omicron 11). No infection was severe. Newborn positivity was similar in all periods. Twenty-nine infants (90.6%) were born to mothers with mild infections, and 18 of 20 (90%) infected babies were born after December 2020 to vaccine-eligible but unvaccinated women.

The researchers said they could not determine whether the lower COVID-9 severity during omicron was related to increasing numbers of pregnant women with previous infections (perhaps imparting some protection against severe illness) or to properties of the variant itself. The study authors concluded, "Long-term risks of early neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown, but maternal vaccination may be protective."

[2] Variant-specific long COVID
Date: Fri 25 Mar 2022

Pre-delta variant data to be presented next month [April 2022] at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) meeting in Portugal suggest that different variants of COVID-19 may produce different symptoms in people who develop long COVID.

The research is based on outcomes seen in 428 COVID-19 case-patients at the University of Florence and Careggi University Hospital in Italy. The patients were seen from June 2020 to July 2021, when the alpha variant was the dominant strain and before the delta and omicron variants rose to prominence.

Seventy-six per cent of the patients reported at least one persistent symptom of COVID-19 during follow-up, including shortness of breath (37%) and chronic fatigue (36%) followed by sleep problems (16%), vision problems (13%), and brain fog (13%). Women were twice as likely as men to develop long COVID, and patients on immunosuppressive drugs were 6 times more likely.

The authors also found a change in long COVID symptoms when comparing patients who had alpha variant to those infected with the original, wild-type strain. Myalgia, insomnia, brain fog and anxiety and depression significantly increased with the alpha strain, while anosmia (loss of smell), dysgeusia ([distorted taste]), and impaired hearing were less common.

"This is the first time they [symptoms] have been linked to different COVID-19 variants," said Michele Spinicci, the lead researcher of the study, in an ECCMID press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/947495). "Future research should focus on the potential impacts of variants of concern and vaccination status on ongoing symptoms."

[3] UK: recombinant variants
Date: Fri 25 Mar 2022 [most recent update]
Source: UK Health Security Agency [abridged, edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-variants-identified-in-the-uk


UKHSA's most recent variant technical briefing includes examination of a number of recombinant variants which have been identified in the UK, as well as updated epidemiological and genomic analysis of omicron BA.2. A recombinant variant occurs when an individual becomes infected with 2 or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within the patient's body. This is not an unusual occurrence and several recombinant SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified over the course of the pandemic. As with any other coronavirus (COVID-19) variant, the vast majority do not confer any advantage to the virus and die out relatively quickly.

UKHSA's new analysis examines 3 recombinants, known as XF, XE, and XD. Of these, XD and XF are recombinants of delta and omicron BA.1, while XE is a recombinant of omicron BA.1 and BA.2. In the UK, 38 cases of XF have been identified, though none have been seen since mid-February [2022]. There is currently no evidence of community transmission within the UK. XD has not been identified in the UK to date, though 49 cases have been reported to global databases; the majority of these are in France.

A total 637 cases of XE -- a recombinant of omicron BA.1 and BA.2 -- have been confirmed in the UK so far. The earliest of these has a specimen date of 19 Jan 2022. There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about growth advantage or other properties of this variant. We continue to monitor all recombinants closely, routinely through our world-leading genomic surveillance and sequencing capability.

Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor, UKHSA said: "Recombinant variants are not an unusual occurrence, particularly when there are several variants in circulation, and several have been identified over the course of the pandemic to date. As with other kinds of variant, most will die off relatively quickly. This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a variable growth rate and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage. So far there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about transmissibility, severity or vaccine effectiveness. UKHSA will continue to monitor the situation closely as a matter of routine, as we do all data relating to SARS-CoV-2 variants both in the UK and internationally."

The variant technical briefing also includes updated analysis on omicron BA.2, currently the dominant variant in the UK. BA.2 is estimated to account for approximately 93.7% of cases in England, with the highest prevalence in the South East (96.4%) and the lowest in the East Midlands (91.1%). Data for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not included in the UKHSA Technical Briefing.

BA.2 continues to demonstrate a substantial growth advantage. Since the middle of February [2022], this growth rate has settled at approximately 75% higher than other circulating omicron lineages in England. Ongoing analysis by UKHSA has found no evidence that infection with omicron BA.2 results in a greater risk of hospitalisation, compared to omicron BA.1.

UKHSA has also this week published further vaccine effectiveness data against hospitalisation following a booster dose. For the first time, these data include analysis on vaccine effectiveness 15+ weeks after the booster dose. These data show that protection against severe illness from COVID-19 remains at over 90% in those aged 65 and over up to 14 weeks after a booster dose. While there is a suggestion that this wanes slightly after 15 weeks, protection in this age group remains high at over 85%. This paper can be found as a pre-print, and the data are referred to in the latest vaccine surveillance report.

UKHSA is updating its variant classification system to give a clearer indication of which variants have significant changes compared to the current dominant variant. Under the new system, the variant of concern (VOC) label will be assigned to variants which are currently emerging or circulating, and which the following characteristics can be confirmed or predicted:

1. A detrimental change in biological properties (changes in transmissibility, severity or immune evasion) compared to the current dominant variant.
2. A growth rate potentially compatible with the eventual replacement of the current dominant variant.

There will be no other categorisation of variants, including no variant under investigation (VUI) category. Previous variants of concern which no longer meet the criteria will be redesignated. UKHSA will continue to designate new variants, and these will receive a variant number (in the format V-date-number). We will continue to closely analyse all available biological, epidemiological and genomic evidence for any SARS-CoV-2 variant in the UK or internationally. These changes will take effect as of 1 Apr 2022 and will be reflected in full in future technical briefings.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------
"This report has been published to share the detailed variant surveillance analyses which contribute to the variant risk assessments and designation of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. This specialist technical briefing contains early data and analysis on emerging variants and findings have a high level of uncertainty.

"SARS-CoV-2 Routine variant data update covers surveillance data and sequencing coverage data on all other Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants under Investigation (VUIs). Unless stated otherwise, this technical briefing uses a data cut-off of 21 Mar 2022 to allow time for analyses.

Changes to variant classification system:
"UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is amending its variant classification system to give a clearer indication of which variants have significant changes in biological properties compared to the current dominant variant(s). These variants may pose a risk to public health in the UK, although at the time of identification it may be difficult to predict the extent of the impact.

"In the new system, the Variant of Concern label will be assigned to variants which are currently emerging or circulating, and for which we have confirmed or can predict:
- a detrimental change in biological properties (changes in transmissibility, severity or immune evasion) compared to the current dominant variant(s); and
- a growth rate potentially compatible with maintaining transmission and/or displacing the current dominant variant.

"There will be no other categorisation of variants, including no variant under investigation category. UKHSA will continue to designate new variants based on genomic features and growth, and these will receive a variant number (V-date-number) and will have routine characterisation analyses once biological materials are available and/or sufficient cases accrue. Previous variants of concern which no longer meet the criteria above will be redesignated.

"These changes will take effect as of 1 Apr 2022 and will be reflected in full in future technical briefings." - Mod.LK]

[4] Respiratory co-infections
Date: Fri 25 Mar 2022

ref: Swets MC, Russell CD, Harrison EM. SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenoviruses. Lancet. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00383-X
------------------------------------------------------------------
Measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have also been effective in reducing the transmission of other endemic respiratory viruses. As many countries decrease the use of such measures, we expect that SARS-CoV-2 will circulate with other respiratory viruses, increasing the probability of co-infections. The clinical outcome of respiratory viral co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.

We examined clinical outcomes of co-infection with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenoviruses in 212 466 adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to hospital in the UK between 6 Feb 2020 and 8 Dec 2021, using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium-WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol.

Tests for respiratory viral co-infections were recorded for 6965 patients with SARS-CoV-2. Viral co-infection was detected in 583 (8.4%) patients: 227 patients had influenza viruses, 220 patients had respiratory syncytial virus, and 136 patients had adenoviruses. Co-infection with influenza viruses was associated with increased odds of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation compared with SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection (table [see source URL to view]). SARS-CoV-2 co-infections with influenza viruses and adenoviruses were each significantly associated with increased odds of death.

This study had several strengths. First, it is the largest study of people with COVID-19 undergoing additional testing for endemic respiratory viruses, reporting 583 confirmed co-infections and 6382 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 monoinfections. Second, we recruited patients over an 18-month duration. Finally, we report outcome data for most patients.

As public health restrictions are lifted, respiratory virus co-infections are more likely to occur during future winters. The marked increase in risk among patients with co-infection has several implications for policy. First, our results provide further support for vaccination against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Second, they suggest that testing for influenza viruses is important in hospital inpatients with COVID-19 to identify patients at risk and a cohort of patients who might have different responses to immunomodulatory and antiviral therapy.
