re: ProMED-mail. Bacillus cereus - France (02): (Paris) fatal, prems, no source identified, RFI 20161005.4536968
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Did the affected infants have _B. cereus_ bacteremia or some other syndrome?
- Yes: [all] 3 newborns had bacteremia (positive blood cultures) and 1 patient was colonized (cavum). [Unsure of what "cavum" refers to.]
2. Was the banked milk that was tested the same as the milk consumed by the affected newborns?
- I do not know.
3. What were the other environmental sites tested, such as, intravenous nutrition solutions?
- Yes: environmental tests were performed: intravenous nutrition solutions, strains isolated from nappies and sheets.
