Egyptian girl contracts bird flu, 69th case
-------------------------------------------
A 5 year old Egyptian girl has contracted the highly pathogenic bird flu
virus after coming into contact with infected birds, the state news agency
MENA reported on Sunday [10 May 2009].

This case brings to 69 the number of people confirmed to have contracted
H5N1 avian influenza virus in Egypt, which has been hit harder than any
another country outside Asia. While the avian influenza virus rarely
infects people, experts say they fear it could mutate into a form people
could easily pass to one another, sparking a pandemic that could kill millions.

MENA, citing the Health Ministry, said the girl from Sohag province was
admitted to hospital on Saturday [9 May 2009]. It said she was being
treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and was in a stable
condition.

Some 26 Egyptians have died after contracting the virus. Most of those
infected had come into contact with infected domestic birds in a country
where roughly 5 million households depend on domestically raised poultry as
a significant source of food and income. Last month [April 2009], Egypt
ordered the culling of all the country's 300 000 to 400 000 pigs as a
precaution against the new H1N1 influenza strain, also known as swine flu.

The World Health Organization on Sunday [10 May 2009] reported 4379 people
in 29 countries have been infected by the new [H1N1] virus. No cases have
been reported in Egypt.
