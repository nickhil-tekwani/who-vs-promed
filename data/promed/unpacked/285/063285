While new to Canada, the strain of tuberculosis bacteria which infected the Alberta cow at the centre of a bovine TB probe has been seen before in Mexico. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported the strain of _Mycobacterium bovis_ found in a southeastern Alberta cow is "closely related" to a strain originating from cattle in central Mexico in 1997.

The _M. bovis_ pathogen from the infected cow is not the same as any strains previously detected in Canadian domestic animals, wildlife or people to date, CFIA said.

The bovine TB probe follows a notice in late September from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that a cow from Alberta had tested positive for the disease at a U.S. packing plant. Removal and "humane destruction" of animals from the Alberta cow's index herd continues, as do on-farm testing and tracing of potentially exposed animals, the agency said Wed [16 Nov 2016]. While the index herd is the only 1 so far to turn up an infected cow, federal quarantines are in place on "approximately" 34 farms in Alberta and 2 in southwestern Saskatchewan as of Wed [16 Nov 2016], CFIA said.

In Alberta, CFIA veterinarians and inspectors are contacting cattle producers in Newell County, around Brooks; the part of Cypress County north of Medicine Hat; the Municipal District of Acadia; and Special Areas No. 2 and No. 3, north of those municipalities. In Saskatchewan, producers are being contacted in an area west of Highway 4 and south of the South Saskatchewan River.

A federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923. Canada is still considered officially free of bovine TB and would lose that status only if another separate Canadian case is confirmed within 48 months. Other TB-positive animals found in connection to the current probe would not be considered a separate case.

Canada's most recent previous case of bovine TB turned up in a British Columbia beef cattle herd in May 2011. [This was the Texas Roping Strain, source never found. - Mod.MHJ]

Surveillance programs are also carried out in areas where livestock have been previously infected. Manitoba, where the disease is still found in wild deer and elk in and around Riding Mountain National Park, south of Dauphin, has been officially bovine TB-free since 2006. The disease mainly affects ruminants, such as cattle, bison, elk, deer, goats and sheep, but can affect all types of mammals, including people -- particularly those who have "extended close contact" with an infected animal while it's alive. Due to its "extremely low prevalence" in Canada, however, findings of bovine TB aren't considered a public health threat.

[Hopefully USDA has a sound collection of _Mycobacterium bovis_ strains archived and the distribution of any "Mexican" strains away from the US/Mexico border might provide a lead as to how this Albertan cow acquired this infection. Ascribing it to a notional _Mycobacterium bovis_ infected Mexican field hand on the Alberta ranch would be a bit of stretch though.

To find Brooks, Alberta, go to http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_6_ed/reference/bilingual/alberta.pdf; it is in the SE corner of the province, near Medicine Hat. For Saskatchewan and the South Saskatchewan River, go to http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_6_ed/reference/bilingual/sask.pdf. For a map showing both provinces and the propinquity of the 2 surveillance areas, go to http://ftp.geogratis.gc.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_6_ed/reference/bilingual/prairies.pdf. - Mod.MHJ

The Journal of Clinical Microbiology 2005 Jul 4 (7): 355-357 records a transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from human to cattle. This is not quite the same as transmission of _Mycobacterium bovis_ from a human to a bovine, but the _Mycobacterium_ spp are closely related. As far as transmission, I might be more suspecting of a deer or elk transmitting a particular strain of _M. bovis_ than a human, unless, of course, the typing of the strain is incorrect from the start, which I think is unlikely. Yes, this is a Mexican strain, but it could have been passed from various deer and cattle over a number of years. It may also have been passed from a Mexican animal that was shipped north while incubating the disease and a cervid animal came into contact with that animal and has now transmitted it across a border region. The trouble with speculating prior to the investigation is there are so many theories, but only one will be correct when it is said and done. - Mod.TG
