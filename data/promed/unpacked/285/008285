The Oregon State Public Health Lab has confirmed that 3 Central Oregon residents who were hospitalized contracted botulism at a private barbecue, Deschutes County health officials said on Mon 2 Jul 2012.

Deschutes County Health Services has conducted an investigation and implicated home canned food as the source of the botulism. Final testing results are pending. No other details were released, though officials told NewsChannel 21 that 2 of the 3 people affected are back at home recovering.

"This was an isolated incident and Deschutes County Health Services has notified all involved individuals," a news release stated. "Botulism in not spread person to person, so there is no risk to the general public as a result of these cases."

County officials called the incident a good reminder of the importance of following strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods while canning, as well as obtaining the necessary pressure when canning to effectively destroy bacteria and prevent botulism.

[It is unclear when the cases presented since 2 of the 3 individuals are out of the hospital. If the presentations were this week, it is probable that the toxin type is not type A, the most severe type. It is not stated if the toxin type is identified and what canned foods were involved.

Intoxication with botulinum toxin was originally described from food in which spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ were able to germinate into vegetative forms that produce one of the serotypes of toxin, which in human disease is typically A, B, or E. In the USA, most cases are, however, related to infant botulism where the relatively uncolonized intestinal tract allows the organism to produce toxin in vivo. This can rarely occur in adults where it is called adult colonization botulism. Wound botulism can also result in disease related to necrotic wounds or drug ingestions. The toxin can also be aerosolized. - Mod.LL
