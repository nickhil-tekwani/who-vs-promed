More polio cases detected in Indonesia
--------------------------------------
Indonesian health authorities confirmed on Wednesday [25 May 2005]
that 6 additional polio cases have been detected in the country,
bringing the total infected to 14.
The new illnesses came from the same district in West Java province
where the 1st case was detected in April [2005] and from the nearby
province of Banten, according to Dr. Yusharmen, an official at the
health ministry's directorate general of contagious disease control.
"This is not something surprising, because that has been expected
since we had a case in an area where there was low immunization,"
Yusharmen told Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.
A 20-month-old girl was diagnosed with polio in Sukabumi on 21 Apr
2005, becoming the country's 1st case since 1995. Authorities believe
she came in contact with a migrant worker or tourist who was infected
abroad.
The outbreak prompted government health workers to do immediate
house-to-house vaccinations in several villages in the area and
intensify surveillance. They plan to vaccinate 6.4 million children
under age 5 in a broader campaign kicking off next week, the World
Health Organization said, as reported by AP.
Yusharmen explained that 11 out of the 14 polio cases were detected
in the villages of Sukabumi. One other polio case was detected in the
nearby district of Bogor -- just south of Jakarta -- while 2 other
polio cases were detected in Banten province.

On 24 May 2005, 6 additional polio cases were reported in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 14. 3 of the new cases are from
the same village as the index case in Sukabumi district, and 3 are
from neighboring districts (Lebak and Bogor districts). The
previously reported 8 cases all occurred from the same village or
from neighboring villages as the index case.
Planning for the polio immunization campaign to be conducted on 31
May - 2 Jun 2005 continues. The campaign will cover West Java, Banten
and Jakarta provinces, to reach 6.4 million children under the age of
5 years. The 2nd-round campaign will be held at the end of June 2005.
Risks:
All cases, including those most recently confirmed, have occurred in
contiguous districts within the provinces targeted for the mop-up
response.
While there is a risk that circulation of wild poliovirus may spread
to other areas, intensified AFP [acute flaccid paralysis]
surveillance has not detected cases outside the affected areas.

[The additional cases in contiguous districts does signal extension
of circulation of the wild poliovirus outside of the initial
geographic area of the outbreak. The 1st round of vaccination
activities that were implemented following the confirmation of the
1st case was conducted in 4 villages in the immediate area of the
case and covered 4000 children less than 5 years of age. The planned
mop-up vaccination activities for the end of May 2005 and end of June
2005 should cover a wide geographic area where there may still be
circulation of the wild poliovirus, and hopefully will result in the
interruption of transmission. Results of intensified AFP surveillance
in other provinces in Indonesia are not mentioned; as yet,
information on possible further spread is still pending. - Mod.MPP]
