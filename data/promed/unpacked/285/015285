Another death has been tied to an outbreak of the _Clostridium
difficile_ superbug in Ontario's Niagara region, hospital officials
say. A 3rd patient related to the _C. difficile_ outbreak at a
Welland, Ontario, hospital died Wednesday afternoon [6 Jul 2011], the
Niagara Health System said Thursday [7 Jul 2011]. At least 17 people
-- mainly elderly -- have died in the Niagara region since the
outbreak was declared 28 May 2011.

Sue Matthews, president and CEO of the Niagara Health System [NHS],
told reporters that the Ontario Ministry of Health offered a field
epidemiologist to help learn more about the outbreak. The
epidemiologist arrived in the region on Thursday afternoon, Matthews
said. Epidemiologists collect and analyze data to monitor trends in
the outbreak, she said. A field epidemiologist is helping [to
investigate] the outbreak, says Niagara Health System president and
CEO Sue Matthews. CBC

Robert Cyrenne, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada
[PHAC], said the agency sent a field epidemiologist in response to a
request from the Ontario government, acting on behalf of the Niagara
Region Public Health. "Upon request, PHAC regularly assists provinces
and territories by providing field epidemiologists," Cyrenne said. The
field epidemiologist is a federally-funded employee based in Toronto
and deployed as an additional resource for the outbreak, said Andrew
Morrison, a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of Health. The
federal agency can also collaborate with provincial and
infection-control experts to help prevent, diagnose and analyze
strains.

The Niagara region deaths include 10 at St Catharines General, 4 at
the Greater Niagara General, and 3 at the Welland Site. Outbreaks were
declared 23 Jun 2011 at the Greater Niagara General and Welland
sites.

On Wednesday [6 Jul 2011], a 4th health facility in the Niagara region
confirmed an outbreak. The Hotel Dieu Shaver Health and Rehabilitation
Centre said 4 of its patients tested positive within the past few
weeks, prompting officials to investigate further and declare the
outbreak. The other 2 patients are not part of the outbreak, said the
centre, which is not part of the Niagara Health System.

The federal government's help came as Ontario's associate chief
medical officer of health, Dr David Williams, said there were now 10
declared outbreaks in hospitals and one suspected. The hospitals are
in Guelph, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Napanee, Toronto, Welland,
Orangeville, Hamilton and Mississauga, the Canadian Press reported. An
outbreak, Williams said, could be as few as 2 cases in a ward, and
there are regularly 4 to 6 outbreaks happening in the province's
hospitals.

_C. difficile_ causes diarrhea and is one of the most common
infections in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Most cases of
_C. difficile_ hit people taking antibiotics. In severe cases, it can
cause critical illness and death in elderly or very sick patients.
People most at risk after exposure are typically of advanced age, and
with underlying illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease or
immunodeficiency, who are also taking antibiotics.

Another patient has died in relation to the _Clostridium difficile_
outbreak, the latest Friday [29 Jul 2011] morning at St Catharine's
General Hospital.

This brings the total of _C. difficile_-related deaths in Niagara to
35 -- including 6 community-acquired cases -- since the 1st outbreak
was declared by Niagara Health System (NHS) on 28 May [2011].

Sue Matthews, NHS interim president and CEO, assured the community the
health system is not taking its eye off the ball and is on track to
end the outbreak. "We're working to do better for our community. We
will do better," she said.

Cleaning of the in-patient areas at Welland, St Catharine's and
Niagara Falls hospitals has been completed and crews are now working
to clean the out-patient and public areas including lobbies and
washrooms, Matthews said. All 3 hospitals are expected to be finished
by Thursday [4 Aug 2011]. Cleaning procedures have also begun at the
NHS's smaller sites and are expected to be completed in the next 2 to
3 weeks, Matthews said.

Staff in hospital emergency departments, she said, have been
"vigilant" in assessing and isolating patients who come in with signs
and symptoms of _C. difficile_-associated disease [CDAD]. Tools have
also been put in place to help staff assess whether they themselves
are experiencing any symptoms of the disease.

Matthews said there are still people who refuse to wash their hands
when entering the hospitals. Some have even gone so far as to cross
their arms, telling staff to "make me" when asked to clean their hands
before entering, she said. The NHS "cannot say enough, cannot remind
people enough" about the importance of proper hand washing to help
stop the spread of CDAD, she said. Whether it's in the hospital or out
in the community, hand washing will help to keep the disease under
control, she added.

[_Clostridium difficile_-associated disease (CDAD) is a spectrum of
potentially fatal illnesses that includes diarrhea, pseudomembranous
colitis, and toxic megacolon. _C. difficile_ is the most common cause
of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized
patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk
factor associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_.

The Niagara Health System (NHS) is located in the Niagara region of
southern Ontario, Canada, between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and is
Ontario's largest multi-site hospital system. NHS is comprised of 7
sites across the 12 municipalities that make up the Regional
Municipality of Niagara, namely the Douglas Memorial Site in Fort
Erie; Greater Niagara General; Site in Niagara Falls;
Niagara-on-the-Lake Site; Ontario Street Site in St. Catharine's; Port
Colborne Site; St Catharine's General Site; and Welland Site
(http://www.niagarahealth.on.ca/services/). However, the exact
number of NHS facilities involved in the CDAD outbreak is not stated
in the most current (2nd) news release above, but the 1st news release
says that the outbreak was not restricted just to the NHS group of
healthcare facilities and that 10 hospitals were involved at that
time. This is not surprising, since patients discharged from one
institution after a bout of CDAD may be subsequently admitted to
another institution in the region with a relapse of the infection.
Relapse rates for CDAD can be as high as 25 percent.

The news releases also do not state whether there is one or more
genotypes involved in the regional outbreak and if the hypervirulent
strain ribotype 027 is involved. Although we are not given the total
number of patients infected, 35 deaths suggest there may be a high
case-fatality rate. That and the occurrence of community-acquired
cases suggest that ribotype 027 may be present.

Recent outbreaks of CDAD with increased severity, high relapse rate,
and significant mortality, have been related to the emergence of a
new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North America, Japan, and
Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces toxins A and B, is
referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1 and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) ribotype 027. This epidemic strain is
characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use of which is
one risk factor for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy D, Kyne L,
O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in fluoroquinolone-resistant
_Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg Infect Dis 2007; 13(3):504-5.
Available at http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm). This
strain is also referred to as the "Quebec strain" (see
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/infDis/Cdiff_ICHE08_05.pdf).

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities
involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized
patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection
control measures, including prompt isolation of patients with _C.
difficile_-positive diarrhea, or cohorting where isolation rooms are
not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene and
control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents
(http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF).
