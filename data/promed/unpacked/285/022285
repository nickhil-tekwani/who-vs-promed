Three children are in hospital after an outbreak of meningococcal disease at Gladstone in central Queensland.

One child is in a serious condition in Brisbane while the other two are stable in Rockhampton. It is believed one of the children attended a childcare centre in Gladstone while the other two have indirect links to the facility.

Queensland Health has provided antibiotics to people who had contact with the children. Health authorities say it is not a community-wide outbreak.

There have been 16 confirmed cases of the disease in Queensland this year.

[For a discussion of meningococcal disease, see ProMED-mail post: Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (CO) fatal 20100625.2115.

In a community outbreak of meningococcal disease, the cases should reside in the same geographic area, but are not close contacts of each other and do not share a common affiliation and the population at risk is the community population, which is used as the denominator in calculations of the disease attack rate (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). There are 3 patients with meningococcal disease in the city of Gladstone (population of about 29 000). The primary attack rate in this community is thus about 10 cases per 100 000, which meets the CDC definition of an outbreak of meningococcal disease in either an organization or community, which is the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of up to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate in the population at risk of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).
However, in the Gladstone outbreak, the 3 children are linked by association to the same childcare center, in which case the population at risk would be much smaller and the attack rate higher.

Gladstone is a coastal city in the state of Queensland, located approximately 550 km north of Brisbane and 100 km southeast of Rockhampton (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladstone,_Queensland). A map of Queensland on which Gladstone can be located can be found at the source URL above.
