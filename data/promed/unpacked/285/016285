We would like to inform you that our diagnostic laboratory at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in Newmarket, United Kingdom, has today (19 Sep 2013) confirmed a positive case of equine influenza in Cheshire, UK. The diagnosis was made following a positive qRT-PCR assay performed on a nasopharyngeal swab sample taken from a horse presenting with clinical signs.

This positive case follows diagnoses made by the AHT in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, East Yorkshire, and Lincolnshire during the last 18 days, and affecting multiple horses. No confirmed epidemiological link has so far been made between the different cases, although all have been linked to recent horse movement.

[The AHT website includes additional useful information for horse owners and veterinary surgeons.

Equine influenza is caused by 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses (genus _Influenzavirus_ A of the family _Orthomyxoviridae_): H7N7 (formerly subtype 1) and H3N8 (formerly subtype 2); however there have been very few reports of H7N7 subtype virus infections in the last 30 years.

In fully susceptible Equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia, nasal discharge, and a harsh dry cough; pneumonia in young foals and donkeys and encephalitis in horses have been described as rare events. Clinical signs associated with infection in dogs also include fever and a cough; occasionally infection results in suppurative bronchopneumonia and peracute death. Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The virus is spread by the respiratory route, and indirectly by contaminated personnel, vehicles and fomites. The incubation period in susceptible horses may be less than 24 hours. In partially immune vaccinated animals the incubation period may be extended, one or more clinical signs may be absent and spread of the disease may be limited. This makes clinical diagnosis of equine influenza more difficult as other viral diseases, such as equine herpesvirus-associated respiratory disease, may clinically resemble a mild form of influenza. Horses infected with equine influenza virus become susceptible to secondary bacterial infection and may develop mucopurulent nasal discharge, which can lead to diagnosis of bacterial disease with the underlying cause being overlooked.

Despite the occasional identification of seropositive persons with occupational exposure there is currently little evidence of zoonotic infection of people with equine influenza.
