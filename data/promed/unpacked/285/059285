1st report of Potato Wart Disease caused by _Synchitrium endobioticum_ in
Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
E. Cakir <emel_cakir@hotmail.com> Plant Protection Central Research
Institute, Bagdat Caddesi No 250, P.K 49, Yenimahalle, 06172, Ankara,
Turkey. Accepted for publication 29 Mar 2005.
During October 2003, Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) wart disease (PWD) was
detected for the 1st time on potato tubers in Aybasti county (Ordu province
in Black Sea Region), a non-economically important potato growing district.
In the same year, the disease was also found in Nigde and Nevsehir, 2
commercially-important potato growing provinces in central Anatolia. The
potato varieties Agria, Donella, Granola, Marfona and Russet Burbank grown
in Nigde and Nevsehir provinces were affected with the disease in very low
percentages (< 1 percent of all plants). In Ordu province, only a local
variety, grown for home consumption, showed disease symptoms.
Diseased plants exhibited typical symptoms on tubers that ranged from mild,
small to severe, large warts that completely transformed tubers into a dark
mass. Galls of various colors, including shades of green, yellow, but
mostly brown, appeared on tubers by the end of the season. Summer and
winter (resting) sporangia were observed from galls of different colors.
Resting sporangia were typical of the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_
(Se), having irregularly shaped, dark brown walls. They were aseptate,
light golden-brown, thick-walled, smooth, 40-50 mm in diameter and
spherical to ovoid in shape. Resting sporangia were isolated from infected
tubers and soil surrounding infected plants using a method developed.
Pathogenicity of the causal agent was proven by the Glynne-Lemmarzalh
method by inoculating the potato sprouts at 1-2 mm long with some fresh
wart tissue and incubating the plants at 18 ï¿½ 1 C. Sporangia were
re-isolated from the warts observed 2 months later. Non-inoculated controls
were symptomless.
PWD is now present in neighboring potato fields covering 907.7 and 23.3 ha
in Nevsehir and Nigde provinces, respectively, on land covering
approximately 10 ha in Ordu province.
This is the 1st report of PWD in Turkey. The Ministry of Agriculture has
been employing the EU (1969) Council Directive 69/464 of 8 Dec 1969 on
control of PWD. Disease surveys for this pathogen are continuing in Turkey.

[The most likely way PWD entered Turkey was by an accidental introduction
of wart-infected potato or by contaminated soil or equipment. PWD has
spread to most regions of the world where potatoes are cultivated.
_Synchitrium endobioticum_ affects cultivated potato and a number of wild
_Solanam_. It was once the most serious disease of potato in the UK but has
now been controlled by statutory measures and the development of "immune"
varieties.
It still poses a serious threat to potato production, because the spores of
the fungus can remain viable in contaminated soil for many years. New
strains of the fungus, capable of attacking potato varieties that were
previously resistant, have developed in several European countries.
Preventing spread of these strains to the UK is especially important.
