[These reports underscore the severity of the present outbreak in
northern Europe. Rarely do we see 30 or 50 new herds affected in
individual OIE report, whether the report is an immediate
notification or a periodic update.
The case fatality rates for sheep of 33.66 percent (cases = 101) and
76.27 percent (cases = 59) in the Belgium updates 5 and 6,
respectively, are also worth noting as signaling that this outbreak
will likely continue to have severe consequences for the livestock
populations in the affected northern European countries. Clearly, an
economic study is indicated, and, of course, the expertise for such a
study is readily available in the outbreak areas.
Maps can be seen on the individual OIE outbreak reports, or, if you
really want to appreciate the density of these infections, go to the
OIE summary map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_outbreak_map&disease_id=9>
