Saskatchewan health officials are advising the public to take precautions against hantavirus infections after reporting the 4th case and 2nd fatality of 2014 in a northern Saskatchewan adult.

They note that deer mice [_Peromyscus mainculatus_], the animal that carries the disease [virus], are present throughout Saskatchewan. [Sin Nombre] hantavirus is transmitted by breathing in contaminated airborne particles from the droppings, urine and saliva of infected deer mice.

"People should be aware of mouse droppings and nesting materials when cleaning buildings," Saskatchewan's Deputy Chief Medical Health Officer Denise Werker said. "Take precautions to prevent direct contact and inhalation of particles that may be contaminated."

"Symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome include fever, muscle aches, cough, headaches, nausea, and vomiting followed by shortness of breath and respiratory failure. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare but usually severe disease that can lead to death.

There have been 30 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome reported in Saskatchewan since 1994, 10 of which resulted in death.

A 41-year-old man had lived in Eagle County for only 2 months before [a] hantavirus [infection] killed him.

The man was from Mexico and was here on a work visa. His death makes him Eagle County's 1st case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome since 2005, said Jennifer Ludwig, the county's public health director.

Coroner Kara Bettis said Hernandez's manner of death was natural. He died a couple weeks ago, Bettis said. The investigation took that long because the Centers for Disease Control requires 2 sets of lab results to confirm a hantavirus death.

"Hantavirus causes death in approximately 40 percent of cases," Ludwig said.

The only other hantavirus case reported in the region this year [2014] was last month [July 2014] in Mesa County, confirmed by the Mesa County Health Department.

Hantavirus[es] are carried by deer mice, which are common to rural areas throughout Colorado, Ludwig said. Deer mice are brown on top with white bellies and have large ears. Common house mice are all gray, have smaller ears and don't carry hantavirus, Ludwig said. The virus does not spread from person to person, Ludwig said.

You can be infected if mouse urine and droppings that contain hantavirus are stirred up into the air and inhaled or if you touch urine, droppings or nesting materials that contain the virus then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. It can also be transmitted through a bite, Ludwig said.

Symptoms begin from 1-6 weeks after exposure and include high fever, severe body aches, headache and vomiting. Initially, there are no respiratory symptoms.

"Because no effective treatment exists for hantavirus, prevention is the key to avoiding infection," Ludwig said.

Colorado typically sees the most human cases of hantavirus in the spring and summer.

According to the CDC:
- Through 31 Dec 2013, a total of 637 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported in the United States.
- Of those, 606 cases occurred after 1993, following the initial identification of HPS; 31 cases were retrospectively identified.
- The state's 81 cases are the nation's 2nd-highest, behind New Mexico's 94.
- Cases have been reported in 34 states. More than 95 per cent of cases are in states west of the Mississippi River.
- About 3/4ths of patients with HPS have been residents of rural areas.
- 63 per cent of cases have been male, 37 per cent female, and 78 per cent are white.
- The mean age of confirmed case patients is 37 years (range: 6-83 years).
- In 2013, 43 per cent of all HPS cases were fatal.

[Although not stated in the 2 reports above, the virus involved in these cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) probably is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in Saskatchewan and Colorado. These reports are another reminder that cleaning in closed buildings that have been unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.
