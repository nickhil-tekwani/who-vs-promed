Tanahu District Health Office discovered 20 new leprosy cases in this
western district of Nepal during the 2nd quarter of the current fiscal year
[2005], beginning 16 Oct 2004. "Of the newly found leprosy patients, 5 are
women and 17 men," Basanta Adhikari, an official from the office, told
reporters on Saturday [14 May 2005]. The majority of the cases have been
found at Damauli bazaar and Peripheral village, Adhikari said, adding:
"Except 2, all of them are patients of normal leprosy." All of the patients
have started regular treatment at nearby health centers and health posts,
he added. About 28 leprosy patients were found in the same district last
year [2004].

[This news item indicates either 20 or 22 cases of disease due to
_Mycobacterium leprae_ during a single quarter, compared to 28 cases during
the preceding entire year or a more than 3-fold increase in apparent
incidence. The vast majority of the world's cases of leprosy occur in
India, China, Myanmar, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Madagascar, and Nepal.
There is a highly uneven distribution within endemic regions: areas of high
prevalence border areas with little or no disease.
Transmission of leprosy remains poorly understood, with nasal droplet
infection, contact with infected soil and insect vectors thought to play a
role. In endemic countries like Nepal, about half of leprosy patients have
a history of intimate (eg, household) contact with an infected person. More
information on this apparent outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.LM]
