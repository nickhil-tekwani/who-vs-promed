[Ref: D Pande et al: A novel maize-infecting mastrevirus from La Reunion Island. Archives of Virology (2012) 157, 1617-21; DOI: 10.1007/s00705-012-1314-y]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The genus _Mastrevirus_ of the family Geminiviridae contains species with circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes of approximately 2.7 kb. Mastreviruses infect a wide variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous hosts and are transmitted by leafhopper vectors. Monocot-infecting mastreviruses have previously been found throughout Africa (including the Southwest Indian Ocean [SWIO] islands), Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, Vanuatu, and Australia. Mastreviruses previously found on SWIO islands such as La Reunion and Mauritius include various _Maize streak virus_ (MSV) strains, _Sugarcane streak Reunion virus_ (SSRV) and _Sugarcane streak virus_ (SSV).

Despite extensive sampling, only MSV has until now been detected in maize with maize streak disease (MSD) symptoms. Here we report for the 1st time a 2nd, highly divergent, mastrevirus isolated from 2 maize plants displaying characteristic MSD-like symptoms, sampled on the SWIO La Reunion. The 2 isolates shared less than 57 percent genome-wide homology with all other known mastreviruses. We propose calling the new species Maize streak Reunion virus.

[2] _Citrus tristeza virus_ - Oman: survey and new strains

[Ref: A Al-Sadi et al: Molecular characterization and potential sources of _Citrus tristeza virus_ in Oman. Plant Pathology (2012) 61, 632-40; DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-3059.2011.02553.x]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A study was conducted to characterize occurrence, molecular variability, and potential sources of _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV) in Oman. A survey during 2009 and 2010 showed that CTV occurs in most (91 percent) of the surveyed districts. Moderate to high levels of infection with CTV in lime were detected in northern Oman (15-63 percent) compared to the south (0-12 percent). This could be related to the continuous introduction of infected citrus germplasm in the north from abroad, where CTV was detected in 45 percent of citrus seedlings imported from Syria, Lebanon, India, Pakistan, and Egypt.

CTV was detected for the 1st time in sweet lime, sweet lemon, citron, mandarin, sweet orange, and sour orange and was found to be associated with stem pitting, stunting, leaf curling, and vein clearing symptoms in many of the infected trees and seedlings in Oman. Bi-directional reverse transcription-PCR analysis of the coat protein (CP) gene of 22 randomly selected CTV-positive samples provided evidence that severe strains of CTV exist in Oman. Cloning and sequencing the CP gene of 6 isolates showed that they have 91-100 percent nucleotide homology with each other and 96-99 percent with representative isolates from other parts of the world.

Phylogenetic analysis of the CTV isolates showed that 4 belong to CTV Group 4. However, 2 isolates formed a separate clade [and results] suggest that they constitute a new CTV phylogenetic group. It remains to be seen if these haplotypes [genetic variants] are widespread in Oman and associated with any particular symptomatology, or just represent some atypical CTV isolates.

Due to the high level of infection with CTV of imported citrus seedlings, strict quarantine measures need to be introduced and implemented in order to save the citrus industry in Oman. In-depth analysis of CTV diversity in Oman and neighbouring countries in the Arabian Peninsula is required, especially after uncovering the existence of CTV haplotypes from Oman creating a new phylogenetic group.

[3] Bean necrotic mosaic virus - Brazil: new _Tospovirus_
Date: June 2012

http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038634


[Ref: AS de Oliveira et al: Characterization of Bean necrotic mosaic virus: A member of a novel evolutionary lineage within the genus _Tospovirus_. PLoS ONE (2012) 7, e38634; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0038634]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tospoviruses (genus _Tospovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_) are responsible for significant worldwide crop losses. They have a tripartite negative and ambisense RNA genome. Transmission is by thrips in a circulative-propagative manner.

Biological (host range and symptomatology), serological, and molecular (sequencing and evolutionary studies) experiments were performed to characterize and differentiate Bean necrotic mosaic virus (BeNMV), which naturally infects common beans in Brazil. Based upon the results, BeNMV can be classified as a novel species and, together with Soybean vein necrosis-associated virus (SVNaV), represents a new evolutionary lineage within the genus _Tospovirus_.

The evidence suggests that 2 divergent lineages of tospoviruses are circulating in the American continent and, based on the main clades diversity (American and Eurasian lineages), new tospovirus species related to the BeNMV-SVNaV clade remain to be discovered.

Further studies may reveal greater tospovirus diversity not only in the Americas (where both viruses were reported), but also throughout the world, increasing the [potential] economic impact [of tospoviruses] on agriculture.

[4] Soybean vein necrosis virus - USA: update
Date: Fri 24 Aug 2012

A new virus to notice in soybeans
---------------------------------
If you've been monitoring soybean fields for late-season pests, you may have noticed large, brown, blotchy lesions that run in the direction of the leaf veins. That symptom is characteristic of a new disease of soybean called Soybean vein necrosis virus, or SVNV.

A 2010 survey of soybean fields conducted by Les Domier, University of Illinois, showed that the disease is found throughout Illinois and is the 2nd-most prevalent virus found in Illinois soybean fields, right after _Bean pod mottle virus_. That is an amazing feat for a pathogen that not only causes a new disease but also is itself a newly described virus.

The virus is transmitted to soybean by the insect thrips. Domier notes that SVNV is in the tospo family of viruses, unusual in that they replicate not only in an infected plant but also in their thrips vectors. So thrips that are carrying SVNV can transmit it for a long time.

Symptoms of SVNV in Illinois typically start showing up in August, which is certainly the case this year [2012]. Initial studies and observations in Arkansas note that symptoms do vary with the cultivar, as we seem to be seeing here. Let's hope that this points to a source of genetic resistance, as has been the case for other pathogens.

[Mastreviruses
-------------
Until now, the African streak virus group of the mastreviruses included _Maize streak virus_ (MSV; type species of genus _Mastrevirus_), _Sugarcane streak virus_ (SSV), _Sugarcane streak Reunion virus_ (SSRV) and _Panicum streak virus_ (PanSV). Mastreviruses are important pathogens of cereal crops and are transmitted by leafhopper vectors (family _Cicadellidae_). MSV and the new species described in item [1] above with the preliminary name of Maize streak Reunion virus (MSRV) are the only 2 mastreviruses reported in maize. A possible synergistic enhancement of disease in coinfections of the 2 maize viruses needs to be considered. Since MSRV is highly divergent from the other members of the group, it will be important to investigate its epidemiology and host range so that its threat to maize production can be assessed.

Citrus tristeza
---------------
_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses. Besides citrus species (family of _Rutacea_), it affects hosts in only few other families, and it appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in severity and may occur singly or in combination. Symptoms also depend on the citrus variety and the scion- rootstock combination. The virus is spread by several aphid species and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. Disease management for CTV includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum, and vector control. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas, and thus the identification of a new phylogenetic group in Oman in item [2] is an important finding.

Tospoviruses
------------
Tospoviruses (type member _Tomato spotted wilt virus_, TSWV) are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of infecting a large range of crops. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips species which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs and tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, and use of resistant crop cultivars. Due to their agricultural importance, research on tospoviruses has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new species are being found and many more can be expected to exist.

A previously unknown virus was first identified in Tennessee in 2008 and in Illinois and Kentucky in 2009 (see ProMED-mal post 20100922.3430) as the cause of a new disease of soybeans. Symptoms observed included vein clearing that becomes necrotic as leaves mature leading to large necrotic regions on leaves and reduced plant vigour. The name Soybean vein necrosis(-associated) virus (SVNV/SVNaV) was suggested and preliminary classification placed it in the genus _Tospovirus_. However, it had minimal similarity to previously characterised members of the genus and is now included in a new clade, together with the new Bean necrotic mosaic virus described in item [3]. SVNV was found to affect a range of soybean cultivars and may be widespread in parts of the US, but no information is available yet on its presence in other countries.

_Bean pod mottle virus_ (BPMV; genus _Comovirus_) mentioned in item [4] has been reported to cause more than 50 percent crop loss in soybeans in parts of the US (for more information on BPMV see link below).
