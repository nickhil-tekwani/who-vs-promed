Ducks culled in central Viet Nam for unidentifiable disease
-----------------------------------------------
Some 4000 ducks that had contracted an unknown disease were culled Thursday
[19 Oct 2006] in the Central Highlands province of Lam Dong, the local
animal health department reported. The department staff killed the
70-day-old poultry in Lam Dong's Duc Trong District, as they were bloated,
immobile, found to be thiamine-deficient, had tearing eyes and were passing
white feces.
Earlier, some 800 ducks of the same flock had died, of which over 300 died
in just one day. The animal department conducted tests of the ducks but
could not nail down the type or cause of the disease. The owner of the
flock admitted buying the newly-born ducks from a dubious source in Ho Chi
Minh City. The ducks had also been raised without being vaccinated, the
department added.
