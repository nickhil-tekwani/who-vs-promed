Legionnaires' disease has claimed a 5th life among patients and staff at a clinic in the northern province of Tucumán, provincial health officials announced Sunday [4 Sep 2022].

Tucumán's Health Ministry had announced 4 earlier deaths on Saturday [3 Sep 2022], all at the clinic in San Miguel de Tucumán, and said a total of 11 people had been infected by the rare, but severe, lung disease.

The latest death was that of a 64-year-old man with comorbidities, officials said.

Of the 6 others infected, 3 remain in hospital and the others are being monitored at home, said Luis Medina Cruz, the Tucumán health minister.

Local officials said they are examining the clinic's water supply and air-conditioning system.

The disease, which first appeared at a 1976 convention of the American Legion veterans group in the United States, has been linked to contaminated water and unclean aeration systems. Symptoms include high fever, aches, and trouble breathing.

The prestigious ANLIS-Malbrán research laboratory identified the disease as Legionnaires' after ruling out COVID-19, flu, and hantavirus.

https://msptucuman.gov.ar/el-ministro-anuncio-los-nuevos-criterios-de-inclusion-para-la-deteccion-del-brote-de-legionella-pneumophila/


The Minister announced the new inclusion criteria for the detection of the _Legionella_ outbreak. Within the framework of a new press conference, the person in charge of the sanitary portfolio, Dr. Luis Medina Ruiz, explained that the change in criteria includes patients, health personnel, and caregivers who have been in the private sanatorium in August [2022] or who have received a surgical intervention and have some compatible symptom, such as fever or respiratory symptoms.

"We want to inform you that, having a known etiology of this outbreak linked to the private sanatorium, we have considered, together with the minister of the nation, Dr. Carla Vizzotti, a change in the inclusion criteria within this outbreak. Initially, when we detected 2 patients with bilateral pneumonia that coincided with the common workplace, and we also could not find its etiology, that was what we had as inclusion criteria. Today, knowing that it is a bacterium that does not always cause bilateral pneumonia, we are including in the selection criteria for patients any health personnel, patient, or family caregiver who has been in [during] the month of August [2022] or who has received a surgical intervention in this private sanatorium and who has some compatible symptom such as fever or respiratory symptoms, not necessarily bilateral pneumonia," he reported.

"That is why today we are including at least 8 new patients, of which one is a patient, 2 are health personnel, and 5 are caregivers of patients who were hospitalized, post-surgical or with neurological problems. Of these 8 patients, there is one who has severe comorbidity, due to a cerebrovascular accident, and who is also suffering from pneumonia; he is the only one who is serious. We are very sorry for the death of the 2 patients yesterday, who were on mechanical respiratory assistance for their bilateral pneumonia and were very seriously ill with severe comorbidities. One of them was 81 years old and the other 64.

"In summary, today we have 6 deceased; 9 patients who are at home with outpatient medical follow-up, since the clinic they present is of moderate or mild severity; and 4 hospitalized patients, 2 of whom are seriously ill on mechanical ventilation (one patient is with a cannula and the other with room air without oxygen, but hospitalized for severe comorbidities), and we are waiting for the appearance, or not, of symptoms that allow them to continue in therapy or eventually be discharged from the hospital," he added.

Likewise, the official stressed that it is a bacterium that is not transmitted from person to person, and having found the cause gives them a lot of certainty about the measures to be taken. "Initially we had taken the measure of isolating the sanatorium without removing the patients, since not knowing the etiology it could have been a virus or a battery [bacterium?] that could have spread in the community. Knowing today that it is a bacterium has allowed us to take other measures regarding this outbreak."

Regarding the private sanatorium, the Minister stressed, "First of all, we have to analyze responsibility. Today the sanatorium closed; patients cannot enter, neither outpatients nor inpatients, and as of today or tomorrow, a team of experts will come; since _Legionella_ is not an easy-to-find bacterium, a special technique is needed."

At the same time, Medina Ruiz clarified that the Ministry carries out tests on the condition of the water -- if it is drinkable, if it has residual chlorine, if it has germs that have not been found -- since the conditions were within the adequate. "The public sector has a permanent epidemiological surveillance: in case of seriously ill patients, the cause is sought. That does not happen everywhere. Here, we saw patients who came from the private sector, we took action on the matter, and we have thoroughly investigated what the cause is. And not finding it is when all this is triggered. I think the next steps will depend on the findings in the coming weeks."

At the same time, he added, "There are no patients who are not related to the private sanatorium in the month of August [2022], and that is the situation where the limits are. Today we have a little more certainty. This disease has the characteristic that it is self-limited; it is very different from COVID that one does not know when it ends. With this bacterium, most people can have an asymptomatic or mild symptomatic picture, and it is self-limited. That means when the disease begins, the body itself limits it and cures it. They will not have relapses because they have no new contact with the germ," he detailed.

In the same way, he remarked, "Anyone who begins with symptoms such as fever, symptoms compatible with the flu: body aches, headache, cough, cold, dyspnea. In some patients, diarrheal pictures. We are going to control them for at least 2 weeks from the closure of the sanatorium, and there is no other person working inside until we are certain that there are no more patients.

Medina Ruiz remarked that the patients who are hospitalized are receiving a specific treatment. Pneumonia is a very frequent cause of death in older people, and with comorbidities, the cause is not always known, and that is every year and winter. Pneumonia is usually fatal, due to the influenza virus.

"Today, all the patients who are compromised are under strict surveillance, in therapy with professionals with a lot of experience, and of course we are going to have a very fluid communication with the family. It will be opportune; we are going to have a press conference once a day, and then with official communications when some relevant information appears," she warned.

Finally, the official explained, "The way this disease is spread is through water vapor, air conditioning, the shower when it disperses the water, when it is breathed. The bacteria do not enter through the mouth when one touches the water; it has a special way of contagion and entry into the body. In a certain way, it generates outbreaks, and this way of contagion does not give rise to inter-human contagion, that is, for the person next to me to become infected. They need a cloud of particles that enter the lung."

Legionellosis - Argentina: Outbreak at a glance
----------------------
As of 3 Sep 2022, a cluster of 11 cases of severe pneumonia, including 4 deaths, have been reported in San Miguel de Tucumán city, Tucuman Province, Argentina. _Legionella_ spp. was isolated in the samples from 4 cases. Legionellosis is a pneumonia-like illness that varies in severity from mild febrile illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia. Cases were initially reported as being pneumonia of unknown cause. _Legionella_ bacteria was identified as the causative organism on 3 Sep [2022].

All cases presented with bilateral pneumonia, fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, and dyspnea between 18 and 25 Aug 2022 and are epidemiologically linked to one health facility. Of the 11 cases, 8 are health workers of the facility, while 3 are patients of the health facility. Three of the 4 deaths were among health workers.

Health authorities are coordinating cluster investigation activities, active case-finding to identify additional cases, contact tracing, and public health activities to limit further spread.

Outbreak overview
--------------------------
On 29 Aug 2022, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of Argentina of a report from the Ministry of Public Health of Tucumán Province of a cluster of 6 cases of bilateral pneumonia without an etiological cause identified in San Miguel de Tucumán city, Tucuman Province, Argentina [1]. All 6 cases were linked to one private health facility in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán, with the onset of symptoms between 18 and 22 Aug 2022. The 6 cases included 5 health workers and one patient who was admitted to the clinic for an unrelated condition and then subsequently to the intensive care unit after developing pneumonia. In addition to bilateral pneumonia, all cases presented with fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, and dyspnea.

On 1 Sep [2022], 3 additional cases were identified through active case finding -- all health workers from the same private health facility, aged 30 to 44 years -- with similar signs and symptoms to the initial 6 cases identified [2]. The onset of symptoms for these cases was between 20 and 25 Aug 2022.

Between 2 and 3 Sep, 2 additional cases were identified, an 81-year-old male and a 64-year-old male, both with comorbidities, who were hospitalized and presented similar clinical presentation as the previous cases [3].

As of 3 Sep 2022, 11 cases have been identified, 4 of whom have died (3 health workers). Eight of the 11 reported cases are health workers of the same health facility. The median age of the cases is 45 years; 7 are male. Ten cases had underlying conditions and/or risk factors for severe disease, including the 4 reported deaths. Four cases are still hospitalized as of 3 Sep [2022]. Contacts of the cases are under follow-up, and to date, none have developed symptoms.

Laboratory results
-------------------
Blood, respiratory, and tissues samples were obtained from the 11 cases. Preliminary tests conducted at the local public health laboratory were negative for respiratory viruses and other viral, bacterial, and fungal agents. On 31 Aug [2022], samples from the initial 6 cases were sent to the National Reference Laboratory -- the Administration of National Laboratories and Health Institutes (Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud - ANLIS per its acronym in Spanish) -- for additional testing [4]. As of 3 Sep 2022, negative results have been obtained for COVID-19 (RT-PCR), influenza, detection of antibodies for _Coxiella_, urinary antigen for _Legionella_ spp., panel of 12 respiratory viruses, hantavirus (Elisa IgM), _Histoplasma_ (RT-PCR), _Yersinia pestis_ (PCR), and micro agglutination for leptospirosis.

Further analyses of 2 bronchoalveolar lavage samples by highly sensitive total DNA sequencing (metagenomics) found readings compatible with _Legionella_ spp. On 3 Sep 2022, ANLIS reported that amplification products of the 16S ribosomal gene for _Legionella_ spp. from the 2 samples of bronchoalveolar lavage sequenced by metagenomics and analyzed by 4 different bioinformatic methods produced results compatible with _Legionella pneumophila_. Confirmation of these results is expected upon completion of the sequencing processes. This laboratory result supports evidence compatible with Legionnaires' disease. Blood culture and seroconversion tests continue to be conducted to complement the diagnosis of _Legionella_ infection.

Epidemiology of legionellosis
--------------------------------
Legionellosis is a generic term describing the pneumonic and non-pneumonic forms of infection with the _Legionella_ species of bacteria. Legionellosis varies in severity from mild to serious and can sometimes be fatal.

Legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form, has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (but up to 16 days have been recorded in some outbreaks). It is an important cause of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, and although uncommon, Legionnaires' may cause outbreaks of public health significance. Initially, symptoms are fever, mild cough, loss of appetite, headache, malaise, and lethargy, with some patients also experiencing muscle pain, diarrhoea, and confusion. The severity of Legionnaires' disease ranges from a mild cough to rapidly fatal pneumonia. Untreated Legionnaires' disease usually worsens during the 1st week.

Mortality from legionnaires' disease depends on the severity of the disease, the use of antibiotic treatment, the setting where _Legionella_ was acquired, and whether the patient has underlying conditions, including immunosuppression. The death rate may be as high as 40-80% in untreated immunosuppressed patients and can be reduced to 5-30% through appropriate case management, depending on the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms. Overall, the death rate is usually between 5-10%.

Public health response
-------------------------
In response to the detection of the cluster of bilateral pneumonia, health authorities in Tucuman Province coordinated cluster investigation activities including the follow-up of cases, search for the source(s) of infection, active case-finding to identify additional cases, and contact tracing. Preliminary investigations indicated no secondary cases were identified.

As _Legionella_ spp. has been identified as the etiology of this outbreak, the following public health measures were implemented:
- Risk assessment and suspension of healthcare activities in the health facility
- Enhanced surveillance including active and passive case-finding
- Biological and environmental sampling, laboratory testing, including bacteria isolation, and metagenomics
- Case isolation and clinical care of patients
- Contact identification, support ,and monitoring
- Risk communication

With the support of national health authorities, environmental samples are being collected to define the source of contamination and urgently implement prevention and control measures. The health authorities are also implementing internal and external communication strategies for health professionals and the community.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO is providing technical support for the outbreak investigation, including advice on sampling, environmental assessment, clinical management, and infection and prevention control (IPC) measures.

WHO risk assessment
------------------------
Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to _Legionella_ species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. The most common form of transmission of legionellosis is inhalation of contaminated aerosols from contaminated water sources. Sources that have been linked to both the transmission of _Legionella_ via aerosols and outbreaks of legionellosis include air conditioning cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, hot and cold water systems, humidifiers, and whirlpool spas. Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients. To date, there is no reported direct human-to-human transmission.

Sporadic outbreaks of legionellosis pneumonia have been reported in Argentina before. There are robust surveillance activities being implemented in the affected health facility. Nonetheless, in the absence of an identified source of _Legionella_ bacteria, the risk of developing legionellosis for people working or hospitalized at the same health facility is currently moderate. Countries with cases of legionellosis reported after travel to Argentina should notify their regional IHR focal point.

WHO advice
--------------
WHO recommends the continuation of laboratory analyses, case identification and clinical care, contact tracing, outbreak investigation to identify the source(s), implementation of measures to prevent further infections, and enhancement of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. IPC measures in health facilities have been enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic and should be reinforced to prevent healthcare-associated transmission. Precautions that are recommended for COVID-19 should continue to be followed.

WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider. WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Argentina based on the current information available on this event.

[The _Legionella_ pneumonia outbreak at a hospital in Tucumán, Argentina, according to prior news reports, total 11 affected individuals, now including 6 deaths, involving both inpatients and hospital staff. However, the 2nd news item above says the inclusion criteria were expanded to include both pneumonic (legionnaires' disease) and non-pneumonic (Pontiac fever) forms of legionellosis, which resulted in 8 additional cases, of which one is an inpatient, 2 are healthcare personnel, and 5 are caregivers of inpatients.

An earlier news report (ProMED post Undiagnosed pneumonia - Argentina (03): (TU) fatal, legionnaires' dis., conf., RFI 20220904.8705398) said that samples taken from 4 patients affected by the pneumonia outbreak in Tucumán tested positive for _Legionella_: _Legionella_ was identified by PCR in respiratory specimens from 3 patients and a puncture [lung?] biopsy in one of the deceased. The results for the other patients were still pending.

However, the WHO report above gives a more detailed description of the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of this nosocomial outbreak that is now being attributed to _L. pneumophila_, based on amplification of the 16S ribosomal gene for _Legionella_ spp. from 2 samples of bronchoalveolar lavage. Nevertheless, urinary antigen assays for _Legionella_ spp, which detects _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, were negative for an unspecified number of the patients. As yet, the source of the outbreak is unknown.

Genotyping the clinical _Legionella_ isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes of the clinical isolates match each other, and genotyping environmental _Legionella_ isolates will identify the environmental source if their genotypes match the genotype of isolates of the individual cases.

We await further reports on investigations of this nosocomial outbreak to clarify some inconsistencies, give results of still pending laboratory tests, identify a source(s), and enumerate any additional cases. - Mod.ML
