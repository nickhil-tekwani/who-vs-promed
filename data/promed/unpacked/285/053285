The Indiana State Department of Health says its staff have confirmed that 3 people have been infected with _Escherichia coli_. The confirmation, on Friday 14 Aug 2015, comes as the department investigates reports of diarrheal illness in 3 Indiana counties. Health Department officials say the agency is working with public health officials in Fulton, Wabash, and Marshall counties to determine the cause of illness in the 3 other individuals. The 6 cases currently known include 1 death.

Officials say family members and others who may have been in contact with the 6 are being monitored for diarrheal illness.

Families want answers after 2 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ [O157] surfaced in several Indiana counties. Now, the department is looking into 3 other suspected cases.

Investigators initially pointed to a local day care, but the state is looking at other possibilities. The investigation comes on the heels of [the death last week of a] 9 year old girl from Rochester. Family members say she died from _E. coli_ and she didn't go to a day care. The State Department of Health says they're investigating reports of a death, but it's too early to say she died from the bacterium.

A couple dozen people came to the Rochester courthouse advocating change -- including the family of 3 year old twins who spent weeks at Riley Hospital for Children. Doctors told them they [had] got _E. coli_ from something they ate. The boys didn't go to a day care either. The family says they don't want this to happen to anyone else.

Again, the State Department of Health says it's too early to tell if the 9 year old died from _E. coli_. At this point, it's just the 2 confirmed cases -- 1 in Fulton County and 1 in Wabash County. There is no official word on where the 3 suspected cases are located.

[With cases in different counties, it is likely that these cases are related to a food vehicle or a common exposure such as a petting zoo. We await more information, including whether the strains are genetically related.

The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 per cent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.

Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly, and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.

As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.

A number of studies have studied Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).
