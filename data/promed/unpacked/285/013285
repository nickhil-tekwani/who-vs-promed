POULT ENTERITIS AND MORTALITY SYNDROME (PEMS), TURKEYS - USA
=============================================================

Business news carried on wire service reports on 23 Apr 1997 said that the
second largest turkey producer in the U.S. had charged off $1.5 million in
the Third Quarter of 1996 to combat PEMS -- poult enteritis and mortality
syndrome, which had killed about 2 million turkeys in both 1995 and 1996.
The outbreaks of this disease prompted the company in March 1997 to cut
turkey production (total cut, one-third) at 45 of its 151 farms in North
Carolina because of previous losses it incurred from the disease.
The disease, not thought harmful to humans, affects young turkeys.
Laboratory tests at N.C. State University have suggested that darkling
beetles, chickens and flies are carriers. This theory has not been tested
out on the turkey farms, which have been advised to institute greater
security on the farms, not allowing persons to enter premises at will.
[PEMS was first recognized in the fall of 1991. It has a marked seasonal
distribution with problems reserved for the very hot months of the year
i.e. May to October in North Carolina. Some investigators believe the
disease is caused by a coronavirus but, as time goes on, the conclusion
that the disease is a multifactorial etiology becomes increasingly
attractive. This is an excellent example of the emergence of a disease in a
non-human populations. Even though surveillance in turkey populations is in
the hands of a small number of trained invididuals and turkey surveillance
is passive by design, the effect of this disease on the turkeys and now on
the producers resists being overlooked. After several years of high
mortality, one could not miss the impact of this disease and it very
unsettling because we are unable to control it as of now. - Mod. pc]
