An IDP [international displaced persons] camp north of Raqqa [Ar Raqqah], Syria, has reported 60 cases of German measles (rubella) in the past few days, according to a Shaam Network report (computer translated). The cases were reported in children and some adults. One death of a child was reported.

The Ain Issa camp, about 50 km [31 mi] north of Raqqa, includes about 3000 tents and is inhabited by more than 20 000 displaced people from Raqqa and Deir Al-Zour.

Rubella, or German measles, infection in people is typically mild. However, in pregnant women, rubella can cause death or birth defects such as cataracts, deafness, glaucoma, and heart, lung, and brain abnormalities in an unborn baby (fetus) during the 1st few months of pregnancy.

Rubella is a highly contagious disease. People who are infected with rubella are infectious from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the rash appears. It is transmitted through airborne droplet or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.

[Rubella is generally a mild disease in children; the primary medical danger of rubella is the infection of pregnant women because it can cause congenital rubella syndrome in developing babies. Before a vaccine against rubella became available in 1969, rubella epidemics happened every 6-9 years, usually among children 5-9 years old, along with many cases of congenital rubella. Thanks to immunization, there are far fewer cases of rubella and congenital rubella.

Most rubella infections today appear in young, non-immunized adults rather than in kids. In fact, experts estimate that 10 per cent of young adults are currently susceptible to rubella, which could pose a danger to any children they might have someday.

Congenital rubella syndrome can have potentially devastating consequences for the developing fetus. Children who are infected with rubella before birth are at risk for growth problems, intellectual disability, defects of the heart and eyes, deafness; and liver, spleen, and bone marrow problems (excerpted and edited from http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/german-measles.html).

According to the WHO European office, 2.6 million Syrians fled their homes for safer parts of the country last year (2017). That's about 7700 displacements per day  --  one of the highest rates in the world. In total, after almost 7 years of conflict, more than 6.1 million people have been uprooted inside the country.

While rubella cases are not common, displaced Syrians had little access to health care while dislocated, and consequently children were not vaccinated. In partnership with donors like the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) and the Government of Norway, WHO has been supporting NGOs to provide health assistance in 7 camps in Raqqa and Hassakah governorates. In the last 3 months of 2017, 13 partners provided more than 216 000 medical consultations in camps, informal settlements and host communities across north eastern Syria.

Syria Immunization Group (SIG), a confederation of health organizations coordinated by WHO, has been working to make sure children in war-torn northern Syria don't miss out on vaccinations. Despite airstrikes, sniper fire, and destroyed roads, SIG teams have managed to vaccinate millions of children against polio, measles, and other diseases in the past 2 years. - Mod LK
