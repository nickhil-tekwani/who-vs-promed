The agricultural authorities in the village of San Juancito (Teorama)
[Norte de Santander department (state/province equivalent)] have
expressed concern over the unexpected death of some cattle. "According
to the characteristics it is thought to be an outbreak of blackleg,"
they reported.

[Personnel from] the Colombian Agriculture and Livestock Institute
[ICA by its initials in Spanish] is already in the area to monitor
cases and provide recommendations to cattle producers.

A commission composed of the professionals Pedro Jesus Suarez Pacheco
and Gustavo Alonso Jacome Alvarez visited the region to analyze the
problem.

"6 animals were found suffering from an outbreak of blackleg and we
immediately began treatment. We know there are other places to the
north [of Teorama] where farmers have expressed their concerns," said
Suarez Pacheco.

Blackleg is an infection caused by a bacterium that causes swelling
in the muscles, generalized swelling, fever, depression, and
prostration. "They fall and die in these places. The causative agent
is in the environment; when the animal is stressed by cold or heat,
moisture, nutritional factors, lack of water and climate change, [it
becomes ill]" said Torcoroma Esperanza Ramirez Arenas, director of
ICA.

[Blackleg is an acute, febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by
_Clostridium chauvoei_ (feseri) characterized by emphysematous
swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found worldwide.

_C. chauvoei_ is found naturally in the intestinal tract of animals.
It probably can remain viable in the soil for many years, although it
does not actively grow there. Contaminated pasture appears to be a
source of organisms. Outbreaks of blackleg have occurred in cattle on
farms in which recent excavations have been made, which suggests that
soil disturbance may activate latent spores. The organisms probably
are ingested, pass through the wall of the GI tract, and after gaining
access to the bloodstream, are deposited in muscle and other tissues.

In cattle, blackleg infection is endogenous, in contrast to malignant
edema. Lesions develop without any history of wounds, although
bruising or excessive exercise may precipitate some cases. Commonly,
the animals that contract blackleg are of the beef breeds, in
excellent health, gaining weight, and usually the best animals of
their group. Outbreaks occur in which a few new cases are found each
day for several days. Most cases are seen in cattle from 6-24 months
old, but thrifty calves as young as 6 weeks and cattle as old as 10-12
years may be affected. The disease usually occurs in summer and fall
and is uncommon during the winter. In sheep, the disease is not
restricted to the young, and most cases follow some form of injury
such as shearing cuts, [tail] docking, crutching [the removal of wool
around the ewe's rear end and belly in preparation for breeding], or
castration. Endogenous blackleg in sheep is uncommon in the USA; it is
much more common in New Zealand where blackleg is seen more frequently
in sheep than in cattle.

Usually, onset is sudden, and a few cattle may be found dead without
premonitory signs. Acute lameness and marked depression are common.
Initially, there is a fever but, by the time clinical signs are
obvious, body temperature may be normal or subnormal. Characteristic
edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder, chest,
back, neck, or elsewhere. At first, the swelling is small, hot, and
painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling enlarges,
there is crepitation on palpation, and the skin becomes cold and
insensitive as the blood supply to the area diminishes. General signs
include prostration and tremors. Death occurs in 12-48 hours. In some
cattle, the lesions are restricted to the myocardium and the
diaphragm, with no reliable antemortem evidence of the localized
lesion.

A bacterin (a suspension of killed or attenuated bacteria for use as
a vaccine) containing _C. chauvoei_ and _C. septicum_ is safe and
reliable for both cattle and sheep. Calves should be vaccinated twice,
2 weeks apart, at 2-6 months of age, in high-risk areas; revaccination
may be necessary at 1 year and every 5 years thereafter. When
outbreaks are encountered, all susceptible cattle should be vaccinated
and treated prophylactically with penicillin to prevent new cases,
which may develop for up to 10 days, at which the bacterin provides
protection. In some areas, multicomponent clostridial vaccines are
warranted. Treatment of clinical cases with parenteral and multiple
local injections of penicillin may be attempted but is frequently
unsuccessful.

This disease does not appear on the list of diseases reportable to
OIE.
