Canada (Manitoba): human cases; most unaware they have West Nile
----------------------------------------------------------------
The vast majority of people with West Nile virus have no idea they're
infected, a new study shows.
Of 1200 blood samples submitted to a team of Manitoba public health workers
and scientists, 3.2 per cent of people had antibodies to West Nile virus.
Of those who tested positive, 85 per cent didn't know they were infected,
and 62 per cent reported no fever symptoms.
This doesn't mean people are developing an immunity to the virus or those
already infected will be immune to future infection, said Dr Neil Simonsen,
an infectious disease adviser for the Public Health Agency of Canada. "We
don't know how long the antibodies survive, and, if they do provide
protection, how long they provide protection," he said.
"Even if people know they have antibodies, protective measures are still
important, because we cannot guarantee that they are immune, although the
likelihood is that they are."
2 elderly Manitobans died after contracting West Nile virus in 2003, and
others spent many months recovering from the virus. About 20 per cent of
infected people get a flu-like illness, and a small number get serious
brain infections.
The survey was conducted last year [2004], with 1500 random telephone
interviews of residents in 5 southwestern Manitoba communities and testing
of blood samples submitted by 1200 of those respondents. The study found no
correlation between infection rates and age or sex.
Most respondents were aware the virus is spread by mosquitoes, but fewer
knew all measures they should take to prevent contracting West Nile. Only
1/3rd said limiting time outside during dusk and dawn reduces the risk.
"Overall, (the survey) supports the message that people should be taking
protective measures in terms of reducing their exposure to mosquitoes,"
said Dr Elise Weiss, medical officer of health with the Brandon and
Assiniboine Regional Health Authorities.
Other measures include wearing light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, using
mosquito repellent, and eliminating standing water. In addition, Winnipeg
announced yesterday [12 Jul 2005] it will start fogging for mosquitoes
tomorrow. The fogging has traditionally sparked protests from residents who
worry about the effect of malathion on human health. But city officials say
that buffer zones will be respected.

[Scientists are still working on human immunity against WNV. Currently,
there is no WNV vaccine available for humans. The WNV vaccine for horses
has been licensed. The effectiveness of this vaccine in preventing West
Nile virus infections in horses has yet to be fully evaluated. There is
hope that a vaccine will become available in the next few years. - Mod.RY]
