First case of BSE in the Netherlands

Friday 21March one BSE-case in the Netherlands was confirmed. It is the
first confirmed case of BSE in the Netherlands.
The dairyfarmer (living in the village of Wilp in the province of
Gelderland) consulted his veterinarian in the second week of March because
the cow behaved distressed. The veterinarian suspected BSE.
The brains of the five year old cow were invstigated at the Institute of
Animal Health (ID-DLO) in Lelystad because of BSE-suspicion. The
dairy-farmer had a herd of 110. The entire herd are culled and their heads
will be investigated at ID-DLO for the disease. Also blood and
urine-samples were taken. All the relatives of the cow were traced back
through the computerized identification and registration-system that is used
in the Netherlands. Most of the relatives were still at the farm where the
BSE-cow lived.
The cow's name is Anja 3. She is a daughter of the dairy-cow Anja (already
dead, lived at the same farm) and the Holstein-Frisian AI (artificial
insemination)-bull Cowboy (already dead, imported from Germany) whose roots
go back to the United States. Mother Anja had one other daughter (Anja 4,
lived at the same farm), one granddaughter (Anja 6, lived at the same farm)
and one son (already dead).
Anja 3's grand-mother and grand-grand-mother (both dead) lived at the same
farm in Wilp.
Anja 3 gave birth to one still living daughter (Anja 5) and two already
slaughtered steercalves.
Three calves that originate from the grandmother were traced at two other
farms. They also were culled and their brains will be examined.
Not much yet known about the feed-providers. Investigation into that is done
by the Inspection of the ministry of Agriculture.
Research into the infection routes (according to the ministry of Agriculture):
1 - contaminated feed
2 - maternal infection
3 - 'spontanuous' BSE
Ruminant's MBM was banned in the Netherlands in 1989.
