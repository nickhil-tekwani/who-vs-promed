McDonald R, Dufort E, Jackson BR, et al. Notes from the field: Blastomycosis cases occurring outside of regions with known endemicity -- New York, 2007-2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In October 2017, the New York State Department of Health was alerted by Albany-area infectious disease physicians about local cases of blastomycosis, including multiple severe infections, in the state health department's Capital District, an area where _Blastomyces_ spp. fungi are not considered endemic. The majority of patients reported no travel to regions where blastomycosis is known to be endemic, prompting a state investigation of the disease. Blastomycosis is reportable in only 5 states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin); it is not reportable in New York. To evaluate New York blastomycosis trends, statewide health care data were reviewed for the period 2007-June 2017, and incidence in one county in the Capital District was found to be particularly high. Although not a reportable disease, as an emerging infectious disease in New York, suspected blastomycosis should be reported to local health departments where patients reside.

Blastomycosis is an uncommon and underdiagnosed disease caused by inhalation of _Blastomyces_ spp. fungi, which grow in moist soil and organic matter. Based on reports of animal and human cases, _Blastomyces_ spp. are thought to be endemic in areas of North America along the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, Ohio, and Saint Lawrence River valleys (1). Unlike the similar fungal diseases coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis, a skin test has not been available to assess geographic distribution of exposure. Data regarding blastomycosis in New York are limited, with reports of canine infections suggesting endemicity along the Saint Lawrence River on the New York-Canada border (2). Outdoor exposures and proximity to waterways have been associated with the disease; however, little about its ecology and epidemiology is known.

Pneumonia is the most common manifestation of blastomycosis. Approximately half of blastomycosis infections can be asymptomatic; however, infection can lead to severe and fatal disease, often from respiratory failure. Disseminated infection can involve any organ, often including cutaneous abscesses and osteomyelitis, and is frequently accompanied by fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Blastomycosis is treated with antifungal medications, typically itraconazole or another azole for mild or moderate disease and lipid formulations of amphotericin B for severe disease.

Delays in diagnosis of more than 1 month have been observed in more than 40% of patients (3), suggesting that a diagnosis of blastomycosis is often not considered until after other treatments have failed. Blastomycosis diagnosis can be confirmed by fungal culture, with the optimal specimen source depending on the type of infection. Pulmonary blastomycosis can be detected on sputum and lower respiratory cultures. _Blastomyces_ spp. also can be identified on histopathology. Polymerase chain reaction can be used to confirm culture or histopathologic identification and on blood to detect disseminated disease. _Blastomyces_ spp. antigen and antibody tests can aid in diagnosis, although clinicians should be aware that these tests have limited sensitivity and can cross-react with _Histoplasma capsulatum_ and other fungi (4).

A 2012 epidemiologic and ecologic review found that in Illinois and Wisconsin, where blastomycosis is considered endemic, the range of annual incidence was 0.4-2.6 cases per 100 000 population (1). To evaluate New York blastomycosis trends, statewide hospital, emergency department, and hospital-associated outpatient International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System data set were reviewed for the period 2007-June 2017. During 2007-2015, blastomycosis ICD codes were identified for an annual mean of 24 (range = 17-30) patients (average annual incidence = 0.1 cases per 100 000 population). In 2016, blastomycosis ICD codes were identified for 59 patients (incidence = 0.2 cases per 100 000). Preliminary data from the first 6 months of 2017 include 25 patients, above the previous annual mean. Incidence in one county along the Mohawk River in the Capital District was particularly high, with a mean of 2.2 cases per 100 000 (range = 0-6.1) during 2007-2016. Travel and exposure information were not available.

Although ICD codes likely involve misclassification, identifying only a small proportion of infections, these data, combined with case reports, indicate that blastomycosis might be endemic in eastern upstate New York. These findings, along with reported cases of blastomycosis in Texas, Kansas, Nebraska (5), and Vermont (6), highlight limitations of the existing blastomycosis endemic map (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/blastomycosis/causes.html) and the need for better data.

Active blastomycosis case finding is underway in New York, as is investigation of passively reported cases to assess common exposures, better characterize risk factors, and evaluate a possible common source associated with the high incidence in the county along the Mohawk River. Although blastomycosis is not currently a reportable disease, health care providers and health care facilities should report suspected cases as an emerging infectious disease in New York to local health departments where patients reside. To prevent delays in diagnosis, which can lead to more severe illness and death, clinicians, and laboratorians should be aware that blastomycosis can be acquired in areas outside of regions where the disease is considered endemic and to consider the diagnosis in patients with compatible signs and symptoms.

[The following is extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Blastomycosis - USA: (WI) tubing, RFI 20150802.3553390:

"Blastomycosis is a potentially fatal infection caused by the soil-based dimorphic fungus _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, which exists in the environment at ambient temperature as a mold and in the animal host at body temperature as a yeast. The fungus likely resides in moist soil with decomposing organic debris. It appears that only under quite specific conditions of humidity, temperature and nutrition can the fungus grow and produce the infecting spores. The spores become airborne when soil in which the fungus is growing is disturbed. Fungal spores may be inhaled and initiate an acute or chronic lung infection, which, if untreated, may disseminate to the skin, bone, joints, urinary tract, prostate, and brain. The incubation period can range from 3 weeks to 3 months, but many infected people remain asymptomatic.

"The diagnosis of blastomycosis is based on isolation of _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ from specimens obtained from sputum, skin, or tissue biopsy (growth of organisms in cultures may take at least 4 weeks), or the demonstration of characteristic broad-based budding yeast cells by direct microscopic examination of wet unstained clinical specimens, cytology preparations, or histopathology slides. PCR-based assays may also be available to detect DNA of _B. dermatitidis_ in cultures or clinical specimens (http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/5/1783.full). The drug itraconazole is used to treat mild or moderate disease and amphotericin B is used for patients with central nervous system involvement, patients who are severely immunocompromised, or patients who do not respond to itraconazole therapy (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/12/1801/296953). Blastomycosis more commonly affects people involved with outdoor activities, in proximity to waterways (http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4528.pdf), and the symptoms may be more severe in people with a weakened immune system.

"The infection is endemic throughout much of the Midwestern USA, including the area on both the Canadian and US sides of the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River valley. Most cases are sporadic, but cluster of cases have occurred in a close geographic area within a short period of time."

Although blastomycosis is not nationally notifiable in the US, it is now reportable in 5 US states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/fungal-disease-reporting-table.html).

The study above identified cases of blastomycosis by their residence in New York state, but for the most part apparently a history of travel to known endemic locations that could have exposed patients to possible environmental sources, which are usually characterized as disturbed soil that contains decomposing organic matter, common in damp wooded areas, was not available. However, the study did note an outbreak of blastomycosis that occurred in the Capital District of the US state of New York in 2017 where most patients had no history of travel to regions where blastomycosis is known to be endemic; the study also noted the incidence of blastomycosis was especially high in one county (not further specified in the above study, but possibly Schenectady county) "along the Mohawk River in the Capital District" during 2007-2016. A map showing the location of Schenectady County can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/PtUfAANVTxs.

The Capital District, also known as the Capital Region, with a population of almost 1.2 million residents (2013), refers to the metropolitan area surrounding the city of Albany, the capital of the New York State and includes the 4 core counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_District,_New_York). The city of Albany is located on the west bank of the Hudson River approximately 10 miles (16 km) south of the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers. The Mohawk River is a 149-mile-long [about 240 km] tributary of the Hudson River; it flows east through the Mohawk Valley, passing by the cities of Rome, Utica, Little Falls, Canajoharie, Amsterdam, and Schenectady before entering the Hudson River (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_River). A map showing the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_River#/media/File:Hudsonmap.png. The Mohawk Valley region of the New York State is the area surrounding the Mohawk River, west of the Capital Region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_Valley_region#/media/File:Map_of_New_York_Economic_Regions.svg) and includes 6 counties (Oneida, Herkimer, Fulton, Montgomery, Otsego, and Schoharie) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Regions_of_New_York_(state)). - Mod.ML
