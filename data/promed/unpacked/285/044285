The European Union pledged USD 100 million in aid to boost the global
fight against bird flu on Friday and Turkey stepped up the culling of
birds to try to stop the deadly virus spreading further. Following
are the latest key facts about the status of bird flu in Europe:
France - France said on Friday it was extending its poultry
confinement measures to 58 departments of the 96 in mainland France,
from an original 26, as fears grow over a virus believed to be
carried by migratory birds.
Germany - Germany has increased customs checks on people entering
from Turkey to stop illegal imports of poultry products.
Greece - Greece, which has banned all animal produce from Turkey, is
spraying vehicles entering the country through its northeastern
border with Turkey as a precautionary measure.
Netherlands - The Dutch government said on Thursday it wants to
vaccinate its huge poultry population against bird flu. The European
Commission has yet to approve vaccination. The Netherlands, Europe's
2nd biggest poultry producer after France, is home to 90 million poultry.
Romania - Romania has found highly pathogenic avian flu in 26
villages in and outside the Danube delta, Europe's largest wetlands
and a major migratory route for wild birds.
Russia - Russian President Vladimir Putin told the government on
Tuesday to take measures to prevent a new outbreak. Russia has been
battling with bird flu in poultry since July, culling more than 600
000 domestic fowl. The virus has been confined to 8 Russian regions,
but no case of human infection has been so far registered in Russia.
Ukraine - Mass poultry deaths were detected at the start of January
2006 at 3 poultry plants in Primorskoe village in Crimea. Ukraine
reported its 1st outbreak of bird flu in a dozen villages in Crimea,
a major stopover point for migratory birds, in late November 2005.

[I think we can safely assume that wherever Turkey has reported human
cases they are in the midst of infected poultry. Turkish officials
have said the deadly strain had been identified in poultry in 11 of
its 81 provinces, with suspected cases in 14 others; veterinary teams
have culled more than 355 000 fowl. - Mod.MHJ]

When a Muslim cleric warned people at prayers last week not to eat
chickens or eggs because of bird flu he gave Resat Baytar a major
headache -- sales of his eggs dried up completely.
Baytar, the biggest egg-producer in Turkey's eastern Van province,
now believes the fate of the poultry sector rests with agriculture
officials meeting in the capital Ankara on Saturday to discuss
financial support measures.
"If the steps are insufficient, producers will halt output, shut up
shop and lay off workers," he said. Sipping tea in his office, he
looks out at the shop floor of his main retail outlet which has stood
empty since the outbreak surfaced 2 weeks ago.
"Our sales of white meat have plunged 80 percent in the last couple
of days. People are avoiding chicken. They choose other dishes
instead. It's not a big problem for us, but it looks like it could
continue for a while," said Saffet Tasci, working at a kebab and
chicken stall in a shopping mall in Ankara. United Nations agencies
have reassured consumers that properly cooked poultry is safe to eat.
But they tell people from affected areas not to eat eggs raw or with
a runny yolk.
While sales have halted, Baytar's 200 000 chickens continue to lay
150 000 eggs per day, forcing him to rent additional storage space.
With annual production of 50 million eggs, his stock will only be
heading for the rubbish bin unless action is taken soon.
Media reports suggest the government may pay up to 5 lira (USD 3) for
each chicken culled by major poultry producers and if they do, Baytar
says he plans to cull 70 000 chickens. Other measures to stave off a
crisis could include delaying debt repayments, providing cheap feed
and long-term credit. Newspapers say the authorities are offering 5
lira per chicken, 15 lira per goose and duck and 20 lira per turkey.
The poultry sector is growing in significance for Turkey's economy,
with annual turnover at some $3 billion. Annual poultry meat output
was 1 million tonnes in 2004. Exports totalled only 30 000 tonnes or
$20 million.
The biggest material loss so far has been felt by the huge number of
Turkish villagers who keep chickens at home. Officials have culled
hundreds of thousands of birds to halt the spread of bird flu.
While large producers insist their facilities maintain high hygiene
standards, officials from the prime minister down are calling for an
end to household chicken coops because of health risks. This may play
into the hands of the major players. "In the long-term this may be of
benefit to us and it will also have advantages for the state as it
will increase their tax income because production will be left to
major firms," said Resat's brother Ekrem.

[While proscribing household poultry may appeal to urban Turkish
bureaucrats with ready access to cheap supermarket food, the
situation in isolated rural villages is very different. There
backyard poultry are necessary to feed one's family. Generally the
present widespread hype over this disease needs to significantly calm
down. - Mod.MHJ]

Iran has started mass culling of poultry along its border with Turkey
to try to stop bird flu from spreading into the country, a health
ministry official said on Friday. "We estimate that 50 000 poultry
will be destroyed in a few days," a senior health ministry official,
who asked not to be named, told Reuters. "We have started destroying
poultry in villages within 15 kilometres (9 miles) of the border
since Wednesday."
The deadly H5N1 avian flu virus that emerged in East Asia has rapidly
spread in Turkey, fuelling fears of an outbreak in neighbouring
countries. It has killed 3 children in eastern Turkey, the victims
coming form the remote rural village of Dogubayazit close to the
Armenian and Iranian borders.
Iranian Health Minister Kamran Baqeri-Lankarani said bird flu had not
yet been detected among poultry in Iran. "But we are totally prepared
and necessary measures have been taken," he told state radio.
Earlier this week, Iran closed its border with Turkey and banned
imports of live birds and poultry products from Turkey. It also urged
Iranians to avoid any unnecessary trips to the infected areas in
Turkey. State television showed pictures of officials disinfecting
vehicles crossing into Iran from Turkey.
