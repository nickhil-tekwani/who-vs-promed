A man showing symptoms of avian influenza died in Iraqi Kurdistan and his
samples have been sent to Jordan for testing. The 40-year-old man died
Friday [27 Jan 2006] in Sulaimaniyah. He was the uncle of a 14-year-old
girl who also died flu-like symptoms, but who subsequent tests established
did not have the H5N1 virus.
"We decided to send the samples of the man to the WHO laboratory in Amman
to make sure that he had not died of H5N1 virus," Imad Ahmad, a senior
official with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the party administering
the city, told reporters on Saturday [28 Jan 2006]. He said the man died
after suffering for a few days from a pulmonary infection.
Turkey, which has 21 human cases of avian influenza [12 now confirmed by
WHO. - Mod.CP], is the only country outside the Far East that has reported
fatalities from the virus. Health officials in Iraq's 3 Kurdish provinces,
which border Turkey, say a number of measures are being taken to stop the
spread of the virus. These include decontaminating trucks crossing the
border, banning the import of Turkish poultry and prohibiting the sale of
live chickens inside Kurdistan. There is also a major public awareness
campaign urging people to take precautions, including cooking instructions
to minimize the risk of infection.
Iraq's Kurdish provinces are a major poultry-producing region supplying
chickens and eggs for much of the rest of the country. Scientists fear that
the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance H5N1 will mutate into a
form that is easily transmissible between humans. This could spark a global
pandemic that could claim millions of lives.

No sign of avian influenza virus infection has been found in a Romanian
woman suspected of having the deadly virus, according to preliminary
laboratory test results released on Saturday [28 Jan 2006]. Romania has
found avian influenza in poultry in 26 villages since October [2005] but
has recorded no human cases.
Earlier on Saturday, the 81-year-old woman from one of the affected
villages was admitted to hospital in the south-eastern town of Galati with
symptoms similar to bird flu. "Preliminary tests show no sign of avian
influenza. It looks like she has bronchitis," Adrian Streinu-Cercel, head
of Romania's main virus laboratory in Bucharest, told Reuters. "But we
still have to wait for the blood test result to be 100 percent sure," he
said. Mariana Mardarescu, doctor at the laboratory, told a news conference
that the final result would be available on Sunday [29 Jan 2006]. "The risk
of bird flu is absolutely minimal. Her condition is good and she has no
fever," Mardarescu said.
Earlier in January 2006, Romania tightened safeguards against avian
influenza, stepping up disinfection measures on major roads and introducing
luggage checks at airports, train stations and seaports. Fears that the
disease may spread to people have grown since it infected 21 people in
nearby Turkey, killing 4 children. [In the Turkish outbreak all but 2 of
the confirmed human cases have been children. - Mod.CP]
Romania first detected the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus in birds in the
Danube delta, which lies on a major migratory route for wild birds. Bird
flu has killed at least 83 people, mostly in Asia, but scientists warn that
if the virus mutates and spreads among humans it could cause a pandemic
that would kill millions of people around the world.

[Apart from the cases in Turkey, mostly involving children, there has been
no confirmed human case of avian influenza virus infection outside of East
Asia. Suspected human cases, subsequently discounted, have been reported
among travellers returning to several European countries. The 28 countries
participating in the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS,
<http://www.eiss.org>) have been invited to report any laboratory tests for
H5N1, and by 25 Jan 2006, 6 countries had reported a total of 19 tests (see:
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/060126.asp#2is>).
This small number of tests, all of which were negative, probably represents
only a small proportion of the suspect cases of influenza A/H5N1 that have
been treated in Europe in recent weeks. The Iraqi Kurd case described above
is unlikely to prove positive since tests on the patient's 14-year-old
niece have been confirmed negative. The condition and symptoms of the
81-year-old Romanian woman do not suggest that she has contracted H5N1
avian influenza. - Mod.CP]
