Lyme disease is rebounding in Maine this year [2022], with the number of cases so far this year [14 Aug 2022] on pace to exceed the totals for 2020 and 2021.

Maine recorded 1433 Lyme cases through [14 Aug 2022], compared with 1127 in all of 2020 and 1510 in all of 2021, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention [https://www.pressherald.com/2021/03/22/lyme-disease-cases-fell-sharply-in-2020-with-covid-19-and-weather-likely-playing-a-role/]. And the deer ticks that cause Lyme will actively search for hosts well into the autumn before becoming less active and burrowing beneath leaf litter for the winter.

The increase in cases this year [2022] comes despite the dry summer in much of the state. Warm, humid, and rainy weather brings out ticks, while dry weather is not as favorable for the arachnids.

Griffin Dill, integrated pest management professional for the University of Maine Cooperative Extension's tick lab, said it's difficult to determine what is causing the increase in Lyme cases this year [2022], but several factors may be at work.

A rainy late spring and early summer may have contributed. Dill said even with mostly dry conditions in July and August, the ticks may have been better poised to survive a dry spell after the near-ideal weather conditions earlier this year. "The adult ticks in spring and early summer were highly active," Dill said. "It started to tail off at the end of June, early July."

Dill said another factor may be that a higher percentage of deer ticks are carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The lab accepts tick samples from all over the state to test for infectious diseases, and the percentage of ticks found to be carrying the bacteria increased from 38 percent in 2019 to 45 percent so far this year [2022]. "We have more ticks testing positive for the pathogens than in previous years," Dill said.

The range of deer ticks also keeps expanding into new parts of the state, he said. "We are starting to see more of an increase in Down East, in Washington County, as far east as Calais," Dill said. "The habitat along the coast is more conducive to ticks."

Cases of another tick-borne disease called anaplasmosis also are tracking higher this year, with 610 cases through [14 Aug 2022], compared to 841 for all of 2021. Maine has reported 97 cases of babesiosis, the other disease most commonly associated with deer ticks, so far this year [2022].

Lyme disease peaked in Maine in 2019, with 2167 total cases, before falling off to 1127 cases in 2020. Dill said it's difficult to tell why cases were so much lower in 2020, but it may be that there were many undiagnosed cases during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic. "Many people were not seeking medical attention in 2020," he said.

Meanwhile, scientists, including some in Maine, are testing a Lyme vaccine that soon could be approved. Pfizer is currently conducting human clinical trials for a Lyme vaccine, and Brewer-based Northern Light Health in Maine is the site of one of the trials. Kris Currier, a Northern Light Health spokeswoman, said the health care system "will soon share more information about a Lyme disease vaccine trial that was recently addressed in the news. We anticipate approval to begin enrollment in September [2022] and will send out information including dates and the process for enrollment when details are confirmed."

Lyme can be treated with a course of antibiotics. But many cases go undetected, especially if people are bitten by ticks in the nymphal stage, which are so tiny they can be hard to spot. Symptoms of Lyme disease can include fatigue, joint pain, headache, and fever. If untreated, Lyme disease can cause heart and nervous system conditions.

Dill said the tick lab is studying the role of the white-footed mouse as a reservoir for Lyme disease. The white-footed mouse is more prevalent in southern Maine but may be expanding its habitat. Dill said it's unknown if the deer mouse, a more common mouse in northern Maine, is less likely to be a reservoir for Lyme than the white-footed mouse. He said it's also unclear if the white-footed mouse is expanding its habitat farther north and displacing the deer mouse.

Meanwhile, the Maine Medical Center Research Institute is conducting several research projects, including "investigating ways to eliminate Lyme disease at its source by preventing ticks from spreading the Lyme bacteria in the wild" and also studying how temperature and humidity impact the survivability of deer ticks.

[An increased incidence of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts expand locally or spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.

Factors that could account for a true increase in the incidence of these tick-borne diseases in the US State of Maine include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice, and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for these diseases in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal and they they are responsible for transporting ticks; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease.

_I. scapularis_ likely traveled from endemic areas in the northeastern US by attaching themselves onto migrating mammals and birds (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm). Deer ticks by themselves unlikely travel far; travel over greater distances is achieved by the ticks' attaching themselves to migrating mammals and birds. Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as "questing") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long).

A photo of the characteristic rash of early Lyme disease can be found at http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lyme_disease_picture/picture.htm.

In the US, _I. scapularis_ can transmit simultaneously one or more of the following pathogens: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the spirochete that causes Lyme disease), _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (a bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (a spirochete that causes a relapsing fever-like illness), _Babesia microti_ (the protozoan that causes babesiosis), and Powassan virus (a virus that causes encephalitis), (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00142/full). For a picture of the tick nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/.

A prevalence of 45% of deer ticks carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is high, and means that there are many infected white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) on which ticks fed. White-footed mice are the reservoir of _B. burgdorferi_.

Decreased rainfall in the summer months in Maine could have reduced the questing nymph tick population, because nymph ticks require a high humidity of more than 85 percent (http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long), forcing them to move down the vegetation into more humid leaf litter on the ground to maintain hydration during summer drought conditions.

The increased incidence of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis in Maine could be due to an increase in the number of questing infected tick vectors during a wet fall season. Because nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long), the local daytime temperatures in the fall season would have to be above this value. In fact, daytime temperatures are mostly above 7 deg C/45 deg F in September and October in Maine (https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Maine/temperature-october.php).

The northeastern US state of Maine can be located on the ProMED interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8705108,222. A map of Maine counties can be found at http://geology.com/county-map/maine-county-map.gif.
The term "Down East" within Maine refers specifically to the state's easternmost coastal regions that covers Washington County and Hancock County, beginning in Ellsworth and stretching to the East all the way to the Canadian Maritime Provinces (https://umaine.edu/undiscoveredmaine/downeast-maine/).

It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence, which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But people are often exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence. - Mod.ML]
