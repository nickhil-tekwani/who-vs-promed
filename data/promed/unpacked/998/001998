The number of dengue fever cases has risen dramatically this month,
exceeding 300 cases per week. This is compared with 125 per week in April 2005.
Singapore has experienced a resurgence of dengue fever over the past few
years. In 2003, there were 4788 cases. It doubled to 9459 in 2004. [no
further data were given regarding the incidence rate of dengue hemorrhagic
fever and deaths, if any - Mod.RY]
Stepping up its efforts to tackle the problem, the National Environment
Agency (NEA) has set aside $5000 [USD 3000] for each Citizens' Consultative
Committee [CCC]and [SD] $50,000 [USD 30 000] for each Community Development
Council. The money will be used to fund community outreach programmes on
dengue fever.
Over the last 2 weeks, the agency has also conducted briefings at 84 CCCs
and 16 Town Councils to update them on the local dengue situation.
Next month, NEA plans to distribute new sets of dengue educational kits
specifically designed for 70 000 families living in landed homes to remind
them to reduce mosquito breeding sources.

Dengue: 33 cases so far and rising
----------------------------------
Even as dengue increased its spread in Ahmedabad with 5 more cases on
Wednesday, health minister IK Jadeja said in Gandhinagar that there are
only 4 confirmed cases and 25 suspected cases of dengue in Ahmedabad.
Speaking to reporters here, Mr Jadeja said there are 4 suspect cases of
dengue in Rajkot. The state government has also asked private hospitals to
inform the state government about dengue cases to check its spread and
monitor the cases.
Meanwhile, leptospirosis [a bacterial disease that affects both humans and
animals] has gripped the flood-hit areas in Surat, Valsad, and Navsari. Mr
Jadeja said 4 people have died in the 3 districts and there are 26 cases of
leptospirosis detected in these districts. He said the state government has
provided a special grant of Rs 7.50 lakhs [one lakh = 100 000, so 750 000
rupees or USD 17 000] in each of the 3 districts to monitor and prevent the
spread of leptospirosis.
Out of 5 cases of dengue reported on Wednesday, one was from Sanand. The
other 4 cases were reported from Auda areas of Ghatlodia, Satellite and
Jodhpur. A 46 year old woman from Sanand village was admitted to Karnavati
Hospital after she complained of high fever. A 7 year old child from
Shayona Bungalows in Ghatlodia, another [5 year old child], from Adiraj
Bungalows in Jodhpur and a 32 year old resident of Rosewood Estate in
Jodhpur were admitted to Sterling Hospital for treatment. A 54 year old
resident of the Satellite area was admitted to Medilink Hospital. [the

1st dengue case reported in Surat
---------------------------------
After Ahmedabad, dengue has reared its ugly head in Surat. 4 suspect dengue
cases were reported from different areas on Wednesday.
A 30 year old man was admitted to a hospital with high fever and later
diagnosed with dengue. Later in the day, 3 suspect dengue cases were
reported from Kharvasa, Katargam, and Khanderaojinagar areas in Surat. One
49 year old was admitted to a private hospital on Tuesday.
However, the Surat Municipal Corporation officials denied the presence of
any dengue case in the city. "Not a single dengue case has been diagnosed
so far. We have already undertaken various cleanliness drives and have sent
medical teams to different areas," said an SMC official. However,
leptospirosis, [a] waterborne [bacterial] disease, has gripped Surat, and 9
patients have been admitted to New Civil Hospital so far.

Ministry confirms dengue outbreak in Cayo
-----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has announced that cases of dengue have been
detected in the Cayo District [of Belize City]. According to a press
release, infections have been reported in Belmopan and surrounding
villages, Armenia, Cotton Tree, Valley of Peace, Unitedville, Ontario,
Roaring Creek, and Camalote.
Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain,
rash, and pain behind the eyes. As a result of the outbreak, tonight the
Ministry, in addition to launching a chemical counterattack against
mosquitoes that carry the disease, is asking [residents] to do [their] part
to curb its spread by eliminating mosquito breeding sites in homes and yards.
This afternoon director of health services Dr Errol Vanzie told News Five
what that campaign will entail. "Not the traditional one where we have
trucks moving through the streets and we donate bags. We don't have the
time and resources for that right now, we need for people to just go out
into the yard, spend 30 minutes, 35 minutes, pick up everything that is
around the yard that can hold water and just dispose of it, bury it, burn
it or bag it to make it available for the solid waste people to take it away.
"Besides that, the Ministry of Health is intensifying our spraying
operations and vector control personnel are also conducting larviciding
activities, meaning destroying larvae. And at the same time, we advise
people that if they have the symptoms that we have already highlighted,
that they don't need to go to the clinic. What they need to do is to rest,
drink lots of liquid, and if they have pain (most people have joint or
muscular aches), to take painkillers, mainly Tylenol
[paracetamol/acetaminophen], Motrin, but not to take anything that has
aspirin."
Janelle Chanona [reporter?] asked: "Aspirin makes it worse?"
Dr Errol Vanzie replied, "Yes, it makes it worse. Dengue is a self-limiting
disease that in 3-4 days will disappear. Very few cases have the potential
to develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever. Fortunately for Belize we have
never had a case before and we hope it will stay that way."
According to the Ministry of Health, while labs here have confirmed the
presence of dengue, additional samples have been sent abroad [where ?] for
confirmation of the disease.

[Most people who are infected and develop dengue fever recover completely
within 2 weeks. Others may develop dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe
bleeding manifestation which can lead to shock syndrome (very low blood
pressure) and is sometimes fatal, especially in children and young adults.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is more common after a secondary infection with
dengue virus. No specific therapeutic agents exist for dengue; steroids,
antivirals, or carbazochrome (which decreases capillary permeability) have
no proven effect. In patients without shock, oral hydration by appropriate
volume replenishment is effective and should be started early. Paracetamol
(acetaminophen) can be used for fever and analgesia; aspirin and other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided owing to the
increased risk for Reye's syndrome and hemorrhage, as mentioned above by Dr
Errol Vanzie. - Mod.RY]
