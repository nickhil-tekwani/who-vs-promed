Background information on filariasis in Thailand
------------------------------------------
Bancroftian filariasis has been most common along the Burma border,
Kanchanaburi, Kwai-Noi, and the Maenan Mae Klong River area. As of
2000, active transmission is limited to the western provinces of Tak,
Kanchanaburi, and Mae Hong Son. Infection is common among migrants
from Myanmar.
A total of 1252 cases of filariasis (type not specified) were reported
in 1997, with a prevalence of approximately 2/100 000. The local forms
are nocturnally periodic.
The local vectors are _Anopheles nigerrimus_ and the _An. sinensis_
complex. _Aedes harinasutai_ is associated with nocturnally
subperiodic or non-periodic infections. A nocturnally periodic form
(vector _Culex quinquefasciatus_) has been found in immigrant workers
from Myanmar.
Brugian filariasis is nocturnally periodic in this country and endemic
to the southeastern coastal swamps. Highest rates occur in
Nakorn-srithamarat Province. The local vectors are _Anopheles
barbirostris_, _An. nigerrimus_, _An. sinensis_ complex, _Mansonia
bonneae_, _Ma. annulata_, _Ma. annulifera_ and _Ma. uniformis_.

[The background data shown above clearly indicate that filariasis in
Bangkok is not part of the endemic situation in Thailand. If the
report reflects an ongoing transmission and not only cases imported
with migrant labour, it is a new situation . - Mod.EP
