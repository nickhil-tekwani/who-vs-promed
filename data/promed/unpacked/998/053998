Scientists of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) have noticed a new viral disease in brinjal [aubergine, eggplant] crops in Karur district [Tamil Nadu]. The disease, called tomato leaf curl virus, has been ascertained by the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB).

It was found on 2 acres [0.8 ha] of brinjal, which was about 50 days old. The incident level was around 20 to 30 per cent and the disease is spreading rapidly despite the farmers spraying insecticides regularly.

The disease, which is noticed on tomato crop, is noticed on brinjal probably for the 1st time in the region. It has to be quarantined as the virus spreads very fast. There is a possibility of the disease in neighbouring Tiruchi [Tiruchirappalli] district, too.

L Sornamanickam, Horticulture Karur, said that information had been communicated to all field-level officials. Farmers had been advised to destroy the plants, if they were affected. The disease was communicated to the Centre for Integrated Pest Management in Tiruchi and other officials to take steps to control it.

[_Tomato leaf curl virus_ (TLCV; genus _Begomovirus_) belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of the genus. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous, cucurbit, and other crops and can lead to considerable yield losses. Symptoms may include distortion and yellowing of leaves and stems, stunting of plants, reduced flowering, and severe loss of plant vigour. A large number of geographical variants of the viruses are being identified and many of them have now been classified as separate species (for example, _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_). Frequent recombination events are considered to be the basis for the diversity within the clades. Variations in host range and specificity exist both amongst viral species and between different strains within species.

Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes). Many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted. Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

In some areas, including India, leaf curl viruses are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops, both in terms of yield losses and loss of fruit quality. 100 per cent losses of tomato crops due to TLCV have been reported in India. Both tomato and aubergine belong to the family of Solanaceae and therefore the presence of a TLCV strain affecting both these hosts is not surprising.
