Invasive moth threatens wine grape crop
---------------------------------------
A huge swath of wine country [California], including vineyards where
some of the world's best grapes are grown, was quarantined this week
after an invasive moth was discovered.

The European grapevine moth has already destroyed at least one
vineyard's harvest and damaged other prime vineyards in the Napa
Valley, prompting the California Department of Food and Agriculture
to place under quarantine 162 square miles of land.

"This is a serious threat to grape growing throughout California,"
said Greg Clark, assistant agricultural commissioner, Napa County.
"We don't want it to become established because we've seen the severe
damage this pest can do." The grape-gobbling pest has long been the
scourge of winemakers in Europe, but the discovery of moth larvae in
a Napa Valley vineyard in September [2009] marked the 1st time the
insect had been seen in the US.

The quarantine covers 2 areas, the larger of which is in the heart of
the Napa Valley and reaches just over the Sonoma County line. The
smaller pocket includes parts of the city of Napa and stretches into
Solano County. The quarantine means agricultural commissioners will
regulate the harvest, shipping and handling of certain fruits and
plants, including grapes, persimmons, olives, pomegranates and kiwi.

Authorities are also asking property owners not to remove the
designated plants and crops from their lands, though produce may be
consumed on the properties. Inspectors are working with growers,
nurseries, landscapers and other agricultural workers to limit the
spread of the moth and enforce the regulations. Clark said 715 traps
that draw the insects to sticky strips have been set up in the
quarantine areas and there are plans to set more in growing regions
throughout the state.

[The European grapevine moth, _Lobesia botrana_ (_Tortricidae_) is
found throughout Europe, North and West Africa, the Middle East, and
eastern Russia. Besides grapevine, it has also been reported on
olive, blackberry, gooseberry, black and red currant, cherry, plum,
persimmon, kiwifruit, pomegranate and a number of wild hosts. The
moth is nocturnal and can fly several hundred meters looking for dry
places.

The adult moth is approximately 6-8 mm long and has a lifespan of 1
to 3 weeks, depending on climatic conditions. Unlike other common
vineyard torticids which lay eggs in overlapping masses, eggs of_
L.botrana_ are laid singly under the bark of the vine stem or in the
supporting posts, with a mean of 80 to 140 eggs per female laid over
about 6 days. Pupae overwinter in diapause (resting state) in cocoons
under the bark, in soil cracks, or on trellis posts. Adults emerge
when air temperatures exceed a threshold of 10 degrees Celsius [50
deg F] for a period of 10 to 12 days. The 2nd generation larvae feed
on green berries leaving only skin and seeds. The 3rd generation
larvae cause the greatest damage by webbing and feeding inside
berries and within bunches, which become contaminated with frass
[excrement]. Feeding damages the berries and exposes them to
infection by various fungal pathogens.

Control measures are targeted at the 2nd generation because of the
prolonged emergence of the 1st generation and possible re-infestation
from untreated neighbouring vineyards. However, treatment of the 1st
generation is used for high populations or area wide control. Under
California conditions, control of both 1st and 2nd generations may be
warranted, given that this is a newly introduced pest.

Insecticides used are less effective after bunch closure. Several
reduced-risk insecticides are registered for use in grapes to control
tortricid larvae. These include insect growth regulators, spinosyns
(fungal fermentation products) and _Bacillus thuringiensis_. Mating
disruption has been studied in Europe and has proven most effective
when moth populations are low and when applied to large areas. Since
this is a newly reported pest, no _L.botrana_ pheromone mating
disruption products are currently registered in the US.
