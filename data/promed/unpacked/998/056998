I reply to the moderator's request for more information following a
posting of an ABC News story about botulism in extensive beef cattle.
This ABC story followed a media release by this Department [of
Primary Industries and Fisheries] aimed at increasing the coverage of
vaccination.
The release did describe an increased incidence following recent
abnormal conditions but the disease remains a routine, endemic issue
in this State [Queensland].
A small number of significant abnormal intoxications have occurred in
the past associated with intensive feeding, but tightened regulations
and vaccination mean that such events have essentially ceased.
In the past, botulism in cattle in Queensland has been confirmed by
ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] for C and D toxin on either
serum, liver, or gut contents. The use of bivalent vaccine in cattle
is recommended.
With drought times, especially exceptional droughts such as those
recently experienced, many producers may forsake vaccination as a
cost saving measure. However, very few cattle need to be saved to
cover the cost of vaccination. Hence, we are keen to ensure that
cattle owners maintain their awareness of this sporadic but
significant disease.
