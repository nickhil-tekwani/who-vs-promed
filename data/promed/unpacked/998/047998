I noticed an inquiry into TB in deer. We have done a lot of work in this
area here in Michigan and here some references which might be useful.
"Bovine tuberculosis in free-ranging white-tailed deer from Michigan" by
S.M. Schmitt, S.D. Fitztgerald, T.M. Cooley, C.S. Bruning-Fann, L. Sullivan,
D. Berry, T. Carlson R. B. Minnin, J.B.Payeur, and J. Sikarskie. Journal of
Wildlife Diseases, 33(4):749-758, 1997.
"Assessing the risks associated with _M. bovis_ in Michigan free-ranging
white-tailed deer". CADIA technical report no. 01-96. Available from the
Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health, USDA, APHIS, VS, 555 S. Howes,
