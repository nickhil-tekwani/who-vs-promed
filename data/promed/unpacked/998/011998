Hundreds of cases of the West Nile virus have been reported [worldwide] so far this year and 22 people have already died as a result of the mosquito-borne infection. In the most recent case, one person is reportedly dead due to West Nile virus (WNV) in Canada, blackburnnews.com wrote. This is the 1st death of the season attributed to the virus in Canada, the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit [in Ontario] said in a news release on [Fri 14 Sep 2018].

It also warned that WNV continues to be a risk until the area experiences temperatures below freezing.

The health unit said residents should continue to protect themselves, as certain types of mosquitoes spread West Nile virus, a potentially serious infection to humans.

Health officials added that so far this year [2018], 26 mosquito traps set up in Windsor-Essex and across the region had caught mosquitoes that tested positive for WNV.

They advised residents to eliminate any standing water around their home, take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellents, stay indoors when mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn and to make sure that all door and window screens are tight and free of any holes.

The West Nile virus is an illness that spreads from mosquitoes to humans. A mosquito becomes infected when it feeds on the blood of a bird that is carrying the virus. About 2 weeks later, the mosquito is capable of spreading the virus to people and animals while biting for a blood meal. The virus is not spread from person to person and cannot be spread directly from infected animals, such as birds, horses, or pets, to people.

West Nile virus originated in the West Nile region of Uganda in 1937, and for decades it was confined to Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of the Middle East and Europe. In 1999, it was detected in New York City, where 7 people died from it. Canada had its 1st confirmed infection in a bird in 2001. In September 2002, the 1st confirmed human cases of West Nile virus were reported in parts of Quebec and Ontario.

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit has received a report of a death attributed to the West Nile virus (WNV). This is a notice to the public that WNV continues to be a risk until the area experiences temperatures below freezing. Most people with WNV never develop symptoms and will not know that they have the virus. Approximately 25% of the people develop West Nile fever. A small number of people (less than 1%) develop severe neuro-invasive disease.

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit would like to remind residents to continue to protect themselves, as certain types of mosquitoes spread WNV, a potentially serious infection to humans.

Area residents should eliminate any standing water around their home/property and take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites.

Individuals can protect themselves from mosquito bites in several ways. - - Use insect repellents that contain DEET, Icaridin, or other approved ingredients on clothing as well as exposed skins. Always read and follow label directions.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and a hat when outdoors. Light-coloured clothing is best as mosquitoes tend to be attracted to dark colours.
- Limit the time you spend outdoors at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.
- Make sure that door and window screens fit securely and are free of holes.

The Health Unit, along with each municipality, will continue to monitor for West Nile virus activity for the remainder of the season. So far this year [2018], 26 mosquito pools have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV) throughout the area and 8 cases of WNV have been reported to health unit.
