Sierra Leone has reported an outbreak of the deadly anthrax disease for the first time in almost 30 years. Authorities say cases were detected in animals in the north western region of the country, where more than 200 livestock were confirmed to have died.

The country's minister of agriculture Abu Bakarr Karim made the announcement at a press briefing on [Mon 16 May 2022]. Officials say it followed reports of animals dying in Port Loko District, from where samples were collected and tested and the result came back positive for anthrax.

Anthrax is described as a serious infectious disease caused by a bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. It occurs naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals. Humans can also get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. But the disease is treatable.

Officials told journalists that no human case had been recorded so far in the Sierra Leonean outbreak, and they said they were considering instituting measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

[It had to have come from somewhere, and 28 years is a bit too long to invoke an old anthrax grave. It could have flown in via a female tabanid fly having fed on an anthrax case and with contaminated mouthparts. Or it was via a latent infection in some cattle purchased from a farm with recent cases. We must await the results of any productive local investigation. In a province with no recent experience of anthrax, it is not unexpected for any outbreak to have progressed until there were very significant deaths.
