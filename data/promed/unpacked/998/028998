SUSHI BARS, HEALTH REGULATIONS: REQUEST FOR INFO
************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

A number of sushi bars have recently opened in Israel, and I have been
contacted regarding health implications. Is anyone aware of regulations
regarding preparation and sale of sushi?
