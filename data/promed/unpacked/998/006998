Five people have been sickened after drinking bottled water contaminated
with chemicals, and authorities were trying to determine whether the cases
were linked and involved tampering.
Two people were sickened Thursday. The other incidents occurred over the
past few weeks and involved different brands of water, according to the
FBI, which is investigating. The conditions of the latest victims were not
immediately known, but the others have since recovered.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged people to take precautions before drinking
bottled water. "Make sure you open the bottle yourself. And you actually
hear the noise and the air coming out," Giuliani said adding people should
take a sniff before drinking.
On 3 Aug 2000, a woman felt a burning sensation in her throat and began
bleeding from the mouth after drinking bottled water in a restaurant. Tests
on the water showed it contained "some type of sodium hydroxide," a
lye-type agent, police commissioner Bernard Kerik said.
A man who drank from a bottle of water purchased from a deli on 27 Aug 2000
felt a burning sensation in his throat. The water was found to contain
ammonia. On 6 Sep 2000, a woman gave her 18-month-old son a sip of bottled
water purchased from a takeout restaurant. The baby became ill and the
water turned out also to be tainted with ammonia.
"You cannot draw the conclusion the cases are linked," said Giuliani. "It's
too early to tell what kind of trend may be occurring or exactly what's
going on."
FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said his agency was told about the
contaminations by the health department on 8 Sep 2000 - 5 days before the
mayor held a press conference announcing the possible tampering.
Health Department spokeswoman Sandra Mullin said the department suspected
tampering on 6 Sep 2000, but could not explain the delay in informing top
city officials or issuing public health warnings.

[The burning in the throat and bleeding from the mouth with apparent little
delay suggests the concentration of the agents was fairly high. However,
for the concentration to be high enough for bleeding from the mouth to
occur so soon, it is surprising the odor did not alert the consumer to
something being amiss.
It will be interesting to know the outcome of the investigation. How did 2
different chemicals in apparently high concentrations come to be in
different bottles of water? - Mod.TG]
