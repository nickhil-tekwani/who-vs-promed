An outbreak of anthrax in the Municipal District of Fairview has
Peace region livestock producers wondering what they can do to avoid
similar incidents on their own farms -- the answer to which is, very little.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has been monitoring the
situation on a bison farm south of Bluesky since 23 Aug 2007, where
the deadly bacteria have killed 52 of the animals to date (Fri 6 Sep
2007. The owner of the farm adamantly refused to comment on the
situation, directing all questions to the CFIA.
Confidentiality regulations also prevent the CFIA from commenting on
specific cases, but a media representative did confirm that a case of
anthrax was reported in the MD [Municipal District] of Fairview and
that 52 bison have died as a result.
Anthrax spores lay inactive in the soil after the death of an
infected animal. There is a good chance that the anthrax we're seeing
today is a result of the bison that once roamed freely in this area
hundreds of years ago, said Dr. Lloyd Keddie of the North Peace
Animal Hospital in Fairview. When the spores are ingested, inhaled,
or come into contact with an open wound, the bacteria become active
and can kill the animal in less than 2 days, depending on the strain
of anthrax involved, he said. "It can take anywhere from several
hours to one or 2 days. It's very quick."
Ingestion is the most common means of transmission in livestock, and
occurs when soil is disturbed or overturned, exposing the bacteria to
the animals, he said.
Because of its highly fatal nature, the 1st sign of anthrax infection
in a herd is often the death of one or more animals. Anthrax may
cause the corpse of an animal to expel bloody fluids, bloat rapidly
after death, and it may not stiffen from rigor mortis. Other infected
animals in the herd may lose their appetite, have difficulty
breathing, and will have swelling in their lower jaw area.
If a producer suspects anthrax, the CFIA stresses that they do not
handle the carcasses at all. They are advised to contact their
veterinarian immediately. The veterinarian will evaluate the scene
and contact the CFIA if anthrax is involved. All cases of anthrax
must be reported to the CFIA under law.
Anthrax occurs all over the world, and in Canada it is most common in
areas between Alberta and Western Ontario. It is relatively uncommon
in this particular area though, said Keddie.
"We're starting to see a bit more of it in Western Canada for sure;
Saskatchewan and different parts of Alberta, so it's not that
peculiar to this area, it's all over, but it's still something new to
the majority of farmers in this area."
There have been 4 other cases in Alberta this year [2007] with one in
Clearwater County, one in Cypress County, and 2 in the MD of
Bonnyville, all to the southeast of the Peace country. These cases
killed a total of 4 cattle and 38 bison.
The disease is so rare in this area that Keddie says he does not know
of one Fairview area farmer who vaccinates their animals for anthrax.
"It's just not that common, it's very uncommon," he said.
Keddie suggests producers decide on a herd-by-herd basis for
vaccinations, and weigh the risk against the cost of not only the
vaccine but the cost of administering the vaccine. "There's lots of
farmers who have been farming here for more than 30 or 40 years, and
have never vaccinated for it and have never had it and probably will
never get it," he said.
The situation on the [affected] farm is ongoing, and the remaining
bison will be quarantined for 21 days following the last death of an
animal, or 21 days after the vaccine is administered, whichever is
longer, according to CFIA regulations.

[Checking out this village, it is NW of Edmonton and well south of
any other outbreaks on the Peace River that I know of. A number of
years ago the disease had made its way west from the Peace River
delta, a wet area where the river turns north at Fort Chipewa to
enter the Wood Bison National Park. Bison bulls wandering west had
taken the disease to the cattle herds summering on the Indian
reservation pastures. Later these herds took the infection south to
affect 3 herds in the Edmonton area. So it is understandable that the
Fairview ranchers didn't know what was happening to them. ADRI
(Animal Disease Research Institute, CFIA), Lethbridge, will have the
cultures from this outbreak and should be able to genotype them to
see if this is a cattle strain or a Wood Bison strain. That it has
apparently killed so many bison would indicate that it might be a
Wood Bison strain.
But as this pathogen does not appear from nowhere investigations
would be worthwhile in the area to see if there was a recent history
of unexpected but uninvestigated deaths in livestock and farmed
bison. With 52 dead bison the fly-loading with anthrax spores will be
significant and therefore all cattle and farmed bison in the area
should be vaccinated as soon as possible. - Mod.MHJ
