The Baltic News Service reported Monday a death in Latvia from
leptospirosis. A rat infestation at a local fish processing company has
caused an outbreak of leptospirosis, an intestinal disease. One female
employee of the factory died last week, 6 more are ill and tests on another
48 workers have not yet been completed.

[Although gastrointestinal complaints are among the protean manifestations
of leptospirosis, it's not the most common presentation. Additional
diagnostic information is needed here. - Mod.ES
[Leptospirosis is caused by serovars of _Leptospira interrogans_ and is
usually diagnosed serologically, although isolation of organisms from blood
or cerebrospinal fluid may also establish the diagnosis. In addition to
rodents, dogs, cattle, swine and other hosts may transmit the infection to
humans, most commonly via contact with water that has been contaminated
with the urine of infected animals. As a result, it is known to be an
occupational hazard of people who have contact with contaminated water,
such as sewer workers, farmers, and fish workers. In addition to
influenza-like symptoms of headache, myalgias, and fever, patients with
leptospirosis may have meningitis, hepatic and renal involvement,
conjunctival suffusion, and rash. - Man. Ed. DS
