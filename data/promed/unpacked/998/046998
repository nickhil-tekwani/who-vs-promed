On 15 May 2013, the Guangzhou City Agricultural Division collected poultry samples from a poultry sales stall in Fuli market, Licheng, Zengcheng City. In one chicken, infection with avian influenza serotype H7 was demonstrated in the Guangdong provincial laboratory. No further typing of the virus has been accomplished; the sample has been submitted to a reference laboratory for confirmation and complete serotyping. The stall owner has shown no disease signs nor been found positive yet.

Subsequent to the laboratory results, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Agriculture launched the following emergency response measures:
- closure of the Licheng-Fuli market;
- Culling and disposal of more than 9500 birds in the market;
- thorough disinfection of the market;
- a 7-day period of health monitoring of the persons engaged in sale stalls of the market.

The Zengcheng City Government said that the origin of the positive chicken has been verified and may be announced on 16 May 2013 [not available yet].

[Official confirmation (or otherwise) of the above media-derived information and any additional data on the event, its handling, and the full identity of the virus involved will be helpful.

So far, there are no reports of human disease in Guangdong, where a chicken in another live bird market (Sanniao live bird wholesale market, Dongcheng, Dongguan) had been suspected on 27 Apr 2013 to be infected by H7, officially confirmed on 5 May 2013 as H7N9. Culling of all poultry on the market was applied.

If confirmed, the infection of a chicken in a market in Zengcheng City described above will become Guangdong's 2nd market infection without human cases in the province. - Mod.AS
