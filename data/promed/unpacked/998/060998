-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The moderator is correct that the clinical signs that are being reported are consistent with canine influenza. Sustained transmission of H3N8 or H3N2 influenza has not been identified previously in the province and such a naive population would be highly susceptible to introduction of influenza.

We are certainly looking for canine influenza, but from quite limited testing so far, we do not currently have evidence of canine influenza.

Further, while signs are consistent with influenza, they are also consistent with a range of other causes of canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC). Regardless, relatively high infection rates seem to be present in Orangeville, Ontario, as well as few other areas in the province. Whether these are linked outbreaks, separate outbreaks (by the same pathogen or otherwise), or pseudo-outbreaks as a result of enhanced reporting, is not yet clear.

CIRDC is an endemic disease in the dog population and a baseline (but usually unreported) level of illness is expected, so there are challenges in interpretation of data such as we are receiving.

[The original article in ProMED-mail post 20151028.3750004 mentioned:

"At first, veterinarians suspected canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), or "kennel cough," but even dogs who have been vaccinated against that disease have been sick, CTV News Barrie reports."

This statement led the moderator to believe that CIRDC had been ruled out. Nevertheless, we look forward to an update of what the actual cause may be. - Mod.TG
