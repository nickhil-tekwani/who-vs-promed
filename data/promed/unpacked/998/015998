Following the confirmation of the death of a girl from rabies by
laboratory tests in Cochabamba, and after receiving between 15 and 20
telephone calls daily from people who suffered attacks from a dog, the
Municipal Zoonoses Office of the Cercado Mayor's Office is ready to
intensify the capture of ownerless dogs in the streets of the city.

Yesterday morning [11 Oct 2011] the Laboratory for Viral Diseases
Research of Cochabamba (LIDVIECO) confirmed that the death of the
7-year-old girl who ceased breathing this past Saturday [9 Oct 2011]
in the pediatric Manuel Ascencio Villarroel Hospital, was caused by
the human rabies virus (hydrophobia). Immunofluorescence tests
detected Negri bodies [rabies antigen], as the cause of this disease.
"The results [of the test] were positive. This is the 2nd human rabies
case confirmed by the laboratory," said the person in charge of
zoonoses of the Departmental [state of province equivalent] Health
Services (SEDES), Libertad Lujan.

Lujan stated that the girl had all the symptoms of the disease such as
nervous system attacks, respiratory failure and also hypersensitivity
to air [light?] and sounds. "The siblings of the child are still under
observation. They are receiving [rabies post-exposure] treatment in
their respective health center and are not showing any [rabies] signs,
although we can not guarantee anything because a lot of time has
passed [before treatment was initiated?]," said the expert who
recommended that all who have been bitten by dogs go to a health
center.

More than 5000 people have reported a dog attack so far this year
[2011] and every day new cases [of dog bites] are reported, which is
the reason that the Director of Zoonoses of the municipality, Gustavo
Rojas, announced a new program for the capture of stray [unowned]
street dogs in order to guarantee the public's health. "The number of
calls for dog bites of people has been increasing and now we have at
least 4 animals under observation in order to determine if they have
rabies or not," said the official who also explained that, "we do not
have enough time to attend to all the cases which are reported to us."
Rojas recommended that the citizens "must not let their animals go
[loose] in the streets to interact with the people, [so that] the
pedestrians can not move around. We are in [a situation] of total
public indifference caused by their own irresponsibility."

According to the explanation of the Municipal Zoonoses Office, new
rules are needed for dealing with street dogs, since the past norms
are not adequate to [handle] the lack of control existing currently.
The large number of animals roaming the streets caused more than 5000
bites, 70 canine rabies cases, and 2 human deaths. Currently, norms
establish that if someone needs the Zoonoses Office to capture
dangerous animals in their street, the person must send a letter and
go through a bureaucratic process that impedes the immediate attention
required, especially for those cases of rabid animals. Since there are
many calls of neighbors and animal attacks are constant, the
[bureaucratic] requirements have been ignored and dangerous animals
are being captured, which is the reason for the need of new ordinances
to simplify the process, permitting more effective coordination of the
work of these officials to meet the needs of the population. Some
animal defense organizations interfere with the work of this unit,
putting at risk the lives of many children in the city, to stop the
capture of street dogs and their euthanasia given that they have no
owner.

[The rabies outbreak in Cochabamba department continues, with
unfortunate fatal outcomes (see ProMED-mail archives 20110821.2543 and 20111002.2969). Canine rabies cases have also bee reported in Oruro,
La Paz, and Santa Cruz departments this year (2011). The current
report again raises the issue concerning the effectiveness of culling
ownerless street dogs versus massive vaccination campaigns of all
dogs, owned or not.

The recent attempt to stop rabies transmission trough culling in Bali
was not effective. Vaccination, combined with neutering, is more
likely to be successful. Removal of stray dogs will likely result in
new strays moving into the vacated area, with resulting fighting among
the remaining and new animals, and greater risk of rabies virus
transmission.

The city of Cochabamba carried out a massive vaccination campaign on 2
Oct 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive 20111002.2969). Apparently, the
campaign was not carried out in Cercado province, Cochabamba
department, reported above.
