Recurrence of Suspected Nipah-like Virus Infection in Western Bangladesh
--------------------------------------------------
At least 19 people have died after being infected by an unidentified virus
in the past month in Bangladesh's western district of Faridpur, reports the
Xinhua News Agency. A dozen cases were being treated at different hospitals
and clinics in the district, official sources stated on Sat 17 Apr 2004.
This is the 2nd virus outbreak in the area in 2004.
The Institute of Epidemiological Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has
sent samples of blood, tissue and bone marrow of the patients to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta for diagnostic
tests. The tests of the 1st spell that took place in January [2004] had
identified a Nipah-like virus that is found in fruit-eating bats.
The symptoms displayed by the patients affected by the latest outbreak are
similar to those that were observed during the January outbreak. The
victims at Faridpur are suffering from respiratory problems, [as well as]
from high fever, unconsciousness, headache and vomiting that were reported
during the previous outbreak. At least 18 children died in the 1st outbreak
in January 2004 in 3 districts neighbouring Faridpur.
Medical experts from the World Health Organisation, International Centre
for Diarrhoea Diseases Research, Bangladesh and other agencies held a
meeting on the disease on Fri 16 Apr 2004. Nipah virus, which is passed
from [frugivorous bats] to humans, draws its name from a Malaysian village
where it was first detected 4 years ago.

[If the suspicion of Nipah virus infection is confirmed by laboratory
tests, it will indicate that this virus is probably endemic in the bat
population of western Bangladesh. Previously Nipah-like virus infections
were reported in 4 districts of Bangladesh: Rajbari, Manikganj, Jaipurhat
and Naogang, in addition to Faridpur. These 5 districts are located in the
southwestern region of the Dhaka Division.
Nipah and Hendra viruses are related but distinct paramyxoviruses which now
comprise a new genus in the sub-family _Paramyxovirinae_ of the family
_Paramyxoviridae_. The genus name _Henipavirus_ has been approved by the
ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses). The henipaviruses
have molecular characteristics that distinguish them from previously known
paramyxoviruses. It is likely that the virus associated with the outbreaks
of encephalitis in Western Bangladesh is Nipah virus itself, or a closely
related virus. In the outbreaks of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia and
Hendra virus infection in Australia, the virus was transmitted to humans
from fruit bats through intermediate hosts; pigs in the case of Nipah virus
and horses in the case of Hendra virus. The outbreaks in Bangladesh have
involved children as well as adults. The presence of the virus in bats and
the route of transmission of the virus remain to be established. - Mod.CP]
