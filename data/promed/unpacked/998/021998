A critique of the preliminary claim of blood-borne transmission of BSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheep in the early, symptom-free stages of mad cow disease [bovine
spongiform encephalopathy or BSE can pass the brain-wasting ailment to
other sheep through blood transfusions, new research has found. The
findings, published in the 16 Sep 2000 issue of the Lancet medical journal,
raise the possibility that the human form of the disease could be
transmitted through blood transfusions. But researchers cautioned that the
risk was still "theoretical". No cases have been recorded of humans
becoming infected from a blood transfusion. Additionally, blood banks in
Britain have introduced precautions to reduce the risk of contaminated
blood supplies, including filtering out all white blood cells which could
potentially carry the infection, and by importing plasma from countries
where there is no evidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of
mad cow disease.
"No further measures would seem possible - short of a Draconian decision to
shut down the entire U.K. blood donor system," said Paul Brown, a senior
research scientist at the American National Institute of Neurological
Disease in Bethesda, Maryland., who was not connected with the study.
Writing in The Lancet, Brown criticized the researchers for publishing
their study at such an early stage before further tests were complete.
Britain's Department of Health said the research did not present any
significant new risk to the public, as scientists have long suspected that
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted through the blood of victims
not showing any symptoms." The government introduced these precautionary
measures ... to minimize any theoretical risk to patients," the department
said. "This risk remains theoretical."
