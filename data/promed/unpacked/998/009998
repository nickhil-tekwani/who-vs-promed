At least 20 persons from this city [Canada de Gomez, province of Santa
Fe] and neighbouring locations, such as Armstrong and Parejas, have
been hospitalized because they presented with symptoms of
trichinellosis, a disease that is a consequence of eating poorly
cooked pork infected with [the parasite] _Trichinella spiralis_.

Some cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests. Patients
(all were members of the same family, or clusters of families, or
close friends) declared they ate packaged salami which had been bought
in the same store in this city.

One of the patients from Canada de Gomez declared that he got the
disease along with 15 other people at a [sporting event] to which a
friend brought some salami to share.

The symptoms were nausea, vomiting, facial swelling, diarrhea, and
abdominal pain; he also had eyelid edema [swelling], muscle pain,
malaise, and fever. Patients were taken care of in Canada de Gomez,
Armstrong, and Las Parejas clinics.

"We cannot mention the product brand until we have test results
available. There is a woman who kept a piece of salami. We hope that
the studies performed confirm the diagnosis," said Hector Frechou, an
officer from the Food Safety Office.

Nestor Volentiera, a physician from Canada de Gomez, said he took care
of 2 men between 40 and 45 years old who presented with symptoms of
trichinosis. "They had symptoms resembling flu, such as headache and
eyelid swelling," he explained.

"I was told that the salami had been bought in Canada de Gomez,"
added the physician, confirming that the outbreak started in this
city. Every case reported is currently being treated in an outpatient
clinic.

The minister of health reassured the population, declaring that "this
product is no longer available in stores", and added that if this
product, manufactured a month ago, were found now, it might not be
fit for human consumption.

The Food Safety office, along with SENASA (National Service for
Agricultural and Alimentary Sanitation, Spanish initials) are also
investigating the pork farm where the infected animals came from.
SENASA officers pointed out that, in general, in these cases pork is
brought from illegal farms with poor sanitary conditions and the
presence of many other animals, such as rats.

Frechou said that it is quite common to observe in rural areas
"inappropriate farms" where there are no adequate sanitary
conditions, indicating that adequate control and supervision from
health authorities is lacking. He added that the brand implicated in
this outbreak "has already stopped production."
