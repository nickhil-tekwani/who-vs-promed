Reusken CBEM, Messadi L, Feyisa A, Ularamu H, Godeke G-J, Danmarwa A, et al. Geographic distribution of MERS coronavirus among dromedary camels, Africa.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We found serologic evidence for the circulation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] among dromedary camels in Nigeria, Tunisia, and Ethiopia. Circulation of the virus among dromedaries across broad areas of Africa may indicate that this disease is currently underdiagnosed in humans outside the Arabian Peninsula.

The study [summ.]
-----------------
High percentages of animals seropositive for MERS-CoV were observed in Nigeria [358 samples] and Ethiopia [188 samples]; the overall seropositivity was 94 percent in adult dromedaries in Nigeria and 93 and 97 percent for juvenile and adult animals, respectively, in Ethiopia. All provinces in which dromedaries were sampled in both countries showed high rates of seropositivity. The overall seropositivity in dromedaries in Tunisia [204 samples] was 30 percent for animals up to 2 years of age and 54 percent for adult animals. Seropositivity of 36 and 40 percent was observed in Sidi Bouzid [centre] and Sousse [north-east] Provinces, respectively; 100 percent of the dromedaries in the province of Kebili [south-west, bordering Algeria; 39 dromedaries from 16 herds kept for tourist rides] were seropositive [map at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/tunisia-administrative-map.htm].

Conclusions
-----------
Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, accumulating serologic and molecular evidence demonstrates that the virus in dromedaries is genetically very similar to MERS-CoV in humans and points to the conclusion that dromedary camels are reservoirs for human infection. MERS-CoV genomic fragments have been detected in dromedaries in Qatar and Saudi Arabia; near full-genome sequences have been generated from dromedaries in Egypt and full-genome sequences have been generated from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.

Here, we show serologic evidence for circulation of MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV in dromedaries in countries in East, West, and North Africa, with possible herd-specific differences in prevalence in Tunisia. The lower seropositivity observed in herds raised for meat production in Tunisia might reflect a high turnover of camels with a continuous introduction of animals unexposed to the MERS-CoV into these herds. No camels imported from neighboring countries were found at the meat-producing farms in Sidi Bouzid and Sousse, only camels purchased from other farms in the same area or other areas in Tunisia. However, animals are frequently moved between Libya and Kebili for trade.

Samples in this study were collected during 2009-2011, confirming observations by us and others that the virus circulated well before March 2012, which is the estimated time of identification of the most common ancestor for the MERS-CoV strains found in humans to date. The earliest serologic indication for circulation of MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV in dromedaries was observed in 1992; however, this result was based on results of a whole-virus ELISA with undescribed specificity. On the basis of well-validated array and neutralization tests, the study of dromedaries in the United Arab Emirates showed the presence of MERS-CoV or MERS-Cov-like antibodies as early as 2003. The accumulated data on MERSCoV serology in dromedaries (Table 1: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/8/14-0590-t1.htm) show circulation of MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV in dromedaries in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula well before 2012, when the 1st cases in humans were identified, and show overall high levels of seropositivity, including in animals from countries without reported human cases.

A question raised by these findings is whether human cases occur outside the Arabian Peninsula and if such cases are currently underdiagnosed in Africa. In addition, for the whole region, the possibility exists that MERS-CoV illness occurred before its discovery in 2012 and that such infection has been overlooked in the areas with evidence for virus circulation among animals during the past 10 years.

Retrospective studies of cohorts of humans with respiratory illnesses of unknown etiology should address this notion.

Alternative explanations for the lack of cases in Africa could be the following: a different risk profile, for instance, related to demographics and local practices; or subtle genetic differences in the circulating virus strain. Full-genome sequencing, virus isolation, and phenotypic characterization of viruses circulating outside the Arabian Peninsula will resolve this issue.

Meanwhile, awareness of MERS-CoV infections should be raised among clinicians in Africa.

[2] Saudi Arabia, review

Camels and Contagion: Inside Global Hunt for Source of MERS
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. His name, 2 years later, is guarded within the privacy of medical files and a family compound of bereaved relatives, his wives, and his children. He was 60 years old. He was a businessman. He lived in Bishah, a small city southeast of the great Saudi port metropolis of Jeddah, and when he became too sick for the Bishah doctors to care for him properly, he was transported to Jeddah, feverish and coughing. There he lay, inside one of the tall white buildings of the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital, where a diagnostic physician called onto his case happened to be a virology specialist, an Egyptian physician named Ali Mohamed Zaki, who liked to pay close attention to the latest reports of pernicious infectious disease.

All this was at the very beginning, a single week in the middle of June 2012, long before the sick man was understood to be the "index patient."

At home in Bishah, in a paddock beside his family's homes, the index patient -- though that was not yet his nickname -- kept 4 camels that had no practical purpose except to live nearby. They were pets.

2. By the morning of Tuesday [13 May 2014], the Saudis' posted "cases passed away" stood at 152, with 495 cases diagnosed inside the country.

International tracking by the World Health Organization put the worldwide diagnosis totals at 536, with 145 deaths, as of [9 May 2014]. The many global points of confirmed MERS diagnoses now include Athens, Greece (male health care worker, just back from Saudi Arabia); Batu Pahat, Malaysia (male religious pilgrim, just back from Saudi Arabia); and the 2 American cities -- Munster, Indiana, and Orlando, Florida -- in which health care workers returning from Saudi Arabia have in recent weeks received MERS diagnoses.

3. Saudi Arabia remains the epicenter, as it was during the detective hunt set off by the man from Bishah [details in the full paper]. It was already a season of exceedingly bad news, from the public health perspective, and then last month confirmation came from a new international study, led by researchers from King Saud and Columbia Universities: MERS-CoV, either the active virus or its biological footprint, was in 3/4ths of the kingdom's camels too.

4. Finally, as though an international viral contagion mystery were not burden enough, there is this matter of the camels. In the United States and Europe there is really no single equivalent to the Saudi Arabian camel. Camels in the kingdom are like dairy cows, beef cows, racehorses, pulling horses, beloved Labradors, and living daily reminders of holy scripture, all in one. (Camels appear, honorably, in the Quran.) The main cities of Saudi Arabia are dense constructions of steel and concrete, lined with international fast-food outlets, spiky with half-built skyscrapers, crisscrossed by those lethal highways. Nobody ventures into urban streets with camels, as one might see in certain cities of India. But just a few miles out along the freeway, as soon as the desert space begins to stretch between buildings, herds of camels are as familiar a sight as countryside grazing cows in my home state of California. Saudi butchers sell camel meat. Camel dishes are a specialty of some restaurants. Camel milk is regarded as wholesome and good for the human gut. So the scientific study that made international news last month [April 2014], finding signs of current or past MERS-CoV infection in most of the kingdom's camels, was a rattling assault upon multiple sectors of Saudi society -- food shoppers, farmers, restaurant cooks, butchers, racing-camel trainers and stable hands, market camel handlers, and families -- like the index patient's -- with prized camels living placidly in the side yard.

Those particular pet camels, incidentally, proved not to be infected. But after the startling Canary Islands and Omani camel findings, Saudi researchers, working with Ian Lipkin's team in New York, were able to accumulate an enormous amount of camel serum, some of it fresh, and some, pulled from storage, dating back as far as 1992. Even that serum, the stuff more than 2 decades old, contained MERS-CoV antibodies. The study's authors concluded that this virus, or something nearly identical, has been infecting Saudi Arabia's dromedaries for at least 20 years.

And fully a quarter of the living camels they studied -- the kingdom's current dromedary stock -- appeared to be carrying live virus. It wasn't that the camels were acting like human beings with MERS; camels get sick sometimes, displaying random symptoms such as sneezing and runny noses. But nobody's identified an outbreak of critically ill Saudi dromedaries, which is both perplexing and worrisome. Assuming camels are somehow passing the virus to humans -- assuming MERS-CoV is not also coming from some other animal reservoir, which a Saudi zoologist I talked to thinks may prove to be the case -- then there's no easy way to tell exactly which camels may be dangerous up close.

Wait, it gets worse. Many Saudi camels are imported. They come from neighboring Middle Eastern countries, in part, but also from countries in eastern Africa, including such already beleaguered places as Sudan and Somalia. Just now online, not scheduled for formal publishing until this summer, is a brand-new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report [see in item 1 above] finding widespread evidence of MERS-CoV in African dromedary camels too.

The unknowns implicit in these new findings are unnerving. Are African villagers and camel handlers -- in communities without specialized testing or even decent hospital access -- walking around now with a contagious deadly virus they don't know they have? It's possible. Are Africans carrying it but not dying from it because they've somehow adapted, in a way urban Saudis have not? It's possible. Are Africans dying from it but going undiagnosed, just because MERS has not become a national preoccupation in places like Sudan, which have other dreadful health problems to attend to? It's possible.

What about Australia, separated by a mighty stretch of ocean from the hospital infections of Jeddah? Australia has camels. They're not domestic; the Brits brought them in the 19th century as pack animals, and the camels were let loose to go feral. They now number about 300 000. A zoonotic disease scientist in Australia told me last week that MERS research is now under way there as well: "diagnostic and surveillance activities, which currently includes MERS in bats and camels," he wrote in an email, adding that he could not yet provide further details.

The World Health Organization has assembled a special emergency MERS committee, with members from 17 countries; they held their 5th conference today [13 May 2014]. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has called an extraordinary multicountry MERS meeting for later this month [May 2014], in Oman.

It is still the case, after all these studies, that nobody knows for sure how the virus is getting from animals into human beings. There's no apparent evidence of high MERS rates among people who butcher or work directly with camels either. A few of the patients had been in contact with camels, but many more, as far as is currently known, had not. And nobody knows whether the virus can pass to people in camel meat or milk; there's a kingdomwide screening effort under way now. A couple of weeks ago WHO and Saudi health authorities began issuing warnings: Don't eat raw camel products, mask up if you have to work with camels, stay away from them if you don't.

[3] Opinion
Date: Wed 14 May 2014

http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/05/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome


MERS is something of a medical mystery. The disease is widely found in dromedary camels, which have long carried the virus. In the Middle East camels are worked, raced and even kept as pets. Their milk is drunk unpasteurized and made into cheese, their meat cooked, and sometimes their urine is imbibed, as it is thought to have medicinal properties ­- all of which has been going on for centuries. But most MERS patients have had no contact with camels or camel products -­ and where did the camels get the virus?

Laurie Garrett, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a leading expert on pandemics, thinks the likely primary host ­- and cause of at least some of the recent surge in Saudi MERS cases ­- is a type of fruit bat known as the Egyptian tomb bat, which has been a host to the virus for centuries. The past few weeks is the time of year workers start pollinating date trees -­ which means clambering all over the bats' roosts. And those roosts are covered with bat saliva, urine and droppings. Ms Garrett anticipates another surge in cases when the workers cover the date trees in nets (to protect the fruit from bats) in late June.

On 14 May 2014, following a meeting of its International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it was not, for now, declaring MERS a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (commonly known as a PHEIC). Given the acceleration and growing globalization of the virus, some health experts questioned that decision. Many wondered if it was politically motivated -­ having targeted one predominantly Islamic country (Pakistan) with polio-related travel restrictions, the WHO may be leery of offending a 2nd. Instead it simply offered some guidelines: improve and implement national policies for infection prevention at health-care facilities; raise public awareness; share more information; and so on. The same day, signs warning travellers about MERS started appearing in some American international airports.

SARs demonstrated just how disruptive even a few thousand cases can be -­ not only in terms of the sick and dying, but also economically. Hospitals lost billions of dollars overhauling their procedures and delaying everything from routine admissions to surgeries. Tourism slumped in those regions hardest hit by the virus, with hotels and local businesses bearing the brunt. On one estimate, the global cost of SARS in 2003 alone was up to USD 54 billion. Given its deadlier (and hence scarier) nature, MERS could prove even more costly.

Worse, a MERS vaccine is unlikely to be available any time soon, optimistic press releases from drug companies and research labs notwithstanding. For one thing, it will take years for any effective vaccine to be tested and then approved by regulators. For another, recall that MERS is a close relative of SARS; 11 years on, there is still no SARS vaccine in sight.

[4] Addressing rumors in Saudi Arabia

Dates do not transmit the coronavirus; no cure for the virus
------------------------------------------------------------
In a statement from an expert to "Al-Riyadh" daily, she addressed rumors circulating in the social media about the coronavirus, its mode of transmission and treatment of patients. She particularly related to the rumors about the possible transmission of the "coronavirus syndrome" (Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV) by means of dates, and camel milk and camel meat. Plants can be contaminated, but only cells of mammalian animals and humans can be infected by the virus. There are no scientific studies to prove the opposite. The rumors about the possible role of dates are, according to the expert, exaggerated if not untrue; anyway, consumers are advised to wash dates.

Camel meat should be thoroughly cooked and camel milk boiled before consumption. Additional advice includes hygienic procedures such as cleanliness of kitchen utensils, use of gloves, hand washing, etc.

In reference to the propagation and trade in popular/folk medicaments, the expert advised people to ignore the mixtures and herbs promoted as treatment of MERS-CoV patients, which are misleading.

[The social-media propagated rumors on the possible role of (mechanically contaminated) dates in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is probably related to the suspected involvement of fruit bats. This route deserves to be scientifically checked in order to be decisively refuted or otherwise. - Mod.AS]

[5] Public response, Saudi Arabia

Date: Sat, 17 May 2014

http://dt.bh/kissing-camels-is-it-safe/


The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is very scary. This week, while avoiding the term global health emergency, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that the deadly viral infection was both serious and urgent, reported The Washington Post.

So far, there have been 571 confirmed cases of MERS; 171 of those people died from the disease.

There's one place, however, where the mood about MERS isn't scaring everyone. It's also the place where the infection was 1st reported in 2012 and where almost 500 recorded cases have been found so far: Saudi Arabia.

And the skepticism about the virus has taken a strange turn in Saudi Arabia, where people have begun kissing camels in response to MERS.

It seems a strange protest, but there's something behind it. Earlier this week, the Saudi government began a campaign to stop people from eating raw camel meat and liver or drinking unpasteurised camel milk.

Partly due to this fondness for camels, and partly due to a perceived lack of transparency from the Saudi government about MERS, a lot of people aren't totally convinced by the warnings about camels.

[The world's camel population is estimated at about 25 million animals, most of them dromedaries (single-humped). The following statistics, derived from OIE's database, pertain to the 4 countries addressed above:

Ethiopia (2012): 2 245 581
Nigeria (2012): 92 699
Saudi Arabia (2012): 213 320
Tunisia (2013): 80 000

The information on the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, in particular concerning the virus reservoir and its transmission into the human population, has been considerably broadened since late 2013; item 1 is illustrative. It is indeed relieving to note the increased and energetic involvement of globally leading research institutions. However, there is still a long way to go; the picture is still rather hazy, as highlighted in items 2 and 3. This leaves room for rumors and unfounded perceptions within the threatened population, as demonstrated in items 4 and 5. Public education needs solid facts to become effective. Close cooperation between public health and animal health authorities, both on the national and international levels, is of paramount importance.

A regional technical consultation meeting on MERS-CoV is being arranged by the FAO, in consultation with its global and regional partners, in Muscat, Oman on 20 and 21 May 2014 with the participation of the main stakeholders from the region.

The main objectives of this meeting are to:
- review current knowledge on the disease in affected countries and the potential role of animal species in the epidemiological cycle of MERS-CoV;
- analyse the recent developments in diagnostic and surveillance tools to support animal investigations;
- identify and agree on actions that will minimize disease spread, based on current epidemiological knowledge; and
- discuss and agree on mechanisms for intra-regional cooperation in investigations, research and knowledge sharing.

The main expected outcomes of the meeting will be a better understanding of MERS-CoV overall, and in particular of the link between MERS-CoV and animal species, as well as the establishment of coordinated initiatives among countries for the effective monitoring of MERS-CoV in animal species.

See also FAO's review of 6 May 2014 at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_060514.html.

OIE has updated its MERS-CoV Q&A page on 12 May 2014. The following excerpt, newly included in the page, is copied for the convenience of subscribers: "Though some camel infections with MERS-CoV have been associated with mild respiratory symptoms in the animals, current evidence does not indicate that MERS-CoV causes significant illness in camels. Evidence from the limited number of infections that have been identified also suggests that infection in these camels has been self-limiting. To develop a more complete understanding of the potential role of camels (and other animals) in the epidemiology of MERS, several types of investigation are needed:
1. Epidemiological studies which aim to determine the risk factors and potential exposure sources for camel infection and how camel infections relate to human cases of MERS; this includes genetic analyses of MERS-CoV.
2. Animal infection studies (including experimental challenges) to determine the behavior of MERS-CoV in camels (and other animals) and how the virus may be shed from infected camels.
3. In parallel diagnostic tests used for MERS-CoV surveillance in camels (and other animals) should be assessed for the reliability of their results in these species."

The need for experimental infection trials in camels has been addressed in ProMED-mail postings 20130811.1875301 and 20130907.1929762. The revised OIE Q&A is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-may-2014-questions-answers-on-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov/. - Mod.AS]
