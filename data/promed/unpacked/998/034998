57 sick; norovirus strikes Scottish swimmers
-------------------------------------
Swimming is dangerous is Scotland too -- and not always because of monsters. Over 50 people took ill after taking part in an open water swimming event at Strathclyde Loch. They suffered sickness, stomach cramps and diarrhoea following the race which attracted 70 entrants from across Scotland.

None of those affected are thought to have been hospitalised, however, the loch has now been closed to water sports and boating. Some of those who fell sick tested positive for norovirus. Experts believe heavy rain prior to the event may have contaminated the water. A Motherwell Masters Amateur Swimming Club source said 6 members of their club took part and were "very ill." They had to seek medical advice following the event and some were off work for a week, she added.

The event, the Western Districts Open Water Swimming Championships, took place on 23 Jun 2012.

[This is the 1st report of norovirus infection contracted during open water swimming in Scotland (or anywhere else). Norovirus infection is more commonly contracted as a result consumption of uncooked oysters or similar filter-feeding organisms. The outbreak associated with open-water swimming in Strathclyde loch (an artificial fresh water loch) is indicative of serious faecal contamination, since more than 50 of the 70 participants became ill.

Strathclyde Country Park is a country park located in Lanarkshire, Scotland. The park covers some 4 km sq, centred on the artificial Strathclyde Loch. It is located next to the River Clyde between Hamilton and Motherwell. Strathclyde Park forms what used to be known as the Low parks of the now demolished Hamilton Palace and still includes buildings associated with the palace.

When the loch was created in the early 1970s it involved the flooding of an old mining village. The west side of the park is bounded by the River Clyde, which was diverted when the loch was built in 1975. The remains of Bothwellhaugh Roman Fort and a Roman bath house can be seen in the park, where the South Calder Water flows into the loch.
