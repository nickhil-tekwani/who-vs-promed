[Anthrax is seldom reported in Sicily with the latest outbreaks in 2014 and 2016. How and why its recent appearance is unclear. These 2018 outbreaks are not distant from the September and October 2016 outbreaks in Maniace. For clarification we must await insightful comments from our informed colleague Antonio Fasanella, Chief of Anthrax Reference Institute of Italy. - Mod.MHJ]
