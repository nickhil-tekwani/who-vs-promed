Indonesia: Suspected Father and Son Avian Influenza Cases Test Negative
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: The results of local tests on an Indonesian father and son
hospitalised in Jakarta with bird flu symptoms show that they [have
not contracted avian H5N1 influenza virus infection], a senior Health
Ministry official said on Friday [21 Oct 2005]. Hariadi Wibisono, a
Director at the Ministry, told Reuters samples would still be sent to
a laboratory in Hong Kong for confirmation [of the negative result].
The father and son case prompted the Health Minister on Thursday [20
Oct 2005] to say [that the cases might represent a cluster] and that
[avian H5N1 influenza virus] could possibly be spreading from human
to human in Indonesia. But the World Health Organisation on Friday
[21 Oct 2005] said this did not mean the virus was mutating.

[Yesterday (Thu 20 Oct 2005) it was reported from Indonesia that a
father and son, and a baby, had been admitted to a Jakarta Hospital
on suspicion of having contracted avian influenza virus infection.
(The baby is not related to the father and son). It was suggested in
addition that this "cluster" might be indicative of human-to-human
transmission of avian H5N1 influenza virus (see: Avian influenza,
human - East Asia (148): Indonesia, Thailand 20051020.3057).
Laboratory testing in Jakarta has not confirmed the initial clinical
diagnosis and at present these cases are not ranked as avian
influenza cases. Therefore the number of confirmed human cases of
avian influenza in Indonesia is unchanged from 5, including 3 deaths.
Further laboratory tests will be undertaken at the WHO-designated
reference laboratory in Hong Kong to confirm the result of the local
tests. - Mod.CP]
