Woman tests negative for bird flu
---------------------------------
A woman who touched a sick bird that later died and tested positive
for avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus has tested negative for influenza,
the Centre for Health Protection reports.

The 48-year-old woman picked up the sick bird with her bare hands and
without wearing a face mask on Tue 13 Dec 2011. She developed flu
symptoms the next day and was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital
yesterday [15 Dec 2011] for isolation and lab tests.

The woman's 11-year-old son was also admitted to the hospital for
isolation and lab tests as a precautionary measure. He had recovered
from a fever and cough earlier this week.

[The evidence for transmission of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus
infection from a sick black-headed gull to the woman who subsequently
24 hours later developed influenza-like symptoms was never more than
circumstantial. The results of laboratory investigation indicate that
her influenza-like symptoms were not due to avian influenza virus
infection. Her son, who was admitted to hospital at the same time,
appears to have exhibited influenza-like symptoms prior to exposure to
the sick gull.

It remains true that transmission of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection
from wild birds to humans, even where there is close contact, is a
rare event. - Mod.CP]
