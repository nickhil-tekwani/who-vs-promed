Mosquito-borne horse infections rise in Louisiana
----------------------
An increase in mosquito-borne virus infections in horses has prompted Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, DVM, to warn owners to vaccinate their horses.

Eighteen horses to date have fallen victim to Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile Virus (WNV).

"The rain we've been having creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes," Strain said.

"If a mosquito bites an infected bird, Eastern Equine Encephalitis or West Nile can be spread to horses, dogs, cats, even alligators and, of course, humans."

The mosquito-transmitted diseases can cause inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord.

So far this year, the department's Office of Veterinary Health has reported 8 WNV and 10 EEE cases in horses.

"Horses are infected the same way humans become infected, by being bitten by infected mosquitoes," Strain said. "We want people to also be mindful of mosquitoes and to take preventative measures to stay safe."

Infected horses may show lethargy, weakness, paralysis or even death. Prevention includes avoiding mosquitoes, using mosquito repellants that are safe for horses and humans, and vaccination for horses. So far, there is no vaccination approved for people.

Ten cases of WNV have been reported in humans so far this year.

"We need to follow the One Health concept in which we battle these deadly diseases together in an effort to keep humans and animals safe," added Strain.

Horse owners should contact their local veterinarian regarding proper vaccination protocols during this time of increased risk.

[Most horses die or are euthanized from EEE. That is such a needless death. Vaccination can prevent the disease. However, immune responses to EEE are lost quicker than some of the other diseases. It is recommended to vaccinate every 4-6 months. The initial vaccination is a vaccine, and other one about 2-3 weeks later, and then every 4-6 months. This is a small cost to keep your horse healthy. Most equine vaccines are a combination. The vaccines usually have West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis in one shot. Tetanus may be in this as well. In some areas, Venezuelan equine encephalitis may also be in the vaccine. So vaccinating your horse can protect the animal from many diseases. Please vaccinate early and often.

Human beings should follow the 4-D rule.
- Dusk and dawn should be times when you are indoors.
- DEET (N,N-dimethyl-M-toluamide) based mosquito repellants should be used
- Dress in light colored long sleeve shirts and long pants when outside.
- Drain any standing water from your area, such as old tires, flower pots, clogged rain gutters, etc. As these little pools of water are great breeding sites for mosquitoes.
