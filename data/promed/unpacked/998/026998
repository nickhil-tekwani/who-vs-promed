Abstract
--------
Strains of a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium, designated MY50T, MY63 and MY101, were isolated from wound samples of 3 hospitalized patients in Yangon, Myanmar. Strains MY50T, MY63, and MY101 grew at temperatures of 4-44 deg C [39.2-111.2 deg F], in media containing 1.0-7.0 % (w/v [weight/volume]) NaCl and at pH 6.0-9.5. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene and whole genome sequences showed that these strains belonged to the genus _Pseudomonas_ and were part of the _P. oleovorans_ group and located close to _P. guguanensis_ and _P. mendocina_. Whole-genome comparisons, using average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization analyses, confirmed that strains MY50T, MY63, and MY101 were the same strain and they were a distinct species in the _P. oleovorans_ group. Results of phenotypic characterization tests demonstrated that utilization of p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid, glycerol, l-pyroglutamic acid, and quinic acid could distinguish these strains from other species of the _P. oleovorans_ group. These genetic and phenotypic characteristics suggest that they should be classified as representing a novel species, under the proposed name _P. yangonensis_ sp. nov. The type strain is MY50T (=LMG 31602T,=JCM 33396T), with a DNA G+C content of 62.82 mol%.

[A survey of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in medical settings in Myanmar resulted in the isolation of 3 strains of a novel species within the genus _Pseudomonas_ from wound samples of 3 patients in Yangon, for which the investigators propose the name _Pseudomonas yangonensis_ sp. nov. The 3 strains were resistant to 7-9 (including meropenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam) of the 13 antibiotics tested.

The authors of the journal article referenced above note that the genus _Pseudomonas_ has 215 species, few of which cause infections in humans; these include _P. aeruginosa_, _P. stuzeri_, _P. putida_, _P. asiatica_, and _P. mendocina_. _Pseudomonas_ species are divided into 3 lineages (_P. aeruginosa_, _P. pertucinogena_ and _P. fluorescens_), which are further divided into 13 groups. _P. yangonensis_ is in the _P. oleovorans_ group, which belongs to the _P. aeruginosa_ lineage.

_P. aeruginosa_, a Gram-negative bacterium commonly occurring in soil and water, is an opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. Water is a common source for nosocomial outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ infection and the formation of biofilms on environmental surfaces is well known to cause difficulties in their eradication. In some outbreaks, colonized healthcare workers (HCWs) transmitted _P. aeruginosa_ to patients and strict adherence to hand disinfection policies were frequently effective in controlling outbreaks (http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-9-70).

One study found that long or artificial fingernails were a risk factor for colonization of the hands of HCWs (https://doi.org/10.1086/501739). We are not given any clinical or epidemiological details about the 3 _P. yangonensis_-infected patients. Were these polymicrobial or monomicrobial infections? How were the patients treated? Were the infections nosocomial or community-acquired? Was this organism cultured from any environmental sources? More information on these patients from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Yangon (formerly Rangoon), with a population of over 5 million residents in 2014 and the largest number of colonial-era buildings in Southeast Asia, is the capital of the Yangon Region and the largest city of Myanmar; Yangon is the country's main center for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment, and tourism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon#Communication).
