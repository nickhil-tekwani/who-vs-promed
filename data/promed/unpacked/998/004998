It would be interesting to find out more about the sale of raw milk for "cosmetic purposes". Sellers of raw milk have used a wide variety of strategies to sell raw milk to people who believe that they obtain health benefits from drinking it (cow shares, farm shares, etc.). I wonder if marketing the raw milk for "cosmetic purposes" was yet another creative strategy to provide it to customers to consume.

Scores of Melbourne [Victoria] stores are still selling dangerous unpasteurised milk beside drinks, despite revelations that a child died and another 4 became seriously ill after drinking it. The Herald Sun found at least 10 inner-suburban stores selling "cosmetic" or "bath" milk yesterday, 11 Dec 2014. Despite the products not being for human consumption, most were in traditional milk bottles, on shelves beside ordinary milk and yoghurt. Additionally, dozens of raw milk drinkers contacted the Herald Sun to say they would continue to drink it in the belief it was healthful, ignoring clear warnings from Victorian health officials of the possibly deadly risks.

The Australian Federal Government said it was willing to crack down on killer bath milk. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has begun an urgent investigation of the milk's packaging, which, despite labelling that unpasteurized milk should not be consumed, is similar to that of normal drinking milk. Consumer Affairs Minister Bruce Billson told the Herald Sun that he had major concerns about the products. Premier Daniel Andrews said he also was unsatisfied with the regulations surrounding the widespread sale of unpasteurized milk.

As revealed by the Herald Sun, a 3-year-old Mornington Peninsula child died and 4 other young children became seriously ill in recent weeks after drinking unpasteurized milk being sold in Victoria. The sale of untreated cow's milk for human consumption is illegal in Australia owing to its high risk of contamination; however, many brands are legally sold "cosmetic" products. But yesterday, 11 Dec 2014, stores in Malvern, Carlton, Fitzroy, Balaclava, Thornbury, Elsternwick, Albert Park, Box Hill and Belgrave all stocked it near other food items.

Despite disclaimers that the milk was not for human consumption, one owner told the Herald Sun he was a regular drinker of the milk. "It's real food in its natural form. There is more nutrition in raw milk and it's good for you, if it's not contaminated," the man said. Another shop owner admitted selling it in the knowledge customers were drinking it. "You'd need a lot of it for a bath, and it's AUD 10 [about USD 8] a bottle."

The owner of Mountain View Farm in Longwarry, which produced the "Organic Bath Milk" that was drunk by the toddler who died, has now promised to change the milk's labelling to make it clearer that it is not for human consumption. She maintained that her milk was sold only as a cosmetic product, despite admitting she drank it herself.

"We label it 'for cosmetic purposes'. It's a requirement from the Health Department. If people ask us if it's safe to drink, we tell them it's bath milk," she said. Asked why it was packaged like regular milk and stocked in food stores, she said that it was "not something you think about".
