[Would it be possible to get a confirmation of what is mentioned in this
PACNEWS excerpt, and share more information about this outbreak and the
control activities undertaken? Typhoid is a health problem present in the
region, and what is happening in Nauru could be of interest for other
Pacific Islands countries and territories Thanks a lot! -- TK

EXCERPT FROM PACNEWS STARTS

Nauru concerned about typhoid outbreak
YAREN (Pacnews) - The discovery of typhoid cases in Nauru is worrying
health authorities in the country.
Nauru's Director of Health Services Doctor Godfrey Waidubu said the
disease, although not confirmed, may have been introduced from food
products imported from either Fiji or Kiribati.
He said health inspectors on the island had been instructed to confiscate
and destroy all imported foodstuff suspected of being contaminated with
the disease. Export products will also be scrutinised. The products under
examination include cooked food.
The Health Department has also advised the national flag carrier Air Nauru
not to uplift food products from Nadi Airport in Fiji or the Kiribati
capital Tarawa, unless they have been officially certified for export by
local health authorities.
Doctor Waidubu said the department was concerned about the further spread
of typhoid fever to Nauru and other parts of the Pacific region.
He said the department had begun an intensive campaign to eradicate the
disease.
"This includes testing of domestic fresh water tanks, underground water
supplies, and areas on the foreshore in the vicinity of sewerage outlets.
Restaurants and hotels are being surveyed to ensure compliance with health
regulations," Doctor Waidubu said.
