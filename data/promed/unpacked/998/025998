The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the 1st case of Japanese encephalitis in Korea this year [2021] on [30 Aug 2021] and requested special attention, such as compliance with mosquito bite prevention rules.

The case is a woman in her 40s living in Sejong City. She had no underlying disease other than an ovarian cyst and had no history of Japanese encephalitis vaccination.

The location of infection may be different from the patient's residence, and an epidemiological investigation is currently in progress.

This patient is the 1st patient since the Japanese encephalitis advisory issued [Mon 22 Mar 2021] and the warning issued [Thu 5 Aug 2021], and the 1st patient, more than a month earlier than last year [8 Oct 2020].

Japanese encephalitis can be transmitted when bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, and clinical symptoms occur in about 1 in 250 people, some progress to fatal acute encephalitis, 20 to 30% die, and 30 to 50% of survivors will have neurological, cognitive, or behavioral sequelae.

Children aged 12 months to 12 years old are subject to the Japanese Encephalitis National Vaccination Program and need to be vaccinated according to the standard vaccination schedule.

Vaccination is recommended for adults who have never been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis, those who live in areas with a high risk of Japanese encephalitis vector mosquitoes, and persons who plan to travel to countries with Japanese encephalitis.

Japanese encephalitis endemic countries include Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, Guam, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russia, Saipan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Viet Nam, East Timor, [among others].

[The Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus transmission season is underway in South Korea. The JE cases in recent years and the one reported above are not surprising, since South Korea is within the JEV endemic area, and cases occur sporadically there. Although severe JE cases are uncommon, vaccination recommended by the health authorities is prudent since infections can be serious and even fatal. Affected individuals acquire their JE infections in agricultural areas where the mosquito vectors are common and birds that are the reservoir hosts are present and breeding. Transmission of JE virus will continue until the 1st killing frosts of autumn occur. - Mod.TY
