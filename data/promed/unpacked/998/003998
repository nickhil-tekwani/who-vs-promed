Vancouver Coastal Health is warning customers of Finest at Sea Ocean Products not to consume 4 varieties of Bruno's Best ready-to-eat seafood products. The health authority says the 4 products sold under the brand name "Bruno's Best" have been recalled because they could potentially grow _Clostridium botulinum_.

The products are:
Bruno's Best Tuna Confit
Bruno's Best BC Octopus Conserva
Bruno's Best House Smoked BC Sardines
Bruno's Best House Smoked Pacific Oysters

They were sold between 1 Jun and 1 Oct 2014 at Finest at Sea stores at 4675 Arbutus St. and 1805 Mast Tower, Granville Island in Vancouver, BC Canada.

During an inspection, Vancouver Coastal Health says inspectors discovered that the products were not properly processed using valid food safety standards. It says the retailer is cooperating fully and has stopped selling the items and that there are no reported cases of illness.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Seafood-related episodes of botulism are generally associated with botulinum toxin type E. - Mod.LL
