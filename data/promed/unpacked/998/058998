At least 19 people died and 172 others fell ill in the eastern province of Kratie, Cambodia, after drinking rice wine brewed with "high levels of methanol" confirmed the Cambodian Ministry of Health on Sun 13 Dec 2015.

"According to latest figures, 19 people died and 172 others felt ill after drinking tainted rice wine in 5 separate incidents since 19 Nov 2015," Ly Sovann, a spokesman for the ministry told Xinhua.

"Laboratory tests have shown that the deaths were caused by high levels of methanol in the wine," he said.

Local authorities closed all the establishments in the province that produced rice wine, he said, and added that stalls selling rice wine were also temporarily closed.

Health officials were sent to the province to investigate these incidents.

Rice or plant-based wines are popular in rural areas in the country due to their low cost.

[This appears to be a follow up to the ProMED-mail posting Undiagnosed deaths - Cambodia: (KH) 20151213.3859086, where rice wine at a barbecue may have killed as many people as the main course of the barbecue (dog). Please refer to that posting for a better understanding of the incident.

Methanol is not one of the usual ingredients in rice wine. So it was either added to give an extra kick and perhaps a secret ingredient to flavor, or it was an accidental contaminate.

It is a contaminant. The question is why was it there?

Methanol is something usually reserved to mimic distilled spirits, such as vodka and others, so the use in wine seems very odd.

Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of methanol-contaminated whiskey or other alcohol products. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates, it is generally small, and, consequently, primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol toxicity than other animals.

Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.

Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a 40 percent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal lethal dose. With aggressive medical care, it is possible to survive the ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may cause blindness, depending on the amount and individual tolerance.

Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.

Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently, it has a longer elimination half-life.

Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours after ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.

Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion, which are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.

Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though visual defects have persisted in up to 25 percent of severe cases.

Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol.

Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type of treatment to be helpful.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment. - Mod.TG
