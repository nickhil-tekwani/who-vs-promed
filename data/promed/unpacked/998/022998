Infection outbreak strikes students at local school
---------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the 2002--2003 school year, there have been about 50
cases of MRSA (methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_) infection
among the students in Pasadena, Texas' independent school district [a
community in the south eastern Houston suburbs - Mod.LL], a staph infection
that is resistant to certain antibiotics and can be more difficult to treat.
This bacterial infection was discovered about 2 weeks into the school year.
Officials believe the infection may have started with some of the team
sports, like the football team. One parent has 2 children who have
contracted MRSA infection. She says her son, who's on the football team,
has had to make 20 trips to the doctor so far, and has missed about 13 days
of school because of the boils that attack his skin. The symptoms first
appeared 2 months ago.
Pasadena ISD Spokesman Kirk Lewis was told about parents' complaints that
the district hasn't done anything to correct the situation. "We've done
everything we know to do," he responded. Pasadena ISD says 29 students at
Rayburn have been affected, and 50 district-wide. Officials say they took
safety measures right after the initial outbreak. Lewis told Eyewitness
News, "We initially went through and cleaned all the gyms with an extra
disinfectant just to try and make sure that the surfaces were clean. And
then, as we began talking with the health department and the physicians,
that's not the way this is contracted." Lewis says county officials report
MRSA is spread through human contact, and that could be why the football
team got hit so hard. But he says the school district is doing all it can,
and the kids should, too.
The Harris County Health Department is sending out a questionnaire to all
the parents around the school district and county-wide to try to get an
idea how widespread this problem is. "90 per cent of the time MRSA causes a
local skin and soft tissue infection, treated generally with oral
antibiotics and occasionally may require drainage and an abscess,"
explained Dr Sheldon Kaplan of the Baylor College of Medicine.

[Clusters of infection spread by direct contact among members of a
competitive sports or recreational group are well recognized (1) and have
been caused by _Herpes simplex_, _Trichophyton species_ (cutaneous fungal
infection), Group A streptococcus, the molluscum contagiosum and hepatitis
B viruses as well as _Staphyloccoccus aureus_. Both methicillin-sensitive
and -resistant staphylococci have been represented. In fact, a cluster of
community acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) occurred in a high school wrestling team
in Vermont, USA in 1993-94 (2).
Regarding CA-MRSA itself, most of the initial isolates that seemed to have
been acquired without health care center contact could, in fact, be linked
back to a hospital (3). It is, however, now clear that true CA-MRSA is
occurring more frequently. Outbreaks in the USA have been reported in a
number of states including Illinois, Texas, Minnesota, and New Mexico.
Two abstracts highlighting aspects of CA-MRSA were presented at last
December's Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy meeting in Chicago,
Illinois (4, 5). It seems clear that significant differences exist between
CA-MRSA and its nosocomial (hospital-acquired) cousin. Antimicrobial
sensitivity-wise, the community acquired strains are usually resistant only
to the beta-lactam group of agents and retain sensitivity to a number of
other agents that the hospital strains do not. These include clindamycin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethaxozole, and the quinolones. Although not directly
stated in the news piece, it is implied that this CA-MRSA cluster was
"multi-susceptible". It appears that the CA-MRSA strains have acquired a
transposon only coding for the _mecA_ gene which confers resistance to the
beta-lactams only altering the penicillin binding protein PBP 2A.
In addition, Fey's group reported that CA-MRSA strains may produce
superantigens such as SEB and SEC (staphylococcal toxins B and C) that
appear to be important in the pathogenesis of toxic shock syndrome (4).
Hospital acquired MRSA strains generally do not produce these antigens.
