Date submitted to OIE: 30 Apr 2020
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 8 Jan 2020
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: lumpy skin disease virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Houran Al Boudy, Jablah, Al Ladhiqiyah [Latakia]
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: resolved 26 Apr 2020
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 182 / 15 / 2 / 0 / 2

Affected population: Dairy farms in Jablah district with a population of 182 heads of cattle. The affected animals are calves, heifers, and cows. Clinical symptoms are fever, lumps in the skin, enlarged lymph nodes. The total number of affected animals is 15 heads. All cattle were vaccinated against lumpy skin disease in the district and province in March 2020, and there are no new cases in the village.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 8.24 / 1.1 / 13.33 / 2.2
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; screening; quarantine; disinfection; disinfestation; control of vectors; ante- and post-mortem inspections; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: vector surveillance

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[In July 2019, Syria reported an event of lumpy skin disease (LSD); 2 outbreaks were reported, affecting the provinces of Hamah and Hims. The event was communicated as resolved on 8 Jan 2020. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=31252.

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterized by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs; emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; edema of the skin; and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. Lumpy skin disease is endemic in most African and Middle Eastern countries. In 2015 and 2016 the disease spread to southeast Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus."

Vaccination has become known to be the most effective measure to control LSD. The disease is vector-borne, with a seasonal pattern.

According to a statement in the current OIE report, "All cattle were vaccinated against lumpy skin disease in the district and province in March 2020, and there [are] no new cases in the village," it would be useful to note which vaccine has been used. The commercially available LSD vaccines are live attenuated. Some vaccine strains are known to potentially cause LSD-like post-vaccination lesions/disease signs (though milder than the field strains). In particular, this has been observed in _Bos taurus_ cattle.

Such a post-vaccination event affecting cattle in Jordan was reported in 2014. The duration between vaccine administration and appearance of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 20 days (mean = 10.3, SD 3.9). No mortality was reported. Duration (course) of clinical signs ranged from 3 to 20 days (mean = 13.7, SD 4.1) (see ProMED-mail posting 20140816.2696557).

"Live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus have been used as vaccines specifically for the control of LSD. Capripoxviruses are cross-reactive within the genus. Consequently, it is possible to protect cattle against LSD using strains of capripoxvirus derived from sheep or goats. However, it is recommended to carry out controlled trials, using the most susceptible breeds, prior to introducing a vaccine strain not usually used in cattle. The duration of protection provided by LSD vaccination is unknown. Capripoxvirus vaccine strains can produce a large local reaction at the site of inoculation in _Bos taurus_ breeds, which some stock owners find unacceptable. This has discouraged the use of vaccine, even though the consequences of an outbreak of LSD are invariably more severe. Risk-benefit of vaccination should be assessed following stakeholder discussion."

"LSDV is not transmissible to humans. However, all laboratory manipulations must be performed at an appropriate containment level determined by biorisk analysis."
