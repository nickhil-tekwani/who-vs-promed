A 7-year-old white-tailed doe from a Fairchild area deer farm that died on 8 Jun 2015 had chronic wasting disease, according to state veterinarian Paul McGraw. The CWD detection announced on Wed 24 Jun 2015 was confirmed recently by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

The deer farm, Fairchild Whitetail, is quarantined; live deer cannot be removed unless they are taken to slaughter. The farm has 167 deer on 12 acres.

This is the 1st confirmed case of the lethal deer disease in Eau Claire County.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection's Animal Health Division is investigating the movements of the doe, which was born at the facility.

"We'll look into the doe's history and any movements on or off the property," said Raechelle Cline of the DATCP, adding that it hasn't been determined whether all the deer at the farm will have to be put down.

But the farm's owner, Rick Vojtik, said he expects all deer on the farm will be killed and tested within the next few weeks. "It's a rough situation for me," Vojtik said. "I may end up having to de-populate the whole herd; then the area would be quarantined off for 5 years."

A baiting and feeding ban is expected in Eau Claire County and some adjacent counties. State law requires that counties, or portions of counties within a 10-mile radius of a game farm or location where a CWD-positive deer is found be subject to a ban on feeding deer or hunting over bait.

Vojtik said he has tested every deer on the property over the past 16 years. Every deer, including this doe's mother, were negative for CWD. The doe looked healthy, he said, and he believed she died from complications related to carrying a fawn.

"She was actually pregnant. There's always a percentage that die in fawning. She was a fat old doe," he said.

State law requires every deer that dies on a deer farm be tested for CWD. "It's really a strange situation to me," said Vojtik, who spent Wednesday [24 Jun 2015] in Madison discussing the case with McGraw. He said he only learned of the positive confirmation Monday [22 Jun 2015].

Vojtik said he doesn't have an answer of where the disease came from. It could have been a spontaneous mutation, although state animal health experts generally don't consider that as a possibility, he said. He expanded the holding pens into a new area, and it's possible CWD was in the soil at the new pens, he said.

There is some evidence now that the prions that cause the disease can be taken up by corn or hay, and he feeds the deer lots of corn, Vojtik said. "They're throwing a lot of different theories at me," he said.

The affected deer was never off the farm, which is enclosed by a high fence, and it could never have had contact with wild deer that might have had the disease.

Vojik said it is puzzling how a case of CWD may pop up in a herd that has previously had a clean record. Recently in Ohio, CWD was detected in a deer farm with more than 500 deer. The deer were all killed and tested, but no additional diseased animals were found.

"I'm sure there'll be a stir in the public," he said.

Vojtik owns a separate deer hunting ranch in the Fairchild area called American Adventure Ranch, but animals from his deer farm have rarely gone to the hunting operation, which is not under quarantine, he said. All deer shot on that ranch have been tested, and CWD has never been found there, he said. Vojtik said he imports deer from other areas, including other states, for the hunting ranch.

[This appears to be an extension of the disease and very sad news for the producer.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible neurological disease of deer and elk that produces small lesions in brains of infected animals. It is characterized by loss of body condition, behavioral abnormalities and death. CWD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), and is similar to mad cow disease in cattle and scrapie in sheep.

Infectious agents of CWD are neither bacteria nor viruses, but are hypothesized to be prions. Prions are infectious proteins without associated nucleic acids.

Although CWD is a contagious fatal disease among deer and elk, research suggests that humans, cattle and other domestic livestock are resistant to natural transmission. While the possibility of human infection remains a concern, it is important to note there have been no verified cases of humans contracting CWD.

CWD can reduce the growth and size of wild deer and elk populations in areas where the prevalence is high, and is of increasing concern for wildlife managers across North America. The disease was long thought to be limited in the wild to a relatively small endemic area in northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming and southwestern Nebraska, but has recently been found in several new areas across the North American continent. The disease also has been diagnosed in commercial game farms in several states and provinces.

It is a popular belief that the causative agent is a prion, a particle smaller than a bacteria or virus, and is a misfolded protein. Regardless of the cause, one has to wonder how this animal acquired this disease.
