[1] Africa (Nigeria, Borno state): cases

In northeastern Nigeria, officials with the Borno State Government reported 491 suspected cases of measles the week ending 17 May [2021], bringing the state total for 2021 to 5902. The total includes 4653 cases in children under 5 years old, or 78% of the total.

In addition, 6 measles-related deaths recorded within the week, bringing the death count to 72 since the beginning of the year [2021].

Active case search for suspected measles cases continued in all LGAs.

Officials face certain challenges with the outbreak to include insecurity limiting access to deliver lifesaving routine vaccines and suspected measles cases reported in unvaccinated communities.

The next steps in the battle with the measles outbreak in Borno will be the tracking of newly displaced population in IDP camps and host communities and planning and implementing extended outreach sessions with measles vaccination among new arrivals and unvaccinated population.

[Introduction
"In Africa, measles remains a leading cause of death and disability in most countries [13]. Early community-based studies have revealed measles case-fatality rates of 3%-34%, which is about 10-20 times those in industrialized countries [14]. In 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that of the 134 200 measles deaths recorded, majority were in sub-Saharan Africa [15]. High case-fatality rates in African and other developing countries are due to a young age at infection, poor shelter and overcrowding, underlying immune deficiency disorders due to malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, and lack of access to medical care. Before the introduction of measles vaccines, 1/3 of children in many African countries were infected in the 1st and 2nd years of life, and most children were infected before they reach 5 years of age [16]. In Africa, about 125 million preschool-aged children have vitamin A deficiency, placing them at high risk of death, severe infection, or blindness as a result of measles [17]. Mortality from measles increases during times of war or famine."

"Measles is an endemic disease in Nigeria, with recurrent outbreaks occurring at irregular intervals. Measles transmission in Nigeria occurs through all months of the year, but peaks in the dry season (February, March, and April) [3]. Measles transmission also sometimes occurs immediately after the end of the rainy season and often reaches epidemic proportions in the dry season. Nigeria is one of only 10 countries in the world with measles vaccine coverage of less than 50% [19, 20].

"Nigeria is among the 45 countries that account for 94% of the deaths due to measles worldwide [1, 21]. There are few literature in Nigeria on the population-based prevalence of measles. However, some studies from tertiary hospitals showed the proportion of measles from pediatric admissions stands at between 1.3-5.1% [22, 23]. Furthermore, the reported CFRs for measles in Nigeria showed regional variations ranging from 1.9% to 12.4% [22, 23]. A study conducted in a secondary health center, in Southern Nigerian, observed that measles accounted for 3.1% of all pediatric admissions in the hospital; this figure is higher than the 2.3% reported in 1998 at a tertiary health center in the same city [24]."

[2] Africa: delayed vaccination drives
Date: Thu 26 May 2020

Fifteen African countries delayed measles immunisation drives last year [2020] as they dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. They are Central African Republic, DR Congo, Nigeria, Botswana, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Kenya, Guinea, Angola, Gabon, Comoros, Burundi, Eswatini, and South Africa.

By April 2021, 7 of these countries had completed the campaigns, and 8 remained outstanding, posing a risk of major measles outbreaks on the continent. The 8 are Kenya, Guinea, Angola, Gabon, Comoros, Burundi, Eswatini, and South Africa

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), new early data shows that an estimated 16.6 million children in Africa missed planned supplemental measles vaccine doses between January 2020 and April 2021, and 8 African countries reported major measles outbreaks that affected tens of thousands during the period.

The 8 African countries that reported major measles outbreaks that affected tens of thousands between January 2020 and April 2021 are Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, and Nigeria.

The outbreaks were largely due to low routine immunisation coverage or delayed vaccination drives. In addition, the quality of measles surveillance in Africa fell to the lowest level in 7 years in 2020, with just 11 countries meeting their target.

At a virtual press briefing, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said "recent outbreaks of measles, but also yellow fever, cholera, and meningitis all point to worrying gaps in immunisation coverage and surveillance in Africa. As we fight COVID-19, we cannot leave anyone dangerously exposed to preventable diseases. I urge all countries to double down on essential health services, including life-saving vaccination campaigns."

Measles is highly contagious, requiring at least 95% immunisation coverage in the population to prevent outbreaks, but according to Dr. Moeti, coverage with the 1st dose of the measles-containing vaccine has stagnated at around 69% in the WHO African Region since 2013 with only 7 countries in the region achieving 95% measles-containing vaccine coverage in 2019.

Dr Moeti said the low measles coverage reflected a wider stagnation in routine immunisation in Africa that, in some countries, has been exacerbated by the pandemic and related restrictions.

According to the WHO, most diseases, including tetanus, diphtheria, and yellow fever, requires 90% coverage in the population, yet it estimates that rates in Africa remained stuck at around 70-75% over the last decade.

Statistics from the WHO indicates that around 9 million children in the African region miss life-saving vaccines each year, and 1 in 5 children remained unprotected from vaccine-preventable diseases, which it said claimed the lives of over 500 000 children under 5 years in Africa every year.

However, despite all the challenges, Africa was declared wild polio-free in 2020 by the WHO.

According to the health expert organisation, vaccines were having a huge impact on diseases like cervical cancer, hepatitis, and Ebola and that the region had made significant gains against meningitis A in recent years; new and underutilised vaccines have been introduced, including the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 40 African countries with over 116 million children vaccinated with the 3rd dose of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine between 2015 and 2019.

Dr Moeti at the media briefing said, alongside the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, WHO was working with African countries to ensure that routine immunisation service delivery was scaled up to close the gaps created at the start of the pandemic.

This, she said, included providing policy guidance, helping strengthen health systems, training health care professionals, reinforcing disease surveillance and the use of data for action, as well as assisting with periodic mass vaccination campaigns for a range of vaccine-preventable diseases.

"Integrated action is needed to increase and expand access to immunisation as part of primary health care. This must be backed by a well-trained workforce, strong surveillance, health information systems, national leadership, management, and coordination. We must also engage more with community leaders and influencers to ensure that everyone understands the life-saving, transformative promise of vaccines," she said.

[One of the tragedies of COVID is the unintended drop in vaccination rates for other vaccine-preventable diseases, of which measles is only one. It is a challenge for a number of African countries to catch up to where vaccines can be delivered safely again. And, as stated above, immunization must become an integral part of primary healthcare. - Mod.LK
