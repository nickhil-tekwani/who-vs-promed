[ProMED-mail thanks David E Dassey for drawing attention to this document
issued by Los Angeles County Acute Communicable Disease Control, which
provides information about the hepatitis outbreak connected to the Advanced
Pain Treatment Medical Center located at 1412 West 7th St. in San Pedro,
California. Interested readers are recommended to access this document for
detailed information.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) is
investigating viral hepatitis infections in people who received intravenous
medication (injection of medications into the vein) while receiving
procedures at the Advanced Pain Treatment Center between 16 Jan 2006 and 18
Aug 2010. LACDPH recommends that patients who received intravenous
medication at this clinic during that time to contact their primary care
physicians or health care providers to get tested for hepatitis B and
hepatitis C and HIV.

During an investigation at the pain clinic, it was discovered that a
syringe and needle, which had been used to inject intravenous medication
into a patient, was then used to obtain medication from a vial that could
be used for other patients. Using a needle and syringe, that had previously
been used on a patient could have contaminated the vial with the blood of
the patient. To date, LACDPH has identified 2 cases of acute viral
hepatitis in patients at this clinic. One patient had acute hepatitis C and
the other patient had acute hepatitis B. Both patients had onset of their
infections in 2010. The investigation is ongoing. There may be other cases
of acute viral hepatitis that have not yet been reported to LACDPH.

The document consists of a comprehensive series of statements providing
information and instructions for those who may consider themselves to be at
risk.

This is an ongoing investigation. It is expected that a final report will
be issued by June 2011 and available from the Department of Public Health's
Custodian of Records at 323-890-7806. In addition the report will be posted
online when it becomes available.
