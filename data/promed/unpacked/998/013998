Three children between 3 and 12 years of age have contracted
hepatitis C virus infection in the public hospital Vall d'Hebron in
Barcelona. The children were receiving treatment in the hemodialysis
unit. A failure in the hygiene protocol, which was not noticed by the
nurse, resulted in contact with contaminated material. The medical
director of the public hospital, Pilar Solans, said yesterday [6 Dec
2007] that in spite of all investigations conducted thus far "we have
not been able to establish the exact cause" leading to the chain of infection.

"Obviously, at some point in the process, there was a problem," added
Solans, who refused to talk about medical malpractice and defended
the "professionalism" of nurses. Even so, the hospital has decided to
"review and strengthen" some "key points" of the protocol in order to
avoid a new setback. The incident occurred in March [2007], and
investigation has not yet been completed. The center has cited 18
other children who were on dialysis during the same dates. Of these
18 children, 14 have been tested and are free of the virus. The
review of the other 4 children will end today [7 Dec 2007]. Solans
ruled out infection because their contact with the unit was indirect.

The main hypothesis of the investigation is directed at the practice
of sharing an ampoule of antibiotic that was administered to the 1st
child affected, according to yesterday's [6 Dec 2007] report in El
Periodico de Catalunya. Hospital officials mentioned at a press
conference that there are a multitude of possible causes. "Everything
in contact with blood carries a risk," said Magda Campins, head of
Preventive Medicine. Moreover, about 16 percent of patients who
undergo hemodialysis end up being carriers of hepatitis C virus,
"either by infection [prior to hemodialysis], infection [as a result
of hemodialysis] or any other reason," argued hospital sources.

Although the hospital has not had any cases in 15 years, Solans
admitted that "zero risk does not exist" and that, by signing the
informed consent, the parents acknowledge the possibility of
infection [presumably, information provided at the time of informed
consent - Mod.MPP]. Thus, it is unlikely the parents will file a
complaint against the hospital for alleged malpractice.

Children who receive dialysis in Vall d'Hebron belong to the kidney
transplant program: their blood is filtered -- since their kidneys
are non-functional -- while they are waiting for a matching donor
kidney for transplantation. The 3 children infected with hepatitis C
have already received the desired kidney transplant.

The hemodialysis unit is equipped with 5 machines and 5 beds, which
are served by 2 nurses and one assistant. The directors of the
hospital denied yesterday [6 Dec 2007] that the hygienic protocol
failure [use of single vial antibiotics for multiple patients] was
related to an excessive workload endured by professionals. Solans
said that the hospital exceeds the established requirements, since
the usual ratio is one nurse for every 4 machines. In general, the
machines are not operating simultaneously. The hospital performs
about a thousand hemodialysis sessions each year.

Hepatitis C virus was discovered in 1988. Prior to its
identification, the disease caused by infection with hepatitis C
virus was known as non A non B-hepatitis. Shortly thereafter, the
need to analyze the blood to be used in transfusions and the cleaning
of medical equipment to prevent transmission were identified.
Hepatitis C virus is transmitted through blood, similar to HIV (which
causes AIDS), but it is much more easily transmitted.

According to many sentences handed down in recent years, those who
suffer infection transmitted in the hospital setting [nosocomial
infections - Mod.MPP] are entitled to be compensated, according to
Oriol Guell. The government of the Community of Madrid awarded 138
000 euros, without going to trial, to each of 8 infected individuals,
following the spread of hepatitis C, admitted to the hospital of
Alcorcon in 2004.
