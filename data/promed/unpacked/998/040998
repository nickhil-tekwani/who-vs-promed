Anaplasmosis has been documented in both humans and animals in China [1,2].
The following background data are abstracted from Gideon
(<http://www.GideonOnline.com>) (primary reference available on request).

Time and place:
- seropositive ruminants have been documented in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region area.
- seropositive rodents have been documented in Jilin Province: Japanese
field mouse (_Apodemus peninsulae_), black-striped field mouse (_A.
agrarius_) and Siberian chipmunk (_Tamias sibirica_).
- Ehrlichial DNA (_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_) has been detected in _Ixodes
persulcatus_ ticks from the Northeastern (that is, Lyme disease) region,
Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang Province.
- infected rodents, sheep and ticks (_I. persulcatus_ and _Dermacentor
silvarum_) have been detected in Jilin Province.

Prevalence surveys:
- 8.82 per cent of forest rodents in Jilin Province, 1.64 per cent in
Helongjiang Province, and 0 per cent in Inner Mongolia autonomous region
(2007 publication)
- 14.1 per cent of rodents captured from a mountainous area in south
eastern China (Zhejiang Province, 2008 publication)
- 5.5 per cent of rodents from Heilongjiang Province, Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, Zhejiang Province, Guizhou Province, and
Xinjiang Autonomous Region (2004 to 2006)
- 1.9 per cent of rabbits captured in southeastern China (2009 publication)
- 4.6 per cent to 6.8 per cent of _I. persulcatus_ in Jilin Province (2003
to 2005 publications)
- 7.34 per cent of small mammals in the forest area of Hengduan Mountains,
south western China (2009 publication)
- 6.7 per cent of livestock and 14.5 per cent of small rodents (2010
publication).

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 8.8 per cent of farm workers near Tianjin (2006)
- 19.8 per cent of persons with animal or tick exposure in central and
south eastern China (2007).

Notable outbreaks:
2006 - an outbreak (9 cases) of transmission through blood or secretions
was reported in Anhui Province among hospital staff who had treated an
index patient.
2008 - an outbreak (5 cases, 3 fatal) was reported in Wanjiakou village in
