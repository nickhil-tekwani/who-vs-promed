The head of the territorial department of the Rospotrebnadzor Administration for the Republic of Tatarstan, Irina Khairullina, said 12 botulism cases have been reported this year [2021] in the districts of Almetyevsky, Zainsky, Leninogorsky, and Sarmanovsky. This compares with 2 botulism cases reported in the previous 2 years. Khairullina noted that 10 people got sick while eating homemade smoked fish, while 2 people associate their disease with the consumption of smoked goose meat, bought from unknown persons in places of unauthorized trade.

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. When ingested, the toxin attacks the body's nerves. Symptoms typically start with muscle weakness in the face and neck, and then spreads to the torso, arms, and legs. The toxin weakens muscles used for breathing, which can lead to death. It is important that anyone ill with symptoms of botulism visit a health-care provider immediately to be assessed.

[The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin from inadequate preparation, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile injections in illicit drug users.

It is not stated if any of the cases were related to others. - Mod.LL
