The four rabies deaths in western Nepal and one reported earlier in
the year from Kathmandu all have one thing in common -- the patients
received the nervous tissue Semple vaccine that the government
provides, [but did not receive] Rabies Immune Globulin (Human or
Equine).
What I would like to point out is that, besides considering
vaccine failure or inadequate treatment in these cases, one must
also consider whether deaths are due to the known neurologic
complications from the Semple vaccine. The nervous tissue vaccines
are known to cause neuroparalytic reactions ranging from 1:200 to
1:1200 vaccine recipients and 25%of these reactions are reported to be
fatal.
Some of these deaths could easily have been due to vaccine-related
complications and not due to rabies.

RabAvert/Rabipur rabies vaccine for use in humans
----------------------------------------------------
I am a devoted reader of ProMED as well as the medical education liaison
for Chiron Corporation's RabAvert(TM) tissue culture rabies vaccine for use
in humans (pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis) in the US. The same
vaccine, but known as Rabipur(R) is sold and distributed in 30 countries
throughout the world, including Nepal, where the four cases of human rabies
were just reported. It is the most used tissue culture rabies vaccine for
use in humans in the world (over HDCV vaccines). The abbreviation used to
describe this vaccine is "PCEC" (purified chick embryo cell).
Rabipur/RabAvert is produced by Chiron in Marburg, Germany.

RabAvert/Rabipur is an excellent rabies vaccine for use in humans in that
it has a high potency with very low reactogenicity (pre- and post-exposure
use), and no type III hypersentivity reactions reported.

As I am sure you read the CDC's MMWR, RabAvert is discussed in the January
16, 1998/Vol.47/No.1 issue; and will be integral to the "Rabies Prevention
- US: Recommendations of the ACIP" which will be published in the MMWR late
1998 or early 1999.
