The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is continuing to investigate and confirm cases of sudden onset hepatitis in children aged 10 and under that have been identified since January 2022. Working alongside Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales, and the Public Health Agency, active investigations have identified a further 18 confirmed cases since the last update on 27 May [2022], bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 240, as of 7 Jun [2022].

Of the confirmed cases, 170 are resident in England, 32 are in Scotland, 17 are in Wales, and 21 are in Northern Ireland. The cases are predominantly in children under 5 years old who showed initial symptoms of gastroenteritis illness (diarrhoea and nausea) followed by the onset of jaundice. As part of the investigation, a small number of children over the age of 10 are also being investigated. No children have died.

There is no evidence of any link to the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. The majority of cases are under 5 years old and too young to have received the vaccine.

The investigation continues to suggest a strong association with adenovirus. Adenovirus is the most frequently detected virus in samples tested, and a formal epidemiological study is underway. Preliminary findings will be published on 16 Jun [2022]. Additional research studies are also being undertaken to understand possible immune factors and the effect of recent or concurrent infections.

Dr Sophia Makki, Incident Director at UKHSA, said, "The likelihood of children developing hepatitis remains extremely low. Maintaining normal hygiene measures, including making sure children regularly wash their hands properly, helps to reduce the spread of many common infections, including adenovirus. We continue to remind everyone to be alert to the signs of hepatitis, particularly jaundice -- look for a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes -- and contact your doctor if you are concerned."

While rare, children can still have serious hepatitis, and we don't always know the cause. That's why investigators continue to look at possible causes and investigate.

Numbers of persons under investigation (PUI): 274

Persons under investigation refer to children <10 years of age with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (>500 U/L) who have an unknown etiology for their hepatitis (with or without any adenovirus testing results, independent of the results) since 1 Oct 2021. PUI does not mean this person is a confirmed case. The states and CDC are looking broadly (including hepatitis cases of unknown origin in children under 10 years of age since October 2021), so this number may go up or down as CDC and states review medical charts and learn more.

States and jurisdictions reporting at least one person under investigation (39)* as of 8 Jun 2022

*These may not be recent cases of hepatitis being reported.

States or territories with no reported PUI (all others have possible cases, but no numbers given, as "to protect patient privacy, numbers for each state will not be released"):

Alaska, American Samoa, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Guam, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Montana, New Hampshire, Northern Marianas, Oregon, Palau, South Carolina, Vermont, Virgin Islands, West Virginia, Wyoming

To protect patient privacy, numbers for each state will not be released. These data were posted on 8 Jun 2022 and reflect data from 1 Oct 2021. Reported PUIs are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data will be updated weekly.

Kentucky health officials are investigating 6 potential cases of hepatitis -- inflammation of the liver -- in young children, including 2 in Louisville. The Indiana Department of Health was investigating 9 potential cases as of Friday [10 Jun 2022].

Dr. Steven Stack, commissioner of the Kentucky Department for Public Health, said the cases are among the more than 270 reported nationwide with no yet known cause. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, and jaundice. Health officials have ruled out common causes of hepatitis.

Stack said these cases are respiratory illnesses, which may also be spread via bodily fluids. He said they are not related to COVID-19 or COVID vaccines, but some cases appear to have a possible link with adenovirus type 41, which causes the common cold. He cautioned parents not to worry unnecessarily, but to take precautions like making sure their children wash their hands and cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing. If they have symptoms, parents should contact a pediatrician.

"This is not something for you to panic about or to get excessively alarmed about, but it is something for you to be careful about," he said. "It's not unusual for some cases of hepatitis in children to remain unknown. And it's not yet clear whether there's been an increase in the overall number of children who are getting hepatitis."

Dr. Jeffrey Howard, interim director at the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, advised parents to make sure their children are up to date on vaccinations. "If your child is sick, keep them away from others, teach them to cover their coughs and sneezes, and seek medical attention if you are concerned about their health," he said in a statement.

The CDC reports that, in general, between 30% and 50% of hepatitis cases in children may have no obvious cause. The USA investigation of cases dates back to October [2021], when 5 Alabama children were hospitalized with significant liver illness. A few of the 5 experienced liver failure.

NPR reported on 19 May [2022] that the CDC was investigating 180 cases, including several children who had to undergo liver transplants and 5 who died earlier in 2022. Many of the cases dated back as far as October 2022 but were only recently reported.

Another child in Ireland has been diagnosed with a mystery strain of hepatitis, bringing the total known cases to 13.

Health officials confirmed the news on Wednesday [8 Jun 2022], adding that a further "small number" of children are under investigation. It comes amid growing concern about the unexplained outbreak that's puzzling experts across the world. All the infections were in children aged between 1 and 12, and all have been hospitalized.

In a statement on Wednesday [8 Jun 2022], the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said: "Since March, 13 probable cases of children with hepatitis of unknown cause have been identified in Ireland, and a small number of children are under investigation. This is more than would usually be expected over this period of time. The children affected have no links to the other children involved. To date, no single virus has been identified in all cases. Investigations are currently ongoing to identify the cause of these illnesses. Ireland is liaising closely with ECDC, UK, and WHO colleagues in efforts to identify the cause of this illness."

It added that GPs and paediatric consultants are aware of the recent increase in cases of hepatitis amongst children and will be alert to identify any further cases that may develop. The agency is urging parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms.

All children up to 16 years with symptoms suggestive of acute hepatitis, such as nausea, vomiting, or jaundice, or with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea, should attend hospital urgently, according to advice issued by the directorate general for health (DGS).

The advice comes in response to a number of suspected cases of hepatitis of an unknown cause in children and adolescents in numerous countries worldwide. Non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea lasting more than one week, and significant weakness may be present alongside respiratory symptoms and fever.

Information regarding the symptoms is limited, but a form of adenovirus is suspected as of right now. The DGS recommends typical protective measures, such as handwashing, coughing/sneezing into one's elbow, ventilating indoor spaces, and disinfecting surfaces.

According to the DGS, the 15 suspected cases reported in Portugal up to 3 Jun 2022, which appeared in in children aged between 4 months and 16 years, occurred between November 2021 and 31 May 2022. The health of these children has evolved favorably.

The other countries in Europe reporting cases by the end of May [2022] were the United Kingdom (155), Spain (34), Italy (29), Netherlands (14), Belgium (14), Sweden (9), Ireland (8), Denmark (7), Greece (5), Norway (5), Poland (3), Cyprus (2), France (2), Austria (2), Bulgaria (1), Republic of Moldova (1), and Serbia (1).

The total number of cases reported worldwide was 621, including 14 deaths. These deaths were in Indonesia (6), United States (5), Ireland (1), Mexico (1) ,and Palestine (1).

[Except for the UK data, no epicurves have been produced to best assess which of the newly reported cases are truly new or just found retrospectively.

Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable, but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by the following:

Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."

Dr. Casanova, the senior author on this paper has published many papers showing that subtle genetic changes can be associated with more severe disease due to a variety of pathogens. - Mod.LL
