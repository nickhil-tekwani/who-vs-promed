Zimbabwe: Bilharzia Outbreak Hits Hurungwe
-----------------------------------------------
A Bilharzia outbreak has hit Hurungwe district amid fears the
waterborne disease could have spread to other areas. The disease has
affected mostly schoolchildren who play in water and ponds at Nyama
resettlement scheme in Hurungwe. Green Lion Old Age and Orphancare, a
community-based organization, has earmarked about ZWN 987 000 [USD
3940] towards intervention programs, which include treatment of
children in the area and research. A research team from the National
Institute of Health Research, formerly the Blair Research
Laboratories, started carrying out research in the area on Sunday [3
Dec 2006] and has so far established that most pupils at Nyama
Primary School have been affected. The institute is carrying out
research in the area following a plea from GLOAO, which discovered
that most schoolchildren were showing symptoms of the disease.

[_Schistosoma haematobium_ is endemic in Zimbabwe. A recent study
from Zimbabwe (Ndhlovu et al. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 23 Oct 2006,
epub ahead of print) showed that 60 percent of women aged 20 years or
below are infected with the organism causing schistosomiasis. Another
study from Zimbabwe found the same prevalence in schoolchildren
(Brouwer et al. Afr Hlth Sci 2004;4,115-8). Outbreaks occur when
control programs fail to identify and treat infected people. The
outbreak reported here shows that schistosomiasis control in Zimbabwe
is not functional. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
