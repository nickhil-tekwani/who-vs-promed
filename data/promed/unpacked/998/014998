This has apparently been the worst year on record for Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) in the Irish herd with the publication of the December
figures. These statistics showed that the 10 new cases diagnosed in
December brought to 83 the total of BSE-infected cows found in the State
this year. Last year there were three fewer cases and in the previous year,
1996, which was a crisis year for the European beef industry, there were 74
cases. Department of Agriculture officials last night pointed out that the
infection rate in the Republic of Ireland is very low given the fact that
there are 7.8 million cattle in Ireland, an infection rate of 1:100,000
animals.
A veterinary source was quoted as saying, "The number of cases we have had
in Ireland in the last nine years is only 352. That figure is equal to what
the British authorities were finding in a single week when the disease was
at its height in that country."
Experts were cited as believing that the disease will disappear from the
Irish herd in about three years when the last animals to have been fed on
contaminated cattle rations are diagnosed.
The British authorities had, according to this story, expected to be rid of
the disease by 2000 but they discovered that cross-contamination of cattle
rations had continued at mills where pig and poultry rations were being
processed by the same rollers. Two years ago, following advice from the
British authorities, Ireland moved to separate pig and poultry feed
processing and now the plants are dedicated ones and are not allowed to mix
the processing. This should eliminate the main cause of the disease unless
farmers feed pig and poultry rations to their cattle, which could
perpetuate BSE.

[Thankfully the 1998 incidence has not gone to 140 animals but has remained
close to the 1997 total. One hopes, as Dan Collins indicated in the
previous posting, this surge reflects better case finding & reporting more
than a real change. - Mod.MHJ
