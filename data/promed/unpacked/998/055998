The following background data on pertussis in the United States were
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Infant vaccine coverage is 95% as of 1997. As of 1994, routine vaccination
(DPT) is given at ages 2, 4, 6 and 15 months. Acellular vaccine is also
approved for primary series.
Highest rates [of pertussis are registered in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, New
Hampshire and Massachusetts. In recent years, incidence has increased among
the age group 10 to 19 years.
The peak reporting year was 1922 (approximately 260,000 cases); and the
peak mortality (9,000 deaths) was reported in 1923.
