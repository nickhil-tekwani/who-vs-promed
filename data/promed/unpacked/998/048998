A cat in Urbana was recently diagnosed with tularemia, a disease caused by bacteria potentially spreading from animals or ticks to people, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District said Friday [15 Apr 2022].

The bacteria, _Francisella tularensis_, can be passed to people through the skin if they handle infected animals or if they inhale contaminated dust or aerosols, especially during outdoor activities such as farming or lawn mowing. People can also become infected if they are bitten by infected ticks.

The disease in people can come without symptoms or be life-threatening. Symptoms in people can include a sudden onset of fever, chills, headache and fatigue following the incubation period, which can range from 2 to 10 days, health officials said.

Tularemia, also called "rabbit fever," has been known to sicken rabbits, muskrats, prairie dogs and other rodents, but domestic cats are "very susceptible" and have been known to transmit the bacteria to people, the health district said.

Signs in cats can include a high fever, mouth ulcers, depression, enlarged lymph nodes and anorexia.

To avoid infections in cats, health officials advise not allowing them to hunt outdoors, making sure they are protected from tick bites and reporting any unexplained die-offs of rabbits or rodents to the health district. The health district is also advising using 2 plastic trash bags and wearing gloves if you need to remove a dead rabbit from your yard. If a shovel is used, disinfect it afterward by placing it in a bucket of water with 1 cup of bleach per gallon of water and letting it sit a half-hour.

The health district is further cautioning the use of tick protection when outdoors and avoiding mowing over sick or dead animals or handling any wild animals.

[The following information on tularemia was written by Drs. Krista Williams and Robin Downing on the VCA Animal Hospitals webpage (https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/tularemia-in-cats):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What is tularemia? Tularemia is a bacterial disease caused by _Francisella tularensis_ and is often referred to as rabbit fever. Tularemia is most commonly found in rabbits and rodents, and it survives by creating tumor-like masses and abscesses in the victim animal's liver. It is a disease not seen at all in the United Kingdom, Africa, South America, or Australia. In North America, tularemia cases are scattered around the continent. It is most commonly seen in the late spring and summer.

"Tularemia is an uncommon infection in cats, but cats can be exposed if they kill or eat an infected rabbit or rodent or through insect bites.

"How is tularemia transmitted? Infection with _Francisella tularensis_ can occur in several ways:
- Ingestion of the tissues or body fluids of an infected animal. After ingestion, the lymph nodes in the head, neck, and gastrointestinal system collect the bacteria. From there, systemic infection follows.
- Contaminated water.
- Some blood-sucking insects and arachnids, including ticks, midges, fleas, or mosquitoes, can transmit tularemia.

"Once the bacteria are in the lymph system, the organism can be found in the lungs, liver, spleen, and the bone marrow.

"What are the signs of tularemia infection in cats? Tularemia generally causes an acute illness with high fever (40-41°C; 104-106°F), large painful lymph nodes in the head and neck, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of skin, mucous membranes, and the whites of the eyes), and organ system failure.

"How is tularemia diagnosed? In order to diagnose tularemia, other diseases causing sudden-onset fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and lethargy must first be ruled out. These include bubonic plague and pseudotuberculosis.

"Diagnostic tests typically include a complete blood count (CBC), a blood chemistry panel, and a urinalysis. Testing will reveal a high white blood cell count, low blood sugar, low blood sodium, and a high blood level of bilirubin. There may also be blood in the urine. Ultrasound may show masses in the internal organs including liver, spleen, or abdominal lymph nodes.

"Blood tests done 2-4 weeks apart may demonstrate an increase in tularemia antibodies indicating infection. DNA testing (called PCR) may also identify tularemia in blood or tissue samples.

"Can tularemia be treated? Yes, tularemia can be treated, but it requires aggressive treatment including hospitalization with good supportive care (e.g., intravenous fluid therapy and antibiotics). The key to successful treatment is EARLY intervention. Even with early diagnosis and treatment, the death rate among cats with tularemia is high.

"Can I catch tularemia? Tularemia has a high zoonotic potential, meaning it can infect humans. Humans can become exposed from tick bites and drinking contaminated water; however, cat bites or scratches can also be a source of exposure. The bacteria create a blister in the skin 3-5 days after contact. The blister ulcerates 2-4 days later, then the bacteria enter the lymph system, spreading to the rest of the body.

"When hospitalized, these cats are isolated, and the veterinary team will wear protective gear during treatments. Tularemia is a reportable disease, meaning it is of such great public health importance that doctors and veterinarians are required to report diagnosis of the disease to their public health authority."

There are products available to protect cats from ticks and fleas. If you are in an area where ticks are plentiful, the tiny seed ticks can ride into the home on your shoe laces or pant legs. They are tiny, but can attach to your totally indoor cat. Cats that are sometimes outside and/or engaging in hunting activities are susceptible. Please consult your veterinarian for a safe product to protect your cat. There are over-the-counter products but be aware some of them have proven to be ineffective and some can be toxic to your cat. Please consult your veterinarian to protect your feline friend. - Mod.TG
