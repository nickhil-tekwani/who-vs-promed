[Re: ProMED-mail Monkeypox - Congo DR: (ET) 20110113.0148]
----------------------------------------------------------
Based on the Global Viral Forecasting and UCLA's field presence in
Democratic Republic of Congo through the USAID Emerging Pandemic
Threats (EPT) PREDICT initiative, this report of 114 cases of
monkeypox, resulting in 5 deaths, seems exaggerated. There is limited
diagnostic and confirmatory capacity for monkeypox in Equateur
Province and elsewhere in the country, outside of Kinshasa: of the
2000 suspected monkeypox cases reported across DRC in 2010, only 120
samples were taken and sent to INRB (National Institute for
Biomedical Research) in Kinshasa, of which only 20 were confirmed
positive for monkeypox.

Furthermore, monkeypox symptoms are often confused with chickenpox.
Our field team, working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health
and INRB, reported the following clarifications from Bikoro health
zone in Equateur: of the 3 samples received at INRB, 2 were confirmed
positive for chickenpox and one confirmed monkeypox. From Gbadolite
in Equateur province, of 3 samples received, 2 were confirmed
monkeypox and one was chickenpox.

Due to the capacity limitations in DRC, the Ministry of Health and
EPT partners (PREDICT, RESPOND, and CDC) and other NGOs are
recommending a national training mission through health structures,
focused on training field personnel, sampling techniques and
supplies, cold chain, and personal protective devices. One important
conclusion in collaborative meetings concerned the fact that
monkeypox is an endemic disease in DRC which often gets exaggerated
in the press. The latest news is that CDC has sent a team to Kinshasa
to prepare for a field visit to Boende, Equateur Province, to begin training.

[ProMED-mail apologises for the delay in posting Dr Saylors' relevant
comment on the recent outbreak of monkeypox virus infection in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. This occurred because of technical
problems with our email system. In the absence of laboratory
diagnostics it is clear that there is high risk of overestimation of
case numbers in view of the clinical similarity of monkeypox and
chickenpox. - Mod.CP]
