Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Giles County, Giles, Tennessee
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Mar 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 16 500 / - / 0 / 16 500 / 0
Affected population: commercial grandparent stock primary broiler breeder flock.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment
As part of routine, pre-slaughter testing and surveillance for H5/H7 avian Influenza, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 of North American wild bird lineage was detected in healthy broiler breeder chickens. This is the 1st detection of H7N9 LPAI poultry in TN and also the 1st detection of LPAI H7N9 in commercial poultry in the United States in 2017. Although this is a low pathogenicity H7 strain, as a precautionary preventive measure, the flock was depopulated. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Tennessee Department of Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this event.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by -products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection/ disinfestation

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / virus sequencing / 8 Mar 2017 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[As noted in the epidemiological comments of the report, "Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 of North American wild bird lineage was detected in healthy broiler breeder chickens. This is the 1st detection of H7N9 LPAI poultry in Tennessee and also the 1st detection of LPAI H7N9 in commercial poultry in the United States in 2017."

On [Fri 3 Mar 2017], USA reported a case of HPAI H7N9 in Tennessee, see last follow-up on [Wed 8 Mar 2017] at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23161.

In both cases this subtype H7N9 was identified as a North American wild bird lineage and should NOT be confused with the H7N9 virus in China virus where it is infecting poultry and humans.

To date, there has been only one case of HPAI H7N9 of North American lineage detected in Tennessee. The other reported case in Tennessee referred to in this report is of low pathogenicity. An earlier LPAI case was reported on [Tue 7 Mar 2017] - which was a low pathogenicity H5N2 detected in a turkey flock in Wisconsin. - Mod.CRD
