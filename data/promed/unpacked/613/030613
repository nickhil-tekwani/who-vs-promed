The government [of] Tanzania is sending a team of medical experts to
Kagera region to investigate reports of an outbreak of a deadly
disease suspected to be Ebola [haemorrhagic fever] in border villages
in neighbouring Uganda. The Deputy Minister for Health and Social
Welfare, Dr Lucy Nkya, said in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday [1 Dec
2010] that the team will comprise medical experts from her Ministry,
the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) and the Muhimbili
National Hospital (MNH).

"You are just breaking the news (on the outbreak of the disease in
Uganda) to me. Thanks, and I will make sure that a medical team is
dispatched to Kagera region as soon as possible," she told The
Citizen in a telephone interview. She said they will summon his
senior lieutenants at the ministry and make immediate arrangements to
send the medical team to Kagera region.

Reports from Uganda quoted health officials as saying that a disease
that has been killing people [in] Kitgum, Abim and Agago districts
could be a new strain of Ebola [haemorrhagic fever].

The situation report of 26 Nov 2010 indicates a cumulative figure of
32 cases with a fatality rate of 25 per cent since its outbreak in
Balang village in Mutu parish in Paimol Sub County, Agago district
early this month [November 2010].

A National Professional Officer with World Health Organization in
Gulu, Dr Emmanuel Tenywa, said a total of 19 people are currently
admitted at an isolation ward in Kalongo Hospital with acute signs
and symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting, and severe frontal headache,
sometimes associated with pain in the eye without conjunctivitis and
blood in their stool. He said already one of the health workers in
the hospital has developed the disease after she accidentally came
into contact with vomit of a patient suffering from the disease.

"The illness thus progresses, with patients reporting abdominal pain
localized in the epigastrium, and as it progresses, patients develop
restlessness, mental confusion, and aggressive behavior which
eventually results in coma and death," he said.

[This press report provides a more detailed description of the
condition of the patients in the Ugandan outbreak and states that the
cumulative number of cases is now 32 with a fatality rate of 25
percent. The symptoms of the patients do not resemble those
associated with haemorrhagic fever, and the outcomes are more severe
than expected for a diagnosis of amoebic dysentery currently favoured
in Uganda. Clarification is awaited.

The districts of Kitgum, Abim, and Agago in the Northern Region of
Uganda where the outbreak is located can found in the map at
