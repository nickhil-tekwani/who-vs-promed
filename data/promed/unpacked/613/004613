Mexican health authorities reported a total of 157 cases of cholera, 145 of them in the central state of Hidalgo, where the source of contagion is a river that provides the water supply for the local population. The federal Health Secretariat said in a communique that besides Hidalgo, the other cases were in the central state of San Luis Potosi, which reported 1 case this Fri 11 Oct 2013, 2 more in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, and another 9 in the central state of Mexico.

The institution said that in the specific case of Hidalgo, a detailed analysis found that "the source of contagion is the pollution of the river, whose water is used by the local population for daily activities like washing food and clothes, for personal hygiene and other uses." The patients in general, it said, are in a moderate state of health, with 70 percent of them not requiring hospitalization, while only one has died.

In Mexico state, it said, the cases "have been resolved and have no epidemiological relation with those found in the part of the Huasteca region in Hidalgo state."

The secretariat said that all cases confirmed have been reported, according to International Health Regulations, to the Pan American Health Organization.

Additionally, no information has been put forward regarding original source of the infection. - Mod.LL
