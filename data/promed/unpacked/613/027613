Re: Avian influenza, poultry vaccines: a review
-----------------------------------------------
I read with interest the said posting [20050307.0680], pertaining to AI
vaccines. Earlier, moderator CP, in commenting on "Avian influenza,
poultry vaccines - China" [20050207.0415], alluded to the administration of
vaccines by water and also this final statement, "The scientists at the
Harbin Institute have clearly mastered the technology of reverse genetics
and produced a candidate live attenuated vaccine virus. It remains to be
seen whether they have modified the virus sufficiently to allow it to be
administered to different species and to obtain protective immune responses
without exacerbation of disease".
A later posting [20040129.0339] indicated that water administration would
not be feasible with the new AI vaccines.
However, these comments reminded me of the experience the Texas poultry
industry had in 1980s with Infectious Laryngotracheitis (ILT), while I was
with the Texas Animal Health Commission. In late 1980, owners of some
broiler operations south of Gonzales, TX contracted to raise older, "spent"
hens as a source of eggs which were to be shipped to Mexico for parent
stock. At the time, Texas was considered free of ILT, but the hens came
from Southern or Southeastern states where ILT was endemic and ILT
vaccination was practiced. The protocol for the most commonly used
modified-live virus (MLV) ILT vaccine was to administer a drop of the
vaccine to the conjunctiva of each bird, insuring the delivery of an
immunizing dose. However, due to labor costs, the vaccine was often
dispensed via water.
In order to bring the hens into production in Texas, they were molted.
During the molting, mortality levels increased dramatically and ILT was
isolated from submitted specimens. Laboratory analysis determined that the
virus had the same mortality as a commonly used MLV vaccine virus that
regained virulence after multiple passages through chickens in the
laboratory. While it could not be proven conclusively, it was theorized
that the virus we were dealing with was the descendant of a MLV eye drop
vaccine that had been dispensed to the hens via water during their 1st
laying period in their home state. Water vaccination did not insure that
every bird received an immunizing dose, leaving some hens unprotected.
Since the vaccine virus was live, some of the hens became infected and shed
it, thereby exposing the un-immunized birds in the population. As the
virus passed through more un-immunized birds, it regained virulence, and
during the stress of molting, produced mortality. While it was a lower
level of mortality than would have been expected with the wild virus, it
nonetheless had a devastating impact on the laying operations. Over 50 000
hens were ultimately culled and buried due to outbreaks of ILT. As a
result of this introduction into the area, ILT outbreaks occurred in laying
operations for most of the decade.
Later, when broilers in the area began experiencing outbreaks, the same
mortality pattern was detected when laboratory challenges were conducted.
It was a standard practice for the broilers to be vaccinated against ILT
via the water route. I have forgotten the reason, but I recall that the
broilers were being marketed 1 or 2 weeks later than normal, which was
apparently enough time for the vaccine virus to become a problem.
I am not a virologist and have no idea whether the new AI vaccines will be
capable of regaining virulence through passage in un-immunized birds or
poultry. It is encouraging that water administration is not being
considered at this time. If a product is ever developed that may lend
itself to water distribution, I hope the concept will be rejected if the
vaccine has any potential to regain virulence through passage in live poultry.
Otherwise, I would be concerned that it may create a scenario similar to
what we experienced in Texas with the (apparently) improper administration
of ILT vaccine.

Any vaccine -- before use -- must be thoroughly investigated by the
"competent authority" of a country's government to determine the safety,
purity, and potency of the product. The insight provided by the reviewer is
a very real and potential serious concern. Currently, no live AI virus
vaccine is licensed for use in poultry, but in some countries, live
cold-adapted influenza vaccines are available for use in humans (Flu-Mist)
and horses (Flu Avert). In the USA, live recombinant virus vectored
products are licensed and used in animals, but they go through a rigorous
safety testing and risk analysis process. Only after the safety --
including environmental safety -- is documented can the recombinant product
be licensed by USDA and used.
In general, use of live AI virus vaccines in poultry is a very risky
proposition, especially for H5 and H7 subtypes, and is in theory strongly
discouraged. The mutation of low-pathogenicity (LP) AI field viruses to
high pathogenicity (HP) is well documented in outbreaks of H5N2 HPAI in USA
(1983-84), H5N2 HPAI in Mexico (1993-95), H7N1 HPAI in Italy (1999-2000),
H7N3 HPAI in Chile (2002), H7N7 HPAI in The Netherlands (2003), and H7N3
HPAI in Canada (2004). If a live H5 or H7 LPAI virus was used as a vaccine,
this replicating LPAI virus would be spread in the field, and like the
original LPAI field virus, could mutate at the proteolytic cleavage site of
the hemagglutinin and become an HPAI virus. This is in addition to the
issues of changes in the OIE code to make all H5 and H7 notifiable avian
influenza viruses. However, with the advent of reverse genetics, changes in
one or more genes may result in the creation of a live AI virus with
reduced potential for mutation to HP. Furthermore, a cold-adapted AI virus
may be produced by selection of virus strains at lower temperature.
However, such viruses would need extensive safety testing for reversion
before accepting them as safe to apply in the field.
