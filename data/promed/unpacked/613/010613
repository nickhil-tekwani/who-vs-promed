One person and 3 chickens in Djibouti have tested positive for the
deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus, Djibouti's health minister said on
Thursday [11 May 2006].
"One patient and 3 domestic chickens have been detected with the H5N1
virus," Abdallah Abdillahi Miguil said in remarks broadcast on state
television.
The patient in the tiny country of 300 000 at the mouth of the Red
Sea is the first human case confirmed in the Horn of Africa, along
the path of migratory birds who have been detected with the deadly
strain.
The results were tested in conjunction with the U.N. World Health
Organisation at a laboratory in Egypt, the minister said. The
condition of the patient, who the minister said was still in the
hospital, was not immediately known.

[In line with the proverbial "one picture is worth 1000 words," a
brief look at the map
<http://www.countryreports.org/maps/Djibouti/dj-area.gif> should be
enough to convince the skeptics that the recent statement that "H5N1
[was] not detected in a single wild bird out of thousands of samples
collected in Africa this winter," followed by pacifying conclusions,
deserve to be assessed with a critical view. With Egypt and Sudan
infected, countries in the horn of Africa and in East Africa should
be regarded as being at high risk, while avoiding complacency in more
northern regions. The detection of 3 infected birds (kudos to the
NAMRU lab in Cairo!) is alarming enough. Combined with a human case,
it might signal the presence of a widely spread, established
epizootic.
Sudan reported to the OIE on 8 May as follows: "A new outbreak has
been identified at Atbara, in River Nile State, 250 km to the north
of Khartoum. New outbreaks have also been reported in Gezira State in
4 poultry farms located 40-50 km to the south of Khartoum town. For
the full report, see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/A_CURRENT.HTM#Sec10>.
Official confirmation and further details of the case and virus in
Djibouti are anticipated.
The FAO and the OIE have cooperatively published the document
"Preparing for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: A Manual for
Countries at Risk". Its update of 16 Feb 2006 is available at
