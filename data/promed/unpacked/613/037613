From 27 Mar 2022 to 26 Jun 2022, 91 days of the epidemic, the health zone of Rethy, located in Djugu territory, Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), continues to report plague cases. A total of 351 suspected cases of plague have been reported, representing an attack rate of 0.14% with 5 deaths (case fatality rate 1.4%).

So far, the most affected health area is Lokpa with 80.9% of cases, followed by Rassia 7.6% and Uketha 7.4%. The majority of people who have contracted the plague are in the age group >5 years (302 cases, 86%) compared with 13.9% (49 cases) among those <5 years, with an average age of 16 years. The bubonic form is dominant -- 99.7% -- with 0.3% of cases being the pulmonary form.

During week 21, the zone reported 54 cases of plague. Since then, the notification curve has not decreased (week 22, 33; week 23, 51; and week 24, 40). Given the abundance of rainfall and the abundance of free fleas in people's homes, it is likely that the epidemic will continue.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. The pneumonic form of infection can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
