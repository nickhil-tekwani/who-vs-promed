The Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) is implementing preventive measures in order to prevent lumpy skin disease [LSD] from spreading into the country, the press centre of Bulgaria's Ministry of Agriculture and Food announced.

After information appeared the disease was seen close to Feres in Greece's Evros regional unit, the BFSA is stepping up the already introduced preventive measures in the districts of Burgas, Yambol, Haskovo, Kardzhali, Smolyan, and Blagoevgrad.

Movement of large and small ruminants on the territory of the districts in question is banned, except taking them to slaughterhouses. Clinical examinations of large ruminants kept in the municipalities bordering on Turkey and Greece will continue to be performed weekly. The ban on taking large ruminants to markets and exhibitions remains in force.

The BFSA says lumpy skin disease is not a zoonosis (it is not transmitted to human beings from infected animals) and poses no danger to human health.

[LSD, a capripox bovine disease, until 1989 restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, has been spreading throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia since 2012. The countries already known to be infected are Azerbaijan, Cyprus (North), Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories, and Turkey. Syria is also known to be infected, though no direct information could be obtained. LSD is endemic in Egypt. To see the location of outbreaks officially reported since 2012, including the new outbreak in Greece, please go to OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/pfrx4ye (click on the cluster, zoom in).

The introduction of LSD into the Balkans, following its advance eastwards in Turkey since 2013, should not surprise. It is anticipated that the EU will apply a stamping-out policy. Should this fail to stop additional outbreaks, wide-scale vaccination within the infected countries will deserve to be considered. - Mod.AS
