11 peacocks found dead in Jaipur
--------------------------------
Eleven peacocks have been found dead in a residential colony here,
police said. Though nothing suspicious has been found on the spot
police have not ruled out death by pesticide poisoning.
"Nothing suspicious has so far been found on the spot where the dead
peacocks were found," superintendent of police (south) Dinesh Sharma
said, adding death by consuming food containing pesticides cannot be
ruled out. The bodies of the peacock have been sent for necropsy.
The birds were found by a resident of the state electricity board
colony, near Heerapuragri sub station, on Jaipur Ajmer road, in the
outskirts of the city last evening, police said. Several cases of
peacock deaths have been reported from several parts of the state
recently and the forest department is trying to ascertain the cause
behind it.
