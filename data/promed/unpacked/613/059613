IÂ´d like to report one case of legionellosis that is most likely linked to
a hotel near Zadar / Croatia [with exposure from 11 to 16 Jun 2001.
On his way home (via bus) the male patient aged about 55 years got the
first symptoms and was admitted to a hospital in Linz / Upper Austria the
next day (17 Jun 2001) with symptoms of pneumonia and fever up to 39.9 C.
He had a positive _Legionella_ antigen in his urine [this test is specific
for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Serum [antibody results are
still missing [pending.
He recovered partially under therapy with quinolones but still feels bad
after discharge from hospital last weekend so that I suggested to switch to
macrolide therapy when speaking to his pneumologist.
Data were collected from a very cooperative tour operator who also told me
that the hotel was closed a day after my phone-call reporting the positive
result, tourists were shifted to another hotel and examinations have
already been performed by the Croatian health authorities (a written report
announced to be available within a few weeks). All data were reported to
the Austrian legionellosis reference laboratory (Prof. G. Wewalka) in Vienna.

[Outbreaks of infection with _Legionella pneumophila_ are well known to
occur in hotel guests. In fact, the organism is named for the large
outbreak that occurred during a convention of American Legion members at a
hotel in Philadelphia, USA that resulted in the organism's initial
isolation and characterization.
Hotel-associated infections have been demonstrated not merely by the
isolation of the organism from the hotel's water system, but by showing
that the clinical isolates are indistinguishable from the environmental
isolates recovered from the hotel water supply (see reference 4, below and
the ProMED-mail postings, above) on the basis of molecular methods.
