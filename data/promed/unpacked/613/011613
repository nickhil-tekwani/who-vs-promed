Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) claimed this year's [2016] 10th life in Karachi [Sindh] on [Sun 16 Oct 2016] as a male patient passed away at the Dow University of Health Sciences' (DUHS) Ojha campus hospital, health officials said.

A resident of Model Colony [one of the neighborhoods of Malir Town in Karachi] was admitted at Ojha hospital 2 days ago, on [14 Oct 2016], on suspicion of suffering from the haemorrhagic fever.

His blood and other samples were sent to the Aga Khan University Hospital's (AKUH, Karachi) lab for medical examinations where a PCR test by the lab confirmed that [the man] was suffering from CCHF.

The patient's condition was said to have deteriorated on Sunday morning [16 Oct 2016], and despite being admitted at the special care unit [he] could not be saved; he passed away at around 1:00 pm, a health official stated.

With this death, the total number of people to have died of the lethal disease rose to 10 this year [2016]; after Eid-ul-Azha [Festival of the Sacrifice] the total number of people reportedly admitted at various health facilities in the metropolis alone, rose to 75, stated Zafar Mehdi, an official of the Sindh health department.

On [2 Oct 2016], a 35-year-old resident of Hyderabad who was admitted to the JPMC [Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi], had passed away and doctors confirmed the cause as Congo fever. Officials said [the woman] was vomiting blood and had high fever and tests conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital confirmed she was suffering from Congo fever. Her death came a day after a 36-year-old butcher died of Congo fever at the JPMC. The [36-year-old man] who passed away on [Sat 1 Oct 2016], was a resident of Baldia Town who had been admitted to the JPMC on late Thursday night [29 Sep 2016].

A polymerase chain reaction test had confirmed that he was suffering from Congo fever. Dr Javed Jamali, the JPMC deputy director, told The News that [the man] died in the afternoon. "CCHF is a highly lethal disease with a rate of over 50 percent mortality. So far no cure except symptomatic treatment is available for infected patients. The best option available is prevention," Dr Atif Hafeez, president of the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) said.

He, however, expressed concern over such a large number of CCHF cases reported from the entire country this year [2016], especially in Karachi. He asked the government to initiate an epidemiological study on rising cases of lethal viral diseases including Congo fever. The deadly tick-borne disease is contracted through cattle and other animals as the parasite attaches itself onto the human skin.

[The report above mentions the most recent fatal case of CCHF, as well as some cases that have been reported in previous posts. The last sentence in the report can be misleading as the disease is essentially spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals and human cases as well as through bites from infected ticks. - Mod.UBA
