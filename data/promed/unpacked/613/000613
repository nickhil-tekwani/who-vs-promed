The moderator commented: "Never, but NEVER pick up a sick bat. In fact leave sick and dead bats alone. Leave it to the state wildlife folk to come and collect it for testing. Not all sick bats have rabies but many of the diseases that they suffer from you do not want to share."

Excellent advice, but there is little more to be said, which we summarized in this article:
http://www.animals24-7.org/2018/01/21/death-of-florida-6-year-old-reminds-that-bat-rabies-can-strike-anywhere/

This is the most important part of the what-to-do-if-you-see-a-bat-on-the-ground advice: "Practically unknown is that most bat species rarely if ever descend to the ground voluntarily, and many bat species cannot take off from the ground. Typically bats roost upside down, clinging to the insides of hollow tree trunks, wood walls, or cave ceilings, and fly by dropping into a glide.

"Bats found hanging upside down or crawling along a vertical or elevated wood surface tend to be healthy and in no need of human intervention. If a bat is found grounded, the bat is probably seriously ill or injured.

"A rescue can be attempted by scooping the bat up gently with a long-handled shovel, then using the shovel to catapult the bat as high into the air as possible (away from oneself and any bystanders). Healthy bats glide into flight, usually as soon as they start to fall back down, and soon disappear. A bat who crashes usually would not survive long anyhow, and might even be rabid."

Most of the bats I've catapulted into the air over the years were probably knocked to the ground by high winds, and have flown when given the chance. The rest, 2 or 3 in the past 20-odd years, died where they landed, and might very well have been rabid.

[This is excellent advice. And remember to use a shovel, not a spade, as you want the bat to go up and not fall back into your arms. - Mod.MHJ
