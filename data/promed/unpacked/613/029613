Badminton officials have suspended play for 24 hours at an
international tournament in Christchurch (New Zealand) after a
stomach bug cut a swathe through a large number of competitors.
Since Sat 7 Apr 2007, more than 80 people at the trans-Tasman
under-17 tournament, players, coaches, and tournament officials, have
succumbed to a bug causing vomiting and diarrhea. Public health
officials called in to try to identify the source of the outbreak met
tournament officials this afternoon [10 Apr 2007] after diagnosing
the gut-wrenching stomach bug, norovirus, as the most likely cause.
Canterbury medical officer of health, Alistair Humphrey, said tonight
[10 Apr 2007] a 2nd wave of infection that hit tournament
participants overnight was "characteristic of a norovirus infection".
Highly infectious norovirus causes vomiting and diarrhea. It is
spread through contact with infected people, and contaminated food
and eating surfaces.
Generally it is present in the community in various strains and
outbreaks are periodically linked to institutions, such as hospitals
and rest homes, and where people are confined in close contact with
each other. Wards in hospitals in Christchurch and Dunedin have been
closed in 2007 through norovirus outbreaks.
Dr Humphrey told NZPA (New Zealand Press Association) a shared dinner
during the June Bevan Badminton Trophy tournament opening ceremonies
on Friday [6 Apr 2007] was the "prime suspect" as the infection's source.
While norovirus was not primarily a foodborne infection, it was
likely something happened at that event where an infected person
passed on the infection to many others.
"We are questioning the caterers and we will be analyzing all the
data collected from questionnaires from the tournament participants
to see if there's any common link between them all," Dr Humphrey said.
About 74 people had been affected in the 1st wave of norovirus on Sat
and Sun, 7-8 Apr 2007. A further 12 had become ill last night [9 Apr
2007], he said.
Tournament organisers had decided this afternoon [10 Apr 2007] to
halt the competition for 24 hours to allow those affected to fully recover.
"It's not spread beyond the tournament, but the officials running the
competition felt that, given they had enough time, they would rather
suspend competition for 24 hours to help break the chain of
infection," Dr Humphrey said.
Public health officials had contacted counterparts in Australia where
several norovirus outbreaks had been reported at sporting events, and
would continue to monitor the current situation here. Most of those
affected in the 1st wave were recovering well, he said.

An international badminton tournament in Christchurch will resume on
Tue 10 Apr 2007, after a third of those taking part were laid low
with gastroenteritis.
Altogether, 180 players from clubs throughout New Zealand and
Australia are competing in the trans-Tasman under-17 tournament. The
illness, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, has affected 60 people
including players, coaches and officials.
Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, Alistair Humphrey, says an
investigation is under way to find the source of the illness. Those
suffering symptoms are filling in questionnaires about where they
have been and what they have eaten, in an effort to work out whether
the disease is food poisoning or a virus.
Tournament organizer, Lyndsay Dick, told Morning Report that it is
too early to tell if the illness was the result of a shared meal on
Friday night, 6 Apr 2007. Ms Dick says the symptoms of
gastroenteritis are short-lived, and the tournament can go ahead.

[The illness here may well be norovirus but a variety of short-lived
foodborne pathogens or toxins could be involved. Not enough
information has been given to better assess possible etiologies.
Badminton (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton>) is a racket
sport played by either 2 opposing players (singles) or opposing pairs
(doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular
court divided by a net. Players score points by striking a
shuttlecock with their rackets so that it passes over the net and
lands in their opponents' half of the court. The shuttlecock is a
feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to
fly differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in
particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the
shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Because
shuttlecock flight is strongly affected by wind, competitive
badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors
as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.
