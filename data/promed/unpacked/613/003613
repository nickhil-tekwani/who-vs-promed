[1] Cholera - Sudan (White Nile State)

Cholera continues to claim more lives in White Nile state. Yesterday, [Mon 15 May 2017], 2 deaths were reported, in addition to the escalation of infections to a total of 20 cases. One person died of cholera in Sheikan village and another died in El Tamrin, journalist El Tahir Ishag told Radio Dabanga. Health centers in both villages witnessed 10 new infected cases each. El Tamrin's new patients were transferred to El Gezira Aba medical isolation center.

Abdelrahman El Siddig, the head of the White Nile civil society organizations, told Radio Dabanga last [Sun 14 May 2017], that a cholera patient died in El Gezira Aba's Berono district on [Fri 12 May 2017]. He said that "dozens of new cases" were recorded in various villages in El Gezira Aba, as well as in Kosti and Rabak. According to the activist, the health authorities are refusing to disclose the number of dead and actual infections in the state.

Journalist Ishag added that it is difficult to obtain precise information about the number of afflicted people and deaths in remote villages. He
attributed the spread to unsafe drinking water from the White Nile. "Most people in the area are relying on water from the Nile brought to them by tankers and donkey carts."

In early May 2017, the Sudanese Health Minister, Bahar Abu Garda, announced a drop in the number of cholera cases in White Nile state, following chlorination of the drinking water. Four people, however, died from cholera in 2 days' time last week in White Nile state.

The deadly disease spread to other localities in eastern, central, and northern Sudan from September 2016. The Health Ministry reported in late January 2017 that more than 300 patients were recorded in El Gedaref, Red Sea, and Khartoum states. But the federal health authorities continue to deny the presence of cholera. The ministry acknowledged a "watery diarrhea epidemic" in eastern Sudan and Khartoum early in 2017.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi)

Nairobi County has issued an alert over a cholera outbreak in the city. So far, 5 cases have been clinically confirmed and the patients admitted at Nairobi hospital for treatment. Three unconfirmed deaths in Kayole have also been reported to the city authorities and are under investigation.

"There is a cholera outbreak in Nairobi and the victims are receiving care at Nairobi hospital. They are in stable condition and should recover soon," said Bernard Muia, Nairobi County health Executive. Muia said that 3 other deaths had been reported in parts of Komarock but the health officials were yet to confirm whether the deaths were caused by cholera. The health chief noted that the disease came from travelers who came to Nairobi from Vihiga on [Sat 13 May 2017]. They were attending a wedding in Karen area. "The index case according to our disease surveillance team is the Karen wedding where the patients and a number of other people had travelled for a wedding. It is presumed that they spread the disease to city residents but we are putting measures in place to avoid the disease from spreading any further," Muia said.

Symptoms of the disease include Diarrhea which comes on suddenly and may quickly cause dangerous fluid loss as much as one liter per hour, nausea and vomiting which may persist for hours at times and general weakness of the body. Dehydration is also a symptom of the disease. These symptoms develop within a few days of infection, although they can sometimes occur after just a few hours. Additionally, the health executive said that sensitization programs had been rolled out to the city estates and hospitals stocked with adequate drugs to address the same. In 2015, statistics show that the city recorded a total of 200 cases and 11 deaths caused by cholera.
