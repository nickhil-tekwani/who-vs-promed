[1] WHO sitrep as of 14 Dec 2014
Date: Wed 17 Dec 2014
Source: WHO Ebola response roadmap - Situation report [edited]
http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en


Now available in an interactive map journal that shows the evolution of the outbreak and the global response:
http://maps.who.int/MapJournal/?appid=8c88dfc31c3445c986150c1037e9be02.

Highlights
----------
- There have been 18 603 reported cases of Ebola virus disease, with 6915 reported deaths
- Reported case incidence is fluctuating in Guinea and decreasing in Liberia
- There are signs that the increase in incidence has slowed in Sierra Leone. A major operation has been implemented to curb the spread of disease in the west of the country
- No new cases have been reported in Mali since 24 Nov 2014. All contacts of the outbreak in Bamako have completed the 21-day follow-up period ...

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 18 569 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 6900 deaths have been reported up to the end of 14 Dec 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 9 Dec 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1 -- see source). The data are reported through WHO country offices.

[This is 139 new cases and 74 deaths -- NOT all confirmed -- in 24 hours in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Liberia has not reported since 9 Dec 2014 -- see last situation report. - Mod.JW]

Taking into account the number of cases as a proportion of an affected country's population, there have been 22 reported cases and 14 deaths per 100 000 population in Guinea, 197 cases and 83 deaths per 100 000 population in Liberia, and 145 cases and 36 deaths per 100 000 population in Sierra Leone.... -- more

[2] Ethiopians arrive in West Africa to fight Ebola

Ethiopians arrive in West Africa to fight Ebola
-----------------------------------------------
Almost 200 Ethiopian health workers have arrived in West Africa to bolster the response to Ebola, a disease that has ravaged weak health care systems and killed more than 300 medical staff. The African Union (AU) said in a tweet that the Ethiopian government sent a total of 187 personnel to the region.... "The aim of the AU is to support the governments on the progress so far made. We want to expand on it, to make sure that the community also supports it," Major-General Julius Oketta, who heads the AU Ebola mission, said upon the arrival of 87 of the Ethiopian health workers in Liberia. They will join more than 175 Nigerian medics deployed to Liberia and Sierra Leone earlier this month.

Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant health minister, says, "The campaign, getting to zero before Christmas, continues. We are still having 5-10 cases per day in Liberia, and that is huge." ... -- more
