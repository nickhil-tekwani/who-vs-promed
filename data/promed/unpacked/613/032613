The Ministry of Agriculture is reminding poultry producers with flocks of all sizes to follow all necessary biosecurity protocols to keep their flocks free of diseases after a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 strain was detected in a wild bird in Saskatchewan.

Samples collected from a snow goose found near Elrose have been confirmed positive for HPAI by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. This confirmation follows the detection of HPAI in poultry and wild birds in the United States and in several Canadian provinces.

The last time HPAI was found in Saskatchewan in either commercial poultry or wild birds was in 2007.

Protecting commercial flocks includes preventative measures such as keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water supply, limiting visitors, and monitoring bird health. Producers should contact their veterinarian immediately if they have concerns about the health status of their flocks. If HPAI is suspected, producers should also contact their local Canadian Food Inspection Agency office.

Small flocks are considered high-risk for HPAI infection as they are most often raised in an extensive fashion e.g. allowed access to outdoor pens or free-range. This means there is a high probability of contact with wild birds or environments visited by wild birds that may be contaminated with HPAI virus. Small flock owners are encouraged to confine their birds indoors if at all possible during this high risk period of wild bird migration and follow the same measures indicated for commercial flocks.

Typically, strains of avian flu do not cause obvious signs of disease in wild birds. However, this H5 strain has resulted in deaths in some species of wild birds, including snow geese and Canada geese, as well as some raptors.

As migratory birds make their way back to Saskatchewan, please report any sick or dead birds to the Ministry of Environment to assist with monitoring efforts. If you find any of the following, please contact the Inquiry Centre at 1-800-567-4224 or <centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca>:
- Clusters of 2 or more dead waterfowl (e.g. ducks, geese) or other water birds.
- Dead raptors or avian scavengers (e.g. ravens, crows, gulls).
- Raptors, waterfowl, or avian scavengers that appear to be sick.
- Large groups of dead birds (e.g. more than 50) of any species.

Reports can also be made to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative at 306-966-5815 or <cwhc.wildlifesubmissions.org/#/>.

Although the risk of transmission to humans is considered low, people should not touch dead birds or other wildlife with their bare hands. Protective eyewear and masks are recommended as additional precaution. Hands should be thoroughly washed before and after with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Birds should be placed in a plastic bag prior to submission.

This strain of HPAI does not pose a food safety risk. Regular food safety and hygiene precautions should be followed when preparing wild game. Hunters should avoid eating birds that are visibly ill.

The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife says 2 bald eagles in the state were found to be infected with avian influenza. One of the birds was found dead in South Hero and the other was discovered ill in Shelburne. Both birds were near Lake Champlain.

With the discovery, Vermont joined 33 other states that have detected highly pathogenic avian influenza in the environment, the state says.

While some waterfowl species can carry the disease without becoming sick, the virus is generally fatal for domestic poultry.

The state says anyone involved with poultry production, from the small backyard coop to large commercial producers, should review their biosecurity measures.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk to the general public from the virus to be low, but the virus can be deadly to domestic and commercial poultry and backyard birds.

The virus is often introduced to domestic poultry by infected wild birds through direct contact or contact with their droppings. It may spread between poultry flocks.

Human movement onto farms should be limited and non-essential personnel and visitors should not be allowed.

The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic.

The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. This is the case for birds of prey and scavengers, which are exposed to the virus when feeding on other infected birds. - Mod.PMB

The USDA APHIS website maintains an updated list of HPAI reports in different wild bird species, including bald eagles from several other states besides Vermont in 2022. - Mod.LXL
