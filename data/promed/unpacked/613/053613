A 4-year-old girl in critical condition is now 1 of 13 people hospitalized in connection with an _E. coli_ O157 outbreak apparently linked to a 3 Jul 2012 picnic in Germantown. Health officials are still trying to figure out the exact food source from the picnic that has sickened 62 people.

Public Health - Dayton & Montgomery County officials did not release the child's name or the name of the hospital, but said she has been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of _E. coli_ O157 infection that can lead to kidney damage or kidney failure.

The _E. coli_ outbreak has been linked to a 3 Jul 2012 customer appreciation picnic at Neff's Lawn Care in Germantown; of those taken ill, 11 have been confirmed as having _E. coli_ 0157. Public health workers are interviewing people who became ill after attending the picnic. They are trying to identify the source of the _E. coli_ contamination, said health department spokesman Bill Wharton.

As many as 300 people may have attended the picnic, and many brought food to share, he said. Having food from so many sources makes it more difficult to determine where the contamination originated. "We're still going through all aspects of how the food originated, how it was prepared, all of that," Wharton said. "A lot of the people who attended the event brought carry-in. Some of the food was supplied at the location. So it's a combination of food from many, many different locations."

Answers may be a long time coming, he said. The local health department is working with the state to trace the outbreak.
"It's a very involved, long process," Wharton said. "Hopefully, we can get enough data from all of the interviews that will help us determine what the cause was."

Summer is prime time for foodborne illnesses like _E. coli_, health officials say. Keeping food at the proper temperature -- hotter than 140 degrees, or colder than 40 degrees -- is the best way to prevent illness.
