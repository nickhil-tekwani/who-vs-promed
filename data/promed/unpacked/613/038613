West Nile Virus in Massachusetts: Correction
--------------------------------------------
The information posted in WNV surveillance 2001 USA (13), posted on
Fri 20 Jul 2001, contained an inadvertent error. It was reported
incorrectly that a West Nile virus-positive crow had been found near
Willow Pond in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. In fact this information
originated from a press release from the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health of last year, dated 26 Jul 2000.
The correct press release from the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health for the current year is reproduced below. To date, the State
Laboratory Institute has confirmed West Nile virus in 2 birds, one
found in Andover on 8 Jul 2001, and the other in Lakeville on 12 Jul
2001.
ProMED-mail regrets this error. We are indebted to Elizabeth
Traphagen, MPH, Epidemiologist at the Division of Epidemiology and
Immunization, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, for alerting
us to the error and for supply of the correct information.

West Nile Virus Detected in Dead Bird in Massachusetts
------------------------------------------------------
BOSTON: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced today
identification of the first West Nile virus (WNV) positive bird of
2001 in Massachusetts. Confirmatory laboratory tests were completed
over the weekend for a crow found 8 Jul 2001 in Andover. The finding
was not unexpected, since WNV has been found this year in birds in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island and Florida.
Additionally, WNV has been found in mosquito pools in New Jersey and
in Delaware.
Last year [2000, 6 of 7 birds submitted from Andover were positive
for WNV. These were among 449 WNV-positive birds identified in the
state during 2000. The State Laboratory has tested 290 other birds
thus far this season; all were negative. In addition, over 1400
mosquito pools have also been negative for WNV and for Eastern Equine
Encephalitis virus. The MDPH Arbovirus Surveillance Program will
continue to work with local cities and towns, Regional Mosquito
Control Districts, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention on mosquito control and surveillance efforts. The presence
of WNV serves to remind the public to take precautions to eliminate
standing water near homes, to avoid mosquito exposure whenever
possible, and to consider using DEET-containing repellents when
outdoors in areas where mosquitoes are active.
The public can report dead birds or obtain additional information by
the calling the MDPH WNV information line at 1-866-MASS WNV
(627-7968), or by visiting the MDPH WNV website at
. All reports of WNV-positive birds
will be posted on the WNV website, which is updated daily.
