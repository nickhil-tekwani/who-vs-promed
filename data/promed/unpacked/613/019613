NICD probes Himachal's mysterious fever
---------------------------------------
A high-level team of doctors from the National Institute of Communicable
Diseases (NICD) and Institute of Virology, Pune is visiting Himachal
Pradesh to try and identify a mystery disease which has killed 10 people
and caused serious illness to at least 60 people.
The doctors are travelling to Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Kinnaur and Rohru -- the
areas which have reported this mysterious illness. The disease has been
recurring over the past 3 years during the monsoon season. While several
people have succumbed to this disease, so far doctors have not been able to
find a diagnosis. Its symptoms include high-grade fever, acute body ache,
and headache. A patient becomes unconscious before eventually succumbing to
multiple organ failure.
More than 30 people are being treated at the Indira Gandhi Medical College
(IGMC) hospital in Shimla. Some of them are responding well to treatment.
"She first had fever, we gave her a lot of medicines and then got her here
from Kinnaur," said Ratan Singh, a patient's father. "She has had fever for
the past 10 to 12 days. We got her here from Hamirpur. She's not eating
anything. We can't understand what has happened," said Amar Nath, a
patient's relative.
A team of medical experts has visited Himachal Pradesh each time the state
has reported this mysterious disease. But an understanding of the root of
the problem has eluded them so far.

[In the first posting there was a brief mention that one of the local
physicians suspected typhus might be the etiology of this outbreak. Dr
Steve Berger has submitted the following background on typhus in India. -
Mod.MPP]
GIDEON identifies 5 rickettsial diseases in India, with notes as follows:
Spotted fever: The local infection is known as Indian tick typhus, and
caused by _Rickettsia conorii_ (strain ITT). The etiologic agent has never
been isolated from patients in India; however, a spotted fever group
rickettsia was isolated in 1950 from a brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus
sanguineus_). Spotted fever in India differs from the Mediterranean form in
that the rash is often purpuric, and an inoculation eschar at the bite site
is rarely found. The clinical course is mild to moderately severe.
Infection was diagnosed in a French tourist returning from India in 1999.
Epidemic typhus: Cases of epidemic typhus were previously reported from
hilly areas in the north west. In 1968, a case of typhus was reported in a
traveler who returned to England from India. The disease has not been
reported in recent years.
North Asian tick typhus, Q fever, and endemic typhus are also thought to
occur in India. Epidemics of scrub typhus were previously reported among
troops stationed in the north and east, but have not been encountered in
recent years.

[Of note is the mention that this disease has been recurring in this region
for the past 3 years, each time in the monsoon season. The clinical
description is still rather vague, but the list of possibilities would also
include leptospirosis. We await more information from authoritative
sources. - Mod.MPP]
