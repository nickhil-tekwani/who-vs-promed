5 more Japanese farms may have bird flu
------------------------------------------
Chickens at 5 Japanese poultry farms near one recently hit by the
bird flu virus have shown signs of also being infected with the
disease.

The 5 farms are located about 0.3 miles [0.5 km] from the area in
Ibaraki prefecture where a diluted [?] strain of avian flu virus was
confirmed. The birds at the 5 farms were found carrying the antibody
to the disease, indicating the birds had been infected with the
virus, the Asahi Shimbun reported Thursday [30 Jun 2005].

The type of virus has yet to be confirmed, officials said.

Although health officials said there is no possibility of humans
becoming infected from eating the chicken meat or eggs from those
farms, the avian flu-infected area could become larger than initially
thought.

The ministry panel on poultry disease Wednesday started studying
whether the chickens raised at the 5 farms should be destroyed.

Government workers are in the process of culling 25 000 chickens at
the 1st infected farm.

Japanese officials say avian flu outbreak may have been more extensive earlier
--------------------------------------------------
Japanese agricultural officials said Tuesday [28 Jun 2005] they
suspect that cases of avian flu at a farm in northeastern Japan may
have been part of a larger outbreak that has since receded.

The Agriculture Ministry said Sunday that some of the more than 800
chickens that died since April at a farm in Mitsukaido City in
Ibaraki prefecture (state), just northeast of Tokyo, had been
infected with the H5N2 strain of avian flu, considered less dangerous
than the H5N1 strain that ravaged Asia in 2004.

On Tuesday, lab tests found that chickens at the 5 farms closest to
the infected farm had developed antibodies to the virus in their
blood, ministry official Hiroaki Ogura said. Blood tests were
conducted on chickens at all 16 farms within a 5-kilometre radius of
the farm with the outbreak, which are banned from shipping any birds
or eggs until officials can confirm there are no further infections.

Chickens at the remaining 11 farms tested negative, according to
results late Tuesday, Ogura said.

The blood tests indicated that some chickens at nearby farms were
exposed to avian flu but survived, Ogura said. The tested birds no
longer had the virus, he said, indicating that the outbreak could
have been more widespread at one point but later receded.

With no virus found at the other farms, officials believe there is no
need for culling at the 5 farms where birds have avian flu
antibodies. The ministry will hold a meeting of experts on Wednesday
to discuss further steps, Ogura said.

Officials began culling chickens at the farm with the outbreak on
Monday, and so far have killed about half of its 25 000 chickens.

The H5N2 strain has not been known to infect humans, according to the
ministry, unlike the H5N1 strain that crossed over to humans and
killed a total of 54 people in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said the risk of
human infection from H5N2 is likely to be low.

Examinations of workers at farms in the affected area showed no signs
of human infection, Ogura said.

[This outbreak has been caused by an NAI ("Notifiable Avian
Influenza"), since the serotype is H5; consequently, an official
report by the Japanese authorities to the OIE is anticipated. -
