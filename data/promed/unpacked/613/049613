The National Food Chain Safety Office (NEBIH) reports that bluetongue has been recorded in ruminants in the southern county of Csongrad. The disease has been diagnosed by the national bluetongue reference laboratory.

Since the end of September 2014, surveillance measures have been applied in the southern districts of Csongrad and Bekes in view of the disease spreading in adjacent areas in southern Europe. The virus has been recorded by the NEBIH laboratory in samples from 2 farms. Consequently, protection and surveillance zones have been officially established and animal movement prohibition applied on the affected farms.

Farmers are requested to report any suspected case immediately to their practitioner or to the district veterinary office (contact addresses provided).

[For the location of Csongrad, see map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/HU/06/Csongrad.html. The region is close to Hungary's border with Romania and Serbia, both known to be infected by BTV-4. Romania's BTV-4 restriction zones extend to territories beyond its borders, in southeastern Hungary. This can be seen in slide 6 of Romania's National Sanitary Veterinary & Food Safety Authority (NSVFSA) presentation to the SCFCAH [Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health], dated 6 Oct 2014:
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/2014100607_bt_romania.pdf.

Further details, including species affected, morbidity/mortality figures, and serotyping results, are anticipated to be included in the due notification to the OIE. - Mod.AS
