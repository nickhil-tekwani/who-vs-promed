Farmers in Gazipur district [Dhaka division] have become frustrated. Paddy had been planted on 13 000 hectares [about 32 124 acres] of land this year [2015], [but some areas] are attacked severely by bacterial leaf blight (BLB). The incidence and severity of it is very much influenced by rainfall.

The paddies in theses areas turned yellow and dry [and] had drastically reduced plants. Damage to the paddy was severe if farmers reduced their insecticide use, said the [local agricultural] officer.

[He] said BLB is an important disease that causes significant yield reduction of crops [and] people should become conscious about [it]. Recently fake fertilizer and insecticides have flooded the market. The farmers should be alert about it.

Broadening of the genetic base for identification and transfer of genes for BLB resistance from wild relatives of rice is an important strategy in resistance breeding programs, he said.

[A] special team had been formed to supervise the affected area.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern Australia, Africa, and the USA. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely affected every year, with reported yield losses of up to 60 per cent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe strains elongate over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance. Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water, and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity). Disease management includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers), and use of resistant crop varieties. Control of insect populations by insecticides, as suggested above, may help reduce the unspecific spread of bacteria via their scratching and sucking wounds.

The related _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.
