Detection of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) reactive antibodies in samples from ruminants in Greece
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In total, 14 bovine, 20 ovine, and 7 caprine blood serum samples, collected from animals in 13 farms in Thessaly and Western Macedonia regions of Greece, were considered to have originated from animals with exposure to SBV. Samples from cattle had been collected from November 2012 to May 2013 and those from sheep or goats in January to February 2013. The different samples originated from animals with reproductive problems, as diagnosed at the Department of Obstetrics and Reproduction of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Thessaly, Greece.

Initial diagnostic laboratory tests, where antibodies to the virus were detected by using the ID Screen Schmallenberg virus indirect ELISA (IDvet Innovative Diagnostics), had been performed at the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Thessaly, Greece.

Subsequently, 10 bovine and 2 caprine samples were sent to the Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Germany, where the results of the initial tests were confirmed by using a serum neutralization test against 100 TCID50 of Schmallenberg virus.

This is the 1st report of widespread exposure of ruminants to SBV in Greece and the 1st report of exposure of goats to SBV in Greece. All animals, in which SBV antibodies were detected, had been born in Greece. This supports the hypothesis that exposure of animals to the virus had taken place in Greece. Detection of viral RNA is needed to finally confirm the presence of SBV in the country.

[We are grateful to the Greek and German authors for this firsthand authoritative serology-based information on SBV in Greece. Final confirmative detection of viral RNA is to be awaited.

Between Dec 2011 and Jul 2012, 9 European countries officially notified SBV to the OIE as an "emerging disease":
December 2011: Netherlands, Belgium, Germany
January 2012: UK, France
February 2012: Italy, Luxembourg
March 2012: Spain
July 2012: Switzerland

Since mid-2012, Member Countries stopped notifying SBV through OIE's WAHIS. Instead, the following 11 countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, and Sweden) informed the OIE by letter of their 1st detection of SBV. These reports were not further distributed, but the information was made public by OIE's department of epidemiology during the 81st General Session, May 2013. See the "Report on Animal Health Status Worldwide in 2012 and the beginning of 2013", 6th plenary session, 30 May 2013; Article 312: "Emerging disease: Schmallenberg virus;" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/A_FR_2013_public.pdf.

During the 4th plenary session of the same meeting, the Delegate from Russia reported that, "the Schmallenberg virus has been detected in cattle in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine" (Article 257 at the URL above).

To the said total of 23 SBV (apparently) affected European countries, Serbia (see ProMED-mail posting 20130617.1777620) and now Greece may be added, bringing the total number of European countries regarded as affected by SBV to 25.

Romania's situation is yet to be defined (ProMED-mail postings 20130822.1895891 and 20130810.1874561).

Information included in a scientific paper on SBV in Turkey (Anatolia) is still to be officially confirmed or otherwise (see abstract at http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11250-013-0415-2 and ProMED-mail post 20130510.1704469). If confirmed, Anatolia will become the 1st territory affected in the Asian continent.

In the absence of internationally binding SBV case definition and SBV-related requirements for international trade in animals and their products, the conditions remain to be agreed bilaterally between trading parties.

Reportedly, a commercial SBV vaccine has already become available.

An updated source on SBV, with links, is available at http://www.fli.bund.de/en/startseite/current-news/animal-disease-situation/new-orthobunyavirus-detected-in-cattle-in-germany.html. According to the said source, infection with SBV is more efficient in sheep than in cattle. In sheep, SBV so far has mainly been detected in the brain of malformed lambs. The site includes a map showing the spread of the virus in German cattle, sheep, and goats during 2013, as of 27 Aug 2013.

Wide-scale infections in cattle in Azerbaijan have eventually become attributed by the local sources to an unspecified "Bunyavirus", probably not to SBV. Detailed clinical descriptions, diagnostic methods and final definition of this "undiagnosed bovine disease (Bunyavirus suspected)" (with allegations of zoonotic potential) have been requested and are anticipated with great interest (see ProMED-mail post 20130913.1940383). - Mod.AS
