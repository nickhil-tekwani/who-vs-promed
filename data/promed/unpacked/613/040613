Last week I submitted a note on R L Rausch's experimental infection studies
with rabies virus in black and brown bears in Alaska. The accompanying
table apparently did not transmit and without it some of the points I wish
to convey were lost. So here is the table again along with the points I
wished to convey to ProMED readers.

* Non-specific death
The two issues that I was trying to convey were, first, only 3 of the 10
black bears developed rabies as opposed to 3 of 3 brown bears. And second,
the two black bears with virus detected in the salivary glands had minimal
levels, while virus was not found in the salivary glands of any of the
brown bears. From the descriptions provided, none of the 3 black bear cubs
exhibited aggressive behavior and basically would be considered "dumb
rabies". Two of the brown bears, however, were aggressive towards the
researchers. This type of information needs to be taken into consideration
before public health officials make blanket recommendations for anti-rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis. Certainly, the 100-150 persons who started
post-exposure prophylaxis was far too many individuals. When will
recommendations for treatment get to true risks (e.g., bites) and away from
theoretical, unproven risks (e.g., touching a rabid animal)? In short, when
do we get the "lawyers" out of the policy questions that must be based on
scientific knowledge (I will get off the soapbox, now!).
