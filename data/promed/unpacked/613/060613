[These are the 1st clinical cases in cattle during the current epizootic of BTV-1 in Italy, initially recorded in Sardinia with serious losses in the extremely BTV-susceptible Sardi sheep breed. Some details on the clinical picture in cattle will be appreciated; probably, there are subclinical cases in the same holding. Their incidence may become known if serological tests are performed.

The route by which BTV-1 entered central Italy is likely to be by windborne infected _Culicoides_ midges from Corsica or Sardinia, situated to the west of the infected region (see map at the source URL above). For further details on the BT situation in Italy, see item 2 below. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue in Italy: updated to 4 Oct 2013
------------------------------------------
National bluetongue control programme is based on:
1. Surveillance on sentinel animals. Large number of sentinel animals monthly tested across the whole country.
2. Entomological surveillance. A net of _Culicoides_ black-light traps weekly operated all over the year.
3. Vaccination on voluntary basis.
4. Areas under restriction. Animal movements subjected to Reg. 1266/2007 rules.

A. Sardinia
-----------
a. BTV-1 circulation:
1. 1st suspicion: 1 Jul 2013
2. No. of confirmed outbreaks: 2916
3. No. of suspected outbreaks: 1921

b. Sardinia 2013 epizootic:
Species / outbreaks / susceptible / cases / dead / killed
Sheep / 2916 / 925 814 / 128 071 / 28 823 / 4
Morbidity rate: 13.8 percent
Lethality rate: 22.5 percent
[For the detailed figures for each of the 8 provinces infected in Sardinia, go to the source URL above].

c. Sardinia vector distribution:
1. _C. imicola_ is the principal vector (almost the unique), widespread across the island.
2. _C. imicola_ is highly abundant in several sites [map included].

d. Sardinia - measures taken:
1. Whole island is included within BT restriction zones
2. Ban of animal exits from the island
3. Clinical visits in all flocks
4. Vaccination of all sheep
5. Vaccination of cattle intended to be moved, according to Reg. 1266 /2007 [http://tinyurl.com/lboc2g2]

d. Sicily - measures taken:
1. The following provinces are included in the restrictions zones for BTV1: Palermo, Trapani, Messina.
2. Ban of animal exits from the provinces under restriction
3. Clinical visits in flocks located within 8 km [5 mi] around outbreaks
4. Blood samples collected from a statistical sample of bovine animals in herds located within 8 km around outbreaks

C. Central Italy
----------------
a. BTV-1 circulation
1. 1st suspicion: 20 Sep 2013

[The 1st introduction of the BTV-1 to Italy, initially to Sardinia (and simultaneously to France's Corsica on its north), and subsequently to Sicily on its south and to central Italy on its east, is causing heavy losses in the susceptible, unvaccinated sheep population. Clinical cases in cattle are likely to be limited in number and severity. BTV-1 has been circulating for several years in North Africa, Spain, Portugal, and the Balearic islands.

It will be interesting to obtain updated information on the BT outbreak reported earlier by the media from Libya, as well as about the situation in Malta.

The current information on the Italian vaccination completes the data addressed in ProMED-mail posting 20131002.1979136. - Mod.AS
