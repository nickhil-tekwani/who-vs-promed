Abstract
--------
Between [1 Jul and 26 Oct 2019] in Andalusia, Spain, a large outbreak with 207 confirmed cases of listeriosis was identified. Confirmed cases had a median age of 44 years (range: 0-94) and 114 were women (55.1%). Most cases (n = 154) had mild gastroenteritis, 141 (68.1%) required hospitalisation and 3 died; 5 of 34 pregnant women had a miscarriage. The median incubation period was 1 day (range: 0-30) and was significantly shorter in cases presenting with gastroenteritis compared to those presenting without gastroenteritis (1 day vs. 3 days, respectively, p-value < 0.001). Stuffed pork, a ready-to-eat product consumed unheated, from a single producer contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ ST388 was identified as the source of infection. The outbreak strain was identified in 189 human samples and 87 non-humans (82 food and 5 environmental) samples. Notification of new cases declined abruptly after control measures were implemented. These included contaminated food recall, protocols for clinical management of suspected cases and for post-exposure prophylaxis in pregnant women, and communication campaigns with concise messages to the population through social media. Given that there were 3059 probable cases, this was the largest _L. monocytogenes_ outbreak ever reported in Europe.

[When ProMED reported on this listeriosis outbreak in Aug 2019, there were 200 people (ProMED post Listeriosis - Europe (08): (Spain) meat product, recall, fatal 20190825.6640291). It is now said to be the largest _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak ever reported in Europe, involving over 3000 confirmed and probable cases between July and October 2019 in Andalusia, Spain. The cases occurred mainly in the province of Seville. Over 2/3rds required hospitalization, 3 died, and 5 of 34 pregnant women had a miscarriage. The source was stuffed pork, a ready-to-eat product consumed unheated, from a single producer that was contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ ST388. The outbreak strain, confirmed by whole genome sequencing (WGS), was isolated from stuffed pork samples from the single producer. No new cases were reported after the implementation of control measures, i.e. product recall.

Because _L. monocytogenes_, a Gram-positive bacterium that causes listeriosis, can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, _Listeria_-contaminated refrigerated, ready-to-eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as cold-cut meats, are recognized as potential sources for listeriosis. A discussion of listeriosis can be found in my moderator comments in ProMED post Listeriosis - Europe (02): Denmark, fatal, WGS, RFI 20220610.8703790.

Seville, with a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Andalusia, located inland, about 80 km (50 mi) from the Gulf of Cadiz coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville).
