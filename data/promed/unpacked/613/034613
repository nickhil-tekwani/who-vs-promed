Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 39
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed
a further case of human infection with H5N1 avian
influenza. The case occurred in a 35-year-old man
from Hanoi who was hospitalized with respiratory
symptoms on 26 Oct 2005 and died on 29 Oct 2005.
This is the 1st confirmed case in Viet Nam since
late July of this year [2005]. Since mid-December
2004, Viet Nam has reported 65 cases, of which 22
were fatal.
The newly confirmed case coincides with a recurrence of outbreaks in poultry.

Indonesia: New suspected Human Avian Influenza Case
-----------------------------------------------
A 16-year-old Indonesian girl who died this week
had bird flu, a health ministry official said on
Wednesday [9 Nov 2005] after the release of test
results. The latest death, if confirmed by
further testing, would bring to 10 the number of
human cases in the world's 4th most populous
nation and the 6th confirmed death since July
[2005].
"The test result showed positive, but we're still
waiting for confirmation from Hong Kong," Hariadi
Wibisono, a senior official at the health
ministry, told Reuters regarding the 16-year-old
girl. Local testing is usually followed by an
analysis at a Hong Kong laboratory recognized by
the World Health Organization. The girl was
admitted to a Jakarta hospital on Sunday [6 Nov
2005] suffering from high fever and pneumonia and
died on Tuesday morning [8 Nov 2005]. She lived
in an East Jakarta suburb near a bird market and
had chickens and pet birds in her house. However,
no evidence of contact with an infected bird has
yet been established, said Wibisono. "We will
carry out investigations to find out how she
contracted the virus," he added.
The disease is widespread among Indonesia's
chicken population, which the Agriculture
Ministry puts at 1.4 billion. Bird flu 1st
emerged among the country's fowl in late 2003 and
has been found in poultry in 23 of Indonesia's 33
provinces, killing more than 10 million
domesticated birds. Compounding the problem are
what officials estimate at 30 million "backyard
chicken" households, accounting for about 200
million birds. These are homes with just a
handful of birds, many in urban areas.
Officials say new infections in poultry this year
[2005] are so far around 800 000, compared with
5.3 million for all of last year [2004]. The
latest outbreaks, reported as of October 2005,
were in South Sumatra, Central Java and Lampung
provinces, and included backyard chickens, fowl
in a zoo and a pet bird, data from the
agriculture ministry showed. Most human bird flu
cases have been blamed on direct or indirect
contact with infected chickens. But scientists
fear the H5N1 virus will mutate into a form that
passes easily between humans, possibly causing a
pandemic.

[In the Reuters report posted yesterday (8 Nov
2005), the 16-year old Indonesia girl from East
Jakarta was considered to be a suspected avian
influenza victim on the basis of clinical
symptoms. The above report indicates that local
laboratory tests confirm that she had contracted
avian influenza virus infection. The results of
confirmatory tests in the WHO-designated
laboratory in Hong Kong are still awaited. -
