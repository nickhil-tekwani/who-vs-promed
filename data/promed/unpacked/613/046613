Of 19 suspected Zika virus cases, 3 are confirmed
---------------------
The mystery surrounding a viral disease, unknown up to now and which was frightening Teresina residents, was finally solved. Laboratory tests of blood samples of 19 patients were conducted and 3 were confirmed as positive for Zika virus. According to the Municipal Health Foundation (FMS), an investigation was requested by the Ministry of Health.

According to the Director of Health Surveillance of the FMS, Amariles Borba, the results were received at the Health Foundation this Wednesday (15 [Jul 2015]), and the patients are recuperating and progressing well. The tests were carried out in the Evandro Chagas Laboratory [a national reference laboratory] located in Para state.

[A similar report on the 19 cases, with 3 confirmed, was published on 16 Jul 2015 in the Prefeitura de Teresina
(http://www.portalpmt.teresina.pi.gov.br/noticia/FMS-confirma-tres-casos-de-zika-em-Teresina/7544 in Portuguese). That report points out the fact that Zika virus infections tend to be milder than dengue virus infections, without the risk of fatal complications. No mention was made about the possible confusion with chikungunya virus infections, which also has similar clinical presentations, as Mod.RNA has pointed out in previous posts on Zika virus in Brazil.

Zika [virus] produces fever, headache and muscle pain, malaise and, in some cases, conjunctivitis, according to health authorities. The virus was 1st identified in Uganda in 1947, specifically in the Zika Forest, discovered in a Rhesus monkey while a yellow fever [virus] transmission study was being carried out.

Guatemalan health authorities investigate the possible presence in the country of Zika virus, [which causes] a disease similar to dengue or chikungunya [fevers], according to an official source.

The Guatemalan Minister of Health and Social Assistance, Luis Monterroso, explained to the press that the Department of Epidemiology is analyzing 5 possible cases of the new virus [infection]. Monterroso did not go into detail about the places where the presumed Zika [fever] cases are registered, [the causal virus of] which is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The official just said that specialized personnel have gone to those places to carry out laboratory tests, "Up to now, they are just symptomatic cases," said the Minister.

[Reports of Zika virus infections diagnosed on symptoms alone should be interpreted with considerable caution. Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus infections present with very similar symptoms, and laboratory confirmation is necessary to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. One hopes that a laboratory confirmation or elimination will be forthcoming soon. If Zika virus is, indeed, present and being transmitted in Guatemala, there are no epidemiological barriers that would prevent its spread throughout Central America and into Mexico. - Mod.TY
