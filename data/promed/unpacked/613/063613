Treatment of Respiratory Syndrome [Chicken Complicated Respiratory
Disease] in Layer Chickens
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Attached is my translation of the 1st 4 paragraphs of an article
describing a respiratory syndrome among chickens in southern China.
In other Chinese publications, a syndrome with a nearly identical
Chinese name has been termed "Chicken Complicated Respiratory
Disease" ("CCRD") in English. - Dan Silver]
Since December 2006, a respiratory system disease has occurred with
relative frequency in southern China, especially among layer
chickens. The course of illness is relatively long. If not promptly
treated, conditions worsen, causing chicken deaths, reduced egg
production, and serious economic losses to farmers.
1. Clinical symptoms
In the beginning, several chickens make prolonged wheezing sounds, a
sound like blowing bellows. On the 2nd or 3rd day, the entire flock
will be sick, with sounds rolling in waves. In addition, food intake
drops, vigor declines, and egg production is reduced. The course of
disease is somewhat long, and deaths can occur.
2. Necropsy Findings
Tracheal congestion, phlegm, inflamed nasal mucosa, lung congestion,
thickening of the air sac wall, follicular atrophy, yolk-like exudate
in the abdomen, oviduct edema.
3. Diagnosis
Chicken Complicated Respiratory Disease can be preliminarily
diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and necropsy findings.

[The syndrome described might have some resemblance to _Mycoplasma
gallisepticum_ infection, commonly designated as chronic respiratory
disease (CRD) in chickens and as infectious sinusitis in turkeys. CRD
is rather widespread in some parts of the world, with egg
transmission as a major source of infection. However, the rather
quick spread of the disease in the flock, as described in the article
(reportedly, 2-3 days from onset to the involvement of the entire
flock) might indicate that other disease agents, including viral ones
(such as Infectious bronchitis and LPAI -- Low Pathogenic Avian
Influenza), are not to be excluded. Dan Silver, who kindly translated
the item, has informed us that the treatment recommended in the
Chinese article is Doxycycline, while traditional Chinese medicines
and commercial feed enriched with micronutrients, vitamins, and amino
acids were also recommended. This might fall in line with CRD
etiology or other bacterial infections.
Additional information, in particular laboratory results, will help. - Mod.AS]
