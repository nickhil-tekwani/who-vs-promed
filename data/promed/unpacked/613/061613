MALARIA, IMPORTED - EUROPE ex DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ALERT
*******************************************
A ProMED-mail post

*******************************
We recommend increased awareness in febrile returnees from the Dominican
Republic and possibly a word of caution when counselling travellers before
their trip.
*******************************
During the last weeks, several cases of falciparum malaria in tourists
returning from the Dominican Republic have been reported by the European
Network on Imported Infectious Diseases Surveillance (TropNetEurop), which
has been in existence since February 1999 and includes 28 infectious disease
clinics within Europe.
All reported patients stayed as package tourists in resort hotels at the
south-eastern coast of the Dominican Republic and did not travel to areas
close the Haitian border [Haiti has endemic malaria - Mod.JW]. None took
malaria prophylaxis. Some visited Higuey, the nearest town.
Patient #1: 26y, female, German national, stayed 14 days, presented with
falciparum malaria in Dusseldorf, Germany in June 1999, treated with
mefloquine;
Patient #2: 28y, male, German national, stayed 14 days on honeymoon,
presented with falciparum malaria in Dusseldorf in November 1999, treated
with mefloquine;
Patient #3: 28y, female, German national, stayed 14 days on honeymoon (with
patient #2), presented with falciparum malaria in Dusseldorf in November
1999, treated with mefloquine;
Patient #4: 34y, female, German national, stayed 7 days, presented with
falciparum malaria in Munich, Germany in November 1999, treated with
mefloquine;
Patient #5: 28y, female, Spanish national, stayed 7 days, presented with
falciparum malaria in Barcelona, Spain in November 1999, treated with
chloroquine.
There have been several reports of an increase of falciparum malaria during
July (including the alleged infection of a Chilean tourist), so the
occurrence of infections among tourists might not come as a big surprise.
However, as the Dominican Republic is still regarded as largely malaria-free
and an area of minimal risk for tourists, prophylaxis is generally not
recommended. The clustering of cases during the last weeks of November
appears to indicate a change in the epidemiological situation and might even
herald an outbreak among tourists during the coming travel season.
This has truly become a problem in several European regions during the last
weeks. Something can be done if information is distributed and awareness
among physicians is raised. For this, ProMED-mail is undoubtedly the best
tool.
