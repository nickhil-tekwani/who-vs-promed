Addendum to previous comments from Bangkok:
We had a discussion about [the predicament with the rabies outbreak in
Indonesia. As we stated previously, mass killing of dogs will only allow
others from the countryside to come in and replace the culled ones. This has
been tried in other places, Yemen, for one, years ago. Malaysia
(Peninsular) has managed to control rabies quite well. The culture and
geography there is similar to Indonesia. It is a Moslem and not Buddhist
country, and some culling of stray dogs, which is not acceptable in
Thailand, is thus possible. They did both ... mass vaccination and
continuous check on vaccine status of dogs and the reduction of the stray
and community dog population as well. Read TY Soon, Rabies in Malaysia, SE
Asian J Trop Med and Publ Health 1988; 19: 535-36. We would suggest the
authorities in Indonesia seek help from the Malaysian ones.

Indonesia:
20,000 people are given post-exposure prophylaxis yearly. 76 cases of human,
and 1,339 of animal rabies (including 1,317 dogs) were reported in 1994.
Eight cases were reported on Flores Island in 1998.
Malaysia:
198 rabid dogs were identified in 1952 and 15 in 1953. The country was
declared 'rabies free' in 1954.
Myanmar (Burma):
Forty to 90 cases per year were reported during the 1980's.
Papua New Guinea:
This country is currently rabies-free. No cases were reported during 1970 to
1997.
Philippines:
275 cases of human rabies were reported in 1978. The mean annual incidence
during 1983 to 1986 was 295 per year. 479 cases were reported (and 1,040
rabid animals registered) in 1994. 37.8% were below age 15, and most cases
were acquired from dogs (there are approximately 10 dogs for every human in
the Philippines).
Singapore:
This country is currently rabies-free. No cases were reported during 1970 to
1997.
Thailand:
- The first human case (Princess Banlusirisarn) was reported in 1911. There
are approximately 10 million dogs in Thailand, of which fewer than 12% were
vaccinated as of 1990. Coverage increased to 53% in 1995 (ca. 4 million dogs
vaccinated). 30% of children will have been bitten at least once by age 15.
- 41,444 rabid animals were identified during 1985 to 1990 - 95.4% dogs and
3.7% cats; 3,781 (3,561 of these dogs) in 1994. Up to 3% of dogs in urban
areas (including Bangkok) are infected. Highest rates of human rabies are
reported in the central region.
- 200 to 400 human rabies deaths were reported yearly during the 1980's; 191
in 1992; 73 (68 from dogs) in 1994; 74 in 1995; less than 70 in 1996.
Approximately 50% of rabies deaths occur among children. 160,448 humans
received post-exposure treatment in 1994.
Vietnam:
Most cases are acquired from dogs. 409,131 patients were treated for
possible rabies exposure in 1995 - 375 of these died of rabies. 28% of
persons treated for possible exposure, and 82% of rabies death in 1995 were
reported from the North. The rabies morality rate was 0.28/100,000
population during 1980 to 1989.

[A kindly correction from Arthur King. - Mod.MHJ
I see that you occasionally suffer from my complaint - a twitch of the
keyboard finger! I have yet to have the privilege of travelling to South
East Asia - our group is the Southern and Eastern African Rabies Group
(SEARG) which is associated with WHO to give SEARG/WHO.
