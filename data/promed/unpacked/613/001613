There are regions in Poland where we can still handle it, but in other regions it has already spiraled out of control, said Dr Tomasz Ozorowski, president of the Organization of Hospital Epidemiology. More and more Poles are appearing who have a dangerous and antibiotic resistant bacterial strain.

Colonized - that's how doctors refer to patients in whom they find the rod-shaped bacterium _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, a dangerous strain with the gene that encodes NDM-1 [New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1], colloquially known as New Delhi. If they have a "colonized" patient on the hospital ward, they should immediately move them to isolation. Before going in to see them, they put on a disposable gown and gloves. When they leave the room, they change clothes and carefully wash their hands. They disinfect everything that touched the patient. And they ensure that they test anyone who came in [unprotected] contact with him.

"They didn't isolate him, they just told us to take him home" says [the woman] whose grandfather found himself last year [2017] in a hospital in Bialystok, where they diagnosed him with New Delhi. "They assured us that at home he would be better off and that neither us nor him were in danger. During the discharge they did not want to check off that he had this dangerous strain. We had to fight for it to finally appear in his medical record," she recalled. Her grandfather got worse every day. "He had terrible swelling in his legs, stomach. 2 weeks after discharge, he was so swollen that we weren't sure how to put on his diapers. When he started to hallucinate, we called the ambulance. He ended up in the intensive care unit (he was in the same ward as others) in a coma. After 2 weeks, they turned off the machines and for cause of death they wrote: sepsis."

We learned from the Bialystok National Sanitary Inspectors (Sanepid), that last year [2017] there were 659 cases in the province. This includes patients who had the New Delhi strain and were asymptomatic [colonized] as well as those who became sick. It is likely that one person died. This year [2018], up through the end of September, there have been 580 cases identified and probably 4 people have died. They say "probably" because they know that not all deaths are reported. Doctors, as a general rule, do not write down on death certificates that the patient had New Delhi; at most, they might write down the effects, such as sepsis, pneumonia, spinal meningitis, osteomyelitis, urinary tract infection, or gastroenteritis. These are the types of infections that New Delhi can cause when it "colonizes" a person with a weakened immune system, such as someone in chemotherapy, after surgery, with substantial burns, the elderly, and children.

In the province of Kujawy i Pomorze, last year [2017] there were 16 infections and 5 deaths. Now [2018?] they have 38 new cases and already 12 deaths. In the province of Warmia i Mazury, last year [2017] there were 96 cases of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ NDM-1 and this year [2018], though there is still a significant amount of time until December, there are already 122 cases. Are all these people alive? That is something that no one is keeping track of.

"We are missing accurate information" admitted Jan Bondar, spokesman for the National Sanitary Inspectors. He says that the while the New Delhi problem is serious and we have more and more clusters of epidemics, we still do not have a reliable way of collecting information about how many people were diagnosed with this dangerous strain and what happened to them. As the average duration of hospital admissions continues to decline, sometimes even if a hospital reacts quickly and sends the sample for testing, by the time the results are back the patient is already gone, discharged.

"There are 3 options:
1. The patient becomes a carrier and has the bacteria in their gastrointestinal system but they do not cause symptoms and in time, the bacteria are expelled.
2. The bacteria cause chronic inflammation and the patient goes through months of feeling ill but the doctors do not know how to help him; all the prescribed drugs fail to fix the problem.
3. The patient has a sudden reaction, like pneumonia and we have to hope that the patient will get better on his own because even in this instance doctors are going to have a hard time finding an antibiotic that will work", said Dr Ozorowski.

He is upset that we do not undertake any coordinated efforts. "The opportunity to work effectively is at the beginning, when there are individual cases. Later, if we do not do anything, it is increasingly harder to try to stop it, like a snowball. Each year is worse than the last. Until finally the situation is so dire that it is impossible to reverse," he reflected.

The National Reference Center division of Antimicrobial Resistance in their last report already warned about a country-wide epidemic. _K. pneumoniae_ NDM-1 was found in multiple hospitals and in at least 15 provinces. Even in the Mazowieckie province, as found by the Warsaw division of Sanepid, last year [2017] they found 2325 patients with New Delhi.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems. Unfortunately, the worldwide spread of genes that encode resistance to the carbapenems is threatening the usefulness of these drugs.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that can destroy the carbapenems, as well as most other beta-lactam antibiotics. There are 2 types of carbapenemases: metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL), which use zinc ions at their active sites to catalyze the hydrolysis of beta-lactam antibiotics, and serine beta-lactamases, which use serine at the active site. NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases -1, -2, -3, -4, etc.), IMP (imipenemase), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamases) are MBL. KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases -1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases) are serine carbapenemases.

KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the US, but have also been reported worldwide. Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on mobile genetic elements, that is, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. These mobile genetic elements frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that carbapenemase-producing organisms have been susceptible only to a few toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

MBLs are now emerging as a global threat. MBL-producing strains are endemic within the community in many Asian countries, have successfully spread worldwide, and account for many significant carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) outbreaks. Infection control interventions in health care facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant organisms can be found at: CDC. 2012 Healthcare-associated Infections (HAIs): CRE toolkit -- guidance for control of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/cre-toolkit/. Preventing spread of multidrug-resistant CRE requires a coordinated national response involving healthcare facilities, labs, and health departments to rapidly detect and respond to antibiotic resistance at a national level. A rapid, coordinated response is also required to control the global spread of antibiotics resistance as emphasized by WHO last year (2017, see ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance (02): WHO, priority pathogens 20170301.4871299).

Bialystok, with a metropolitan area population of 450 254 residents, is the largest city in northeastern Poland and the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship (province) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Białystok). A map of Poland's provinces can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Poland#/media/File:POLSKA_mapa_woj_z_powiatami.png). - Mod.ML
