TULAREMIA - SPAIN (NORTHERN): VOLE RESERVOIR (02)

To the extent that burning destroys the voles' food sources, it may
have some effect. However, burning fields does not directly kill many
voles. Voles (of practically all species) typically burrow far enough
underground that fast-burning grass fires and forest fires sweep
right over them with no effect. They go into semi-hibernation to
minimize their oxygen consumption and just wait the fire's out.
Because of this, voles are usually the 1st mammals to reappear
anywhere after a bad fire. They were even back on the slopes of Mount
St. Helens within a very short time after the volcanic eruptions,
which undoubtedly did kill many voles but many survived as well.
Typically a fast moving fire bursts open many kinds of hard-shelled
seeds such pinon nuts and pine nuts. Voles thrive on these seeds, and
their population explodes. The voles then become food for hawks,
owls, eagles, and small mammal predators including feral cats, dogs,
coyotes, jackals, bobcats, and lynx.
Very often so-called "mouse plagues" occur 6 months to a year
(depending on climate) after extensive grass fires or forest fires.
These are actually population explosions of voles. Without knowing
the specific conditions where the fields are being torched in
northern Spain, I would predict that they are going to get more voles
soon, not fewer.

[ProMED-mail thanks Mr. Clifton for his comments regarding this issue.
To better distinguish voles from mice
(http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075664/vole):
Voles consist of any of 124 species of small-bodied mouse-like
rodents of the Northern Hemisphere. Voles have a blunt rather than a
tapered muzzle, a tail shorter than the body, and small eyes and
ears. Voles live in a wide variety of habitats at elevations ranging
from sea level to high mountains. - Mod.LL]
