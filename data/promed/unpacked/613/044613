Rabid dogs kill 2 people
------------------------
A 13 year old boy from Banjar Gentong, Tegallalang, died with rabies at
Sanglah Hospital on Tue 23 Nov 20010. He was a 6th grade student in
Tegallalang and had been bitten by a dog 3 months ago during a sports
meeting on 17 Aug 2010. The boy's father said that his son is the 2nd
rabies victim in Gentong, the 1st being a 35 year old man. The head of
Gentong Banjar has been requested by the Animal Husbandry Agency to
eliminate stray dogs in Banjar Gentong. This will be carried out on
Wednesday [24 Nov 2010].

Meanwhile, Dr IGB Ken Wirasandi, secretary of the Rabies Control Team of
Sanglah Hospital, stated after reviewing the symptoms that the boy was
rabies-positive. However, he regretted that most rabies victims never
received post exposure vaccination or had their wounds treated. He added
also that since end of 2008 until 2010 the Sanglah Hospital has treated 123
suspect rabies victims. Of these 75, including the latest victim, have
died. [Presumably the survivors had not in fact contracted rabies virus
infection. - Mod.CP]

As of yesterday [23 Nov 2010], 2 more suspect rabies patients are still
being treated at Nusa Indah Hospital.

A patient treated initially at Sanjiwani Hospital, has been transferred to
Sanglah hospital as his condition worsened. The patient stated that he had
not been bitten by a dog. According to one of his family members, in fact
the victim had been bitten by a rat in his own home. 3 days ago the patient
had fallen from his motorbike and subsequently suffered seizures with
symptoms similar to rabies. Accordingly, he was rushed to Sanjiwani Hospital.

[Merritt Clifton has appended the following comments regarding the report
above.

The precise number of rabies fatalities in Bali remains uncertain. Only 2
days earlier the Malay Peninsula Standard reported that, "The death toll
for 'suspected' rabies is now 106 people, 46 of whom were rabies positive
based on laboratory test results." I have now logged 79 rabies deaths by
name, age of victim, and place, but every recent media report places the
total number of deaths as upward of 100, and as many as 130 deaths are now
possible (as previously enumerated on ProMED-mail).

Rats are rarely a vector for rabies virus because they die too rapidly
after becoming infected. But in places where dogs are the major form of rat
control and dogs have been exterminated, the likelihood of rats biting
people is increased, not least because rats overpopulate their most favored
habitat and expand into places where they have previously been checked by
dogs -- like houses that are more-or-less open to the wildlife and the
elements. [The diagnosis in the case of this patient remains tentative. -
Mod.CP]

The Bali Animal Welfare Association is reportedly going great guns on their
vaccination program, funded by the World Society for the Protection of
Animals, but there have been several strategic misunderstandings occasioned
by different understandings of relevant terminology. For example, I was
called upon a couple of weeks ago to explain to some of the participants
the difference between "ring vaccination" (vaccinating around an outbreak)
and "circle vaccination" (vaccinating in the outbreak area and surrounding
radius), since in literal translation "ring" and "circle" are exactly the
same thing. Some of the other points of confusion include the perennial
mix-up of "shot" meaning inoculation, with "shot" meaning gunshot. My own
perspective is that anyone calling a vaccination a shot should be
vaccinated. - MC
