[The article is titled: Decreased Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae
to Fluoroquinolones in Canada. The abstract is summarized below - Mod.ES
"Fluoroquinolones are now recommended for the treatment of respiratory
tract infections due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ particularly when the
isolates are resistant to beta lactam antibiotics."
Drs. Chen, McGeer, de Azavedo, and Low of the Canadian Bacterial
Surveillance Network examined antibiotic susceptibility patterns on 7551
isolates of _S. pneumoniae_ obtained in Canada in 1988 and from 1993-1998.
_S. pneumoniae_ isolates exhibiting a minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) for ciprofloxacin of at least 4 micrograms per ml were further
characterized.
The prevalence of _S. pneumoniae_ with reduced susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin increased from 0 percent in 1993 to 1.7% in 1997/98 (p =
0.01). The prevalence of isolates with decreased susceptibility increased
with the age of the patient, reaching 2.6% for persons >65 years of age.
Seventy-five isolates with reduced susceptibility were studied. Seventeen
serotypes were represented. Strains that were resistant to penicillin were
more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. During
the same time period, fluoroquinolone prescriptions dispensed by Canadian
retail pharmacies increased from 0.8 to 5.5 [7-fold per 100 persons per
year.

[These are useful data that reinforce the need for judicious use of
fluoroquinolones in medical practice, but they are not particularly
surprising.
The fluoroquinolones inhibit the activity of bacterial DNA gyrase
(topoisomerase) enzymes, and mutations in the gene for the enzyme subunit
that binds fluoroquinolones could result in decreased affinity for, and
susceptibility to, these agents without a loss of enzymatic activity. The
DNA gyrase enzyme is necessary for bacterial DNA replication. - Mod.ES
