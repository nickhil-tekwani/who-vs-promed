It isn't clear to me, either, but last Monday I extensively interviewed
John Walsh of the World Society for the Protection of Animals about
several other post-volcano situations he's been involved with, in a
disaster relief career that began in 1963, and he volunteered that back in
the 1960s through the 1980s, he never encountered leishmaniasis; in
the 1990s, however, Walsh said it has followed every volcanic
eruption in the Americas south of the U.S., as well as various other
natural disasters in Central and South America.
It may be that the combination of ongoing deforestation with the
abrupt ecological changes resulting from volcanic eruptions are
somehow expanding the habitat of the sandflies responsible.

The volcanic activity in Nicaragua may have resulted in the
movement of people into a forested area and/or to a different
altitude, where there is increased exposure to sandflies. A change
in the type of shelter might also contribute.
Although the references cited suggest the outbreak is one of
visceral leishmaniasis, is this known to be the case?
