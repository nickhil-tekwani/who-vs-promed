[1] Cholera - Viet Nam (Hanoi)

A 28-year-old woman in Tay Ho district was hospitalized at the
Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases on 12 Mar 2010 in serious
condition, but has been released. The patient was first treated at a
private hospital, but failed to recover. She was moved to Central
Hospital for Tropical Diseases with dehydration and exhaustion,
reported Nguyen Hong Ha, the deputy director of Central Hospital for
Tropical Diseases on 17 Mar 2010.

After 5 days, the woman completely recovered and left the hospital on
17 Mar 2010. This is the 1st cholera case in Hanoi in 2010. The
Central Epidemiology Institute has been investigating the possible
source of the cholera.

[Outbreaks for cholera in Viet Nam were prominent in 2008 and 2009,
primarily in the northern provinces where Hanoi is located.

[2] Shigellosis - Viet Nam
Date: Mon 22 Mar 2010
From: Stephen Baker <sbaker@oucru.org> [edited]


At the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC),
Viet Nam, shigella is the leading bacterial cause of children
hospitalized with diarrhea. We have performed a number of treatment
and observational studies looking at dysentery and particularly
shigellosis.

Interestingly, over a 15 year period we also have seen a change in
the dominant species but the inverse of the observations reported
from Toronto (ProMED-mail Shigellosis, changing epidemiology -
Canada: (ON) RFI 20100216.0548). We have seen a progressive species
shift from _S. flexneri_ to _S. sonnei_ (Vinh et al: A changing
picture of shigellosis in southern Vietnam: shifting species
dominance, antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical presentation.
BMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:204; [available at
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/204>]). In fact, in
2009/2010 more than 95 percent of isolates are multiple drug
resistant _S. sonnei_ that are also resistant to 3rd generation
cephalosporins [such as ceftriaxone - Mod.LL] and demonstrate reduced
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones [such as ciprofloxacin. - Mod.LL]

The dominant shigella species may be dependent on the location and
stage of economic development. _S. sonnei_ appear to be most commonly
associated with industrialized countries while _S. flexneri_ is
associated with less industrialized countries. Fluctuations in the
incidence of _S. flexneri_ serotypes within a single location have
also been recorded and because immunity to secondary shigella
infections is believed to be serotype specific, this may be the
driving force. The reason for the change in shigellosis species in a
specific location is unknown and may be due to number of factors
involved in the transmission, environmental niche, the infectious
dose and also the changing economic conditions. Immunity (or the lack
of) possibly caused by exposure (or none exposure) to unrelated
organisms with a similar LPS antigen may change the selective
pressure on the organisms. We do not currently understand the driving
forces behind the change in HCMC, if there is clonal expansion of one
particular dominant strain with increased fitness and ability to out
compete other serotypes or whether there are other secondary
contributing factors in a community going through profound economic
and social change. We are currently investigating this in HCMC.

Because there is less shigellosis in places such as Canada,
transmission of the bacteria and population immunity is also more
limited. It is possible that the change in species that has been
observed in Toronto is related to a specific dominant strain that has
been introduced via international travel. Shigellosis is a common
imported infection from parts of Asia and men who have sex with men
(MSM) may be a transmission route of a dominant strain. Contact and
social network analysis with serotyping and genotyping would be
useful to distinguish if multiple strains or an individual _S.
flexneri_ clone is circulating. The main reservoir may be MSM, which
may lead to community infections in the population through the
individual shedding organisms. Global mapping data of this serotypic
and genotypic data would be useful to trace the primary sources of
infection and lead to a greater understanding of the changing
patterns of shigellosis in rapidly changing countries like Viet Nam
and where the disease emerges as recently described in Canada.

[3] Cholera, diarrhea - Bangladesh (Dhaka District)

As many as 30 patients reported to have cholera are being admitted
each hour at the Mohakhali Cholera Hospital, most of which are
children and the elderly.

Between 15 and 16 Mar 2010, 942 patients were admitted to the
hospital and another 264 were admitted on 17 Mar 2010 after being
affected by the waterborne infection of cholera, hospital sources
said.

Sources said the number of patients of diarrhea, dysentery, and all
kinds of waterborne diseases is increasing alarmingly. Most of those
are coming from Moghbazar, Khilgaon, Banani, Mugda, Lalbagh, Mirpur,
Tejgaon, Mohakhali, and Madhubagh areas [in Dhaka District].

Relatives of the patients said they are getting infected of different
diseases after drinking polluted water supplied by the Dhaka Water
Supply and Sewerage Authority (WASA).

[4] Cholera, diarrhea, 2009 - Nepal (Far and Mid-Western Districts)

Almost a year after the cholera outbreak that killed over 300 people
in the far and mid-western districts including Jajarkot, the National
Health Research Council (NHRC) disclosed that the epidemic was caused
by a combination of pathogens, and not solely by the cholera
bacterium.

Disclosing the findings of a high-tech lab test carried out by the
Center for Molecular Dynamics of Nepal (CMDN), Dr Chop Lal Bhusal,
chairman of NHRC, said, "The outbreak was the consequence of an
amalgamation of various types of dangerous bacteria."

"The lessons learned from the Jajarkot outbreak may be useful in
fighting forthcoming epidemics," he added.

The latest lab test found _Aeromonas_, _Shigella_, _Campylobacter_,
and _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria in stool samples collected from
patients during the Jajarkot outbreak.

"We found bacterial strains of _Aeromonas_ as high as those of
cholera," Sameer M Dixit, country director of CMDN, said, adding,
"All bacteria were combined either with cholera or _Aeromonas_."

According to Dixit, all types of bacteria found in the lab test were
water-borne. "We have, therefore, concluded that the Jajarkot
outbreak was caused by contaminated water," he said. "But we need
further research with a high number of samples to scientifically
substantiate our conclusion."

[5] Cholera - India (Maharashtra)

The death toll due to cholera has gone up to 13 in Solapur city since
last week. Earlier, only few parts of the city were reported for the
gastroenteritis and cholera patients, particularly slums located at
the Ashok Chowk area. But even after the claims made by the civic
authorities, the epidemic is spreading rapidly in other parts.

Chief minister Ashok Chavan had recently sent a delegation of
ministers -- including Laxman Dhobale and Foujiya Khan -- to take
stock of the situation in the city.

The number of people sickened by a shigellosis outbreak traced to a
Lombard sandwich shop is now at 50, DuPage County Health Department
spokesman David Hass said this afternoon, 12 Mar 2010.

Hass added that all 10 people who were hospitalized for the illness
have been discharged. "It's still an ongoing investigation," Hass
said.

The restaurant is closed and a re-opening date has not been set, Hass said.
