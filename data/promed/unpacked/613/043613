A horse that tested positive for West Nile virus was recently identified in Cherokee county.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control notified the county of the infected animal, according to a statement from the county.

The response area is southeast of Blacksburg, and officials with Cherokee County, the Town of Blacksburg, and the SC Department of Natural Resources will begin taking the following preventive action:
- door-to-door home and business visits within the treatment area;
- spraying of a mosquito-control agent via truck beginning Sunday evening;
- additional spray applications in 10 to-14-day intervals;

Information on treatment dates will be available at <cherokeecountysc.gov/emergency-services/emergency-management.com>

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [10 Oct 2017] that additional New York horses have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV).

The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (NYSDAM) has confirmed 4 additional WNV cases. One horse from St Lawrence county is still alive but was not vaccinated for the disease, the EDCC said, while the 3 other horses -- which resided in Cayuga, Erie, and St Lawrence counties -- have been euthanized. The EDCC said 2 of those 3 were not vaccinated, and the other horse had been vaccinated but not enough time had elapsed for the vaccine to be protective.

West Nile is also transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. There are no specific treatments for WNV, however supportive care can help horses recover in some cases. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool for WNV. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

A horse at the southern end of Cayuga county died from West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, according to a release from the Cayuga County Health Department.

The department was notified by the state Department of Health about the death, and as of [Fri 13 Oct 2017] it said no other animal or human deaths in the county have been reported due to the illness.

About 8 of 10 people do not exhibit symptoms of the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some, however, may develop a fever and exhibit symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. About 1 in 150 people infected can develop a severe illness, according to the CDC.

In the meantime, the department is encouraging the public to remain vigilant and use personal protection measures to minimize the potential of mosquito bites. People should wear shoes and socks, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors. The health department also recommends using a mosquito repellent containing 20 to 30 percent DEET or picaridin.

To reduce mosquito breeding on property, eliminate standing water by cleaning clogged rain gutters, turning over wheelbarrows and wading pools, changing out water in bird baths, properly maintain and drain swimming pools, remove tires, throw away outdoor containers that hold water, drill holes in the bottoms of recycling containers, and use landscaping to eliminate low spots where water could accumulate.

For more information, call the health department at (315) 253-1560 or visit http://www.cayugacounty.us/Community/Health/Environmental-Health

The Ohio Department of Agriculture Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory has reported a confirmed case of equine West Nile virus (WNV) in Columbiana county. The 18-year-old thoroughbred mare with unknown vaccination status showed acute onset of clinical signs on [4 Sep 2017], including neurologic signs, weakness in the hind limbs, muscle fasciculations, heart rate greater than 100 bpm, and a temperature of 103 deg F [39.5 deg C]. The mare was euthanized later that day. This is the 11th case of equine West Nile virus in Ohio for 2017.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) works to protect horses and the horse industry from the threat of infectious diseases in North America. The communication system is designed to seek and report real time information about disease outbreaks similar to how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alerts the human population about diseases in people.

There are a number of WNV cases being posted on a regular basis this year (2017). With very good vaccines available I cannot figure out why horse owners are failing to vaccinate. There are other diseases that we almost beg for a vaccine to protect our animals and yet when we have one, there are so many people who think there is no need to vaccinate.

The reality is, regardless of where you live, mosquitoes can transmit diseases to your horses. Please use the vaccine. It is effective in preventing the disease. - Mod.TG]
