OFFLU Avian Influenza Statement
-------------------------------
Forty-one countries in Asia (11), Europe (21) and Africa (9) have reported avian influenza in wild birds and domestic poultry to the OIE since 1 May 2021 to present. These have been confirmed as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) through molecular pathotyping with most viruses falling within HA clade 2.3.4.4b. A broad range of subtypes has been detected with domestic poultry in Africa affected by H5N1, Europe by H5N1 and H5N8, and in Asia by H5N1, H5N2, H5N6 and H5N8.

H5Nx clades have evolved over recent years leading to subtype diversity, multiple genotypes and also antigenic variability. In 2016, a novel H5 clade 2.3.4.4b emerged and was responsible for waves of H5N8 infections in Europe, Asia and Africa in 2016 and 2017. These were caused by novel reassortant viruses containing internal gene segments from Eurasian low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and H5N8 viruses which were first found in China in 2013. Further reassortment with NA genes from Eurasian LPAI viruses gave rise to H5N5 and H5N6 subtypes. Until 2019, the northern hemisphere experienced reoccurring cycles of infection of predominantly H5N8 in wild birds with spillover events into poultry, with these viruses historically having a relatively stable genotype albeit with internal genes being subject not only to drift but also to reassortment.

From mid-2020, H5N8 outbreaks occurred in Iraq, Russia and Kazakhstan caused by new H5 2.3.4.4b variants ("G2") with closest relatives to 2.3.4.4b viruses detected in Israel and Iraq in 2019 and 2020, respectively. There are indications these are derived from reassortment with Eurasian and North African LPAI, however, under surveillance makes it difficult to understand the precise origins. These viruses made up most circulating viruses in wild birds and poultry throughout 2021, involving an unprecedented wide range of subtypes (H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8) and wide dispersal throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. This was further complicated by increased reassortment creating an epidemiologically and genetically complex landscape. Two genetically distinct clusters of viruses with changes in known antigenic sites circulated in Japan and South Korea from October 2020 and continued to be detected until spring 2021. They are closely related to separate outbreaks seen in European countries in early ("G1") and late ("G2") 2020, respectively.

In Europe since September 2021 there has been an increase in H5N1 events. Sequence data from recent H5N1 events in September (Russia and the Czech Republic) and October (Italy and the UK) have a similar 2.3.4.4b HA to H5N5 and H5N1 strains found in Europe and Africa in late 2020/early 2021, linking further back to H5N8 circulating in Eurasia. Long branches to the diverse NP/PB1/PB2 segments would likely indicate under sampling or sequencing of wild bird-derived LPAI. Several phylogenetic groups in internal proteins linked by long branches indicate large diversity in wild birds.

Such co-circulation of different H5 lineages in diverse bird populations lends itself to further virus evolution through both drift and reassortment creating an ever-evolving complexity in both virus genetics and spatiotemporal distribution. The constantly changing picture results in significant challenges. Whole genome sequence analyses are important for tracking such evolution and in assessing these emergent events. There are now genetically distinct 2.3.4.4b subclades circulating which are further diversifying, and it is difficult to understand their origins. Human infections with 2.3.4.4.b H5 viruses have also occurred in the past year and although we do not understand the precise origins of these outbreaks, the viruses appear genetically similar to strains circulating in wild birds and poultry. There is also an increased need for regular assessment of contemporary viruses against current vaccines used in poultry in different regions using genetic data and though antigenic characterization using standardized protocols and sera to understand the extent to which antigenic drift leads to reduced vaccine efficacy, by clade. Mitigation strategies based on enhanced farm biosecurity and modifications to production practices are needed when these viruses are carried by wild birds. Enhanced surveillance is needed for early warning and case detection as well as for vaccine antigen matching in places where vaccines are being used or under consideration.

"OFFLU is the OIE/FAO global network of expertise on animal influenza working to reduce the negative impacts of animal influenza viruses by promoting effective collaboration between animal health experts and the human health sector. Originally launched in April 2005 to support avian influenza, OFFLU was expanded in 2009 to include all animal influenza and to further support to Veterinary Services in their efforts to reduce risks to animals and the public from animal influenza viruses" (https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/#ui-id-3).

The 1st HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Europe started in fall 2005, initially in Romania and Croatia, spreading across central Europe while causing high mortality in domestic poultry and wild birds. In 2010, when this event could be finally declared terminated, it had been detected in wild birds and poultry in 21 European countries. Its route of introduction could not be definitely established, though the role of migratory birds underlined.

The 2nd avian influenza virus (AIV) epizootic in Europe, caused by an HPAI H5N8 subtype, became larger than the 1st one. Its ancestral strain was initially reported in China in 2010, spreading later to Japan and South Korea. In late 2014, it spread to Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, causing severe losses in turkeys and chickens, and -- in difference from HPAI H5N1 -- milder disease in Anseriformes poultry (e.g., ducks) and wild birds. It was agreed that the main mode of its spread was migrating birds. This is also the generally accepted view concerning the spread of the current H5N1 strain, prescribing the consequent preventive measures.

Vaccination of poultry against "fowl pest" (the former term of HPAI), an OIE-notifiable animal disease with serious economic and trade-related consequences, was obviously considered a main preventive measure for decades. OIE's Terrestrial Manual, updated May 2021, says:

"During the 1990s, the prophylactic use of inactivated oil-emulsion vaccines was employed in Mexico and Pakistan to control widespread outbreaks of HPAI and H5/H7 LPAI. During the 1999-2001 outbreak of H7 LPAI in Italy, an inactivated vaccine was used with the same (i.e., homologous) haemagglutinin subtype to the field virus, but with a different (i.e., heterologous) neuraminidase. This allowed the serological differentiation of non-infected vaccinated birds from vaccinated birds infected with the field virus and ultimately resulted in eradication of the field virus. Prophylactic use of H5 and H7 vaccines has been practiced in parts of Italy, aimed at preventing H5/H7 LPAI infections, and several countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East as an aid in controlling HPAI, in China (People's Rep. of) for H7N9, and in Mexico for H7N3 HPAI virus infections. HPAI viruses should not be used as the seed virus for production of vaccine."

(The manual mentions also "Live recombinant virus-vectored vaccines" with H5 influenza A virus haemagglutinin gene inserts, approved and used in a few countries since 1997; since 2015, non-replicating, haemagglutinin based H5 RNA particle, H5 expressed baculovirus and H5 DNA vaccines have been approved for poultry but have had limited use.)

It has been argued that AIV transmission cycle cannot be fully blocked by mass vaccination if the viruses have a wild bird reservoir. This suggestion was supported by experience in China, where mass vaccination appeared to be more effective to minimize infections of AIV subtype H5 clade 7.2, which had no wild bird reservoir, than to minimize infections of clades 2.3.2 and 2.3.4, which did have wild bird reservoirs (https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13515).

As indicated in OFFLU's statement above, "there is an increased need for regular assessment of contemporary viruses against current vaccines used in poultry in different regions, to understand the extent to which antigenic drift leads to reduced vaccine efficacy." However, availability of information about vaccination coverage and vaccine strains included is incomplete. All countries that have reported H5N1 since September 2021 referred to vaccination in their OIE notifications as "not applied." According to OIE's WAHIS database, during 2019, vaccination against HPAI (subtype not specified) was applied in Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Pakistan. Such information for 2020 has, so far, become available only from Egypt and Pakistan. Reporting should be enhanced, including updated official information from all OIE's member countries.

To better assess the origin(s) of infection and to attempt forecasts, hopefully enabling timely application of precautionary measures, a One Health approach incorporating epidemiologists, ornithologists and virologists is essential. - Mods.AS/CRD]
