The Secretary of State in the Ministry of Public Health in charge of epidemics and pandemics, Alim Hayatou, recently launched a vaccination campaign against yellow fever at Lagdo in the Northern Region.

Speaking during the launching ceremony, the Secretary of State indicated that the vaccination campaign targets the population of the regions especially inhabitants of the banks of the Lagdo River because of their vulnerability to attacks.

The Minister reiterated government's determination to protect the population against the ravaging effects of yellow fever.

The campaign is being launched at a time when the 2011 health report indicates that 62 cases were registered in the area.

The campaign targets some 2 million inhabitants.

[The 3 Feb 2012 ProMED-mail post (see archive no 20120203.1032090), cited the Ministry of Health as reporting a total of 23 yellow fever cases, including 7 deaths, having occurred since October 2011 in Guider, Bibemi, Gaschiga, Lagdo, Mayo Oulo, and Golombe districts (all in the Northern Region). At least 13 of these cases from 6 health districts were laboratory confirmed at the Institute Pasteur of Cameroon.

The report above indicates that there were 62 cases, but does not state how many of these were laboratory confirmed. Both the report above and the 3 Feb 2012 report indicate that the vaccination campaign had begun at the end of January or the beginning of February 2012, 3-4 months after the October 2011 cases occurred. Fortunately, there is no indication that additional, recent cases are occurring.
