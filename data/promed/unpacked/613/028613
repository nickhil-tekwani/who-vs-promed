Arizona state livestock officials warned horse owners Thursday to make sure
their animals' vaccinations are up to date for a potentially fatal equine
sleeping sickness. The Arizona Department of Health recently found
mosquitoes carrying the virus that causes Western Equine Encephalitis in
southern Maricopa County and on the Gila River Indian Reservation.
Cases are most common during the summer and early fall when mosquito
populations are high.
Symptoms include neurological signs such as depression and lack of
coordination. A sick horse may also go down and not be able to rise. The
illness is fatal 20 to 50 percent of the time.
