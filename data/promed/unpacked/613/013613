At least 10 people have died and 42 others admitted in to hospital following the recent outbreak of kala-azar [visceral leishmaniasis] in Ayod County in South Sudan's Jonglei State, local leaders say.

According to Nelson Kuach Thoat, a member of Jonglei State Legislative Assembly representing Ayod, 7 people died in Pagil Payam [district] while 3 died in Jech Boma [sub-district].

Cases of kala-azar are common in the water-logged remote areas of Ayod, Pigi, and Fangak counties of northern Jonglei state. Annual reports of death and hospitalization from the disease during the rainy season are not new but little has been done to combat the situation.

Over 50 people died of kala-azar last year [2011] in Fangak and Ayod between May and June. Local leaders have blamed the recent heavy rains for this year's kala-azar cases. The MP said that on 9 Oct 2012 it rained for almost 24 hours straight.

Kala-azar is a parasite-carried infectious disease transmitted by sand flies. The disease is fatal if not treated after few days. The Commissioner of Ayod, James Mawich Makuach, told UN Radio Miraya in a phone interview on Wednesday [10 Oct 2012] that shops and residential areas have been swept away by floods in Ayod and called on the UN and government to help.

Jonglei State's Minister of Health, Jehan Makuei Deng, says an assessment to area will commence soon but flooded roads have made Twic East, Duk, and Ayod County inaccessible.

[For a review of the data on leishmaniasis in Sudan and South Sudan see the comments to the ProMED-mail posting from 16 Sep 2012 (Leishmaniasis, visceral - South Sudan (02): (UY) 20120916.1295988). Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Sudan and South Sudan. Leishmaniasis is not an acute disease and the statement that it is fatal within a few days if not treated suggests that other diseases, especially malaria, could also play a role in the outbreak. Malnutrition in the population probably contributes to the number of clinical cases of visceral leishmaniasis.
