The Texas Department of Health now have lab confirmed cases reported in
horses from Chambers (1 horse), Cherokee (1 horse), Hardin (2 horses)
Harrison (1 horse), and Rusk Counties (1 horse), and in an emu from Jasper
County.
We also have a confirmation of a horse from Harris County. This animal had
been vaccinated every year for the past 14 years, but had not been
vaccinated this year. The veterinarian who attended this animal stated it
had classic EEE symptoms. A single serum sample was obtained and showed a
1:320 titer for EEE and a 1:640 titer for WEE.
I believe that this animal will be counted as a confirmed EEE case.
East Texas veterinarians should be reminded that the USDA will test animals
for the arboviral encephalides at no charge. Possible cases should be
referred to Dr. Gary Svetlik (513/916-5551) of USDA for diagnostic
assistance -- as the situation warrants. Dr. Svetlik shares specimens with
the Texas Department of Health Laboratory, where the specimen will be tested
for rabies.
