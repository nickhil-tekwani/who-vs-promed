On 6 Mar [2008], the department of Neembucu informed the Centre of
Inter-institutional Operations (Centro de Operaciones
Interinstitucionales - COI) that there were various febrile cases
under study with 4 suspected [yellow fever, YF] cases confirmed to
date. It was then decided to form a team in order to vaccinate,
promote hygiene and sanitation and to destroy the breeding grounds of
the mosquitoes _Aedes aegypti_ and _Haemagogus_ [spp.]. House visits
are still ongoing as well as community awareness activities for the
prevention of the disease.

The Minister of Health has changed certain yellow fever vaccination
campaign strategies, indicating that they will only be administered
to adults and children from one to 60 years of age and that the
vaccinations in high, medium and low risk areas will be done
according to the guidelines established by the COI. The Expanded
Program on Immunizations - EPI - (Programa Ampliado de Inmunizaciones
- PAI) has delivered 2 399 000 yellow fever vaccines [doses] in
different regions of the country and has stored an additional 1 045
000 [doses]. At this time, the EPI reports to have vaccinated 1 750
000 people since the onset of the outbreak.

[It would be interesting to know whether the 4 confirmed YF cases
were acquired locally or elsewhere in the Paraguay YF virus
transmission hotspots and whether they were sylvan cases or the
patients were infected in an urban setting (perhaps in Pilar, the
capital city of the department). A map showing the location of
Neembucu, the southern-most department at the border of Argentina,
can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]
