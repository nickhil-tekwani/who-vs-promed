STREP. PNEUMONIAE, PENICILLIN-RESISTANCE AND OTITIS MEDIA (02)

All the organisms listed [970903123440] are part of normal respiratory flora.
Finding them in a group of children with abnormal physiology does not imply
causation. With regard to PRSP the worldwide rate of resistance varies from
5-50%. NOT finding them in this study would have been unusual!

Having taught microbiology for 14 years, I am a bit surprised at the comment
[by Robert LaBudde] at the end of this ProMED-mail post about "microorganisms
are involved in more disease than ever previously thought." Such comments
make me think that I have been missing the boat in a big way for a long time.
I have taught that _Strep. pneumoniae_ is the most common cause of otitis
media. Now while a penicillin-resistant form may be newsworthy, I am
actually surprised that this could be the first reported one. The ubiquitous
ear infection almost guarantees the emergence of an antibiotic resistant
strain, and likely a long time before now. Could someone make further
comment on this?

[Well, is this (archive 970903123440) the first reported penicillin-resistant
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or not? If it is not, then is it among the few
reports of PRSP? If it is the first report, then whether it is to have been
expected or not is irrelevant to the finding. We would appreciate it if
someone with other than an opinion on this would let us know. -- Mod CHC]
