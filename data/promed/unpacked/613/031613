30 000 birds die of flu in Russia in day
----------------------------------------
Russian officials report the country has a 3rd major outbreak of the
deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
30 000 birds died in a 24-hour period in southern Russia -- including
almost 22 000 in the Krasnodar region with the rest in Daghestan --
RIA Novosti reported Thursday [16 Mar 2006].
Officials say southern Russia is especially vulnerable to the disease
because of the number of migrating birds that pass through the area.
So far, more than 350 000 birds have died of the disease or been
culled in Krasnodar and 760 000 in Daghestan.
Health officials have begun a vaccination program for poultry to keep
the disease from spreading further. No human deaths from the H5N1
strain have been reported in Russia.

NIS 15 million allotted for bird flu compensation
-------------------------------------------------
The public should not be afraid to eat chicken sold in stores, and
"there is no shortage of meat," Agriculture Minister Zeev Boim said
in a bid to calm Israelis concerned over the spread of bird flu to
local fowl.
During Sunday's [19 Mar 2006] cabinet meeting, Boim updated ministers
on the steps the Agriculture Ministry has taken to contain the spread
of the lethal virus, which was discovered in local poultry for the
1st time this weekend.
Boim estimated that within 45 days all affected farms would be
decontaminated and would return to being fully operational. The
cabinet allotted NIS 15 million [USD 3.22 million] to compensate
affected farmers, to be distributed by a team made up of staffers
from the Agriculture and Finance Ministries and the Prime Minister's
Office.
Health Minister Jacob Edery said that despite the virus's outbreak
throughout the Middle East, his office would not be taking any
emergency measures at this stage.
Health Ministry Director-General Professor Avi Yisraeli told the
assembled ministers that 30 Health Ministry employees were stationed
throughout the south, where the virus has killed hundreds of birds,
preparing for the possibility of a human infection. Prof. Yisraeli
told Ynet that at the current stage, there is no plan to evacuate
citizens from the affected areas.
The controlled culling of fowl at the affected farms went into high
gear Sunday [19 Mar 2006]. Turkeys from kibbutz Nachson and Moshav
Sde Moshe were poisoned, and at the kibbutzim of Kissufim and Nirim,
farmers prepared to poison the poultry's drinking water.
Thousands of turkeys and chickens have already been [killed] by
poisoning their drinking water after fluids were withheld from them
for a long period.
The bird carcasses are being deposited in 6-meter deep holes
insulated with plastic and lime. On Saturday evening [18 Mar 2006],
however, piles of chicken carcasses were briefly left unburied, and
there were deep concerns that this could have spread the virus
further to healthy chickens.
Following the outbreak of the virus, the Agriculture Ministry's chief
veterinarian instructed the Education Ministry to make precise lists
of all students who have contact with chicken farming, in and out of
school, and to immediately notify the ministry if any changes in
students' health or behavior are noted.

More bird flu cases found in Denmark
------------------------------------
9 more cases of the H5 bird flu virus have been found in Denmark,
according to an expert who said that it would be established over the
weekend whether they were of the potentially deadly H5N1 type.
Peter Bagge of the Danish Food and Veterinary Research Institute said
the 9 tufted ducks had been found in the marine [sic: marina? marine
environment? - Copy editor MSP] of the town of Aeroeskoebing, on the
small island of Aeroe in the south of the country.
Bagge said authorities had acted as if the cases were H5N1, setting
up a protection zone around the area.
The institute said Thursday [16 Mar 2006] that the 1st case of H5N1
had been found in Denmark in a wild buzzard on Svinoe, on the island
of Zealand, south of Copenhagen.
The Danish discovery came a day after the EU's reference laboratory
confirmed Sweden's 1st cases of the H5N1 strain, also in tufted ducks.

[Denmark's 1st avian influenza case in a wild fowl was reported in
post 20060315.0803. The identification of the 1st affected bird as a
buzzard (_Buteo buteo_) was reported by investigators from Denmark's
Institute for Food and Veterinary Research (DFVF) and Statens
Seruminstitut (SSI). They, collaboratively, sequenced the virus
isolate, A/Buzzard/Denmark/6370/06 (H5N1), which had been obtained on
15 Mar 2006 from SPF [specific pathogen free] chicken embryos.
According to their information, the dead buzzard was found on an
undisclosed date in the southern part of the island of Zealand
(Saelland) in Denmark.
For their data, see ProMED post 20060319.0855: Avian influenza virus: sequence
database (02).
According to the Danish daily The Copenhagenpost online of 16 Mar 2006, the
Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research (DFVF) has sent samples of
the virus to an EU lab in England to be verified; see
<http://www.cphpost.dk/get/94599.html>.
VLA (Weybridge) reference laboratory's website has discontinued its
(commendable) service, which provided the dates and origins of samples
received and their test results.
No information on the cases in Danish birds is available on the OIE
website. - Mod.AS]
