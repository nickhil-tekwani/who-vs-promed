WASHINGTON D.C., USA. September 9, 1998. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is
unveiling its latest shield in the fight against alien invasive
species with the grand opening of the Center for Plant Health
Science and Technology today in Raleigh, N.C.

"This is a great day for U.S. agriculture and the department," said
Michael V. Dunn, assistant secretary for USDA's marketing and
regulatory programs. "This center will further USDA's mission of
safeguarding U.S. borders against the arrival of non-native plant
pests and diseases."

The center, located on North Carolina State University's Centennial
Campus, will coordinate plant health research and the application
of findings at APHIS' 13 plant protection and quarantine
laboratories and the National Biological Control Institute.

"We're pleased that North Carolina State's long-standing
relationship with the USDA continues to grow with the opening of
this center on Centennial Campus," said Dr. James Oblinger, the
dean of N.C. State's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
"This partnership will speed the transfer and application of
scientific discoveries for the benefit of American consumers,
growers, importers and exporters."

Among other things, center activities will focus on analyzing pest
pathways into the United States and the distribution and spread of
non-native pests to other parts of the United States, as well as
safeguarding against the introduction of these destructive pests
and diseases.

"In the past year alone, APHIS has spent more than $30 million
eradicating non-native pests and diseases from the United States,"
said Craig A. Reed, administrator of APHIS, a part of USDA's
marketing and regulatory programs mission area. "The Center for
Plant Health will enable us to better determine risks and pathways
of emerging pests, as well as facilitate agricultural trade."

Center for Plant Health Science and Technology, PPQ, APHIS, USDA,
