EU says bird flu confirmed in swans in Hungary
----------------------------------------------
3 dead wild swans found in southern Hungary have tested positive for the H5
avian influenza virus, the European Commission said on Wednesday [15 Feb
2006].
The European Union's executive arm said samples from the birds were being
sent to a specialist laboratory in Weybridge, Britain, to determine whether
they had the H5N1 strain which can kill humans.
"The Hungarian authorities are applying the same precautionary measures as
other member states in which the H5N1 virus has been confirmed or in which
it is suspected in wild birds," the Commission said in a statement.
The H5N1 strain has been confirmed in wild birds in EU member states Greece,
Italy and Germany, and is suspected in Slovenia and Austria.
"The Commission will adopt a decision at 17:00 (1600 GMT) today on the
precautionary measures to be applied in Hungary, just as it did for the
other affected member states," the statement said.
Precautionary measures include setting up a 3 km protection zone around the
area where the swans were found, and a surrounding surveillance zone of 10
km.
Within the protection zone, poultry must be kept indoors, movement of
poultry is banned except directly to the slaughterhouse, and the dispatch of
meat outside the zone is forbidden except under very limited conditions.

[Note that the 1st paragraph states that the swans had "tested positive for
the H5 avian influenza virus", and the next paragraph that samples have been
sent to Weybridge to check if they are in fact H5N1. Typing to the H5 level
is relatively easy, but more specialized testing is required to determine
whether it is H5N1. However, swans are repeatedly being implicated as
carriers of H5N1 in Europe (Germany, Greece, Russia), perhaps because dead
swans are much more conspicuous than other dead wildfowl. - Mod.JW]
