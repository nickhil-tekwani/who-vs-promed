Mystery surrounds devastation of St Lawrence coconuts
-----------------------------------------------------
A coconut farmer at St Lawrence, [Essequibo Islands-West Demerara, Guyana] is seeking help to stop the destruction of his farm, which is continuing to be devastated by an unknown cause. In the last 5 years, almost half of his 25 acres [about 10 ha] of trees has been devastated. According to the farmer, healthy looking trees will suddenly begin dropping their fruits, then a yellowing will progress [resulting in] dried and fallen [fronds] and the tree will finally die.

Most of the dried trees have since been replaced with new coconut plants. The farmer is hoping that the young plants will not contract the disease given the losses he has already suffered. A visit to the farm saw scores of trees, which had already died and many showing evidence of the unknown disease.

The case was referred to the National Agricultural and Research Extension Institute (NAREI) for analysis and help to find a solution. Officials from NAREI have since visited the farm and are conducting investigations as well as offering advice and help

[A range of diseases of coconut palms have been reported from the Americas. Amongst them are lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms, which are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. LY is spread by sucking insects (such as plant hoppers) and commercial control relies on use of resistant varieties. For more information on LY see links below and previous posts in the archives.

A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. While the picture and description above may resemble LY symptoms, reliable diagnosis of a pathogen is needed before any management strategies can be designed. It is to be noted that the replanted seedling in the centre forefront of the photo provided by the source is already showing yellowing symptoms, which may point towards a new infection.

If LY were to be shown to be the cause of the problem in Guyana, this would be a 1st report of the disease in the country and probably in South America. A spread from the adjacent Caribbean region would be feasible, but specific phytoplasma species and/or strains would need to be identified to determine a possible source of the incursion.
