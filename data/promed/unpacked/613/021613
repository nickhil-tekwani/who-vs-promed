About 20 people from at least 2 counties who were reportedly exposed
to a rabid dog are now getting precautionary shots.
Fauquier and Loudoun health officials said the dog was taken to at
least 3 veterinary clinics, including facilities in Bealeton,
Fredericksburg and Warrenton, before it was diagnosed.
Douglas Hubbard of the Loudoun County Health Department confirmed
that the dog was euthanized at an animal clinic in Leesburg on or
around 10 Apr 2007. A rabies test yielded positive results, and
Loudoun health officials were notified 13 Apr 2007, he said. They
notified their counterparts in Fauquier County.
Charles Shepherd is the district manager of environmental health
assigned to Fauquier County. He said his department was notified
because Loudoun officials mistakenly believed the dog was from
Fauquier. It was really from Culpeper, he said.
Shepherd added that when a rabies test yields positive results,
health officials try to notify everyone who has had contact with the
animal within about 10 days of diagnosis.
Rabies is a "deadly disease caused by a virus that attacks the
central nervous system," according to the Virginia Department of
Health website.
The virus is found in the saliva and brain of an infected animal. It
can be contracted through a bite or by getting saliva or the brain
tissue of an affected animal in a wound, in the eye or mouth.
Bill Bush is a veterinarian at the Life Center in Leesburg, where the
dog was euthanized. He said that while it exhibited symptoms of
rabies, those symptoms can also be indicative of other diseases, such
as encephalitis.
"The dog [a female pug estimated to be about 14 months old] had signs
suggesting there was some inflammation of the brain," Bush said. "It
had poor vision, and the right eye was worse than the left. It was
weak, unable to walk, and it was having spontaneous eye movements. It
was salivating and having oral movements indicative of seizures."
According to health officials and veterinarians, a rabies test can
only be conducted once an animal is deceased.
In an e-mail distributed last month [April 2007], the president of
the Virginia Hunting Dog Owners' Association also urged pet owners to
have their dogs and cats vaccinated.
"We have a growing and serious problem in Virginia," Bob Kane said.
"Confirmed reports of rabid animals and people treated for rabies
exposure reached 8-year highs in the state last year [2006]."
Statistics provided by the Virginia Health Department indicate that
as of 21 Apr 2007, there were 212 confirmed cases of rabid animals in
Virginia this year. There were 637 confirmed cases of rabid animals
statewide in 2006.

[A discussion of rabies virus may be found on ProMED-mail post 20070426.1364.
Post-exposure rabies prophylaxis for unvaccinated persons should
always include administration of both human rabies immune globulin
(HRIG) and a series of 5 rabies vaccinations. The combination of
immune globulin and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite
exposures, regardless of the time elapsed since the exposure.
Previously immunized persons should receive only vaccine.
Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) provides rapid passive immune
protection. It is given only once, on the 1st day of the
post-exposure prophylaxis regimen (designated day zero). As much as
possible of the HRIG should be infiltrated into and around the wound,
and the remaining given intramuscularly at a site distant from the
vaccine (frequently the gluteals). If the HRIG was not administered
on day zero, it may be administered through the 7th day of the
regimen. Beyond the 7th day, HRIG is not indicated since an antibody
response to vaccine is presumed to have occurred. The recommended
dosage of HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight, for all ages. No more than
the recommended dosage of HRIG should be given.
Rabies vaccine induces an active immune response that requires 7 to
10 days to develop and persists for 2 years or longer. The PEP
vaccine series consists of 5 1-ml doses of rabies vaccine given on
days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The injection must be given intramuscularly
in the deltoid region of adults or in the anterolateral thigh of
young children. The 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be administered
in conjunction with HRIG on day 0 of the PEP regimen, except in
previously vaccinated individuals. Previously vaccinated persons are
given 2 1.0 ml doses of vaccine IM, on days 0 and 3 (no HRIG is administered).
Two inactivated, cell culture rabies vaccines are currently available
in the U.S.: Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDVC) and Purified Chick
Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCEC). Both are considered equally safe and
efficacious. It is recommended that a vaccine series be initiated and
completed with the same vaccine product.
In general, there is a very low frequency of serious adverse
reactions to the rabies PEP regimen. Local pain and low-grade fever
may follow administration of HRIG. Pain, erythema, swelling, itching,
and other mild local reactions are reported among 30 percent to 74
percent of vaccinates. Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle
aches, dizziness, or other systemic reactions are reported among 5
percent to 40 percent of vaccinates. Rabies PEP should not be
interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild systemic adverse
reactions to rabies vaccine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
antipyretic agents may be used to control mild adverse reactions.
An immune-complex-like reaction (generalized urticaria, sometimes
accompanied by arthralgia, arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting,
fever, and malaise) occurs in approximately 6 percent of
pre-exposure-vaccinated individuals receiving a booster dose. This
reaction can rarely occur in persons receiving their primary
vaccination regimen; however it has not been reported to be life
threatening in either case.
When a person with a history of serious hypersensitivity to rabies
vaccine must be revaccinated, antihistamines may be administered
concomitant with vaccine, and the person should be observed for
development of anaphylaxis immediately following vaccination. The
Acute Disease Investigation and Control Section is available for
consultation about the management of possible rabies exposure and PEP
in patients with a history of serious adverse reactions to rabies vaccine.
