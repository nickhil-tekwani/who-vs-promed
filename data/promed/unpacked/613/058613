_E. coli_ outbreak with unknown food source
-------------------------------------------

Fast facts
---------
Illnesses: 84
Hospitalizations: 38
Deaths: 0
States: 4
Recall: no
Investigation status: active

Update on source
----------------
A specific food has not yet been confirmed as the source of this outbreak, but many sick people reported eating sandwiches with romaine lettuce at Wendy's restaurants in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania before getting sick. Based on this information, Wendy's has taken the precautionary measure of removing the romaine lettuce being used in sandwiches from restaurants in that region. Wendy's uses a different type of romaine lettuce for salads. Investigators are working to confirm whether romaine lettuce is the source of this outbreak and whether romaine lettuce used in Wendy's sandwiches was served or sold at other businesses. Wendy's is fully cooperating with the investigation.

What you should do
------------------
- CDC is not advising that people avoid eating at Wendy's restaurants or that people stop eating romaine lettuce.
- Wendy's has taken the precautionary measure of removing the romaine lettuce being used in sandwiches from restaurants in this region.
- At this time, there is no evidence to indicate that romaine lettuce sold in grocery stores, served in other restaurants, or in people's homes is linked to this outbreak.
- CDC will update this advice if the investigation identifies foods to avoid.

Investigators are continuing to collect different types of data to identify the food source of this multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. A specific food has not yet been confirmed as the source of this outbreak, but many sick people reported eating burgers and sandwiches with romaine lettuce at Wendy's restaurants before getting sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
Since the last update on 19 Aug 2022, 47 more illnesses have been reported to CDC. As of 24 Aug 2022, a total of 84 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 4 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2022/o157h7-08-22/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 26 Jul 2022 to 9 Aug 2022 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2022/o157h7-08-22/epi.html).

State of residence / Number of sick people
-------------------------------
Indiana / 6
Michigan / 53
Ohio / 23
Pennsylvania / 2

Sick people range in age from 5 to 94 years, with a median age of 24 years, and 52% are male. Of 73 people with information available, 38 have been hospitalized and 8 people in Michigan have developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some of the recent illnesses have not yet been reported to PulseNet as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak. In addition, some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _E. coli_.

State and local public health officials have been interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Among 62 people who have been interviewed, 52 (84%) reported eating at a Wendy's restaurant in the week before their illness started. The Wendy's restaurants where sick people ate are in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. People reported eating a variety of menu items, including burgers and sandwiches. Of 17 people with detailed information about what they ate at Wendy's, 15 (88%) reported eating romaine lettuce served on burgers and sandwiches. Investigators continue to analyze data at the ingredient level to determine if there are any other possible foods that could be the source of the outbreak.

[The rise in cases over a week since the last report primarily reflects completion of whole genome sequencing of potential cases. The suspected vehicle has a finite life span and has been reported to have been removed from the food chain. No additional information is yet forthcoming regarding the geographic source of the suspected vehicle and whether a "smoking gun" has been found, that is, isolation of the same organism from the suspected vehicle. - Mod.LL
