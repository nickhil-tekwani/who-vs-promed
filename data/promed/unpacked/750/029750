Re: Transmission of West Nile Virus from Alligators to Humans
-------------------------------------------------------------
[In the preceding post it was suggested that the 1st human case of West
Nile virus infection in Idaho had contracted the virus in the course of his
employment in an alligator farm -- see: West Nile virus, human - USA
(Idaho) 20031108.2767. Steve Grenard queried the identity of the vector and
the mode of transmission, and has forwarded the following response to his
questions obtained from Peter Brazaitis, former Curator of Animals at the
Central Park Zoo in New York City and the Superintendent of Reptiles at the
New York Zoological Park/Bronx Zoo.]
"I just got off the phone with knowledgeable people in Louisiana. There are
now a great many cases of West Nile virus among alligator farmers, workers,
and especially captive farmed alligators. To save money on heating water,
the farmers have gone to only cleaning their tanks once a week and are
overcrowding the tanks by 3 times or more capacity. The tanks are breeding
grounds for mosquitoes, filthy, and badly contaminated with decaying food
and feces. Worse, they are taking infected animals and releasing them back
into the wild. We are talking 10's of thousands of animals on these farms.
Mosquitoes are freely feeding on and transmitting West Nile virus between
animals and people. The state does not enforce or inspect as they did in
the past for fear of law suits. Farmers fear that a finding of
contamination on the farms may result in their getting closed down. Thus,
they will not allow inspections and threaten to sue the state if they do
and they lose revenue because of it. As the alligator farmers and their
taxes are a big source of revenue to the state management program, and
farmers are pretty much running the state program, the state does not want
to rock the farmers' boat."

[The intervention of an arthropod vector in the transmission of West Nile
virus to the farm worker from captive alligators has not been definitely
excluded, and other modes of transmission are possible. It would seem to me
that the critical factor is the amount of virus delivered rather than the
means of delivery. For example, it has been demonstrated experimentally
that West Nile virus can be transmitted directly between captive birds in
the absence of vectors and ectoparasites (see: West Nile virus,
bird-to-bird transmission (04) 20001102.1909). In humans West Nile virus
can be transmitted via blood donation, tissue transplantation, and by
maternal milk (see: West Nile virus, breast milk - USA (02) 20021004.5462).
In the case of the Idaho patient, mosquito-borne transmission cannot be
excluded, but it is not inconceivable that West Nile virus could be
transmitted via wounds and abrasions. Transmission among alligators has
been assumed to be by mosquitoes, but it is possible that there is direct
transmission via wounding. - Mod.CP]
[Experience with injecting red-tailed hawks with West Nile virus revealed
that the viraemia had stopped by day 6, but the signs didn't appear until
day 10. The same phenomenon may pertain in alligators, so that the sick
ones are no longer viraemic and therefore handling them should present no
problems. Plus the virus is not robust, so their presence in the warm tank
water is most unlikely. Clean water is important and they should have
proper filtration systems, if only to avoid recycling enteric pathogens and
any toxic chemical getting into the system through the ground water. - Mod.MHJ]
