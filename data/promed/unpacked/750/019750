[There have been multiple findings of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds from sites across Great Britain. Avian influenza has been confirmed in birds in premises in England, Wales, and Scotland. The latest avian influenza update situation is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#history (last updated 10 Nov 2021).

The current avian influenza season began in October 2021, with several countries in Europe reporting cases of HPAI, mainly subtype H5N1, which differs from the previous season when the HPAI subtype H5N8 predominated.

Everything seems to indicate that this new season 2021-2022 will be another challenging situation for the poultry sector in the region. Most cases thus far have been associated with the introduction of the HPAI virus from migratory wild birds.

A map of HPAI detection in Europe during 1 Oct 2021 to 8 Nov 2021 is available at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_EU/2021/Map_AI_EU_2021-11-08.jpg. - Mod.CRD
