Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - WHO Update 87
------------------------------------
As of 7 Feb 2010, worldwide more than 212 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of
pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 15 292 deaths.

WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states
and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update
----------------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, overall pandemic
influenza activity continued to decline in most countries. The most
active areas of transmission continue to be in later peaking areas,
particularly northern Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. Of note,
Senegal became the 3rd country within the past month (and 5th overall)
to confirm 1st cases of pandemic H1N1 2009 in West Africa. There is
insufficient evidence at this point to determine if this heralds the
beginning of a period of more widespread transmission in West Africa,
which heretofore may have been largely spared a significant period of
communitywide pandemic influenza virus transmission.

In North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission persists but
substantial declines in activity have been observed over the past
month across the region. In Morocco, levels of ILI [influenza-like
illness] have returned to near baseline, and in Egypt, the number of
confirmed cases has declined considerably.

In South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus continues to
circulate widely across the region; however, overall activity
continues to decrease or remain low in most places. In India,
influenza transmission persists, particularly in western, and to a
lesser extent, northern India; however, overall the numbers of cases
have declined substantially. In Thailand, overall activity remains low
and unchanged since the previous reporting period; however, focal
areas of increased ILI activity were reported in central and northern
Thailand.

In East Asia, pandemic influenza transmission persists across the
region; however, overall activity has declined substantially in most
places. In China, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses continue to
co-circulate; however, over the last several weeks, seasonal influenza
type B viruses have been predominant. In Japan, influenza activity
continues to decrease towards seasonal baselines, including in Okinawa
which is experiencing greater levels of influenza activity than in
other parts of the country. In Republic of Korea (S. Korea), levels of
ILI have decreased substantially to near baseline levels.

In Europe, although pandemic influenza virus continues to circulate
widely, particularly across central, southern, and eastern Europe, the
overall intensity of pandemic influenza activity has declined
substantially from peaks of activity seen earlier during the winter
transmission period. Among 15 countries testing more than 20 sentinel
respiratory samples, the proportion of samples testing positive for
influenza ranged from 0-14 percent. Recent slight increases in rates
of ARI [acute respiratory tract infection] in Slovakia, Slovenia, and
the Russian federation, do not appear to be associated with detections
of influenza viruses and may be due to other circulating respiratory
viruses.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggest that pandemic influenza
virus transmission may be geographically localized in most countries
reporting surveillance data to the WHO, and the overall intensity of
activity may be low.

In the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones,
overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low
in most places. In Central America and the Caribbean, pandemic
influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low
or unchanged in most places. A high intensity of respiratory diseases
with increasing trend was reported in Guatemala; however, the
increased activity does not appear to be associated with increased
detections of influenza viruses and may be due to other circulating
respiratory viruses.

In temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of
pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of
sustained community transmission. Pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus
continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide.
In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B
viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and
type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, East and Southeast
Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential
to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

Region / Deaths*
-------------------
WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 167
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / At least 7261
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 1018
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / At least 3648
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) / 1523
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO /) / 1675

Total / At least 15 292

*The reported number of fatal cases is an under representation of the
actual numbers as many deaths are never tested or recognized as
influenza related
