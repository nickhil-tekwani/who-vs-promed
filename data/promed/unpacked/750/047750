Twenty-five cases of dengue have been confirmed in Texas since 1 Jul 1999.
Eighteen cases were in Webb County residents. The remaining seven cases
were in residents of Galveston, Hidalgo (2), Nueces, Tarrant, and Willacy
Counties (2).
Five of these cases (3 in Webb Co. residents and one each in Nueces and
Willacy Co. residents) were acquired in Texas. The Nueces County resident
had traveled to Web County, but not outside the US during the two weeks
prior to onset of illness.
Travel history is, as yet, unclear for two patients. The remaining 18
patients, except for the Tarrant Co. resident who traveled to Brazil, all
had been in Mexico during the 2 weeks prior to onset of illness.

[In a comment to a previous posting, on dengue in Mexico, I cited
"Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta" who "referred all questions about the dengue cases to state health
authorities, saying they haven't been studying the outbreak." Seems that
is not correct. We now have been informed by both the State of Texas and
by CDC that CDC/Fort Collins (Division of vector-Borne Infectious Diseases)
and the State have been collaborating and involved and CDC has had a team
investigating the outbreak in Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, in collaboration
with Texas and Mexico health authorities. The objective was to identify
risk factors associated with transmission on both sides of the border, and
ultimately to use this information to develop more effective prevention
strategies. We are pleased to be corrected. Looks like the person who
originally spoke for CDC shouldn't have. - Mod.CHC
