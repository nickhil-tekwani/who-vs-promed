Major outbreaks of Newcastle disease in poultry in Australia over the last
2 years were due to a change in a home-grown, milder strain, and not from
an incursion from overseas.
This is the message that will be presented to the 11th International
Congress of Virology in Sydney today, by CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific
Industrial Research Organization Animal Health's Dr Peter Daniels.
Dr Daniels says genetic sequencing of the virus was the key to determining
the origin of the 2 Newcastle disease outbreaks in the Central Coast and
Western Sydney regions of New South Wales (NSW).
"Comparison with the genetic 'fingerprints' of known overseas and
Australian strains, pointed to the origin of the virus. This clearly showed
the outbreak was caused by a highly virulent Newcastle disease virus that
had mutated from an existing, milder virus strain already present in
Australia.
"Genetic sequencing also provides information on the virulence of the virus
strain, or in other words, how much disease it can cause," Dr Daniels says.
New South Wales Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Dick Jane, says CSIRO's
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) played a crucial role in
providing fast information about the virus to NSW Agriculture, the agency
that successfully managed the control of the Newcastle disease outbreaks.
"This allowed us to respond quickly to the outbreak, and choose an
eradication strategy based on the best scientific information," says Dr
Jane.The small mutation (or change) in the milder virus which caused it to
become highly virulent occurred in a crucial section of the genetic
material of the virus. This section of viral DNA codes for a protein called
the 'F protein'.
It is the F protein that controls how the virus accesses different tissues
of the bird. Mild, low-virulent viruses only access superficial tissues,
for example the lining of airways. Highly-virulent viruses, however, can
infect all tissue layers, and can also infect the brain, leading to large
numbers of bird deaths.
Newcastle disease viruses are present in most countries including
Australia, but aside from the NSW outbreaks early this year and late last
year, serious disease-causing strains have not occurred in the country
since 1932.
Australian scientists and industry have been aware of mild Newcastle
disease strains circulating in Australian poultry, without causing
significant disease, for over 30 years.
Research will continue into the Newcastle disease virus, particularly into
better and faster techniques for diagnosis, and into the propensity of the
virus to change, says Dr Daniels.
"It is important to determine whether this change was associated with one
strain of virus found in the Central Coast area, or whether strains present
in other areas could also change and become virulent. One of the ways of
doing this is to examine strains of the virus found in other parts of
Australia and compare them with the Central Coast strain that mutated and
became virulent," says Dr Daniels.
