NSW Health has alerted Sydneysiders to watch out for measles symptoms after 2 people returned to Australia from Bali infected with the disease.

A Sydney resident and a Brisbane resident were on Virgin Airlines flights from Denpasar, Bali, to Sydney on 2 days last week. The Sydney resident also spent time at a pharmacy, medical centre and hospital in Auburn last week.

[For details of their whereabouts and flights when infectious, see full report at URL above.]

This is the 2nd measles warning NSW Health has issued this week and the 4th this year [2017].

The total number of measles cases in NSW now stands at 8 for 2017. All NSW residents contracted the disease overseas.

Sydney residents should be mindful of symptoms, particularly if they have not been vaccinated and have spent time in the places frequented by the infected people.

Symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.

NSW Health communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard said it was important to be vaccinated against measles, not only to protect yourself but to protect others through "herd immunity."

"The risk of contracting measles is higher in certain overseas countries, and vaccination is your best protection against this disease, so it's important to seek advice from your doctor on the appropriate vaccinations to have ahead of overseas trips," Dr Sheppeard said.

"The greater the number of people vaccinated, the greater the herd immunity, which helps to protect vulnerable people, such as infants under 12 months who are too young to have the measles vaccination.

"Measles is highly infectious and is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. If you or a family member experiences symptoms, it's important to go to your GP as soon as possible, as measles can have serious complications, particularly for young children."

Measles vaccine MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] has been freely available for many years for adults and children. Two doses of the vaccine are required for maximum protection for anyone born in and after 1966.

Health chiefs are warning shoppers they may have been exposed to measles after an infectious Big W employee worked for 4 days in a western suburbs store.

Visitors to the chain store in the Werribee Plaza should be on the lookout for signs of the viral disease, which begins like the common cold before a characteristic measles rash breaks out.

Employees of the store have been informed, but Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton fears more people may have been exposed via contact with the casual worker who was on duty last weekend.

Dr Sutton said the individual worked for 4 consecutive days during the infectious period: Fri 3 Mar 2017 from 8pm to midnight, Sat 4 Mar 2017 from 5 to 9pm, Sun 5 Mar 2017 from 3 to 6pm and Mon 6 Mar 2017 between 6 and 9pm. The employee had not yet been diagnosed with measles during this period.

Measles cases have plummeted in recent years because of an effective immunisation program, but babies who are too young to get the jabs, those who have a compromised immune systems or an incomplete vaccination history are at risk when outbreaks occur.

"This individual did not require hospitalisation and is now recovering," Dr Sutton said.

"It is thought a recent visit to Bali is where the illness was contracted, but the symptoms were not apparent until well after their return."

Health authorities last week warned about the risk of contracting measles after 2 people returned from Bali with the disease within 2 days of each other [see report above].

"We are concerned that more people may have been infected through contact with this individual in the community," Dr Sutton said in a statement.

He reiterated the importance of immunising children because of this new risk of the highly contagious infection coming from overseas where it was more prevalent.

Measles has an incubation period of up to 18 days so people can remain infectious for many days after coming into contact with it.

Anyone with suspected symptoms of measles should ring their doctor or hospital ahead of their arrival so they can give them treatment without the risk of infecting other patients.

[3] Guinea
Date: Fri 10 Mar 2017

http://reliefweb.int/report/guinea/guinea-measles-outbreak-continues-spread


More than 2100 children have been infected with measles in Guinea since January [2017]. The Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of measles on 8 Feb 2017. The outbreak is now affecting 17 health prefectures in Guinea. N'Zérékoré, in the southeastern forest region, is the most affected prefecture, with 675 cases reported between 1 Jan and 8 Mar 2017.

"We are admitting new children every day," said Doctor Karim Assani, a pediatrician at the N'Zérékoré Regional Hospital working with ALIMA. "Many of them are severe cases, suffering from complications."

ALIMA has been supporting the N'Zérékoré Regional Hospital to take charge of severe cases, free of charge. The children are treated in one of 2 isolation tents that ALIMA set up on hospital grounds.

ALIMA is also supplying health clinics in the area with treatment kits for the management of simple cases, and supporting health centers in the district to monitor the evolution of the outbreak, as well as the referral of complicated cases to the hospital. So far, 643 children with simple measles have been supported by ALIMA in health clinics within the prefecture.

[An] 18-month-old is just one child who has been received by the ALIMA team. Doctors say he was admitted to the emergency room in "very critical" condition, with advanced measles and suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

"My child was very sick," said his mother. "He was no longer eating, and I was very worried, thinking he was going to die. I brought him to the hospital, and now my child is almost cured," she said. "He smiles at me, and soon we will be discharged."

Since the declaration of the outbreak, ALIMA has treated 53 complicated measles cases. Doctor Assani said medical teams successfully treated 94 percent of children who were admitted to the hospital. Complicated measles cases can have a mortality rate of up to 15 percent without proper care.

Measles is a highly-contagious virus that affects the respiratory system and mainly affects children under the age of 5, and unvaccinated pregnant women. It can be spread by coughing and sneezing, and has a number of symptoms, including the characteristic rash, fever and red eyes.

If left untreated, the virus can lead to difficulties breathing, dehydration and vision problems. The most severe cases are often a result of other complications, such as malnutrition.

"It is important that people follow national measles immunization programs to prevent this deadly and highly contagious disease," Doctor Assani said, deploring the fact that measles continues to kill, even though there is an effective vaccine.

Measles is not new to Guinea, but unfortunately, in the past few years, the routine vaccination rate for measles has been low, as the Ebola epidemic weakened the health system and made some people lose confidence in health structures. In many rural villages, the vaccines are not easily accessible, and access to free health care isn't always granted.

Community health agents say they continue to inform people about measles and are urging parents not only to vaccinate their kids, but also to bring their children to the nearest health clinic at the 1st sign of measles.

On 12 Mar 2017, ALIMA will launch a mass vaccination campaign, alongside national health authorities, in N'Zérékoré to protect some 140 000 children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years against measles.

ALIMA has been supporting the pediatric ward and emergency room at the N'zerekore Regional Hospital, in southeastern Guinea, since July 2015. In 2016, ALIMA teams admitted more than 4600 patients. 579 children were treated for malnutrition.

ALIMA also provides free medical care and psychosocial support to 114 Ebola survivors living in and around N'zerekore. During the Ebola outbreak, ALIMA ran a 40-bed treatment center, which most recently admitted 13 patients during the last flare-up of the virus in March 2016

Thousands of Sudanese displaced people and South Sudanese refugees have been hit by diseases, including measles and acute watery diarrhoea, in North Darfur's El-Lait county, which is located near the border with East Darfur state.

The area recently received around 6000 displaced persons who fled a tribal conflict in El Nair area of East Darfur. The affected areas also host several thousand South Sudanese refugees from Bahr el Ghazal region.

Speaking to the Sudan Tribune on condition of anonymity, a Sudanese official from the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) confirmed the outbreak of measles and diarrhoea in Futaha and Dalil Babikir areas of El-Lait.

"The number of IDPs has reached more than 6000 people, in addition to 19 300 South Sudanese refugees, according to the latest HAC statistics," he said.

Also, he disclosed that the Sudanese authorities have authorized aid groups to reach the affected areas to assess humanitarian needs, while United Nations agencies plan to visit the areas on Tue [14 Mar 2017].

[Since the beginning of 2017, nearly 32 000 South Sudanese refugees are estimated to have arrived in Sudan, bringing the total South Sudanese refugees caseload to 332 885. Initial reports of the new arrivals in 2017 show that 90% of the arrivals are women and children (Reliefweb). In such a situation with a lack of strong health infrastructure and clean water facilitates, the rapid spread of infectious agents, including measles and acute watery diarrhea can be especially severe in children and old people.

Acute watery diarrhea, suspected to be caused by cholera, appeared in Sudan about 6 months ago in 2016 and continues to claim lives. The spread of watery diarrhoea has been attributed to contaminated food. A lack of commitment to health requirements in places selling food has been blamed. Hundreds of people suffering from watery diarrhea have been reported by the Sudanese Health Ministry.

Acute watery diarrhoea may last several hours or days. This condition is most commonly seen with traveller's diarrhoea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) or parasite-induced diarrhoea from giardia. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. It can kill within hours if left untreated.

Diarrhoeal infections are spread through contaminated food or drinking water or person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene. The spread can be prevented through early detection and confirmation of cases followed by an appropriate response. - Mod LK
