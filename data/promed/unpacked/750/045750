Current situation
The ongoing polio epidemic (total 131 cases) has spread outside the
capital Mogadishu. Somalia is the only country in the world with a
geographically expanding polio outbreak. With recent confirmation of
cases outside Mogadishu, including in the north of the country, the
risk remains of continued spread of wild poliovirus in Somalia, and
potential for spread to neighboring countries. Polio immunization
campaigns are planned for January and February [2006], aiming to
reach each time the country's 1.6 million children under 5 years of age.
Background
Somalia, a country plagued by ongoing conflict, insecurity, the lack
of a health infrastructure and low rates of population immunity, is
at the top of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative's list of acute
challenges. Recognizing the threat of poliovirus importations due to
polio outbreaks in nearby Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen, Somalia had
previously conducted 3 [National Immunization Days] NIDs before the
1st polio case of the outbreak in July 2005. These preventive
campaigns have been instrumental in limiting the spread of the virus
following importation.
Response
5 National Immunization Days (NID) have been conducted since the
start of the outbreak and have limited the geographic spread of the
virus. 4 of these campaigns used the powerful new monovalent oral
polio vaccine.
A review of management and operations in the country was conducted in
November [2005] in order to guide action and limit the outbreak. To
overcome the constant constraints of insecurity and inaccessibility,
WHO and UNICEF work in close collaboration with communities and local
officials on the polio eradication effort. The program employs 198
national and 10 international staff. During immunization campaigns,
additional community members are recruited to assist in vaccination,
logistics, social mobilization and security.
With sufficient funding, additional immunization activities will be
conducted in early 2006, and the outbreak could be stopped by the end
of the 1st quarter [31 Mar 2006].

now considered under control. The date of onset of the last reported
case was 17 Nov 2005.

Outbreak of polio in Indonesia (Updated 09 January 2005 [?9 Jan 2006])
-----------------------------------------------
11 new VDPV (Vaccine Derived Poliomyelitis) cases were reported from
Madura Island, East Java province. This brings the total number of
polio cases to 342 (including 45 type 1 VDPV, under investigation,
from Madura Island in East Java province). A total of 10 provinces
and 43 districts are affected.
In addition to the 2 emergency vaccination campaigns (OPV Mop-ups
rounds conducted on 31 May and 28 Jun 2005 in West Java, Banten and
Jakarta provinces), 3 rounds of National Immunization Days (NIDs)
were held on 30 Aug, 27 Sep and 30 Nov 2005. Over 24 million children
less than 5 years of age were targeted throughout the country.
Prior to this outbreak (caused by an importation of type 1 wild
poliovirus), Indonesia had been polio free since 1995.

[According to the polio eradication website case report listing, as
of 3 Jan 2006, the date of onset of the most recent confirmed case in
Indonesia is 25 Nov 2006. The above reports on cases in Madura Island
relate to Vaccine Derived Poliomyelitis (VDPV) cases, further
suggesting that there is continued circulation of a VDPV type 1
strain on Madura Island. In ProMED-mail posting Poliomyelitis -
Indonesia (19): RFI 20050930.2864 on 30 Sep 2005, there was mention
of 20 cases of VDPV type 1 in Madura Island; the above report now
mentions 45 cases.
This is now the 8th documented occurrence of paralytic polio
associated with circulation of a vaccine-derived virus (VDPV) with
reversion to neurovirulence. Prior instances were in the USA
(type-1), Madagascar (type-2), Egypt (type-2), the Philippines
(type-1), the Dominican Republic and Haiti (type-1) (see referenced
ProMED-mail articles below) and China (type-1) (see ref. 6 below).
This phenomenon has now occurred (or better stated, "been
documented") in 4 different regions of the world: the Middle East
(Egypt and Israel), the Americas (Hispaniola, i.e. Haiti & the
Dominican Republic, the USA), the Western Pacific (Philippines, China
and now Indonesia), and Africa (Madagascar). In 2 of the regions, the
Americas and the Western Pacific, circulation of the wild poliovirus
had been interrupted (the last reported case of wild
poliovirus-associated disease in the Americas was in 1991, in the USA
in 1979, in the Philippines in 1993, China in 1994 and in Indonesia
in 1995). In Madagascar, the last documented case of wild poliovirus
circulation was in 1997. In all 7 prior cases, this occurred in
pockets of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals (we do
not have this information about the current case(s) in Indonesia, but
one might assume this is the case). There was also a case report of a
VDPV type-1 paralytic case in Russia (see ref 1) in 1999.
In the absence of total interruption of wild poliovirus circulation
worldwide, there is still a need for intensified vaccination efforts.
The risk of disease is still present, especially in today's
environment with extensive world travel. The occurrence of VDPV in
association with clinical disease is very disturbing, as it adds
another factor to the risk/benefit equation of vaccination
recommendations. As mentioned in an earlier comment, a cost-efficacy
analysis of switching to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in
countries that have interrupted wild virus circulation suggests that
they cannot afford it. Significantly, a switch to IPV would remove
the advantage of flooding the environment with the vaccine virus (the
attenuated very-low-neurovirulence virus) to further interrupt
transmission of wild poliovirus if introduced, as well as to
"vaccinate" individuals who may not have directly taken the vaccine themselves.
An additional question to ask here is whether the VDPV type-1
identified in circulation on Madura Island is associated with the
vaccine virus used in the monovalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) used
for interruption of transmission of the wild poliovirus circulation
in Indonesia, or if it is one associated with the trivalent OPV in
use for routine vaccination activities. More information on this
situation in Madura Island would be very much appreciated.
