KSM Maccabi Research and Innovation Center publishes insights from real-time monitoring of Corona virus vaccination data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccinated members sample, age group 60+ review
Given the great interest for data on the impact of Corona virus vaccine, Maccabi Health Services Research Center -- KSM, in collaboration with KI Institute, analyzed the data of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalizations among the 1st approximately 50 000 vaccine recipients (vaccinated between [19-24 Dec 2020]), ages 60+ [older than 60 years old].

Our current work represents raw data without implementing statistical methods (except a moving average), allowing decision makers, researchers and the public to form initial impressions related to the Corona virus vaccine efficacy. We will be regularly updating the data on our website, as well as publishing a more in-depth statistical analysis in professional journals.

Sample group
The analysis was performed on a sample group of 50 777 Maccabi members over the age of 60, who were vaccinated during the week of [19-24 Dec 2020] (when the moving average is 7 days -- 3 days before and 3 days after vaccination).

Graph description [see graph at the source URL above]
Green graph -- represents the daily amount of newly infected vaccinated members out of the sample group (50 777 members aged 60+ who had been vaccinated between [19-24 Dec 2020]).

Yellow graph -- represents the daily amount of newly vaccinated hospitalized members out of the sample group (50 777 members aged 60+ who had been vaccinated between [19-24 Dec 2020]).

Blue graph -- added as a reference, pointing to the rate of infection in the general population in the corresponding period, starting [22 Dec 2020], using a 7-day moving average (3 days before, up to 3 days after each date). The graph describes the number of newly verified Corona virus infections within 480 000 Maccabi members over the age of 60 (adjusted to the same sample size of 50 777). Note that the population in this graph includes the entire population of Maccabi over the age of 60, and not solely members who had not been vaccinated.

Insights on the 23rd day of vaccination (2 days after receiving the 2nd dose)
- Significant decrease, within the vaccinated members aged 60+, reaching a decrease peak of approximately 60% of the number of newly verified.
- Decrease of slightly more than 60% in the number of new hospitalized patients (although the sample here is smaller).
- Similar graphs have been published in the professional press analyzing data, using other epidemiological methods, which indicate a similar trend.

We will continue to issue similar follow-up graphs, on larger sample groups, and over longer periods of time. Our goal is to release such updates in the upcoming weeks, on a weekly basis.

Our opinion is that at this level of efficiency, there should be no exemption from performing Corona tests, isolation, or the enablement of crowded gatherings until additional convincing data is obtained. And of course continue to wear masks and keep social distancing, as recommended.

[The graph available at the source URL above begins on 22 Dec 2020 and continues through 10 Jan 2021 (if I interpreted it correctly). The drop off in newly confirmed cases in the vaccinated group begins at approximately 7 days post receipt of the 2nd dose of vaccine (presumably the 2nd dose).

In an earlier media report (12 Jan 2021) they showed an impact beginning 13 days after receipt of the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine (https://www.mako.co.il/news-lifestyle/2021_q1/Article-0fe0fbe7787f671027.htm in Hebrew -- good machine translation). A more detailed assessment was in a Nature report available in COVID-19 update (30): vaccination impact, immune escape, variant, WHO, global 20210123.8129255 showing a 33% drop off in newly confirmed cases starting day 13 following receipt of the 1st dose.

The key will be following these curves out further following the 2nd dose received, as well as increasing the sample size followed following the 1st dose. We look forward to reading a peer reviewed article on this study. - Mod.MPP]

Twins With COVID help scientists untangle the disease's genetic roots
---------------------------------------------------------------------
After 35 years of sharing everything from a love for jazz music to tubes of lip gloss, twins [KiS] and [KeS] assumed that when they became sick with COVID-19 their experiences would be as identical as their DNA.

The virus had different plans. Early last spring [2020], the sisters from Rochester, Michigan, checked themselves into the hospital with fevers and shortness of breath. While [KeS] was discharged after less than a week, her sister ended up in intensive care. [KiS] spent almost a month in critical condition, breathing through tubes and dipping in and out of shock. Weeks after [KeS] had returned to their shared home, [KiS] was still relearning how to speak, walk, and chew and swallow solid food she could barely taste. Nearly a year later, the sisters are bedeviled by the bizarrely divergent paths their illnesses took. "I want to know," [KeS] said, "why did she have COVID worse than me?"

Since the new coronavirus 1st shuddered into view, questions like the one posed by [KeS] have spurred scientific projects around the globe. Among the [more than] 94 million infections documented since the start of the outbreak, no 2 have truly been alike, even for people who share a genetic code.

Identical twins offer researchers a ready-made experiment to untangle the contributions of nature and nurture in driving disease. With the help of twin registries in the United States, Australia, Europe, and elsewhere, researchers are confirming that genetics can affect which symptoms COVID-19 patients experience. These studies have also underscored the importance of the environment and pure chance: Even between identical twins, immune systems can look vastly different -- and continue to grow apart over the course of a lifetime.

Dr Mishita Goel, one of the doctors who treated the twins [KeS] and [KiS] last spring [2020], said she was surprised to see the virus chart such different medical trajectories in each sister. "We were amazed," said Dr Goel, who published a case study on the twins last summer. Both sisters were carrying excess weight and had a history of metabolic conditions. If anything, [KeS], who has asthma and a more severe case of diabetes, might have had a slightly higher risk of entering intensive care, Dr Goel said. But it was [KiS] who fared worse.

At least some of the factors that influence the severity of a COVID case are written into the genome. Recent studies suggest that people with type O blood, for example, might be at a slightly lower risk of becoming seriously sick with the coronavirus (though experts have cautioned against overinterpreting these types of findings). Other papers have homed in on genes that affect how cells sound the alarm about viruses or raise their defenses to ward off invaders. Still, other genetic tweaks may make it easier for the coronavirus to break into cells. Some might even trigger an overzealous immune response to infection that damages healthy tissues alongside the sick ones -- a common feature among the worst COVID-19 cases.

There even seems to be a measurable genetic influence on whether people experience symptoms like fever, fatigue, and delirium when stricken with the coronavirus, said Tim Spector, an epidemiologist and the director of the TwinsUK registry based at St Thomas' Hospital in London. Last year [2020], he and his colleagues developed a symptom tracking app to record how people dealt with the disease. In a study that has not yet been published in a scientific journal, they reported that genetic factors might account for up to 50 percent of the differences between COVID-19 symptoms. One gene that they are investigating codes for a molecule called ACE2, which the coronavirus docks onto before entering cells. "It would be wrong to think we can answer this if we just crack the genes," Dr Spector said. Still, in at least some respects, the bodies of identical twins are "genetically programmed to be similar."

Twins [KB] and [KM], 28, of Toledo, Ohio, both fell ill shortly after Thanksgiving [26 Nov 2020]. Their sicknesses were staggered by about a week, hitting [KM] first. But "day for day, it was exactly the same," [KB] said. For both sisters, COVID began with an hourlong fever of 99.5 deg F [37.5 deg C], followed by days of back pain and a strange buzzing sensation. The 8th day crescendoed with an agonizing headache. Then, like clockwork, the symptoms disappeared. The virus's encore didn't faze the twins. "Honestly, it was kind of nice for her," [KM] said of her sister. "She got to see exactly what would happen to her."

What [KB] and [KM] experienced wasn't the norm. Many of the conditions that can raise a person's risk for severe COVID -- excess weight, heart disease, diabetes, smoking -- are highly influenced by environment and behavior, not just genetics. A person's history of fighting off other coronaviruses, like those that lead to common colds, might also affect their likelihood of developing a serious case of COVID.

Some researchers have also floated the idea that the amount of coronavirus a person takes in may have an impact on the severity of disease, a trend that has been documented with other infections. "It's the difference between having your immune system being actually able to squash the infection, or having a much harder time fighting it if all your cells become infected at the same time," said Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside.

[MR], 29, says he wonders if he sniffed up more of the virus than his twin brother, [SR], did this summer [2020], in the days after they gathered with their family for the Fourth of July. Both brothers began experiencing symptoms shortly after the celebrations ended, around the time [SR] headed back to his home in Arlington, Virginia. The virus saddled [SR] with a scratchy throat and a headache -- a "light, cold-like" illness, he said. A few days later, [MR], who was living at home with his parents, came down with much more severe symptoms: a sore throat, chills, shortness of breath, and fatigue that relegated him to his bed for an entire day. About 2 weeks passed before he could smell or taste the cinnamon-dusted popcorn he regularly snacks on. The twins' parents came down with bad COVID symptoms as well, so [MR] had to isolate with 2 other infected adults. Hunkering together in the same house may have exposed him to a larger dose of the virus, the brothers said. But, they added, that's just a guess.

For some twin pairs, there are no obvious explanations for their differing disease course. [MH] and [VH], 17-year-old identical twins in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, have spent their entire lives near each other, bonding over their tastes for In-N-Out Burger and Taylor Swift. "We share drinks, we hang out in each other's rooms, we have the same friends," Vivian said. But she and her sister never seem to catch the same sicknesses. When the sisters both fell ill from COVID the week after attending a Halloween party, their symptoms forked: [MH] lost her sense of taste and smell, neither of which have returned in the 2 months since, while [VH] battled a debilitating flulike illness.

Identical twins start as a single embryo that splits in 2, creating carbon-copy babies-to-be. But from that time on, their developmental trajectories diverge, as their DNA accumulates small and often subtle, but unique, typos. A paper published this month in Nature Genetics reported that identical twins differ by an average of 5.2 early and naturally occurring developmental mutations. Through childhood and adolescence, the biological chasm between twins deepens further as distinct microbes colonize their guts, or subtle shifts in the environment squish or stretch parts of their genomes, making certain segments harder or easier to read. All of these changes and more can influence how a person responds to an infection, said Anita Pepper, a developmental biologist and a vice president at The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia.

Even the DNA that cells start with is not set in stone. Certain immune cells called B cells and T cells are, in some ways, especially impervious to the genes they start with. Part of the job of these cells is to manufacture proteins, such as antibodies, that recognize pathogens that might do the body harm. The more of these suspicious shapes the cells and antibodies can find, the better a person can avert illness. But it wouldn't make sense to encode a separate gene for every possible iteration of an antibody -- there are just too many. Instead, immune cells build their defensive repertoires through a process called recombination, which involves mixing and matching segments of DNA to create billions, trillions, even quadrillions of unique genetic stretches.

Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington and the identical twin sister of [AP], compared the process to cobbling together words on a Scrabble board -- a way to generate a diverse vocabulary without hauling a dictionary from place to place. "Once those cells go out into the body, the hope is that you've created enough diversity that you can recognize everything," Dr Pepper said. "It's brilliant." The randomness of these processes makes them just about impossible to replicate from person to person -- even if all of the Scrabble tiles they start with are the same.

This immune malleability is an advantage because it can equip the body to fend off even pathogens it has never seen before, said Mark Davis, an immunologist at Stanford University who has used his institution's twin registry to conduct research on the genetics of the immune system. Twins may start with the same genetic ingredients, Dr Davis said, but then "they roll the dice."

Still other researchers have turned to twins to study another effect of the pandemic: a global fraying in psychological well-being. Emanuela Medda, a researcher with the Italian Twin Registry, is leading an effort to track stress, anxiety, and depression among thousands of twins scattered countrywide. Continents away, John Hopper, an epidemiologist and director of Twins Research Australia, has undertaken a similar project monitoring how families are navigating a world altered by the coronavirus. The pandemic has created its fair share of challenges, Dr Hopper said. But early findings, collected via a series of surveys, offer a glimmer of hope: Amid the chaos, some people feel that hardship has brought them closer to their loved ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Here we report a preliminary genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.28 lineage circulating in the Brazilian Amazon region and their evolutionary relationship with emerging and potential emerging SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian variants harboring mutations in the RBD [receptor-binding domain] of Spike (S) protein.

Phylogenetic analysis of 69 B.1.1.28 sequences isolated in the Amazonas state revealed the existence of 2 major clades that have evolved locally without unusual mutations in the S protein from April to November 2020.

The B.1.1.28 viruses harboring mutations S:K417N, S:E484K, and S:N501Y, recently detected in Japanese travelers returning from Amazonas, branched within one of the Amazonian B.1.1.28 clades here identified, suggesting that these sequences could be representatives of a novel (unreported) emerging Brazilian clade, here designated B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y).

Our analysis also confirms that the putative novel clade B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y) detected in Japanese travelers did not evolve from the clade B.1.1.28(E484K) recently detected in Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian states, but both variants arose independently during the evolution of the B.1.1.28 lineage.

Results [excerpts]
These findings support that the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.28 strains detected in Japanese travelers returning from the Brazilian Amazon region probably evolved from a viral lineage that circulates in the Amazonas state since April 2020, and might be representatives of a potentially new emerging Brazilian lineage, here designated as B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y).

Local B.1.1.28 Amazonian lineages seem to have evolved at a constant rate between April and November 2020 and none of the sequences here obtained displayed an unusually high number of mutations in the Spike or in any other genomic region.

These findings support that the fast mutation rate detected in the B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y) variant is a recent phenomenon that probably took place between December 2020-January 2021.

Aiming to detect the circulation of this lineage among the Amazonian population, we are currently conducting a genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2 recently infected individuals in Amazonas. Our preliminary analysis also confirms that the emerging Brazilian lineages B.1.1.28(E484K) and B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y) arose independently during the diversification of the B.1.1.28 lineage in Brazil.

The concurrent emergence of different viral B.1.1 lineages carrying mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y in the RBD of the Spike protein in different countries around the world during the 2nd half of 2020 suggests convergent selective changes in SARS-CoV-2 evolution due to similar evolutionary pressure during the process of infection of millions of people.

If these mutations confer some selective advantage for the viral transmissibility we should expect an increasing frequency of those viral lineages in Brazil and around the world in the following months.

[It is interesting that the investigators propose that the mutations detected by the Japanese Ministry of Health in 4 Japanese travelers returning from Brazil, characterized by genetic changes in the emerging Brazilian lineage B.1.1.28(E484K) and B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y), arose independently during the diversification of the B.1.1.28 lineage in Brazil. It is hypothesized that the fast mutation rate detected in the B.1.1.28(K417N/E484K/N501Y) variant is a recent phenomenon that probably took place between December 2020-January 2021. Biological implications are not yet known, but if strains in this lineage are transmitted more efficiently, they are expected to increase rapidly in the population not only in Brazil but globally. - Mod.LK]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The Japanese government initiated the "Go To Travel" campaign on [22 Jul 2020], offering deep discounts on hotel charges and issuing coupons to be used for any consumption at travel destinations in Japan. In the present study, we aimed to describe the possible epidemiological impact of the tourism campaign on increasing travel-associated cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country. We compared the incidence rates of travel-associated and tourism-related cases prior to and during the campaign. The incidence of travel-associated COVID-19 cases during the tourism campaign was approximately 3 times greater than the control period [22 Jun 2020] to [21 Jul 2020] and approximately 1.5 times greater than the control period of [15 to 19 Jul 2020]. The incidence owing to tourism was approximately 8 times and 2-3 times greater than the control periods of [22 Jun 2020] to [21 Jul 2020] and [15 to 19 Jul 2020], respectively. Although the 2nd epidemic wave in Japan had begun to decline by mid-August [2020], enhanced domestic tourism may have contributed to increasing travel-associated COVID-19 cases during [22 to 26 Jul 2020], the early stage of the "Go To Travel" campaign.

1. Introduction
As of [1 Nov 2020], Japan had recorded a total of 99 959 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including 1765 deaths [1]. Owing to widespread domestic transmission, a state of emergency was declared on [7 Apr 2020] in 7 prefectures (Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo, and Fukuoka); this was expanded to all 47 prefectures on [16 Apr 2020]. The incidence of COVID-19 subsequently decreased over time [2], and the state of emergency was gradually lifted on [14 May 2020], and had been lifted in all prefectures by 25 May 2020. Following the end of the 1st wave, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases was seen from late June [2020] in urban prefectures, most notably in Tokyo and Osaka; the reported number of confirmed cases reached 1595 cases per day on [7 Aug 2020]. In response, local prefectural governments implemented focused interventions to reduce disease transmission in high-risk settings, including nightclubs, bars, and restaurants. The incidence of COVID-19 peaked between late July and early August [2020] in many prefectures; the prevalence of hospital admissions peaked on [10 Aug 2020] with 13 724 cases and then declined. Presently, Japan is facing a 3rd epidemic wave, with a marked resurgence in the number of COVID-19 infections beginning in early October 2020 [1].

The impact of COVID-19 has affected various industrial and social sectors, most notably the tourism sector, including hotels, lodging, and transportation. The Japan Tourism Agency regularly conducts the Overnight Travel Statistics Survey [3] and has estimated that the relative number of hotel guests staying in business hotels, resort hotels, city hotels, and ryokan (a classical Japanese style lodging) from March to June in 2020 decreased by 48.9-84.9% compared with the same period in 2019. Moreover, the total number of foreign visitors to Japan was 32 million in 2019, but the cumulative count by October 2020 was only 4 million [4]. As an economic countermeasure to rescue adversely affected sectors by boosting consumer activities, the Japanese government initiated the "Go To Travel" campaign on [22 Jul 2020], slightly ahead of its originally scheduled start date (early August 2020). [22 Jul 2020] was the day before the 4-day holiday from [23 to 26 Jul 2020]. The campaign offered drastic discounts on hotel charges and issued coupons that acted as a "cash back" system and that could be used for any type of consumption at travel destinations, thereby increasing consumer demand with the aim of stimulating economic activity at local levels [5]. Similarly, other countries have promoted domestic travel in various ways [6].

[2. Methods: available at the source URL above]

3. Results
A total of 3978 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported from [1 May 2020] to [31 Aug 2020] in 24 prefectures of Japan. Male individuals accounted for 57.3% of cases (2211 cases); the sex was unknown for 119 cases. The average patient age was 42.6 years. The presence of symptoms upon diagnosis was known for 3060 patients (76.9% of the total), involving 2150 mild cases (70.3% of cases with known symptoms) and 891 asymptomatic cases (29.1%).

Of the 3978 cases, 817 (20.1%) had a travel history across prefectural borders or a contact history with another person who crossed prefectural borders; we defined these as travel-associated cases. The average age of travel-associated cases was 36.2 years old, and that of the remaining cases was 44.2 years old (Figure 1A). The month of reporting for all confirmed cases is shown in Figure 1B, dominated by July [2020] with 2074 cases (52.7%), followed by August [2020] with 1597 cases (40.5%). There were 482 travel-associated cases (23.2%) in July and 289 cases (18.1%) in August 2020

Focusing on the purpose of travel, we identified that tourism increased during the "Go To Travel" campaign.

4. Discussion
In the present study, we analyzed surveillance-based datasets containing information of travel-associated cases of COVID-19 infection, prior to and during the "Go To Travel" campaign, and we compared the incidence rate of travel-associated cases and those travelling for tourism purposes. The incidence of travel-associated cases during the campaign appeared to be approximately 3 times greater than that during control period 1a (from [22 Jun 2020] to [21 Jul 2020]) and approximately 1.5 times greater than the incidence during control period 1b (from [15 to 19 Jul 2020]). Notably, the incidence related to tourism was approximately 8 times greater than that during control period 1a and 2-3 times greater than the incidence during control period 1b. Although the 2nd epidemic wave in Japan had begun to decline by mid-August [2020], the number of travel-associated cases increased during the "Go To Travel" campaign.

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that the number of travel-associated COVID-19 cases that involved crossing of prefectural borders increased during the "Go To Travel" campaign. For both control periods 1a and 1b, and also for both datasets with known dates of illness onset and COVID-19 confirmation, we showed that the IRR [incident rate ratio] clearly exceeded a value of 1. In particular, the present study findings demonstrated that travel-associated cases related to tourism increased markedly in terms of proportion and incidence during the campaign. Enhanced domestic tourism may have contributed to increasing the number of travel-associated cases of COVID-19 in Japan, at least during Period 2, the early part of the "Go To Travel" campaign.

Our descriptive analysis was too simplified to be able to conclusively determine a causal relationship between the tourism campaign and COVID-19 incidence in Japan. In particular, it must be acknowledged that the "Go To Travel" campaign started during a 4-day holiday period. Thus, the enhanced number of tourists traveling throughout the country cannot be attributed solely to the campaign. Another issue to be noted is that the severity of the epidemic was increasing in urban prefectures during the periods examined, such as in Tokyo and Osaka, which were not included in our analysis [14,15] In the meantime, a policy working paper was published, suggesting that the campaign increased the number of hotel guests without intensifying the spread of infection [17]. We will also analyze data from another round of the "Go To Travel" campaign that began on [1 Oct 2020]. During the summer of 2020, a campaign called "Eat Out to Help Out" was conducted in the United Kingdom with the aim of supporting the food service industry [18]. That campaign was not intended to promote domestic travel, but it has been reported that the campaign may have affected local transmission in the United Kingdom [19].

Although the policy decision to conduct the "Go To Travel" campaign was made on the basis of decreased epidemic activity and the expected positive impact of the campaign on socioeconomic activities, it is natural that enhancing human mobility across wider geographic areas would facilitate additional contact and thus increase the spatiotemporal spread of disease [20,21]. When the state of emergency was lifted in Japan around the middle of May (that is 21 May 2020 for Osaka and 25 May 2020 for Tokyo), the original plan was for the reduction in travel restrictions to begin in August [2020], and the campaign was originally intended to start during that month [22]. However, the campaign schedule was moved forward, even as cases were increasing in Tokyo and Osaka and the country was trying to regain control of the epidemic. Government policies have had to strike a balance between epidemic control and restoration of economic activities, and managing both was the justification for implementing the tourism campaign [23]. Thus, experts in infectious diseases and public health cooperated with the government, formulating guidelines for infection control in each sector and offering advice to maximally reduce infections via the use of precautionary behaviors (such as wearing masks, avoiding close contact in confined spaces, and hand hygiene). In fact, the campaign included guidance on preventive measures for both travelers and service providers [24]. Nevertheless, the present study findings indicated that these efforts were accompanied by increased travel-associated cases of COVID-19 infection.

[A very interesting study, the results of which are not surprising. With each major holiday period in many countries, increased domestic travel and family and friends gatherings have been associated with increases in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. (USA: Thanksgiving weekend and Christmas and New Year's; Europe: summer holiday times, Christmas and New Year's; the 1st major wave in Iran associated with pilgrimages to holy sites (Qom), and resurgence associated with holiday periods).

Early on in the pandemic (3 Apr 2020), there was a joint OpEd (Opinion) piece in the Telegraph on COVID-19 and economic and health security by Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO. They made an appeal to policy makers..."Our joint appeal to policymakers, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, is to recognise that protecting public health and putting people back to work go hand-in-hand."...A key summation was, "The course of the global health crisis and the fate of the global economy are inseparably intertwined. Fighting the pandemic is a necessity for the economy to rebound." (see COVID-19 update (86): global, economic health security, new countries, WHO 20200407.7193701). As seen in the past year, letting down one's guard on restrictions has been associated with increases in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. This study provides some preliminary data looking at increased domestic travel within a country. - Mod.MPP]

[Weekend reporting artifact is seen with a 42.8% drop in global reported cases since Thursday 21 Jan 2021, a 49.5% drop in reported deaths; at the country level, there was a 55.8% drop in reported cases by Argentina; a 52.7% drop by Brazil; a 46.3% drop by Germany; a 31.3% drop by the USA; and a 20.8% drop by the UK.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (135 336), the UK (30 004), and Brazil (28 346), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8649 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 23 Jan to late 24 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, UK, Brazil, Russia (21 127), France (18 436), India (12 921), Colombia (12 516), Indonesia (11 788), Portugal (11 721), Italy (11 628), Mexico (10 872), and Germany (10 051). A total of 47 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 47 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 22.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases have decreased to under 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 days hours - almost 350 000 less than Thursday (21 Jan 2021) -- and over 99.7 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.13 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports over the weekend especially but also over the past 2 weeks. There is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 6 countries reporting more than 650 cases in the past 24 hours. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
