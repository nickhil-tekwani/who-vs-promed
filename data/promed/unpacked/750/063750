On 24 Oct 2001, the French Ministry of Agriculture reported to OIE
that since December 1998, no rabies case associated with fox rabies has
been recorded in France. The "rabies free" status has been published in
the September-October 2001 OIE bulletin.
To maintain this status, France will now use a defensive strategy based
on preventive anti-rabies oral vaccination campaigns along "at risk"
borders, epidemiological surveillance and sanitary measures associated
with import control of domestic carnivores. An emergency stock of
oral vaccination baits is maintained.
This success is the result of a constant rabies control policy associated
with the use of efficient oral anti-rabies vaccines.

[ProMED does not usually report on disappearing diseases, but this
was submitted by an official source, & shows that it is possible to
eradicate rabies even in a non-island country. - Mod.TG/JW
