China warned of the threat of a massive avian flu outbreak among birds in
the country as it reported 2 new human cases of avian influenza, the
official Xinhua News Agency said on Saturday [25 Feb 2006].
Agriculture minister Du Qinglin said China culled 23 million fowl in 2005
as it sought to halt the spread of the disease. Of those, 163 000 were
found to have the H5N1 strain of bird flu, Xinhua cited the minister as
saying. Du said his ministry would stick to consistent epidemic monitoring,
diagnosing, and reporting, and strengthen poultry vaccinating and virus
testing. "In view of the current situation, the possibility of a massive
bird flu outbreak could not be ruled out," Du said, repeating a similar
warning issued earlier this week when he said a big outbreak could occur in
the spring. Chinese farmers raised about 15 billion poultry in 2005, or 21
per cent of the world's total, Du said.
Earlier on Saturday, Xinhua reported that 2 new human cases of bird flu had
been diagnosed in the east of the country. A Chinese girl in eastern
Zhejiang province and a woman farmer in neighbouring Anhui province were
currently in critical condition, Xinhua cited the Ministry of Health as
saying. The woman farmer, who was diagnosed on 11 Feb 2006 with symptoms of
fever and pneumonia, had come into contact with sick and dead poultry,
Xinhua said. The girl, a 9 year old from Anji County, had visited relatives
who kept poultry but it was not clear how she had been infected, Xinhua
said. China's Ministry of Health has reported the 2 new cases to the World
Health Organization, and to authorities in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and
other countries, Xinhua said. The latest cases brought the total number of
human cases of avian influenza in China to 14, Xinhua said. 8 of those have
died while 4 have recovered, it said.
China has reported more than 30 outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in
both poultry and wild birds in a dozen provinces in the past year. Bird flu
is highly contagious among poultry and can spread through an entire flock
in hours. It remains difficult for humans to catch but has killed more than
90 people worldwide since late 2003. So far most human victims of the virus
have had direct or indirect contact with infected birds, but there are
fears the virus will mutate into a strain easily passed among people,
causing a pandemic in which millions could die.
[The previous human cases of avian influenza occurred in the following 7
provinces and regions: Anhui, Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Liaoning,
and Sichuan. The 9 year old girl described above is the first human case to
be reported from the eastern province of Zhejiang. A map of the provinces

Two new human cases of bird flu detected in China
-------------------------------------------------
A 9 year old girl in east China's Zhejiang Province and a 26 year old woman
farmer in east China's Anhui Province were confirmed to be infected with
H5N1 bird flu, reported the Ministry of Health on Saturday.
The Zhejiang girl lives in Anji County. She showed symptoms of fever and
pneumonia on Feb 10 and has been admitted to hospital. She is now in a
critical condition, said a report released by the ministry. According to
investigation, the girl visited relatives twice in Guangde County of Anhui
Province before she fell ill. During her visits, chickens raised at her
relatives' homes got sick and some died. The exact source of her infection
is under further investigation, said the ministry. Her samples tested H5N1
positive by both the Zhejiang provincial center for disease control and
prevention (CDC) and China's national CDC.
The other new case in Anhui is from Yingshang County. The 26 year old woman
developed fever and pneumonia symptoms on Feb 11. The report says she is
also in a critical condition. This patient had contact with sick and dead
poultry, according to investigation. The local agricultural department has
isolated H5N1 virus strain from samples of dead chickens in Yingshang
County, said the ministry. The woman's samples tested H5N1 positive by both
the Anhui provincial CDC and the national CDC.
The 2 patients have been confirmed to be infected with bird flu in
accordance with the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) and
the Chinese official standards, said the ministry. Those having close
contacts with You and Wang have been put under medical observation by local
health authorities. So far, no abnormal symptoms have been reported. The
ministry has reported the new cases to WHO and the regions of Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan, as well as several countries.
These cases have brought the total number of human cases of bird flu in
China to 14. Previously, the country had reported 12 cases, 8 of whom have
died and 4 who have been discharged from hospital.
In Yingshang County of Anhui, inspection teams from the Ministry of
Agriculture and the provincial agricultural authorities found 13 chickens
died in Jitai Village on Feb 22. H5N1 virus were isolated from samples of 4
dead chickens by the national bird flu reference laboratory on Saturday.
The local government has culled more than 200 fowls in the area and
intensified prevention measures, according to sources with the Ministry of
Agriculture, which noted that the epidemic is now under control.
A total of 170 human cases of bird flu involving 92 deaths have been
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by Feb. 20, according to WHO.

5 people have been quarantined in Malaysia with suspected avian influenza
as chicken sales plunged 30 per cent following a new outbreak of the deadly
H5N1 virus, officials said on Saturday [25 Feb 2006]. Ramlee Rahmat,
director of the health ministry's disease control division, said 5 people
were admitted to hospital for observation late Friday [24 Feb 2006]. "5
people with symptoms -- high temperature and respiratory infection -- were
taken in for observation late Friday. The results will be known Sunday," he
told AFP.
Ramlee said the 5 -- 3 children and 2 adults -- were aged between 4 and 44
years. "They live some 300 metres from one of the outbreak areas," he said.
No human cases have so far been reported in Malaysia, which last reported
the H5N1 virus in a chicken in the northern state of Kelantan in 2004.
Lee Chong Meng, adviser to the Selangor and Federal Territory Poultry
Traders Association, told AFP that at a meeting 2 days ago, that chicken
dealers said sales had plunged 30 per cent in West Malaysia. Lee said
commercial farms in West Malaysia produce some 35 million chickens a month
for domestic demand and the usual daily consumption is 1.2 million
chickens. "Following the outbreak, people are avoiding chicken. There are
about 300 000 chickens in surplus supply daily now," he said. Lee said the
fall in demand was a concern to the country's poultry industry which
employs thousands of workers. "If the situation continues it will cause
heavy losses to commercial farm owners," he said.
On Monday, Malaysia confirmed its 1st outbreak of avian influenza in more
than a year after 40 free range chickens died in 4 villages near Kuala
Lumpur. An initial group of 10 people from the affected villages who were
hospitalised late Tuesday complaining of flu symptoms and respiratory
problems have all tested negative for the virus [see: Avian influenza,
