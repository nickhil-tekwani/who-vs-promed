Spain reports 5th human death from mad cow disease
--------------------------------------------------
The Spanish government late Friday [6 Mar 2009] confirmed the
country's 5th fatality from the human variant of mad cow disease, a
woman who died in the northern city of Santander in January [2009].

The health ministry said laboratory tests confirmed that the woman
had [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) as the human variant of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, is known.
"The appearance of sporadic cases of the disease does not indicate
new risks for the health of the public," it said in a statement.

The last death in Spain which was confirmed to have been due to the
brain-wasting disease took place in August 2008 in the northwestern
region of Castilla and Leon. Spain recorded its 1st human death from
mad cow disease in June 2005 when a 26-year-old woman succumbed to it
in Madrid.

More than 200 people around the world are suspected to have died,
most of them in Britain, from the human variant of the disease, which
was 1st described in 1996. Scientists believe the disease was caused
by using infected parts of cattle to make feed for other cattle.
Authorities believe eating meat from infected animals can trigger the
human variant of the fatal brain-wasting disease. The 27-member EU,
of which Spain is part, has banned high-risk materials such as spinal
cord from use in feed, and stricter labelling was also introduced.

Woman dies from mad cow disease in Spain
----------------------------------------
A Spaniard has died from the human form of mad cow disease, the 5th
such death in Spain since 2005, the Ministry of Health said in a
statement late Friday [6 Mar 2009]. The victim died in January 2009 in
the northern city of Santander, according to the statement, which did
not provide further details. The victim was a woman who was
hospitalized last fall [2008], according to Juan Jose Badiola,
director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease.

The ministry reiterated that there is no danger from eating meat in
Spain. "The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the
predictions that were made at the European level more than 9 years
ago," the Ministry statement said. 10 years can pass between eating
contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the
disease also called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob (vCJD) disease, health
officials say. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the 1st
cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, include
isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal
origin or with animal proteins, the Ministry said.

A total of 3 of Spain's 5 deaths from the disease were in the northern
province of Leon. The city of Santander is in the nearby Cantabria
province. Last September [2008], officials reported the death of a
woman from the human form of mad cow disease. Officials also said her
son had died earlier from the same disease. It was believed to have
been the 1st case in the world where 2 members of the same family have
died from the disease, Badiola told CNN at the time. The mother, in
her early 60s, died in August 2008. Her son, 41, died in February
2008, Badiola said. Badiola said the mother and son likely contracted
the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in
Spain in 2001. They had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which
included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they
may also have eaten animal brains. They were from a village in Leon
province.

The 3rd fatality in that province was a woman, 50, a local government
worker, who died in December 2007.

The 1st confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005,
when a young woman died near Madrid.

[Details of the nature of this woman's potential exposure to
BSE-contaminated meat are awaited.

As of February 2009 in addition to the 5 deaths in Spain, there have
been 165 vCJD deaths in the UK, 23 in France, 4 in the Republic of
Ireland, 3 in The Netherlands, 2 in Portugal, and single deaths in
Italy, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Japan
(<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm>. In addition, 2 cases in the
USA are thought to have been contracted elsewhere.
