The Public Health Ministry of Thailand has warned of a dengue fever
outbreak, after reports that 20 000 people have been stricken during
the past 6 months, 13 of them fatally. Elderly people and children
aged less than one year are most at risk of dengue-fever infection,
the ministry's permanent secretary, Dr Paijit Warachit, warned.

"People who have a high fever, fatigue or stomach-ache, or vomit or
cannot eat, should seek treatment," Paijit said. The continuing
seasonal rainfall this year [2011] has increased the number of
mosquitoes carrying the virus that causes dengue haemorrhagic fever.
Children below one year and elderly sufferers from chronic ailments,
such as diabetes and high blood pressure, may develop severe symptoms
after infection but are often unable to tell others of their illness.

According to Public Health Ministry records, from January [2011] to
June [2011], 23 324 people were infected with the dengue virus. Of
this number, 13 succumbed to the disease. The record also showed that
52 per cent of the total number of dengue cases were aged between 10
and 24 years. About 650 cases were children aged less than one year,
and 190 cases were aged over 65. _Aedes aegypti_, a common species of
mosquito, is the leading cause of this disease.

"We found that more than 80 per cent of mortality from dengue fever
during July and August [2011], the peak season for the disease, was
caused by this common household mosquito," Paijit said.

Clinical Professor Siripen Kalayanarooj of the Queen Sirikit National
Institute of Child Health said the number of dengue infections had
drastically increased among babies and the elderly in recent years.

"The dengue fever virus strikes children easily, as they have a low
level of immunity against it," she said, even though they get some
immunity from their mothers.

She said severe symptoms and mortality from dengue fever among
elderly people, especially those who have congenital disease, were
usually the result of a secondary infection. She suggested that people
who develop high fever for more than 2 days should undergo immediate
diagnosis and treatment at hospital.

Aspirin and ibuprofen are not recommended to reduce fever or to treat
the illness, as these 2 drugs could cause bleeding in the stomach,
leading to death.

[According to the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of
Epidemiology (BOE)'s report of the situation of dengue infection in

rate was 47.24 per 100 000 population, with a case fatality rate (CFR)
of 0.06 percent. Of these, 12 755 cases and no deaths were due to
dengue fever (DF), (http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=66 in

(DHF) (http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=26 in Thai), and
629 cases and 16 deaths were due to dengue shock syndrome (DSS)

[2] Cambodia

With more than 4600 patients hospitalised from dengue so far this
year [2011] and outbreaks in 7 provinces, the National Dengue Control
Programme (NDCP) is calling for heightened vigilance during the
remainder of the rainy season, when the mosquito-borne disease is most
prevalent.

Parents should immediately take children suffering from a high fever
to the nearest health centre or hospital for treatment, NDCP director
Dr Ngan Chantha said yesterday [20 Jul 2011], explaining that early
and appropriate treatment was critical for preventing dengue
haemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal.

According to the NDCP, 4626 patients, primarily children, were
hospitalised in the 1st 27 weeks of this year [2011], compared to 2888
in the same period last year [2010]. 23 had died, compared to 9 in the
same period last year [2010]. The most serious outbreaks are in
Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Siem Reap, Kandal and Kampong Speu and
Banteay Meanchey provinces, Ngan Chantha said.

"The situation is not out of control," he said, noting that during
the 1st 27 weeks of 2009, almost 5200 patients had been hospitalized.

There remained, however, a possibility that the swiftly spreading
disease could spiral out of control if communities failed to eliminate
mosquito-breeding sites and individuals failed to protect themselves
from mosquito bites, he said.

The mosquito that transmits dengue bites during the day, so it is
necessary to keep napping infants under a mosquito net and for other
children (as well as adults) to wear long sleeve shirts, he said.

Oceania - Australia. 24 Jul 2011. The Australian Red Cross had to
throw out 33 600 litres of donated blood for fear it was contaminated
with dengue fever [virus], after the large northern Queensland
outbreak in late 2009-10.

Disposing of 7 per cent of its blood supply cost the blood service
almost AUD 4 million [USD 4.28 million]. Australian Red Cross
executive director of research Dr David Irving said the recent problem
was brought home with the outbreak in northern Queensland, when more
than 1000 people were infected with dengue [viruses]
