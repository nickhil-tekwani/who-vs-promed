MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS: 1992 SEROGROUP C OUTBREAK, US (2)
===========================================================
[Referring to the original account, posted 19 March, reporting that
frequenting certain bars and smoking were associated with acquiring
the infection:]
This seems to be an example of co-factors without causality. In the
particular instance of the cases in Illinois, crowding, smoking, and
drinking went together because the students crowded in a place where
smoking and drinking were common. Smoking, drinking, and crowding
in this outbreak cannot be separated from each other epidemiologically.
To confirm whether smoking as an important risk factor, one must
investigate outbreaks where smoking is common, but crowding and drinking are
not. To confirm drinking as a risk factor, one must find situations
where drinking was an independent predictor of risk. Such situations
are not easy to find and this highlights the weaknesses of outbreak
investigations. Ralph Feigin did a nice investigation of an outbreak in
a school where smoking and drinking were not an issue. The factor most
predictive of being a secondary case was the nose-to-nose distance of
the child in his desk from an index case. Especially for infections
with respiratory spread, crowding is a key factor.
