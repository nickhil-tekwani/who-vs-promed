[Local authorities said on Fri 22 Mar 2019], 13 children have been confirmed killed following an outbreak of measles in Nigeria's northern state of Borno.

In a statement reaching Xinhua, the Borno State Primary Health Care Agency said the airborne disease has spread across 25 local council areas in the state.

The disease, a leading killer in developing countries like Nigeria, is showing a steady rise in Borno, with 4693 people already infected, the government agency said. "13 council areas are most affected by measles in 33 wards," the statement said.

On [Thu 21 Mar 2019], Babagana Abiso, a director of disease control in the state, said efforts were ongoing to contain the spread of the disease.

Abiso said due to the outbreak, 1.7 million kids are to be immunized against the disease.

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) would provide technical support for the 10-day immunization exercise, the official said.

"Immunization remains one of the most effective ways to protect children from killer diseases," he said, explaining that children of ages 6 months - 10 years are targeted for the immunization.

UN health officials reported an update on the measles epidemic in Madagascar recently and it shows that the number of cases has risen to 105 170 since 3 Sep [2018].

There were 634 reported deaths in health facilities and 567 community deaths including 114 measles-related deaths and 453 non-measles related death assessed by community workers. 70 percent of the deaths are of children.

Officials say 104 out of 114 districts in all the 22 regions are in the epidemic phase.

Madagascar's Ministry of Public Health and its civil society partners have launched an aggressive vaccination campaign across the country in hopes of slowing the spread of the disease.

This is an alarming situation," said Dr Aliâ€¯Ouenzar, National Director of PIVOT, a prominent health sector NGO and Direct Relief partner on the front lines of the epidemic. Preventive measures must be accelerated to prevent the spread of the disease, he said. The group just completed a vaccination campaign effort that reached 65 000 children, ages 6 months - 9 years, in the district of Ifanadiana.

Northern Territory Government has lowered the age when babies can be vaccinated in urgent response to a measles outbreak in Darwin.

Babies can now receive the free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at 9 months of age instead of 12 months.

Reported cases of the highly infectious disease in the Darwin area continue to rise, while no confirmed cases have been reported in Katherine. There are now 23 confirmed cases of people with measles.

"The NT Government is providing Territorians with access to quality health care, and we have responded to the recent measles outbreak by offering the free MMR vaccine earlier to babies," Minister for Health, Natasha Fyles said.

A further 5 people in Auckland have been diagnosed with the measles.

Auckland medical officer of health Dr William Rainger said the total number of cases in the region had risen to 9 but 4 of the 5 new cases were household contacts.

"There is one new case which isn't linked to an existing case, a woman in her 40s from Rodney," Rainger said.

He said the person was now in isolation, but she had been infectious since Mon 18 Mar 2019.

[6] Hong Kong: vaccine policy

https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3003500/hong-kong-change-measles-vaccine-policy-so


Hong Kong is set to change its vaccination policy for measles, with children receiving a 2nd injection against the contagious disease at a younger age amid a continuous rise in infections.

From next year [2020], children aged 18 months will receive the 2nd jab instead of having to wait until they are 6 years old under the existing policy.

Secretary for Food and Health Professor Sophia Chan Siu-chee also revealed at the Legislative Council on Wed that about 30 000 doses of the vaccine would arrive in Hong Kong next month [April 2019]. The Airport Authority would also step up its vaccination service for airport staff.

Chan's announcement came as the Department of Health confirmed 4 more cases of measles, taking this year's [2019] total to 30.

The 4 cases included 2 from the airport -- a 31-year-old man working at the MTR's Airport Station, and a 21-year-old woman working in Terminal 1. By [Wed 27 Mar 2019], a total of 11 cases involved airport and airline personnel.

The 2 other cases recorded on [Wed 27 Mar 2019] were a 43-year-old man who recently visited Okinawa, and an 8-month-old boy who recently travelled to Bangkok and Hua Hin in Thailand. He was the 3rd and youngest baby to be infected with measles this year [2019].

More measles cases likely to hit Hong Kong, disease expert warns

The city has already clocked up 20 infections so far this year [2019], more than in all of 2018.
The Centre for Health Protection steps up efforts to vaccinate workers at the airport, where the outbreak appears to have hit.

The Health Bureau (SS) has confirmed in a release on [Tue 26 Mar 2019] that a 29-year-old worker in Kiang Wu Hospital has been infected with measles.

The man, who is from mainland China, was working as a ward assistant, and was found to be infected on [7 Mar 2019] when delivering a meal to a hospital ward.

As the man is from the Mainland, the SS does not know if he had received a measles vaccine. The man had developed a fever on [20 Mar 2019], and a rash on [23 Mar 2019]. However, records showed he had worked on [22 Mar 2019].

According to the data provided in the release, 8 employees of Kiang Wu Hospital have been found to be infected with measles since the 1st cases of measles were reported in early March [2019].

The health authority says that more than 250 medical staff in Macau have been re-vaccinated.

In addition, the release notes that a 26-year-old measles patient whose condition was previously reported has confirmed that he had accompanied his family to Kiang Wu Hospital on [6 Mar 2019] in the afternoon.

Although the 26-year-old had traveled to Thailand from [7-12 Mar 2019], the patient was categorised as an internal case, as he had contact with the 5th victim.

https://fox17.com/news/local/15-states-reporting-cases-of-measles-outbreak-now-second-highest-since-2014


A total of 15 states have now reported cases of measles to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC's latest report also added nearly 50 cases, bringing the total to 314 as of [21 Mar 2019].

Kentucky, Georgia, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington have now all reported cases in the outbreak.

Measles cases -- CDC
--------------------
The outbreak has been linked to travelers who brought the measles back from other countries facing outbreaks such as Ukraine and Israel. There were 372 cases reported in 2018 according to the CDC. So far, the current outbreak is the 2nd-highest since 2014.

The CDC says the majority of people with measles were unvaccinated and the issue could continue as travelers from overseas bring the disease back to the United States.

The CDC says the virus can be spread through coughing and sneezing. The virus can live for up to two hours in an area where an infected person coughs or sneezes. Others who breathe in the virus or touch the infected surface can then become infected if they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.

[10] USA (New York, Rockland county): declaration of state of emergency
Date: Tue 26 Mar 2019

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-rockland-county-new-york-state-of-emergency/?ftag=CNM-00-10aac3a


Health officials in Rockland county, New York have declared a state of emergency amid an ongoing measles outbreak. The county is prohibiting unvaccinated children under the age of 18 from going out in public spaces for 30 days, CBS New York reports.

There have been 153 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland county, which sits about 40 miles [64 km] north of New York City. The majority of cases have been in children, most of whom have not been vaccinated.

"We will not sit idly by while children in our community are at risk," County Executive Ed Day said in a press conference [Tue 26 Mar 2019]. "This is a public health crisis and it's time we sound the alarm."

The ban begins at midnight tonight [26 Mar 2019] and is in effect for 30 days. Public places affected by the order include shopping centers, businesses, restaurants, schools, and places of worship. Anyone under 18 who hasn't been vaccinated will be banned from such places for 30 days or until the individual gets vaccinated. People who are medically unable to get vaccinated are exempt.

Day noted that this is the 1st effort of its kind nationally. "The circumstances we're facing here clearly calls for that," he said.

He emphasized that law enforcement will not be going around asking everyone for their vaccination records. However, parents of unvaccinated children "will be held accountable" if they are found to be in violation, Day said, and could face a class B misdemeanor charge.

Measles outbreak in Rockland county
-----------------------------------
In September of [2018], an international traveler arrived in Rockland county with a suspected case of the measles. 6 additional cases of measles from international travelers to the area followed, exposing more people to the virus. The outbreak was centered in an Orthodox Jewish community where many residents had not been vaccinated. Day noted that many Orthodox rabbis have been working with health officials to encourage vaccination in their community, so it's not a matter of religious objection.

The cases are currently clustered in eastern Ramapo, though officials warn exposure may occur anywhere in the county. The Health Department is working to limit exposures and offering free vaccine to boost the county's immunization rate.

Earlier this month [March 2019], a federal judge barred 50 unvaccinated students from attending Rockland's Green Meadow Waldorf School for at least 3 weeks.

To prevent the spread of illness, officials are advising people who may have been exposed and have symptoms of measles to contact their health care provider, local clinic, or emergency department before going in to seek medical care. This will help the facility take steps to ensure others won't be exposed to the virus.

Anyone told by a health care provider to "watch for measles" after possible exposure is advised to stay home and not go out in public, where they could expose others.

[11] USA (California): immunization policy
Date: Tue 26 Mar 2019
Source: News 4 [abridged, edited]
https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Measles-Immunizations-Strict-Outbreak-california-507696891.html


California would give state public health officials instead of local doctors the power to decide which children can skip vaccinations before attending school under legislation proposed [Tue 26 Mar 2019] to counter what advocates call bogus exemptions.

The measure would also let state and county health officials revoke medical exemptions granted by doctors if they are found to be fraudulent or contradict federal immunization standards. The proposal comes amid measles outbreaks in New York, Washington, and elsewhere that are prompting states including Maine and Washington to consider ending non-medical exemptions.

California eliminated all non-medical immunization exemptions in 2016, as have Mississippi and West Virginia. The lawmakers want California to now follow West Virginia's lead in having public health officials rather than doctors decide who qualifies for medical exemptions. Doctors would send the state health department the reason they are recommending the exemption and would have to certify that they examined the patient.

The steps are needed to crack down on a few unscrupulous doctors who are helping parents avoid vaccinating their children by selling medical exemptions through word of mouth or online advertising, lawmakers and physicians representing prominent medical groups said at a Capitol news conference.

"They were monetizing their medical license by selling these exemptions ... putting our children and the public in danger for a quick buck," said Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan of Sacramento, a pediatrician who authored the current state law and the new proposal.

Several upset parents gathered in a Capitol hallway said the measure isn't needed because the immunization rate already is high under current law. A shouting match briefly broke out between opponents and one supporter of the legislation, reminiscent of the high emotions that surrounded the original bill and continue to haunt the issue.

Statewide immunization rates increased after the law took effect from less than 93 percent to more than 95 percent, enough to keep most outbreaks from spreading.

But the rate of medical exemptions has also tripled, according to the California Department of Public Health. Although it's still less than 1 percent of school children statewide, advocates said 50 schools have exemption rates of at least 15 percent, and more than half of students aren't vaccinated in at least 3 schools.

That means pockets of unvaccinated children who could spread illnesses like measles "because of the increase in bogus medical exemptions and by false information being spread on the internet," said Dr Eric Ball, representing the American Academy of Pediatrics in California.

Federal guidelines say less than 1 percent of children should avoid vaccinations if they have a severe allergic reaction or impaired immunity such as from a liver problem, the HIV virus, or chemotherapy.

A measles case reported in Shasta county is also related to 2 others reported in Butte and Tehama counties, health officials said [Sun 24 Mar 2019].

The female patient in Shasta county apparently caught the disease from her father, who recently had been traveling overseas when he contracted the illness, said Dr Karen Ramstrom, Shasta county's health officer.

"The (measles) cases in the United States now are often most typically connected to international travel," Ramstrom said.

She did not know the patient's immunization history, except to say "she was not adequately immunized."

Health officials are trying to contain the measles cases by isolating the patients and by reaching anyone who may have come in contact with either of the 3 people known to have the illness. Family members of those with measles have also been isolated, she said.

Ramstrom said the one patient is isolated at a Shasta county health facility, but she doesn't live in the county. She did not want to specifically identify where the other 2 patients were from except to say the 3 cases were spread across the 3 counties.

Terri Fields Hosler, Shasta county's director of public health, said she had to be careful about the patients' privacy by giving out too much personal information about the 3 people and their relationship.

She did, however, say the 3 cases constituted a "cluster," which means they have all come in direct contact with each other.

Since the 1st case was reported in Shasta county last week, no new cases have been identified, she said.

At least 18 people in Oakland county, Michigan, have contracted measles in an outbreak that began 13 Mar 2019, according to an update yesterday [25 Mar 2019] from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Oakland County Health Division

The Detroit Free Press reported the cases stemmed from an ill Israeli traveler who visited Oakland county from 6 Mar 2019 through 13 Mar 2019. Michigan health officials have held several vaccine clinics in that county in the past 2 days, already reaching more than 970 people.

Several synagogues, kosher food markets, and health clinics are listed as possible sites of exposure. According to health officials, vaccination within 72 hours of exposure can help prevent the disease.

Meanwhile, health officials in New York's Rockland county have declared a state of emergency as a measles outbreak in the Orthodox Jewish community continues to grow.

Beginning tomorrow, [27 Mar 2019] unvaccinated minors will be banned from public spaces until the emergency declaration ends in 30 days, ABC news reported.

Rockland county has recorded 153 cases of measles in an outbreak that began last September [2018], and 82.1% of case-patients are unvaccinated, another 4.0% are under-vaccinated, and the immunization status of 9.9% is unknown. As in the Michigan outbreak, Rockland county's outbreak began with a foreign traveller visiting the community.

Totally, an estimated 35 people have died of measles in Ukraine since the start of the outbreak of the disease in 2017.

At least 14 people died and more than 32 000 were infected in a major measles outbreak in Ukraine in the past 3 months.

A total of 32 939 people, including 18 109 children, were infected from 28 Dec 2018-12 Mar 2019 by measles in Ukraine, the ministry said in a statement.

Last year [2018], 35 120 cases of measles were recorded in Ukraine nationwide compared with 4782 cases confirmed in 2017. It marked the largest increase in measles cases in the world, according to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).

The Ukrainian health authorities blamed the low level of immunization for the outbreak of the disease.

[The outbreak of measles in the Ukraine with more than 32 000 people infected appears to be out of control. Early in 2018, WHO posted "WHO and partners have been working closely with the affected countries' health authorities to protect their populations from measles, as well as from other serious vaccine-preventable diseases. "At least twice as many children were vaccinated on time against measles in 2017 compared to in 2016," says the WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Marthe Everard. "This jump in routine immunization coverage represents a great step forward. However, the continuing spread of measles in Ukraine demonstrates that more must be done to vaccinate all those who have fallen behind." Ukraine has had the lowest immunization coverage in the Region in recent years and therefore has a large population of susceptible individuals.

Substantial progress in the past year in Ukraine includes: establishment of a national measles task force and a response plan to urgently address the outbreak; catch-up campaigns for children up to 10 years old; development of a long-term plan to ensure secure supplies of vaccines; training for health workers in identifying and reporting measles cases. (WHO Regional Office for Europe http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/ukraine/news/news/2018/01/ukraines-efforts-to-stop-measles-outbreak-continue-as-case-total-increases)

Yet there are almost as many cases this year, 2019, in the 1st 3 months of the year, as in all 2018. Was the vaccination effort not sustained? - Mod.LK

[18] Measles comeback
Date: Tue 26 Mar 2019

[Excerpt]
---------
Parents who steadfastly refuse to vaccinate their children because they believe vaccines trigger autism or other harms and others who delay vaccination because of these discredited concerns are creating clusters of susceptible kids. Those clusters drill holes into the wall of herd immunity public health relies on to keep diseases like measles at bay.

These pockets of unprotected children are like kindling. An American who gets infected abroad and returns home sick can effectively put a match to that kindling. The more kindling, the bigger the resulting fire.

That is exactly what happened in the ongoing New York outbreak, triggered when an unvaccinated child from Orthodox Jewish community traveled to and was infected in Israel. To date, there have been 181 cases in this outbreak. Israel's outbreak traces back to the explosive spread of measles in the Ukraine.

It's also likely what happened in 2015 when 147 children from a number of states were infected when the virus spread at Disneyland in California. A child from the Canadian province of Quebec was infected at the park, too. He or she was a member of a religious community that doesn't vaccinate; the outbreak ignited in Quebec engulfed 159 people.

This is what the measles virus does.

"Outbreaks that happen in Europe or South America or whatever, they're all a plane ride away," said John Wiesman, health secretary for Washington state, which is battling an outbreak that likely originated somewhere in Eastern Europe. "And with global travel today, in terms of our health security, we've got to in our own communities make sure that we don't have pockets of unimmunized kids."

[This report, like a number of others, is sounding the alarm. Extreme action is called for to prevent the continuing spread of measles. Most of the world's population has forgotten what a serious disease measles can be. - Mod.LK]
