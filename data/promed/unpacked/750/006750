Influenza update -- 385 (based on data up to 3 Jan 2020)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns

Summary
-------
- The current influenza surveillance data should be interpreted with caution as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has influenced to varying extents health seeking behaviours, staffing/routines in sentinel sites, as well as testing priorities and capacities in Member States. The various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.
- Globally, despite continued or even increased testing for influenza in some countries, influenza activity remained at lower levels than expected for this time of the year.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained below inter-seasonal levels, though sporadic detections of influenza A and B viruses were reported in some countries.
- In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was reported at inter-seasonal level.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, increased influenza detections were reported in Haiti in recent weeks. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity, decreased in most reporting countries.
- In tropical South America, there were no influenza detections in this reporting period.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity continued to be reported in Western Africa.
- In Southern Asia, sporadic influenza detections were reported across reporting countries.
- In South East Asia, there were no influenza detections reported in this reporting period.
- Worldwide, influenza B detections accounted for the majority of the very low numbers of detections reported.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 82 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from [21 Dec 2020] to [3 Jan 2021] (data as of 15 Jan 2021 4:26:22 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 200 863 specimens during that time period. A total of 409 specimens were positive for influenza viruses, of which 121 (29.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 288 (70.4 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 19 (54.3 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 16 (45.7 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). All the characterized B viruses (129) belonged to the B-Victoria lineage.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO encourages countries to continue routine influenza surveillance, test samples from influenza surveillance sites for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses where resources are available, and report epidemiological and laboratory information in a timely manner to established regional and global platforms. Updated considerations for addressing disruptions in the influenza sentinel surveillance and extending to include COVID-19 wherever possible are available in the interim guidance, Maintaining surveillance of influenza and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 -- adapting Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and sentinel systems during the COVID-19 pandemic [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/maintaining-surveillance-of-influenza-and-monitoring-sars-cov-2-adapting-global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system-(gisrs)-and-sentinel-systems-during-the-covid-19-pandemic]. Updated algorithms for testing of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 for surveillance are also included.

Almost 90 000 cases of influenza and acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI) have been recorded in Ukraine over the past week, according to data provided by the Health Ministry.

"Over the past week, 89 133 people fell ill with ARVI, 35.5 percent of whom were children under the age of 17. The incidence rate is 234.6 per 100 000 population, which is 51.4 percent less than the epidemic threshold calculated for Ukraine," the report reads.

The Health Ministry notes that no lethal cases related to influenza have been reported.

Despite the great challenges it poses, the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to strengthen core surveillance capacities that can deliver public health benefits during and well beyond this emergency. It is important to understand that the key measures recommended for the prevention of influenza include cough etiquette, hand washing, and annual vaccination, particularly in the high-risk groups. The 1st 2 are the same non-pharmaceutical measures (NPIs) as those recommended for COVID-19 protection, and efficacious vaccines are now available for COVID-19 as well as for influenza.

It is clear both influenza and COVID-19 can be prevented by mask-wearing, frequent and thorough hand washing, coughing into the crook of your elbow, staying home when sick, and limiting contact with people who are infected. Another strategy to reduce the likelihood of a double epidemic would be to strengthen existing influenza vaccination programs.

In addition to continuing adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), one way to prepare for a possible double epidemic is to ramp up the testing capacity for both COVID-19 and seasonal infections. Combination testing for both COVID-19 and influenza could also be beneficial, as a single sample could be used to distinguish the 2 infections in patients presenting with similar symptoms. Another reason it is important to determine whether respiratory symptoms are due to influenza or to COVID-19 (or both) is that mitigation efforts for the former aren't as strict as for the latter. - Mod.UBA]
