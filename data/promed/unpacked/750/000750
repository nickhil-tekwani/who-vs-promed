--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The report stating that California is having a pertussis epidemic was published in 2014 when there actually was an epidemic. California is not currently experiencing a pertussis epidemic. If you could correct this posting, it would be most appreciated.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Harriman for correcting the record that no epidemic of pertussis is currently occurring in California. ProMED-mail regrets the confusion that the posting on 24 Jul 2019 in error of a 2014 report when there actually was an epidemic of pertussis in California may have caused. - Mod.ML
