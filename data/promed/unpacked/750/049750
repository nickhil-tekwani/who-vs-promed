A compounding company in Augusta, GA has recalled syringes of the cancer drug Avastin it supplied over 5 months to physicians treating vision problems after the FDA received word that 5 patients who received the compounded medication came down with eye infections that could leave them blind. The FDA announced the recall Thu 21 Mar 2013, after regulators conducted a preliminary inspection of Clinical Specialties Compounding Pharmacy and found "practices at the site that raise concerns about a lack of sterility assurance."

The CDC sent the FDA reports it had gathered of 5 patients sickened with endophthalmitis, an infection within the eyeball, after having received an injection in the eye of Avastin repackaged at CSCP. A company news release said its products were distributed nationwide between 19 Oct 2012 and 19 Mar 2013.

The recall involves a cancer drug that is used off-label in the treatment of severe (or "wet") macular degeneration, a disorder that gradually causes blindness, starting with a loss of central vision. Though the FDA has not approved the marketing of Avastin for macular degeneration, many physicians use it as an alternative to more expensive therapies approved by the FDA, including ranibizumab (marketed as Lucentis) and aflibercept (marketed as Eylea).

The FDA's actions to stem the eye infections comes 5 months after a deadly outbreak of fungal meningitis prompted the agency to shut down the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, MA, which delivered tainted epidural steroid injections to hospitals and medical practices across 23 states.

The absence of strong FDA enforcement powers over compounding pharmacies, and the discovery of filthy conditions at the New England Compounding Center, have spurred more aggressive FDA efforts to monitor conditions at compounding pharmacies, which repackage existing prescription drugs into made-to-order medications.

The latest news comes just 4 days after compounding company Med Prep Consulting Inc. recalled all its products after a Connecticut hospital found mold in bags of medicine compounded at the company's Tinton Falls, NJ facility. Those products were shipped to hospitals in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Pennsylvania.

[This drug has been previously associated with infections linked to a repackaging or compounding pharmacy as several clusters of infections occurred in 2011. Two of the 3 outbreaks were related to alpha-hemolytic streptococci, suggesting the contamination of oral microflora from an unclear mechanism.

Avastin (bevacizumab) and Lucentis (ranibizumab) are in a class of medications called vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) antagonists, working by blocking abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the eye(s) that may cause vision loss in people with wet age-related macular degeneration. Both are produced by Genentech, but only the latter drug is packaged in doses appropriate for ocular use at a cost to the consumer, or more likely to the 3rd party carrier, of 40 times. - Mod.LL
