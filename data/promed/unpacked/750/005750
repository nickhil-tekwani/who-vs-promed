The mentioned case was not confirmed to be anthrax, but rather a streptococcal infection. Furthermore, investigations of the origin of the heroin did not confirm a link with Germany but suggested that the heroin was bought in Copenhagen. Hence, there is not a confirmed "Danish link" to the 2 German cases.

[I am very grateful to our Danish colleagues for clarifying this so quickly and authoritatively. Instead of being _Bacillus anthracis_, it is a haemolytic Group A streptococcus. According to the Danish police, this heroin has been circulating in the Copenhagen area for the last 3 months. - Mod.MHJ
