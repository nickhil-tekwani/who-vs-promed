The firm Agro Plus 2006 (Kamensky district, Cherkasy region of Ukraine) recently recorded cases of pig mortality, reported the State Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service of Ukraine. According to the report 240 pigs died. In total, the farm contained about 1680 pigs.

Experts think that the cause of mortality is African swine fever (ASF). However, veterinary specialists doubt that the pigs died due to ASF because evidence of this disease was not visible.

[Outcome of veterinary investigations, including laboratory test results to exclude ASF, will be welcomed.

Following the initial report on its 1st ASF outbreak, which started on 30 Jul 2012, Ukraine has submitted 6 follow-up reports, all reporting the absence of additional outbreaks. The most recent follow-up report was submitted on 25 Sep 2012. According to the OIE, the current status of ASF in Ukraine is "continued". - Mod.AS
