On Sunday night [9 Oct 2022], 4-month-old [AL] was happy and alert. By Monday morning, he was struggling to breathe. [AL's] parents took him to an emergency room near their home in the Chicago suburbs, but it didn't have a children's wing, so he was rushed by ambulance to another hospital an hour away. He tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, a common virus that causes lung infections. His condition "went downhill really fast," his mother said.

Hospitals across the country have reported a surge in RSV cases over the last 3-4 weeks. The virus began circulating in the summer, to doctors' surprise, since it usually peaks in winter.

For many kids, RSV symptoms look like a common cold. But for others -- young babies or children with lung diseases or weakened immune systems -- symptoms can be more severe.

"The ones who tend to get the most sick are the infants below 4 months. And then the ones who are older who tend to get most sick are those who have some other medical conditions," said Dr. Sameer Kamath, chief medical officer for Duke Children's Hospital and Health Center.

RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, an infection that causes airways to become inflamed and clogged with mucus, making it difficult to breathe. If the infection travels to the lung sacs, it can result in pneumonia.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), RSV results in around 58 000 annual hospitalizations and 100-300 deaths among children under 5.

[AL] was moved to a pediatric ICU on Tuesday [11 Oct 2022] after his heart and breathing rates soared. His mother has been staying with him in the hospital, since she still breastfeeds. Meanwhile, his father has been driving back and forth to take care of their 3 other kids.

NBC News spoke with 6 doctors across 5 states -- California, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Rhode Island -- all of whom said pediatric hospital bed capacity has been strained due to an influx of RSV patients. "We're really having a capacity problem like I've never seen before," said Dr. Charlotte Boney, pediatrician-in-chief at Baystate Children's Hospital in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The CDC said it does not keep a national count of RSV cases, hospitalization or deaths, but it tracks changes in the virus' spread. "We have observed a rise in RSV in multiple US regions, and some regions are nearing seasonal peak levels," a CDC spokesperson said.

Last week, nearly 5000 tests came back positive, according to CDC data. That's not far from the number in the same week of October 2021 but far higher than in October 2020.

Boney said her hospital experienced a higher volume of patients in September [2022] than ever recorded, many of whom had RSV. Her pediatric ICU was closed to new patients on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022] because no beds were available.

During a normal winter, her emergency room might see around 100 children a day, Boney said. It's now seeing about 130-150. Many RSV patients in Massachusetts are being transferred to nearby states, she added.

Dr. Michael Koster, director of pediatric infectious diseases at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, said his hospital has been treating some RSV patients from over 100 miles away. Kamath said that in the area around Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, "there have been nights when there has been one bed available between 3 institutions, which is very scary."

At Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, hospital and ICU beds have been full for over a month. Dr. John Cunningham, the hospital's physician-in-chief, said the emergency room is seeing a 150% higher volume than is usual for October. He said the hospital is treating around 10-30 RSV patients at a given time, so they occupy a large share of its 30 ICU and 60 emergency beds.

Cunningham's hospital is directing some patients to other facilities, but it can take 24 hours for a transfer, and a child's condition could easily deteriorate in that time. "Depending on the severity, it's not an exaggeration to say minutes, hours matter," said Dr. Benny Joyner, medical director of the pediatric ICU at UNC hospitals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

In San Diego, 50 patients have tested positive for RSV over the last few days at Rady Children's Hospital, according to Dr. John Bradley, the hospital's medical director of infectious diseases. He said the volume of RSV patients is "2-3 times what we've ever experienced." "In mid-October, an epidemic of RSV is basically unheard of in San Diego," Bradley added.

Doctors said RSV is spreading earlier this year [2022] and resulting in more severe illness in some kids because many children weren't exposed to respiratory viruses earlier in the pandemic due to masking and social distancing. "All those infection control measures protected us from all these viruses. Now everyone has relaxed those measures and these viruses are back with a vengeance," Boney said.

Doctors said they've seen many young kids who contracted RSV from an older sibling, who in turn was infected at school or day care. That's how the family thinks [AL] got sick: They have a daughter in 1st grade, a son in pre-kindergarten and a 2-year-old daughter at home. The entire family had cold-like symptoms last week.

"It's very much a contact illness," Cunningham said. "Hand hygiene is really the key thing. The major way that it disperses is actually by direct contact, rather than by somebody coughing on you."

Doctors said parents shouldn't worry about every cough or runny nose, but they should look out for signs that a child is lethargic or breathing hard or fast. "If your child, especially under the age of 2, is flaring the nostrils, grunting, head bobbing or you're seeing sucking in around the collarbones or ribs, that's much more concerning," Koster said.

Kamath said many children who show up to the hospital aren't able to eat or drink because they're breathing so rapidly. If your child can't consume liquids, Joyner said, "that's a harbinger that you need to bring them in and get them evaluated."

[AL] showed many of those warning signs, the father said. Doctors told them that their son needed oxygen support and tubes inserted into his nostrils to suction the mucus from his airways. On Thursday [13 Oct 2022], [AL] was finally able to breathe on his own.

Children hospitalized with RSV typically recover within 2-3 days, though "a small minority do end up in the ICU, and then sometimes even on the ventilator," Kamath said. ICU patients tend to recover within a week, according to Joyner.

Aside from breathing tubes, ventilators and supportive care like steroids or fluids, doctors don't have many ways to treat RSV. "There is no Paxlovid-like drug for RSV. There is no Tamiflu drug like we have for influenza," Boney said.

One drug, a monoclonal antibody called Synagis, is approved for babies at high risk of severe RSV, such as those born premature or with chronic heart or lung problems. But doctors said they give that treatment sparingly.

However, Bradley said his San Diego hospital is set to participate in a clinical trial of an RSV antiviral from Pfizer later this year [2022]. "I've already told Pfizer, 'Hurry up, get the study up and running,'" he said. "We're being overwhelmed with RSV, so it'd be easy to study the drug right now."

Pfizer is also testing an RSV vaccine candidate, which was found to be nearly 86% effective in preventing severe illness in a late-stage trial of older adults. Another RSV vaccine candidate, from pharmaceutical company GSK, was found to be around 83% effective against the disease among adults ages 60 and up, according to data released Thursday [13 Oct 2022].

Bradley predicted it will like take another few years for an RSV vaccine to become available. In the meantime, he said, oxygen support is highly effective.

"It's purely a lung infection. This virus doesn't go anywhere else in the body the way influenza does," he said, adding that "once they get oxygen and the lungs work, the kids actually feel OK."

[The early increase in RSV may very well be due to children no longer wearing masks to prevent exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RSV and other respiratory pathogens such as influenza now have a susceptible exposed population to infect.

COVID cases among kids are down, but flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are on the rise. "It's really unusual to see that in the summer. And now, we have 2 summers in a row when RSV surges, and actually our area, Houston, we never really returned to baseline where we had in a very few RSV cases," explained pediatric infectious disease Dr. Michael Chang with University of Texas Health and Children's Memorial Hermann.

RSV symptoms can be like the common cold: cough, fever, and a runny nose. However, in babies, it can be dangerous.

"Infants less than 6 months are going to be at higher risk for severe RSV. Infants that have any type of underlying lung disease. So, premature babies under 2 years and still have chronic lung disease or dysplasia, they are at risk for potentially more severe cases, and then infants under a year or 2 years that have some sort of underlying congenital heart disease, they can be at risk for severe disease as well," Dr. Chang said.

The flu can also be dangerous in young kids and older adults. Right now, the number of flu cases resembles more along the lines of what occurs near the peak of the season. According to Chang, the peak doesn't usually start until after Thanksgiving.

Doctors don't really know why both viruses are surging now but assume with school, daycare, and work lives back to normal, respiratory illnesses are infecting more people. "There's a lot of people out there who I will say 'Oh, I want to get the flu vaccine. I just haven't gotten around to it,' So, for those people, you need to go get vaccinated as soon as possible!" Chang added.

["Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in 1-2 weeks, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States" (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html). - Mod.LK
