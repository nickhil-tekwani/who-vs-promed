Tonga is experiencing a suspected outbreak of dengue fever
----------------------------------------------------------
Radio Tonga quotes a medical officer, Doctor Ma'ake Tupou, as saying 100
people in the Ha'apai group are being treated with flu-like symptoms.
Dr Tupou says most of the patients are suffering from fever, body aches and
in some cases bleeding noses. A 2-month old baby is the youngest patient.
In the capital, Nuku'alofa, medical authorities say the Vaiola hospital is
treating an average of 15 patients a day.

[2] Australia (Torres Strait)

More cases of potentially fatal dengue fever have been discovered on
Thursday Island in Torres Strait.
The latest outbreak was identified last week and by today 8 cases of the
disease had been confirmed. A Queensland Health spokeswoman said several
more patients who had shown early signs of the disease were being tested.
The spokeswoman said efforts were being made to control the outbreak of
type 4 dengue -- which has recently been active in Indonesia, East Timor
and Papua New Guinea -- as quickly as possible, because of the heightened
risk to islanders following last year's type 2 dengue outbreak.
People who contract 2 different types of dengue fever have a heightened
risk of contracting dengue haemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal. Last wet
season, 278 cases of type 2 dengue were reported in the Torres Strait area
and one person died from it.
The spokeswoman said health staff from Cairns and Townsville had been flown
to Thursday Island to help control the outbreak. "They are going from house
to house to identify and treat breeding sites of the mosquitoes, which
carry the disease," she said.
Symptoms of dengue fever include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea,
rash, exhaustion and a loss of appetite and residents have been warned to
clear away anything that can contain water where mosquitoes can breed and
to use insect repellents.

Highest number of dengue cases recorded in 2004
-----------------------------------------------
There were 9459 cases of dengue fever in Singapore last year [2004] -- the
highest number recorded in a year. Senior Parliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai
Kee said the situation was worrying.
The "Mozzie Attack" programme will be rolled out to all constituencies by
June this year [2005] to help spread the message of prevention.
Mr Koo said the National Environment Agency [NEA]had stepped up its efforts
to search and destroy mosquito breeding in homes and public areas.
It is working with managing agents of condominiums and town councils to
prevent mosquito breeding.
There has been some success in public areas, with only 5 percent of schools
found with breeding sites, down from 25 percent before 1999.
But the rising trend of mosquito breeding in homes accounted for 60 percent
of all breeding sites found. So the NEA will continue to work with CDCs and
grassroots organisations to include dengue control initiatives in their
work plans.

[4] Yemen (Hodeidah)

Dengue fever kills 7
--------------------
At least 124 people have been infected with dengue fever in southern Yemen
and 7 have died from the disease in Hudaidah [Hodeidah] province, 226 km
southwest of the capital Sana, the health ministry said.
Dengue fever, which can be treated, is an infectious disease carried by
mosquitoes and is found mostly during and shortly after the rainy season in
tropical and subtropical areas.
Deputy Minister of Public Health Dr Majed al-Junaid said more help was
needed in controlling the outbreak. "We are still struggling to contain
this disease given our limited resources," he told IRIN in Sana.
The Ministry of Public Health submitted a report this week to the cabinet
calling for more action to prevent the outbreak from becoming an epidemic.
The report followed a comprehensive investigation at all hospitals in the
province in the period up to 18 Feb 2005.
Since dengue fever was first detected on 16 Dec 2004 in the small city of
Zabid in Hudaidah, 124 cases of infection have been reported. By
mid-January [2005] 7 people in the city had died of the disease, the
ministry report said. But doctors fear the death toll could rise as the
disease can spread quickly. The Yemeni government says it is on full alert
to deal with the outbreak but more help is needed.
More than 50 medically equipped cars with over 250 technicians have been
dispatched in one of largest medical campaigns in the country's history. It
includes wiping out mosquitoes, filling swamps where they breed and
disinfecting areas where mosquitoes live to stop transmission of the
disease, official sources confirmed. [Note that while Singapore
concentrates on eliminating mosquito breeding in homes and public areas
(see above), Yemen talks about filling swamps -- but the vector mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_ does not breed in swamps. � Mod.JW]
The government report calls for additional funding of at least USD1.5
million to control the epidemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) in
Sana has offered technical assistance to the government. WHO representative
in Yemen, Dr Hashim Elzein Elmousaad, told IRIN that according to different
tests and investigations in Sana and Cairo, Egypt, cases have appeared all
over Hudaidah and are confirmed to be dengue fever type 3.
Dengue fever can be caused by any one of 4 types of the dengue virus:
DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. A person can be infected by all 4 types at
different times during a life span, but only once by the same type.
"Dengue fever is not uncommon for Yemen, type 1 was discovered for the
first time in some districts of Shabwa province (458 km southeast of Sana)
in July 2002, then appeared again in 2003 in Ataq city, the capital of
Shabwa province," Elmousaad said. "The results from the laboratories showed
that people from whom blood was collected in Hudaidah and Zabid, as well as
those from Shabwa, were exposed to dengue fever before 2002," he explained.
The danger of dengue fever depends on its type the doctor explained: "We
have to differentiate between dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dengue fever is usually without bleeding, but dengue hemorrhagic fever is
with hemorrhaging and people can bleed from the gums, the intestines,
stomach or from the nose, as well as other symptoms," Elmousaad said.

[It is true that fatal cases are often due to a 2nd infection with a
different type of dengue. In East Asia this usually happens in
children. It would be interesting to learn the age distribution of these
deaths. Note that transliteration of Arabic place names is variable. We
have used the name Hodeidah in the title of this report to maintain
consistency with previous reports (see below). � Mod.JW]

[5] Yemen (Hodeidah & Mokha): travel advisory
Date: 9 Mar 2005
From: William Lesh, Chief of the Consular Section [edited]
The World Health Organization has advised the US Embassy that a dengue
fever outbreak has afflicted the port cities of Hodeidah and Mokha on the
western coast of Yemen and the surrounding coastal area. Estimates of the
number of cases vary. With no specific treatment for dengue infection, any
outbreak of this mosquito-borne disease is a serious international public
health concern.
A large share of dengue infections occur without symptoms at all,
especially in children. When symptoms appear they tend to feel like a
severe case of influenza. Approximately 1 percent of dengue infections
result in a more severe form of the infection called Dengue Hemorrhagic
Fever (DHF) which has a 5 percent case fatality rate. DHF tends to occur
mostly in those who have had previous dengue infections.
Yemen's health services network does not have adequate resources to mount a
mosquito eradication campaign, nor the resources to systematically identify
and treat suspected cases when they occur. The Embassy's Regional Medical
Officer recommends avoiding travel to the Hodeidah region until better
estimates on the scale of the outbreak are available. If travel is
necessary, avoid mosquito bites through the use of insect repellents.
Further information on dengue fever is available on the Center's for
Disease Control website. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa can be contacted at
