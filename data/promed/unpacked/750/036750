First Report of Blue Mold or Downy Mildew of Pepper from Nurseries in
Southeastern Spain.
M. M. Guerrero Díaz and A. Lacasa, Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo
Agrario y Agroalimentario, 30150 La Alberca, Murcia, Spain; and M. Santos,
R. Blanco Prieto, and J. C. Tello Marquina, Departamento de Producción
Vegetal. Universidad de Almería. 04120 Almería. Spain. Plant Dis. 87:100,
2003; published on-line as D-2002-1105-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication
18 October 2002.
During October and November 2001, severe losses in production of pepper
seedlings (_Capsicum annuum_). were reported. At least 4 pepper seedbeds
were affected and 1.6 million plants (more than 40 percent of total
production) suffered severe defoliation.
Symptoms included chlorotic spots on upper leaf surfaces along with a dark
brown felt and violet reflections on the undersurface of leaves. Spots
became necrotic and expanded to include almost the entire blade, resulting
in defoliation that made the plants worthless. These symptoms had not been
observed in Spain previously.
California type cultivars that produce yellow fruit (Capino, Vélea, and
Fiesta) exhibited more severe symptoms compared with cultivars that produce
red fruit (Orlando, Haban, Barbadillo, Ribera, and Requena). Lamuyo type
cultivars were not severely diseased.
_Peronospora tabacina_ [Pt] was identified as the causal agent of downy
mildew in pepper, the same pathogen that causes tobacco blue mold. Sexual
reproductive structures were not found on pepper leaves. Sporangia and
sporangiophores corresponded with those described for Pt (synonym _P.
hyoscyami_ f. sp. _tabacina_) (3). Sporangia were spherical in the youngest
sporangia and oval to elliptical in mature sporangia (23 × 16 micrometers).
Sporangia were borne on dendritic, dichotomously branched sporangiophores
that branched 4 to 8 times and terminated in curved, acute apices.
Sporangiophores occurred singly or in small groups.
In pathogenicity tests, California and Lamuyo type pepper cultivars were
inoculated with a suspension of spores in distilled water by spraying
seedlings bearing 4 true leaves. Inoculated seedlings were maintained at
temperatures of 15 to 25°C (night/day).
Pt exhibiting the same morphological features as those described above was
observed 15 days later on pepper leaves. This disease on pepper was
described first in the United States (1,2) and subsequently reported in
Greece and Australia (2).
Pt caused disease in nurseries producing pepper seedlings following
production of tobacco seedlings or close to other tobacco plants (1). In
Murcia, this downy mildew in pepper appeared in pepper nurseries with
supplemental heating and did not appear in those without heating. However,
the disease spread when diseased pepper seedlings were moved to unheated
nursery greenhouses.
The inoculum may have originated from tobacco plants introduced in the
greenhouses for the purpose of propagating parasites of whitefly (_Bemisia
tabaci_). Otherwise, tobacco is not cultivated in the Murcia.

[Downy mildew is common on peppers and is essentially a seedling
disease. Moist conditions foster pathogenisis. Pepper seedbeds must be
located away from tobacco seedbeds in order to reduce possible transfer of
blue mold spores (also caused by _P. tabacina_) to pepper plantings. Foliar
applications of fixed or neutral copper formulations at the seedling stage
(4-5 day intervals) are recommended to reduce infection. -Mod.DH]
