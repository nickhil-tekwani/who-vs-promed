[From ProMED-mail posting "Newcastle disease, game fowl, plty. - USA
(CA) (07) 20030210.0361:]
"Dr. Allen's letter highlights the need for other measures, such as
education of the animal owners, or perhaps trainers and fighters."
and
"Education initiatives that target non-commercial animal owners
represent a significant need nationwide. This is especially important
in the context of bioterrorism, agricultural security, and emergency
preparedness (Agricultural Security and Emergency Preparedness)"

The above statements reminded me of an incident during an effort to
eradicate Infectious Laryngotracheitis (ILT) from Texas in the
mid-1980s while I was with the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC).
A game bird owner/fighter sent some birds to the poultry lab due to
illness and death. When ILT was diagnosed, TAHC destroyed the
remaining birds, eliminating the man's line of game bird genetics and
an important source of income. The gist of his final comment was
that he would never make the same mistake again.
Prior to this incident, some commercial egg and broiler producers in
that part of the state were experiencing sporadic outbreaks of ILT,
apparently due to a modified live vaccine strain of the virus. It is
possible that some of the workers from these farms attended
cockfights and may have even raised the birds. In addition,
biosecurity was lax. The potential for the disease to spread from
the commercial flocks to the fighting birds and then to other
commercial farms was great.
Education is important and will most likely increase the odds of a
disease incident being reported by some producers with small
herds/flocks. However, I believe, based on this and other
experiences, that certain segments of the population, especially
those engaged in an industry that is dependent on an illegal
activity, such as cockfighting, will not comply with disease
reporting because the people do not perceive it to be in their
self-interest. Only when it enters the commercial portion of a given
industry will the disease be detected by the regulatory agencies.
Because of this, biosecurity and disease surveillance are indispensable.
This is a personal observation, not to be construed as the view of
the Texas Department of Health.

[Biosecurity is an issue in all animal operations. As much as we want
to protect our animal industry and economy associated with that
industry, it is important to be sensitive as much as possible to the
owner. Therefore, education is the key to communication for
surveillance, control, and biosecurity. - Mod.TG]
