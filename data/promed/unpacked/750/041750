Sindh during the current year [2017] has registered 4312 cases of chikungunya against 405 in 2016, said a report issued by the provincial health department. The officials concerned, as well as seasoned professionals talking to APP, attributed the situation to the absolute disregard for adequate and safe disposal of garbage and rampant negligence towards sewerage and sanitation. Acknowledging that Karachi is the worst hit, senior professionals said that there was strong connection between the disease and poverty.

Almost 100 percent of the registered patients were cited to fall under the category of low income groups, mainly the slum dwellers, who were not only the most vulnerable, but the ailment also led to serious implications for their wage-earning capacities. "Chikungunya, a mosquito borne disease, is rarely fatal; however, its associated morbidity is immense," Professor and section head, Adult Infectious Diseases, Aga Khan University Hospital, Dr Bushra Jamil, said.

High fever, joint pain (in lower back, ankle, knees, wrists or phalanges), joint swelling, rash, headache, muscle pain, nausea and fatigue are identified as its manifestations. According to the provincial health department report [3], chikungunya-induced deaths were reported last year [2016] and [6] during the current year (2017).

Dr Tahir Hasan, a senior epidemiologist said the death rate of chikungunya virus is less than one per cent, while the ailment itself is also largely self-limiting. "It lasts for 2 or 3 days; however, after-affects are often damaging as the affected continue to complain of piercing pain and ache for quite some time," he said. The professionals were of the unanimous opinion that people must protect themselves from mosquito bites, with equal attention towards eradication of their breeding points.

There was said to be no specific antiviral drug treatment for chikungunya and also no vaccine available at the commercial scale to prevent the ailment. Despite being largely benign, the doctors said possibility of associated complications cannot be ignored, and these could range from eye problems to kidney problems, skin conditions, bleeding, and hepatitis etc.

[Since the 1st few cases were reported from Sindh province at the end of 2016, chikungunya has been reported from all provinces of Punjab, with most recent reports from Swabi district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where certain areas are already effected with an ongoing dengue epidemic.

As the vector for both of these diseases is _Aedes aegypti_, which has been found in numerous districts and regions, there is need for development and implementation of national and provincial short-term response plans with a strong integrated vector management component to tackle all vector-associated diseases. The plan should be followed by long term implementation measures which build on existing strengths and resources and focus on building multi-sectoral coordination, as management of vector borne diseases requires efforts on improving patient surveillance and case management, vector control measures, and strong involvement of the social sector, and community awareness. - Mod.UBA
