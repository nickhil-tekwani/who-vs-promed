Manitoba had its first anthrax case in the Vita area of SE Manitoba --
presumptive positive in our lab on 15 Aug 2003, confirmed in the CFIA lab
in Lethbridge on 22 Aug.
This beef herd has lost 6 or 7 cattle. The herd was vaccinated on the
weekend of 16 Aug 2003, and treated with penicillin at the same time. Carcass
disposal was completed that weekend as well.
This herd is in an area that has had anthrax outbreaks in 2001 and in 2002.
Vaccination in the area was widely practised in 2002, but pretty much
forgotten about in 2003. With the incredible heat wave we have been going
through, the likelihood of more cases occurring is fairly high.

[This area is in southern Manitoba in the Roseau River drainage. Hot, dry
weather triggers anthrax cases by reducing the innate immunity and thereby
allowing low exposure levels of spores to initiate infections. From a
third-party perspective, it seems it took some time for the owner and his
veterinarian to realise that they might have anthrax; one animal was
necropsied before the federal veterinarian was contacted (anthrax is a
federal veterinary responsibility in Canada).
***Simultaneous use of penicillin and Sterne vaccine is not a good idea --
antibiotics should never be given along with Sterne vaccine, it is a total
waste of vaccine and makes the ranchers think that they have vaccinated their
stock, which they haven't, because Sterne is a live vaccine and very
sensitive to penicillin. The penicillin kills the vaccine organisms before
they can do any good.
What they need to do is:
[1] Move the animals away from the area of maximum risk, e.g., where the
carcasses are and where the original source may have been, and dispose of
the carcasses by burning;
[2] Treat the herd, or at least all those animals that are at patent risk
of the disease, with LA200 or any other long-acting penicillin/antibiotic.
This will stop any incubating infections; if you depend solely on
vaccination it can take 8 days while deaths continue before there is
any significant immune protection. (Because LA200 stings badly, it is better
to treat horses BID with an injectable penicillin for 3 days. If LA200 is
used on horses, they won't let you near them when you later have to
vaccinate them, or if they do you may end up spending some days in hospital.)
[3] Wait 7-10 days for the antibiotic to clear from their systems.
[4] Vaccinate the whole herd with Sterne vaccine.
[5] Repeat annual herd vaccinations with Sterne for at least 3 more years.
Failure to revaccinate in these subsequent years is one of the commonest
causes of repeat livestock outbreaks in Canada.
While animals can be safely moved to another farm or ranch by 14 days after
vaccination, animals going to slaughter after being given antibiotics
should be held back longer. This period is variably defined and depends
entirely on local regulations. The vaccine site can be trimmed out by the
meat inspector, though some remove the whole quarter. - Mod.MHJ]
