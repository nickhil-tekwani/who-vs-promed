Two more in Hong Kong hospital suspected to have cholera.
Two women were admitted to hospital in Hong Kong on Monday with suspected
cholera after three people were confirmed to have the disease last week,
health officials said. They were taken to Queen Mary Hospital after
suffering vomiting and diarrhea since Friday. Last week, three men were
confirmed to have contracted cholera after eating shellfish, the first
cases of the disease this year in the territory. A health department
spokesman said there was no outbreak of cholera in Hong Kong but urged the
public to clean and cook food thoroughly. Hong Kong has also been grappling
with an outbreak of so-called bird flu, with imports of chickens from China
resuming this weekend after being suspended more than a month.

[Although it is not entirely clear from this report, I presume that these
cases are thought to have arisen in Hong Kong, and are unrelated to cases
reported earlier as imported from other regions of China. - Mod.ES
