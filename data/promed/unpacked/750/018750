Just 5 years after containing the deadly Ebola virus disease (EVD), authorities at the Ministry of Health (MoH) have confirmed an outbreak of Lassa fever across the country.

The situation is so serious that Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Francis Nah Kateh, has warned Liberians to take the necessary preventive measures, "even though this is what we have been taking care of all the while. For the disease to spread to Grand Kru County, gives health authorities the cause for concern."

According to MoH data, a total of 92 suspected cases between 1 Jan-25 Aug 2019, including 21 deaths, have been reported.

"Of these, 25 cases have been confirmed by RT-PCR (Nimba-9, Bong-10, Grand Bassa-5, and Grand Kru -1), while 9 remain suspected cases," the release recorded.

The case fatality rate among confirmed cases is 36% (9 deaths out of 25 confirmed cases). Males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females.

The MoH release also said that although Lassa fever is not new to Liberia, it is a deadly viral disease that requires urgent attention. The disease is spread by rodents or rats and through close contact with infected persons.

"We are concerned about the sporadic increase of Lassa fever cases outside the Lassa Belt in Liberia," meaning Nimba, Bong, and Grand Gedeh counties.

"For Lassa fever to affect Grand Kru other than those counties it has previously affected, gives us the fear to raise the alert," Dr Kateh told the Daily Observer via mobile phone on [Fri 2 Sep 2019].

Henceforth, MoH authorities in collaboration with partners and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), said they are responding to the Lassa fever outbreak in the country.

According to a release issued in Monrovia on 22 Aug 2019, Bong County Health Team notified NPHIL and MoH of the disease's outbreak following the confirmation of one case from Suakoko District, Bong County.

The case concerned the death of a 30-year-old male and a laboratory technician; a health worker, who previously worked with the Phebe Hospital, and a resident of Phebe Airstrip.

"Our hearts are broken, and we express our heartfelt condolences to members of the bereaved family," MoH said in a release on [Fri 30 Aug 2019].

Similarly, on 24 and 25 Aug 2019, the National Public Health Reference Laboratory confirmed 2 additional cases of Lassa fever infection in a 46-year old male as well as a 14-year old female, both residents of Suakoko Town, Bong County.

So far, the release said a total of 30 contacts, including 18 health workers, have been line-listed and are being followed up to the extent that 2 of the contacts have become symptomatic, though one of them have been tested negative.

Additionally, 2 cases (one contact) remain in isolation and are undergoing Ribavirin (Lassa) treatment, "because this is the 10th confirmed case being detected from Bong County since [the beginning of] 2019."

In response to the outbreak, MoH, NPHIL, World Health Organization (WHO), United States-based Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC), and partners are providing technical, financial, and logistical support to the District Response Teams.

"No epidemiological link has been established between these cases. However, there is a likelihood for these cases to be linked based on history of the source of infection," the release declared.

Health authorities are therefore advising people to "Keep your environment clean; cover your dishes to prevent rats excreting or urinating on them; cover food in tightly-closed containers to prevent rats from playing in food or drinking water; do not eat rats, because you can get the sickness by coming in contact with their blood, [urine, or feces] do not dry food in open places where rats can reach; avoid body contact with infected persons and endemic zone; and visit a health facility immediately when you feel sick."

Meanwhile, NPHIL, MoH, and partners have appealed to the general public to take necessary preventive measures, and kindly report cases of fever (any kind) to the nearest health facility.

"We continue to improve our rapid response teams at county, district, and community levels through the County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreak," the release said.

At least 21 people have died from Lassa fever in Liberia this year [2019] as the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of the disease on [Fri 30 Aug 2019] in Monrovia. One health worker, who was a laboratory technician, is amongst the dead.

There are also 25 confirmed cases and 92 suspected cases recorded between [1 Jan-25 Aug 2019], according to Dr Francis Kateh, Chief Medical officer of Liberia.

These cases are reported from Nimba (9), Bong (10), Grand Bassa (5), and Grand Kru (1), while 92 other cases remain suspected cases, the National Public Health Institute said in a release.

On [24 and 25 Aug 2019], NPHIL says its laboratory also confirmed 2 additional cases of Lassa fever infection in a 46-year old male and a 14-year old female, both residents of Suakoko Town, Bong County.

The case fatality rate among confirmed cases is 36% and males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females, the release disclosed.

"What is more concerning to us is the fact that when health workers that have the authority and have been trained to identify and take care of others, are being infected then that escalates the process to another level," Dr Keteh told journalists on Friday morning [30 Aug 2019] at an impromptu press conference intended to announce the emergency, adding that "Some health workers" have been tested and are undergoing treatment.

Added Tolbert Nyenswah, Director General of NPHIL: "Lassa is 2nd Ebola, no need to hide the information. It's better we put it [the information] out there -- the situation we are dealing with and how we can prevent it."

"So, it is important that we raise this and let the general public know that there are a couple of things that they can do in order to save lives."

Cases outside 'Lassa belt'
--------------------------
The Chief Medical Officer stressed that the situation is "alarming" because cases are being confirmed outside of the region known for recording Lassa fever.

"From the Nimba County area going through Bong [county] to Lofa County -- that is the Lassa Belt -- and so those are places that we have always been concerned [about] but, if you can now find Lassa in other parts of Liberia then, of course, it's becoming a major issue," he said.

"Normally, it's during the dry season that we see the escalation of Lassa fever but during the rainy season if we are having people positive then it's also concerning."

What is Lassa fever?
--------------------
Lassa fever is a deadly viral disease which is spread by rodents or rats and through close contact with affected persons. The illness was discovered in 1969 and is named after a town in Nigeria where the 1st cases occurred.

It is endemic in parts of West Africa including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, according to the US Center for Disease Control, CDC.

An estimated 100 000 to 300 000 infections of Lassa fever occur annually, with approximately 5000 deaths.

"Surveillance for Lassa fever is not standardized; therefore, these estimates are crude. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10-16% of people admitted to hospitals annually have Lassa fever, demonstrating the serious impact the disease has on the region," the CDC states on its website.

Is Liberia prepared to deal with Lassa?
---------------------------------------
NPHIL, the Liberian government agency responsible to track diseases, says the viral disease is not new to Liberia but they are concerned about the "sporadic increase" outside the Lassa Belt which requires "urgent attention."

However, Nyenswah expressed confidence that the country can deal with the outbreak, disclosing that there's a Lassa fever contingency comprehensive plan that has been rollout to stop other counties that may get infected by the disease.

He said NPHIL has moved drugs to start treating patients but said more drugs are needed as well as the monitoring of over 30 contacts to "avoid these patients from showing symptoms".

Dr Kateh added that the health sector "has the capacity to curtail those diseases that may show their faces" in Liberia but he also stressed that the "critical thing" is gathering support to ensure public health issues are mitigated.

"This is where the government and our partners have to come together and how we can give the necessary support," he said.

Liberia was rocked by the Ebola outbreak between 2014 and 2015 exposing the weakness of the country's health sector and killing over 11 000 people. But the health authority has said the sector is [more] resilient than before the 2014 outbreak.

"One of the things we've said is that after Ebola we are not going to find ourselves in the situation that we were in prior to Ebola and it is also important that when these issues come about we will be as transparent as possible to let you know what is going on and what steps we are taking to curtail the infectious rate," said Drs Kateh.

Meanwhile, he called on the public to improve hygiene measures by keeping their environment clean, cover dishes to prevent rats from coming in contact with them, cover food in tightly-closed containers, avoid eating rats, avoid drying food in open places, avoid body contact with affected persons and endemic zone, and visit a health facility immediately when you feel sick amongst others measures.

NPHIL, MOH and partners have also called on the general public to take the necessary preventive measures and report cases of fever to the nearest health facility.

"We continue to improve our rapid response teams at county, district, and community levels through the County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreaks," NPHIL release added.

[Occurrence of Lassa fever cases in areas outside the usual "Lassa fever belt" is of concern and the Ministry of Health is wise to increase public information and advise citizens about measures that should be taken to avoid infection with the virus. Occurrence of Lassa fever in Liberia is not new and cases have occurred there sporadically for several years. Between 1 Jan and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed (see archive 20180711.5898495). Apparently, all those Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, barrier-nursing practices, or biocontainment facilities in the laboratory are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

As mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in many of these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

Images of the _Mastomys natalensis_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and of _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_ at http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/. - Mod.TY
