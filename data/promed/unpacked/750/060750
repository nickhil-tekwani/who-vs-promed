[According to local press, the 2 affected birds are emus, kept in this
distant petting farm. The emu is a large, flightless Australian bird
(_Dromiceius novaehollandiae_; see photo at
<http://photogallery.canberrabirds.org.au/images/Emu4_Dabb.jpg>) related to
and resembling the ostrich and the cassowary.

Similarly to 2 previous outbreaks in Israel, in 2008 and in February 2010,
this is an isolated case, detected in a small avian holding, most probably
following contact with wild bird (droppings?). Its detection is feasible
due to the intensive Israeli HPAI surveillance system; a description of the
system may be found in the recent (4 May 2010) summary of the February 2010
Ein-Shemer outbreak, available at
<http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/D1617904-EC04-4D8D-9573-E8E1B3D36AF4/0/doh_sofi_ihud_eropi_shapat_ofot_en_shemer_4510.pdf>.
