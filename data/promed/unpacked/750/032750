Approximately 600 participants representing the 172 OIE Member
Countries and Territories, intergovernmental (FAO, WHO, World Bank,
WTO etc.), regional and national organisations took part in the 76th
Annual General Session of the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE), 25-30 May 2008.

Official OIE sanitary status recognition of Members
----------------------------------------------------
The International Committee approved the 2008 list of countries or
zones that had applied for an official OIE recognition of their
sanitary status concerning one or several of 4 priority diseases:
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), foot and mouth disease (FMD),
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and rinderpest.

"Applications are studied following a very democratic process that
involves renowned international experts, the elected members of the
OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases and finally,
possibility for all 172 Members Delegates to put all propositions in
question," OIE Director General Dr. Bernard Vallat reminded the
members of the International Committee.

This year [2008] the OIE recognized a record number of sanitary
statuses on BSE. Following the recognition of 30 Members this week,
the OIE now recognizes 41 Members as having a "controlled risk" or a
"negligible risk" status. [see commentary].

The OIE is the sole world organisation to grant an official status on
freedom from specified animal diseases including BSE.

A total of 5 Members or zones of Members were newly recognized as
free of FMD with or without vaccination. [The full list, updated 26
May 2008, is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/info/en_fmd.htm>].

The OIE granted 13 new national free statuses on rinderpest. The
organisation reiterated the objective, shared with the FAO, to
declare the world free of rinderpest in the short term.

Food security
-------------
The International Committee stressed the strong link existing between
the fight against hunger around the world and the fight against
animal diseases in particular developing countries and consequently
between food security and animal health. A specific resolution was
adopted.

The International Committee also reemphasized the importance of the
OIE mandate relating to food safety at the production level.

More commitment from OIE Reference Laboratories and Members to the
OFFLU network
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delegates adopted a resolution requiring Members reporting outbreaks
of highly pathogenic avian influenza to rapidly share biological
material and data with the international scientific community.
Members are encouraged to use the OIE/FAO OFFLU network as a way of
generating and disseminating this information, thus allowing the
early preparation of human vaccines. [For the OFFLU website, see
<http://www.offlu.net/>].

The Session further insisted that it is mandatory for all OIE
Reference Laboratories to gather, process, analyse and disseminate
epidemiological data concerning the disease they are responsible for.

Global animal disease notification
----------------------------------
The worldwide zoosanitary situation, covering around 100 terrestrial
and aquatic animal diseases, was examined in detail.

The Session highlighted that notification of disease outbreaks from
Members has dramatically improved since the launch of the new online
system WAHIS in 2006. To the benefit of the world epidemiological
situation, Members assimilated the system and it meets all
expectations regarding the swiftness, number and quality of
notification reports.

The WAHID database now captures all the information provided by WAHIS
and makes it accessible to anyone worldwide.

National Veterinary Services, OIE scientific network and diagnostic kits
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluation missions using the Performance of Veterinary Services tool
(PVS) were reported on during the meeting. The missions were so far
conducted in 54 Members with the support of several international
donors in order to improve animal health management worldwide.

The international Committee accredited the application of 5 new
Collaborating Centres and 8 Reference Laboratories, bringing the OIE
global network of scientific expertise to a number of 208 worldwide.
This network provides OIE Members all updated animal disease control
methods permanently.

The International Committee noted that the interest in the OIE
Twining Initiative concept of laboratories is growing from both
developed countries and, in-transition and developing countries which
can use this path to access the OIE network of excellence.

Additions to the Terrestrial and Aquatic Animal Health Codes
------------------------------------------------------------
Consistent with the framework of its usual standard-setting
activities, the Committee updated and adopted new international
standards, aimed at providing better safeguards for the sanitary
safety of world trade, as well as guidelines to better implement
surveillance of animal diseases and zoonoses worldwide.

Significant standards were also adopted in the field of animal
welfare, including a new scientific definition of animal welfare and
new guidelines for aquatic animals.

Discussions emphasized again that the World Trade Organization, under
the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Standards, formally mandates the OIE as the reference organisation
responsible for establishing international standards relating to
animal diseases, including zoonoses.

[In relation to BSE, OIE now recognizes 10 Members as having a
"negligible risk" and 31 as having "controlled risk" status. For the
names of the 10 with "negligible risk" status, subscribers are
referred to the commentary in posting 20080529.1738. The status of
the remaining 131 Members is "undetermined BSE risk."

The General Session approved proposals for some changes in the list
of notifiable diseases, including additions. The list currently
available at
<http://oie.int/eng/maladies/en_classification2008.htm?e1d7>, was
last updated on 21 Jan 2008. Its update is anticipated. - Mod.AS].
