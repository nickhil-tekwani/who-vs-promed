Six cattle died of anthrax during the past 4 days at Hanspukuria under Tehatta police station in Nadia district, Animal Resource Department Deputy Director Manik Chandra Das said today [2 Aug 2014].

"Anthrax generally break out during the rainy season. The germs come from ground through grass," Das said. However, the situation was under control, he said. "We have vaccinated the public cattle of the affected area. In addition to that, we have been keeping a surveillance over the issue," Das added.

[While I don't doubt Dr. Das's remark about anthrax spores in the soil, in some parts of India, cattle do not graze during the monsoon because of the risk to their feet of infection. Instead, they are fed dry forage (hay or similar) supplemented by commercial feed, which will contain bone meal, which is not always sterile. Let us hope this is not the case here. But if it is, there will be coincident outbreaks in other herds on the same feed. But Dr. Das's people have a surveillance system in place along with vaccination; anthrax is enzootic in West Bengal; fingers crossed for them.
