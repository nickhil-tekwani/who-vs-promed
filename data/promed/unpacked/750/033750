_Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in humans is widely distributed and
potentially life threatening
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract from the paper:
Background
----------
Until recently, _Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in humans was
misdiagnosed as _Plasmodium malariae_ malaria. The objectives of the
present study were to determine the geographic distribution of _P.
knowlesi_ malaria in the human population in Malaysia and to
investigate 4 suspected fatal cases.
Methods
-------
Sensitive and specific nested polymerase chain reaction was used to
identify all _Plasmodium_ species present in
(1) blood samples obtained from 960 patients with malaria who were
hospitalized in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, during 2001-2006;
(2) 54 _P. malariae_ archival blood films from 15 districts in Sabah,
Malaysian Borneo (during 2003-2005), and 4 districts in Pahang,
Peninsular Malaysia (during 2004-2005); and (3) 4 patients whose
suspected cause of death was _P. knowlesi_ malaria. For the 4 latter
cases, available clinical and laboratory data were reviewed.
Results
-------
_P. knowlesi_ DNA was detected in 266 (27.7 percent) of 960 of the
samples from Sarawak hospitals, 41 (83.7 percent) of 49 from Sabah,
and all 5 from Pahang. Only _P. knowlesi_ DNA was detected in archival
blood films from the 4 patients who died. All were hyperparasitemic
[had large numbers of the parasites] and developed marked hepatorenal
[liver & kidney] dysfunction.
Conclusions
-----------
Human infection with _P. knowlesi_, commonly misidentified as the more
benign _P. malariae_, is widely distributed across Malaysian Borneo
and extends to Peninsular Malaysia. Because _P. knowlesi_ replicates
every 24 hours, rapid diagnosis and prompt effective treatment are
essential. In the absence of a specific routine diagnostic test for
_P. knowlesi_ malaria, we recommend that patients who reside in or
have traveled to Southeast Asia and who have received a "_P.
malariae_" hyperparasitemia diagnosis by microscopy receive intensive
management as appropriate for severe falciparum malaria.

[Until this study, _P. knowlesi_, the cause of monkey malaria, was
thought to be restricted to monkeys. - Mod.JW]
[This study convincingly demonstrates that _P. knowlesi_ is the 5th
malaria parasite of man.
_P. malariae_ was first described by Laveran in 1880, and it has
always been difficult to explain its patchy, worldwide distribution.
In some areas with high prevalence of _P. malariae_ like East and West
Africa overlapping with areas where primates and monkeys are
abundant was noticed, and it was suggested that there was an animal
reservoir of _P.
malariae_ (PCC Garnham: Malaria parasites and other haemosporidia.
Blackwell, Oxford 1966). If _P. malariae_ and _P. knowlesi_ have been
mixed up in other geographical areas as well this could explain why
the epidemiology of _P. malariae_ has been difficult to explain.
Suppression of _P. malariae_ infection by concomitant _P. falciparum_
infections has been suggested, but never definitely proven, although a
high prevalence of presumptive _P. malariae_ in tribes of the Amazon
with no _P. falciparum_ support this hypothesis (Louis Molineaux: The
epidemiology of human malaria as an explanation of its distribution,
including some implications for its control. Chapter 35, IN: Malaria,
Wernsdorfer and McGregor, Churchill Livingstone, 1988).
The present study shows that microscopic classification is not sufficient to
differentiate _P. malariae_ from _P. knowlesi_, and strains and areas
with _P. malariae_ need to be re-examined with genetic studies of the
parasites previously classified as _P. malariae_. It is conceivable
that the P. malariae described previously in tropical areas are
[actually] _P. knowlesi_ ,whereas the _P. malariae_ originally
described in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean reflect that true
_P. malariae_ is primarily found in subtropical areas. - Mod.EP
