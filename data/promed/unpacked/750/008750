BLACK SPOT AND HUANGLONGBING, CITRUS - EUROPE: ALERT

Data released by the European Union showed that 94 citrus shipments
to Europe were rejected last year [2009] due to phytosanitary
concerns. Some 71 of these consignments had reportedly been
contaminated by citrus black spot.

The fresh produce association AVA-Asaja has accused authorities of
"being complacent" over the threat posed by citrus greening and
citrus black spot, 2 of the deadliest diseases that the sector faces
on a global scale. In the case of citrus greening, AVA claimed that a
plan of action had still not been put in place in Spain, despite the
presence of the disease in the US and the detection of the insect
that spreads greening in the Canary Islands.

"We are playing with fire," said AVA-Asaja president Cristobal
Aguado. "In January (2008), scientists from the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) confirmed that the threat is real, that the controls
are not working and that black spot could become easily acclimatised
to our region."

[Black spot caused by the fungus _Guignardia citricarpa_ is one of
the most serious citrus diseases in Asia but is also found in
sub-Saharan Africa, South America and parts of Oceania. Symptoms can
occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken
lesions of varying size, shape and colour depending on stage of fruit
or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses
since fruit may not show visible symptoms yet while on the tree.
However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable
conditions. Black spot causes significant losses due to premature
fruit and leaf drop and disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit.
Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material
(including nursery plants or scions with latent infections) and by
mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the
season, and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties.
All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents,
except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Diseases management
includes fungicides, phytosanitation and pathogen exclusion.

Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. It is
caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as
_Candidatus_ Liberibacter (asiaticus, africanus or americanus).
Fruits become unmarketable, and trees may die prematurely. _Ca._ L.
asiaticus, posing the main risk in Europe, is spread by the Asian
citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_) as well as by grafting and
possibly seed transmission. Disease management requires an integrated
approach including phytosanitary measures, elimination of inoculum,
and vector control.

Both black spot and citrus greening have been included in the A1
quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
