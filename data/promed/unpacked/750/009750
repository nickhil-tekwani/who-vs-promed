Efforts of 400,000 soldiers and civilians have protected the cities of
Wuhan and Harbin from rising flood waters of the Yangtze River, but large
numbers of residents of rural agricultural areas have been evacuated.
Evacuees include more than 800,000 in the eastern province of Anhui,
200,000 in central Hunan province, and 280,000 in northern Jilin province.
Health minister Zhang Wenkang said that cases of hepatitis, dysentery, and
acute upper respiratory infections were the principal health problems among
the displaced at the present time, but expressed concern for the potential
for outbreaks of snail fever [schistosomiasis among flood workers.
