A rescue center says California sea lions are coming down with a potentially fatal bacterial infection in near-record numbers. The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito says more than 220 sea lions rescued this year [2018] have been diagnosed with leptospirosis.

It's the 2nd-largest outbreak recorded by the rescue center.

The center says outbreaks aren't uncommon but the last major one was in 2011. It involved nearly 200 sea lions.

The bacterial infection affects the kidneys and can be lethal if untreated. The Marine Mammal Center says the strain affecting the sea lions has also been seen in pigs, skunks and foxes. It's transmitted through infected urine, either directly or in contaminated water or soil.

It's unclear how the sea lions contracted the infection.

[The 1st mortality event in sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_) caused by _Leptospira interrogans_ was reported in 1970, in wild populations along the coast of California and Oregon (USA). Thereafter, leptospirosis outbreaks have been occurring at regular intervals, and leptospirosis has been implicated as a cause of premature parturition in California sea lions. The serovar implicated is Pomona. The occurrence of the disease appears to be cyclic. Every 4-5 years there are peaks of exposure (seroprevalence increases), which coincides with sea lion strandings due to leptospirosis.

Recently (Sep-Dec 2017), there was an outbreak in sea lions along the Oregon Coast (see ProMED post 20171030.5413664). - Mod.PMB
