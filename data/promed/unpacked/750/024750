VIRUSES SURVIVE AIRCRAFT TOILET TREATMENT
=========================================

---------------------

Viruses can survive chemical treatment in aircraft toilets, according to a
study commissioned by WHO and the US CDC.
In a report in the New Scientist magazine picked up by news wires,
environmental scientist Mark Sobsey from the University of North Carolina
reported that his team had found viruses in almost half the samples of waste
pumped from on-board toilets. "It was a bit of a jolt for us," Sobsey said,
that the viruses could survive the chemicals used in the aircraft sewage
tanks.

While all the viruses discovered in the waste are associated with enteric
disorders, the finding means that other viruses, including those that cause
hepatitis, could also survive what has hitherto been an acceptable method of
neutralizing waste prior to treatment by commercial sewage plants.
Sobsey, it is reported, said that the commercial treatment does not always
kill all viruses. "That means one to 10 percent of the viruses survive and
are discharged into the environment," he said. "We think there's a risk."
The use of stronger chemicals in all aircraft toilets has been suggested to
stop the potential spread of viruses, bacteria and other pathogens around
the world. [This raises the question of safety for air transport workers and
passengers.]

[Some 15 years or so ago there was a body of research on "blue ice" ... the
frozen contents of airplane toilets/lavatories ... and their risks. Plus ca
change. Of course some of that risk was spectacular as the ice penetrated
roofs and houses in its descent. MHJ-Mod]
