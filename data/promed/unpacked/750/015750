In the message titled "W135 virus (Haj meningitis) prompts warning:
Singapore MUIS urges pilgrims to get vaccinated" dated 27 Apr 2001, the
moderator states that "Vaccine containing the W135 component has not been
used in the UK previously, either for outbreaks or for travelers to the
Haj, as there is little indigenous circulation of W135, and W135 was not
reported in association with the Haj before 2000."
I would like to bring to the attention of your readers of an earlier report
on the same topic by Yousuf et al (1), who in 1995 reported 2 cases of
meningococcemia caused by W135 serotype in Haj pilgrims admitted to King
Abdul Aziz Hospital, Madinah Al-Munawarah, Saudi Arabia. Both the patients
died in the hospital. One was an American and the other an Indonesian. The
authors pointed out that the policy of compulsory vaccination of those
intending to make the Haj pilgrimage against _N. meningitidis_ groups A & C
may result in group B, W135, and Y assuming increasing importance in the
future. A recent Lancet report (2) shows that at least part of this
prediction has become a reality in the form of a W135 epidemic causing
considerable morbidity and possibly mortality.
Yousuf et al. recommended "Therefore to avoid any future meningococcal
epidemics, it may be necessary to use a polyvalent vaccine against _N.
meningitidis_ groups A, C, W135 and Y." In hindsight we could say that if
the health authorities in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere had heeded this
advice, we would have largely avoided the current W135 epidemic, as the
polyvalent vaccine has already proved successful in military personnel from
the USA (3).

[Thank you Dr. Badrinath for these references and observations. It is
doubtful that the use of the W135 component would have completely prevented
transmission (as no vaccine has 100 percent efficacy, see EID article
referred to in 21 Apr 2001 posting). It clearly would have significantly
reduced the transmission and numbers of cases seen. According to the UK
data to date, none of the reported cases associated with this year's Haj
had a history of vaccination. Information on vaccination status of other
Haj-related cases this year would be appreciated as well as information on
studies underway on the vaccine efficacy. - Mod.MPP

Meningococcal disease, serogroup W135
----------------------------------------
During 2000, there was an international outbreak of meningococcal disease
caused by an unusual serogroup: W135 (see Disease Outbreak News index for
meningococcal disease).
During 2001 the following countries have reported cases of W135
meningococcal disease associated with international travel or contact with
travellers to Saudi Arabia, to WHO:
Burkina Faso: 4 cases have been reported. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135
has been laboratory confirmed.
Central African Republic: 3 cases (Haj pilgrims) have been reported. _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
France: 2 cases (close contacts with Haj pilgrims) and no deaths have been
reported. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
Norway: 4 cases (2 contacts with Haj pilgrims) and no deaths have been
reported. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
Saudi Arabia: 109 cases (predominantly Haj pilgrims from outside Saudi
Arabia), including 35 deaths reported between 9 Feb and 22 Mar 2001. _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed in more than
half of the cases.
Singapore: 4 cases (3 close contacts with Haj pilgrims, 1 history of travel
to Saudi Arabia) and no deaths have been reported. Of these, 2 cases
occurred in January 2001, before the main period of pilgrimage to Saudi
Arabia. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 28 laboratory
confirmed cases, including 7 deaths have been reported. Out of these cases,
8 were pilgrims returning from the Haj, 9 were close contacts of the
latter, and data are outstanding on the remaining cases. 2 cases occurred
in January prior to the main pilgrimage period. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup
W135 has been laboratory confirmed.
Meningococcal disease. As with all types of meningococcal disease, early
diagnosis and treatment are essential. The symptoms of group W135
meningococcal disease are the same as for other groups of the disease:
sudden onset of intense headache, high fever, nausea, and vomiting,
photophobia, and stiff neck. The most severe clinical form of the disease,
meningococcal septicemia, can be presented by abrupt onset, high fever,
petechial rash, or purpura.
WHO recommends that chemoprophylaxis be given to close contacts of the
cases, such as persons sleeping in the same dwelling. In most countries
rifampicin is recommended.
In preparation for the Umra and the Haj seasons for next year, the Ministry
of Health of the Government of Saudi Arabia has notified the Ministries of
Health of all countries from which pilgrims arrive that the vaccination
against meningococcal meningitis with the quadrivalent vaccine (serogroups
A,C, Y, and W135) has been added to the health requirements for arrivals
coming to the Umra and Haj.
WHO encourages national reference laboratories to closely monitor
meningococcal disease.
For further information, see the Control of Epidemic Meningococcal Disease.
WHO Practical Guidelines. 2nd edition in English and in French, with annexes.
In order to fully identify and follow the epidemiological spread of the
W135 strain, WHO encourages countries to send specimens to WHO
Collaborating Centres for Meningococcal Infections. The Centres are:

[The Saudi government has responded appropriately with the change in
vaccination requirements for future travel. As vaccination certification is
mandatory for receipt of visa to travel to Saudi Arabia, this should ensure
that Haj pilgrims are appropriately vaccinated prior to travel. - Mod.MPP
