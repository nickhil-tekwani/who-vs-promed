[This is the 7th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or Hubei province in its entirety in the past 24 hours. There are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei. Of 48 cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours all are imported.

According to the report above, a total of 81 518 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 48 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (29 Mar 2020) report was prepared. There were an additional 44 suspected cases reported, all imported. In addition, 1 death was reported from Wuhan. 41 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which continues to increase the number of newly confirmed cases on a daily basis. And Macau reported 1 additional newly confirmed case in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 39.

A total of 48 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Locations of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 771. There are an additional 44 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 125 cases and 4 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (29-30 Mar 2020) when there were 78 newly confirmed cases. A total of 9786 cases including 162 deaths were reported today, up from 9661 cases and 158 deaths yesterday [29 Mar 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count had been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 9 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 68.3% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.3% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 48.0% of the total newly confirmed cases while Seoul represented 19.2% of the newly confirmed case reports and in Gyeonggi 10.4%. Quarantined imported cases represented 12.0% of the newly confirmed cases.

Looking at the information from the English language website, it appears there are 2 main clusters feeding the increases in newly confirmed cases: 1 is related to a religious congregation in Seoul that possibly had a gathering (or a series of gatherings), and the other is a nosocomial outbreak in a hospital in Daegu -- the epicenter of the outbreak.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 217 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). In total, there have been 476 confirmed cases that were importations. Disturbingly, 57.6% were identified in the community, while only 42.4% were detected through airport screening. As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 101 739 cases, including 11 591 deaths, up from 97 689 cases and 11 591 deaths reported on 29 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 29 and 30 Mar 2020 was 4050 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5217 newly confirmed cases between 28 and 29 Mar 2020, a 22.4% reduction in daily newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours and a 32.2% reduction in the past 48 hours. It is early, but perhaps this is the start of a positive trend. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (42 161), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (13 531), and Veneto (8724), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 47.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, representing a drop from the previous 24 hours when they represented 52.8% of nationally reported cases. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 8712 cases and represents 7.2% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 20 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 19 days since the countrywide lockdown. Of note is since a peak on 26 Mar 2020, Lombardy has decreased the daily newly confirmed cases by 54.6%, and Emilia-Romagna has decreased by 48.5%. A very positive trend...

[4] Iran: 41 495 total cases, 2757 deaths

The number of declared coronavirus infections in Iran topped 40 000 Monday [30 Mar 2020], as the government warned the outbreak could run for several more months and cost over 10 000 lives. [A] report by Iran's anti-coronavirus committee said the country may struggle with the outbreak until at least early summer [2020].

Parviz Karami, who published the study on Instagram, said 11 000 people would die in case of "medium government intervention", including measures already taken by Iran. Potential fatalities could drop to 7700 with "maximum" intervention, such as banning movement inside cities and imposing quarantines, he said.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said Monday [30 Mar 2020] another 117 people had died from the virus over the past 24 hours and 3186 new cases had been confirmed, raising the total to more than 41 000. The death toll had reached 2757. According to Jahanpour, 13 911 of those hospitalised have recovered, while 3511 are in a critical condition.

The Islamic republic is one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic. Iran has been scrambling to contain COVID-19's spread since it reported its 1st cases on [19 Feb 2020]. After weeks of refraining from imposing a lockdown or quarantine measures, Tehran decided last Wednesday [25 Mar 2020] to ban all intercity travel until at least [8 Apr 2020]. There is no official lockdown in Iran's cities although the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home to contain the spread of the virus.

According to Rabiei, the administration has endorsed a USD 6-billion rescue package to fend off the damage from the outbreak. It included low-interest loans to businesses to prevent a spike in unemployment and cash handouts to impoverished Iranians.

Some of Iran's top hospitals are experimenting with stem cells to "balance immune system response" in infected patients and find a treatment, according to ISNA [ [Iranian Students News Agency]. Iran also said Monday [30 Mar 2020] it has started mass production of "highly accurate" coronavirus testing kits that could produce results within 3 hours.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 164 253 including 3165 deaths, an increase from 142 321 cases and 2484 deaths. New York state, with 67 325 (41.0%) cumulative case reports and 7677 (35.0%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (3250 newly confirmed cases 14.8%), California (1101 newly confirmed cases 5.0%), and Michigan (1012 newly confirmed cases 4.6%) and to a lesser but increasing amount, Massachusetts, Florida, Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 23.4% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.
