From: Laura D. Kramer <ldkramer@ucdavis.edu>

We have been evaluating several diagnostic assays for SLE [St. Louis
encephalitis and WEE [western equine encephalitis viruses in mosquito
pools containing 1 infected mosquito in pools of 50 (_Culex tarsalis_),
with concentrations of virus from <1 PFU [plaque-forming units in Vero
cell culture to 5.0 log10 PFU. The comparative assays include RT-PCR after
RNA extraction, in situ EIA, antigen capture EIA, and cell culture plaque
assay. The RT-PCR is the most sensitive assay, as well as the fastest, with
results available in <24 hrs. This is also true for detection of virus
(actually viral RNA) in bird sera. However, we use in situ EIA for
surveillance in California. This summer we had planned to compare the
various assays on field material, blindly, after the fact , but we have had
no isolations from mosquito pools to do this.

[If you want SLE virus-infected mosquitoes, there might be some available
in NY City. Laura attended Cornell University/NY City, so she is well
aware of the potential for collecting overwintering mosquitoes in The
Cloisters, the subway, th 42nd Street bus terminal, and other delightful
places. I recommend it. - Mod.CHC
