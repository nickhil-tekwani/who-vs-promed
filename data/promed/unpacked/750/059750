Rabies cases spark emergency action
-------------------------------------
Rabies is once again threatening western Europe. This week emergency
teams are fanning out across 4 German states and neighbouring parts
of France, trying to vaccinate enough foxes to stop the disease
spreading, as national and regional authorities trade accusations.
The reason for the flare-up appears to be patchy vaccination of wild
foxes in the German state of Hesse. Officials at Germany's national
rabies laboratory in Wusterhausen say they will stamp out this nest
of infection this year, by vaccinating foxes every 6 weeks if they
have to.
But their counterparts in France, Switzerland and Belgium are
expressing "serious concern" that unless recommendations about fox
vaccination made by a panel of European Union scientists in 2002 are
strictly applied, large areas of Europe where rabies had been
eradicated could be reinfected.
Rabies eradication was one of Europe's success stories. Switzerland
became rabies-free in 1998, thanks to a huge campaign in which
biscuits doped with vaccine were distributed in fox habitats. France
was next to eliminate the disease, in 2000, followed by Belgium and
Luxembourg in 2001. In 2000, this helped convince the rabies-free UK
to end compulsory quarantine for mammals brought in from some
European countries.
But in Germany, stubborn nests of infection persisted. Part of the
problem was ensuring even vaccination in urban areas, where placing
baits can be difficult, says Thomas Muller, head of the Wusterhausen
lab. "Another big problem was human error." States managed their
vaccination campaigns themselves, with varying effectiveness.
Muller's team is trying to get better cooperation. Several former
problem states, including Bavaria, have not found any cases for
several years. But there has been no let-up in Hesse, which found 24
rabid foxes last year [2004]. In December, one turned up in
Baden-Wurttemberg, which had been rabies-free since 1996 and stopped
vaccinating in 2002. And in January 2005, Rhineland-Palatinate,
rabies-free since 1998, found rabid foxes near the Hesse border.
Late in 2004 all 3 states plus Bavaria carried out emergency
vaccination in threatened areas, and this week they are air-dropping
vaccine-laced bait across thousands of square kilometres. France
stopped vaccinating in 2003, but Florence Cliquet, head of the French
national rabies lab in Nancy, says her team will bait fox dens along
the German border this week, and will vaccinate a 60-kilometre-wide
border strip in May 2005.
Europe's fox population has grown as much as 8-fold in the past
decade, and this has raised fears that rabies could easily get out of
control. "The virus could really spread fast if it got loose now,"
says Reto Zanoni of the Swiss Rabies Centre in Berne.
Michel Aubert, former head of the French lab, blames the persistence
of rabies in Germany on the ineffectiveness of the German vaccine,
and points to figures suggesting that it takes twice as many German
as French baits to clear an area of rabies.
He also claims the virus in German vaccine sometimes reverts to the
disease-causing form. This is known to have happened once in Austria,
but Muller says there have been only 3 suspected cases in Germany in
the past 5 years. He insists the main problem is the way the
vaccination campaigns have been run. The EU must hope he is right.
New member states such as Poland still have rabies problems, and most
vaccination campaigns rely on the German vaccine.

[The much-praised oral rabies vaccination of wildlife has been
recently reviewed; see Rupprecht CE, Hanlon CA & Slate D. (2004).
Oral vaccination of wildlife against rabies: opportunities and
challenges in prevention and control. Dev Biol (Basel). 119:173-84.
The paper includes the following statement:
"Despite the progress observed and the absence of substantive adverse
environmental or health effects, oral vaccination is not a panacea,
and should be viewed as an important adjunct to traditional
prevention and control techniques in human and veterinary medicine.
Local outbreak suppression of rabies among free-ranging wildlife is
documented, and regional elimination of particular virus variants
among specific, targeted carnivore hosts is demonstrable, but true
disease eradication is not achievable at the present time by current
techniques".
