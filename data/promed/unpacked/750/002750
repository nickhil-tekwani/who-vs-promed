Lesotho anthrax could hit Free State
------------------------------------
[South African] Free State farmers were warned on Tuesday [4 Mar
2008] that an anthrax outbreak in Lesotho could affect them due to
the "porous" nature of the border between the 2 countries.

Free State agriculture department spokesperson Ntai Mokhitli said the
national department of agriculture had informed the province about
the discovery of an outbreak of anthrax in Lesotho. "We are forced to
immediately initiate a vaccination campaign to combat this incidence
and to alert members of the public to be cautious."

Mokhitli said the areas the department would focus on were Zastron,
Van Stadenrus, Wepener, Hobhouse, Ladybrand, Clocolan, Ficksburg,
Fouriesburg, Clarens and Qwaqwa -- encompassing the whole Free State
border with Lesotho.

The Free State department was in the process of establishing
surveillance measures to monitor the movement of animals within a
20-kilometre [12.4-mile] radius from these areas.

Mokhitli urged the public and farmers to be on the look out for
strange behaviour among their animals, even domestic animals, and to
report it to agricultural authorities. He said no cases had been
reported in the Free State by Tuesday.

[More recent announcements on IOL have not added anything
significantly new to this early report. Lesotho suffers sporadic
attacks of anthrax involving essentially only cattle and sheep, but
latterly horses. Lesotho reported 3 outbreaks in Mafeteng in 2005; 3
in April 2006 in Masero with significant deaths; but no outbreaks (so
far) in 2007. In 2006 South Africa reported 8 outbreaks in
Mpumalanga, Northern Cape Province, Limpopo, and the Kruger National
Park. In January 2007 only 2 outbreaks in the Northern Cape Province
and in North West Province. We await information from Lesotho on the
extent of the apparent problem there. - Mod.MHJ]
