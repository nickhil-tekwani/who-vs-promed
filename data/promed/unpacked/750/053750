The Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso reported last weekend that a 16-year-
old boy from Gaoua, 310 km SW of the capital, Ouagadougou, had been confirmed
as a case of YF by the YF reference laboratory for West Africa in Dakar,
Senegal [Institut Pasteur]. A team has been sent to investigate the
situation.
All children under 1 year of age in Burkina Faso have the right to receive
the YF vaccine free as part of their infant vaccination series [it does not
say what the coverage level is in the affected area.] Health officials are
appealing to the population to bring their children in for vaccination.

[Adults need to be vaccinated also. YF is uncommon in this country -- see
refs. below. This is the same area that was affected in 1998, when 30 000
doses of vaccine were distributed in the area -- the outbreak before that was
in 1983. But the disease appears to be in one of its breakout cycles in West
Africa this year, with cases in other West African countries -- they should
be looking for cases in Cote dÂ´Ivoire. - Mod.JW]
