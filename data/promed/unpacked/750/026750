Hidden away in rural Lewis County, a woman with dozens of animals
appears to be violating a public health quarantine. Some of the
woman's animals tested positive for a contagious animal disease last
month [May 2007].
Not far from cages upon cages of cooped-up canines, an old sign reads
"Three Mountain Dog Rescue." Owner Theresa Hutton calls herself a
savior for critters. Even though a quarantine is in place, the woman
admits to allowing animals to come and go from her property.
The woman has nearly 100 dogs on her property. She says she sells
animals to pay for their food and care, and she admits that despite
this quarantine, animals are still flowing in.
"I don't want people dropping them off at the [dog] pound or in the
road or in the woods, which is a lot of what they do," she said.
But critics say it's no rescue shelter at all, but more like a prison
camp. Neighbor Tonja Nichols is one of those critics. "I just think
it's an outrage. They're loud, they're smelly, they're not taken care
of," she said.
In fact, last month [May 2007], police and health officials swept
through the property and euthanized 41 dogs after turning up a
contagious animal disease called brucellosis.
Investigators considered Hutton's treatment of the animals neglectful.
They removed horses and ask the prosecutor to file charges. Hutton
says that's all baseless. "They get the shots every year," she said.
Some people say it's a puppy mill. "We do a little bit of breeding,
but no, it's not a puppy mill," she said.
There is a quarantine filed by health officials. The order says "no
animals" may enter or leave. Still, Hutton admits she's accepted dogs
that have been dropped off, and a horse showed up after the
quarantine. Hutton claims the quarantine doesn't apply to horses.
"Just the dogs are under the quarantine order," she said. "That's what
they told me."
"If there is a horse on the property, that would be a violation of the
quarantine order," said Lewis County Prosecutor Michael Golden. The
prosecutor says he plans to look into this and if he finds the
quarantine has been violated, he'll seek a civil court order enforcing
the quarantine. He also says sometime next week he plans to file
charges against Hutton for animal neglect to her horses.
Hutton says she always charges at least USD 50 for animals she allows
to be adopted. She says that way she can make sure the dogs and cats
go to responsible owners.

[_Brucella canis_ is the bacterial organism that primarily causes
brucellosis in canines. It is a gram negative intracellular
bacterium. Other species, _B. abortus_ and _B. suis_ have, on
occasion, been known to infect canines.
Reproductive failure is the most prevalent clinical sign. Females may
have embryonic death and resorption about 20 days post mating or may
have abortions about 45-55 days of gestation. Consequently, the
complaint is most often a failure to conceive. The male may share in
the cause of this apparent failure as well.
Males may have epididymitis in one or both testes and/or infertility.
Testicular atrophy and a moist scrotal dermatitis may be present. The
semen of infected males has a large number of abnormal sperm, or no
sperm at all.
Loss of libido, lethargy, and generalized lymph node enlargement may
be noticed in both genders. Premature aging has been noted in both
genders when infected.
Diagnosis can be difficult. Culture from the blood, lymph nodes,
marrow, urine, milk, vaginal discharges or semen is the only
definitive diagnosis.
Experimentally, the organism was seen in 100 percent of the dogs at 2
months post infection, and the bacteremia [bacteria in the
bloodstream] lasted 6-12 months. The organism was recovered in 100
percent of the males and 30 percent of the females in tissues (lymph
node, spleen) when they were abacteremic.
Summary of diagnosis: Use the RSAT, 2ME-RSAT [see original reference
below for explanations] to screen and identify all negative animals.
Use the AGID cell wall antigen test to confirm the disease. Culture is
the only definitive diagnosis and is the best diagnostic test in the
1st 2 months of the disease; however, dogs become abacteremic after
27-64 months. Treatment can be difficult and expensive, especially in
the case of kennel animals. The urine of infected male dogs may tend
to concentrate the organism such that cleaning up urine may present a
risk to immune compromised individuals (cancer patients or HIV or
other causes of immune suppression).
This report doesn't specifically indicate that the quarantine was for
brucellosis, but it is perhaps implied. If the quarantine was for
brucellosis, then selling animals not only violates the quarantine but
may place some people at risk of the disease. It may also represent a
risk of spreading the disease to other animals. This report does not
tell us the method used to diagnose the dogs. Clearly, from the
discussion presented above, an accurate diagnosis is important. Horses
may also get brucellosis, although the mechanism is different, and
generally horses do not get _Brucella canis_.
