The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Meeker County, Minnesota.

This is the 9th confirmation in a commercial flock in Minnesota [since 4 Mar 2015]. The flock of 310 000 turkeys is located within the Mississippi flyway where this strain of avian influenza has previously been identified.

Samples from the turkey flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirmed the findings. NVSL is the only internationally recognized AI reference laboratory in the United States.

APHIS is working closely with the Minnesota Board of Animal Health on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the premises and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

As part of the existing USDA avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners as well as industry are responding quickly and decisively to these outbreaks by following these 5 basic steps:
1. Quarantine: restricting movement of poultry and poultry-moving equipment into and out of the control area
2. Eradicate: humanely euthanizing the affected flock(s)
3. Monitor region: testing wild and domestic birds in a broad area around the quarantine area
4. Disinfect: kills the virus in the affected flock locations, and
5. Test: confirming that the poultry farm is AI virus-free.

USDA also is working with its partners to actively look and test for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

The Minnesota Department of Health is working directly with poultry workers at the affected facility to ensure that they are taking the proper precautions. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.

[The US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry, to be low. No human infections with the virus have been detected at this time.

Minnesota
---------
The highly pathogenic form of H5N2 avian flu was confirmed today [10 Apr 2015] on 4 more commercial turkey farms in Minnesota -- 3 in previously unaffected counties -- affecting 189 000 birds, while an H5 strain was detected in a North Dakota turkey flock.

The virus has now infected turkeys on 13 Minnesota farms in a little over a month. Minnesota officials also announced today [10 Apr 2015] that a farm housing more than 300 000 turkeys whose outbreak was announced 2 days ago will need to cull all the birds on its premises.

The new outbreaks have affected 48 000 turkeys in Cottonwood County; 66 000 in Lyon County; 30 000 in Watonwan County; and 45 000 in Stearns County, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said today [10 Apr 2015] in an update. The 189 000 newly affected turkeys bring to 872 000 the number of affected birds on Minnesota commercial farms since early March [2015], the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) said in an update today.

The outbreak in Stearns County is its 4th in recent weeks, while the other 3 counties are experiencing their 1st outbreaks. The newly affected counties are in the southwest corner of the state, south of the Minnesota River, while Stearns County is in central Minnesota. Cottonwood and Watonwan are neighboring counties, while Cottonwood abuts Nobles County, which reported an outbreak on 2 Apr 2015.

All 9 affected Minnesota counties are in the Mississippi flyway followed by migrating wild birds.

As with previous outbreaks, samples from the 4 newly affected flocks were tested at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) national lab in Ames, Iowa, after elevated levels of bird deaths were noted. All birds on the affected farms will be euthanized to prevent disease spread, officials noted.

The MBAH also said today [10 Apr 2015] that all turkeys on a Meeker County farm of 310 000 birds that was confirmed to be H5N2 infected on 8 Apr 2015 will need to be euthanized [see item [1] above]. Beth Thompson, DVM, JD, MBAH assistant director, told CIDRAP News on 8 April 2015 that there was a chance that some of the turkeys might be spared, but that did not turn out to be the case.

Minnesota is the nation's largest turkey producer, at 46 million birds per year, according to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association (MTGA). Newly affected Lyon County is the 4th-leading turkey-producing county in Minnesota, according to the MTGA. Kandiyohi, which has had 2 H5N2 outbreaks, leads the state, followed by Stearns County.

North Dakota
------------
Meanwhile, a state veterinary lab in North Dakota confirmed H5 avian flu in a commercial turkey flock in Dickey County in the southeastern part of the state on the border with South Dakota, the Associated Press (AP) reported yesterday [9 Apr 2015].

North Dakota State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab confirmed that samples from the flock of 40 000 turkeys tested positive for H5 after the flock owner reported elevated death rates. State officials are awaiting results from the APHIS lab in Ames for the exact strain, which could be H5N2.

South Dakota has had 2 H5N2 outbreaks in a week, the most recent reported yesterday [9 Apr 2015]. They were in separate counties in the east-central part of the state, more than 100 miles [161 km] from the North Dakota outbreak.

In addition to the Minnesota and South Dakota outbreaks, Missouri has had 2 H5N2 outbreaks in recent weeks and Arkansas 1. The virus was also confirmed in a backyard poultry flock in Kansas last month [March 2015], and earlier in the winter it cropped up in several western states.

The APHIS said in today's [10 Apr 2015] update that the USDA's avian flu response plans call for federal and state officials to follow 5 response steps: (1) quarantining poultry and equipment; (2) eradicating affected flocks; (3) monitoring wild and domestic birds in the outbreak region; (4) disinfecting affected farms; and (5) testing the farm to ensure it is free of avian flu viruses.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the risk of H5N2 to humans low. Human cases have yet to be detected.

[This disease continues to spread. While wild birds have been blamed as the source of the problem, it seems strange that the disease continues to spread to areas where wild birds and affected birds may have no contact. One has to consider the issue of whether there are other methods of transporting the disease. For example, would trucks delivering feed, or removing litter, be transporting the disease between bird premises?
