Seminar participants hit by food poisoning
------------------------------------------
A total of 7 people were admitted to the RIPAS emergency ward
yesterday [25 Feb 2008] where they were diagnosed with food poisoning
in what appears to be the result of bad 'nasi ayam' that was served to
participants attending a Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) seminar.

The seminar held at UBD, dubbed the Information Week For Electronic
Resources, was organized by the Ministry of Education. Teachers and
librarians from around the nation were invited for the seminar.

"They were serving food there, like nasi ayam which tasted quite good
actually," said a teacher who was diagnosed with food poisoning at
the emergency ward. He said participants who did not eat the nasi
ayam were "okay" and were not afflicted by any of the symptoms.

"About 2 hours after eating it, I started feeling dizzy and had a
stomach ache. I started vomiting a lot and so my wife took me to the
emergency ward. It was here I met some other patients with food
poisoning who also attended the seminar," said the teacher.

"We have taken samples for testing and so far we know of 7 people
from the seminar who were infected," he said. Some 300 people
attended the seminar."

[With a short incubation, the illness may have been caused by
pre-formed bacterial toxins such as those produced by _Staphylococcus
aureus_, _Bacillus cereus_, _Clostridium perfringens_ or other toxic
substances. These illnesses may cause vomiting, diarrhea, or both and
are usually short in duration (less than 24 hours) and not associated
with prominent fever. With prominent vomiting here, staphylococcal
enterotoxin illness should be strongly considered. In such cases,
enterotoxin-producing _S. aureus_ can be isolated from the food.
However, since nasi ayam is chicken fried rice, the possibility of _B.
cereus_ disease also needs consideration.
