[1] California: vaccine mandate
Date: Sun 3 Oct 2021

California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Fri 1 Oct 2021 announced the nation's first coronavirus vaccination mandate for schoolchildren, requiring that all elementary through high school students get the shots once the vaccine gains final approval from the U.S. government for different age groups.

The government has fully approved the COVID-19 vaccine for those 16 and over but only granted an emergency authorization for anyone 12 to 15. Once federal regulators fully approve it for that group, the state will require students in 7th through 12th grades to get vaccinated in both public and private schools. Newsom said he expects that requirement to be in place by 1 Jul 2021.

California will require the COVID-19 vaccine for students in kindergarten through 6th grades after it gets final federal approval for children 5 to 11.

"We want to end this pandemic. We are all exhausted by it," the Democratic governor told reporters at a San Francisco middle school.

The announcement comes as infections in most of California have dropped markedly in the last month. Newsom has been emboldened after easily defeating a recall effort last month following a campaign where he emphasized his commitment to vaccine mandates to end the pandemic.

In Los Angeles County -- the nation's largest, with more than 10 million residents -- just 1.7% of people tested for the virus have it and daily infections are down by half in the last month, when most kids went back to school.

"These numbers are amazingly low given that 3000-plus schools are now open countywide," county Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thu 30 Sep 2021.

She noted that though the number of outbreaks in schools has increased slightly in recent weeks, the overall number is small and largely related to youth sports.

The state's vaccine mandate for schoolchildren would take effect the semester after the federal government grants final approval. If it comes in January [2022], then the mandate would take effect in July [2022].

Students would be granted religious and medical exemptions, but the rules for how the state would apply them have not been written yet. Any student who refuses to take the vaccine would be forced to complete an independent study course at home.

Until now, Newsom had left the decision on student vaccine mandates to local school districts, leading to a variety of different orders across some of the state's largest districts. 5 districts in California have imposed their own requirements, including Los Angeles, the nation's 2nd largest school district, which is set to take effect in January [2022].

Newsom's plan does not override those districts' plans, saying school districts can "accelerate" the requirements.

Dr. Peter N. Bretan, president of the California Medical Association, said the organization "strongly supports" the governor's decision.

"This is not a new idea. We already require vaccines against several known deadly diseases before students can enroll in schools," he said. "The Newsom administration is simply extending existing public health protections to cover this new disease, which has caused so much pain and suffering across our state, our nation and the entire globe over the last 18 months."

Newsom has made it a point of pride to be the first in the nation to issue a variety of pandemic-related school mandates.

In August [2021], California became the 1st state to require all teachers and staff in K-12 public and private schools to get vaccinated or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. Newsom also issued a school mask mandate earlier in the summer [2021] for indoor classes that applies to all teachers and students.

[2] Lineage B.1.620

Abstract
--------
Distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages, discovered through various genomic surveillance initiatives, have emerged during the pandemic following unprecedented reductions in worldwide human mobility. We here describe a SARS-CoV-2 lineage -- designated B.1.620 -- discovered in Lithuania and carrying many mutations and deletions in the spike protein shared with widespread variants of concern (VOCs), including E484K, S477N and deletions HV69D, Y144D, and LLA241/243D. As well as documenting the suite of mutations this lineage carries, we also describe its potential to be resistant to neutralising antibodies, accompanying travel histories for a subset of European cases, evidence of local B.1.620 transmission in Europe with a focus on Lithuania, and significance of its prevalence in Central Africa owing to recent genome sequencing efforts there. We make a case for its likely Central African origin using advanced phylogeographic inference methodologies incorporating recorded travel histories of infected travellers.

...Discussion
----------
In this study, we have presented evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 lineage designated B.1.620, first detected in Europe in late February [2021], is associated with the central African region, where it appears to circulate at high prevalence, and has been introduced into Europe, North America, and Asia on multiple occasions. A fair number of known B.1.620 genomes that were sequenced in Europe stem from travel-related cases returning from Cameroon [Fig. 3 at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26055-8#Fig3], and recently sequenced genomes from CAR and Cameroon similarly belong to lineage B.1.620, suggesting that the central African region is likely to be the immediate source of this lineage...

Our work highlights that global inequalities, as far as infectious disease monitoring is concerned, have tangible impacts around the world and that until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is brought to heel everywhere, nowhere is safe for long. Additionally, we highlight the importance of collecting and sharing associated metadata with genome sequences, in particular regarding individual travel histories, as well as collection dates and locations, all of which are important to perform detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis. We only observed one single instance where a GISAID entry was accompanied by travel information and had to request such information for all the samples in our core dataset by contacting each individual lab. Whereas many labs were quick to provide the requested information, we were certainly not able to retrieve all related individual travel histories.

The scientific community therefore still faces the important task of reporting and sharing such critical metadata in a consistent manner, an aspect that has been brought to attention again during the ongoing pandemic.

[A very interesting thread giving readers an insight into how genomic data unfolds in real time, and the difficulty of getting it published quickly can be seen at https://mobile.twitter.com/evogytis/status/1443917026653839379.

The thread by Gytis Dudas @evogytis on Oct 1 ends with, "To conclude, even though B.1.620 is probably dead the circumstances that let it happen are still alive. Central Africa seems far away from Europe but the world we live in simply doesn't work that way anymore..." Which is why it is important for there to be equitable distribution of vaccines. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries including the USA (46 482), UK (30 043), Turkey (27 973), Russia (25 219), India (23 161), Brazil (13 466), Philippines (14 739), Romania (12 590), Ukraine (11 809), Thailand (11 375), Malaysia (10 915), and Iran (10 135), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5863 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 30 Sep 2021 to late 01 Oct 2021). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 13.2% decrease in daily reported cases and a 4.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 235.41 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.81 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
