And 1 in Shaanxi), and 1277 suspected cases were newly added.

1779 new cases were cured and discharged on the same day, 25 318 close contacts were released from medical observation, and 113 severe cases were reduced.

As of 24:00 on [19 Feb 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 56 303 confirmed cases (among which, 11 864 were severe cases), a total of 16 155 [patients were cured and discharged, and a total of 2118 died.

[According to the report above, there have now been a total of 74 576 cases of confirmed COVID-19 reported from China, representing an increase of 391 cases in the past 24 hours, of which 349 (89.3%) were in Hubei. In addition, there were 114 deaths reported, of which 108 (94.7%) were in Hubei. There were 3 new cases reported from Hong Kong.

Reporting criteria have changed so that clinically compatible cases are now be classified as suspected case. Adjustments were made in numbers of previously clinically confirmed cases who had negative nucleic acid tests for the SARS-CoV-2. What is impressive here is the marked decrease in newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As they are basically reverting back to using laboratory confirmed cases, the numbers of daily confirmed cases were trending downward on a daily basis. Time will tell if this trend continues.

[As mentioned previously, this website is constantly updated as new information comes in, so it is likely that when you read this post, the numbers will not match the linked numbers because they will have been updated since the post was prepared.

According to the data on the Johns Hopkins website, there are now a total of 1095 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from outside mainland China, representing an increase of 82 cases reported in the past 24 hours. The 14 cases from the Diamond Princess that had been added to the USA case count yesterday [18 Feb 2020] have been removed. One sees that the media reported 20 cases in South Korea have not been added to this website as yet. A very challenging situation having countries in all global time zones reporting officially their case counts around the 24-hour clock. - Mod.MPP]

2 positive cases of coronavirus confirmed in Iran
-------------------------------------
Iran's Health Ministry has confirmed 2 cases of coronavirus, the 1st in the country. The report states that there was also an unspecified number of other suspected cases and that those individuals have been isolated.

There are currently no details on the nationality of the 2 people infected by the virus or the state of their health.

An official in the health ministry said that 2 confirmed cases were detected in the central province of Qom. Subsequent tests were in progress, and the results of these tests will be released to the public once they are finalised, the official added.

A member of the National Committee on Infectious Diseases of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education said: "The deaths of 2 people due to the coronavirus indicate that other people close to them are likely to be infected and should be quarantined, and the number of patients is likely to be higher [another report mentioned that 25 individuals are under quarantine].

Massoud Mardani on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020] evening added: "My information on the state of the new coronavirus in Iran is based on reports from the Ministry of Health, and according to the Ministry of Health, 2 people have been infected and have died as a result of the disease. Further details of the Ministry of Health will be made public. The people who were in contact with the 2 men are under surveillance and must be quarantined and tested," he said.

Two deaths have also been tested, and the results have been positive, but a new coronavirus test has been sent to the Pasteur Institute of Tehran for confirmation.

A member of the State Committee on Infectious Diseases of the Ministry of Health said: "It appears that the 2 patients had been tested before their deaths, but the final test results will be determined after their deaths."

He added: "Depending on the course of the disease, there are 5% of other cases, and people need to take care and prevention seriously."

He continued: "The new coronavirus diagnostic kit is available to the Pasteur Institute and is available for a few cases where the corona's initial test is positive, and the infectious doctor confirms it. In order to prevent the epidemic, the way to communicate suspicious people with other people should be taken [sic?]," the infectious specialist said.

People who have been in contact with 2 deceased people should be identified quickly. These people must be separated and treated so that the disease is not passed on to others.

This afternoon (Wednesday [19 Feb 2020]), Kianoush Jahanpour, head of the Ministry of Health's Public Relations and Information Center, published a news release on the Ministry of Health's website, confirming the confirmation of 2 positive cases of coronavirus in 2 people in Qom. Mohammad Mehdi Goya, head of the Ministry of Infectious Diseases Management Center, announced later that the Ministry of Health is completing information on these patients, but at the same time, the head of Qom University of Medical Sciences announced the confirmation of the death of 2 patients with coronavirus.

The coronavirus has so far killed nearly 2000 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, which estimates that between 3 and 4 percent of people with the underlying virus die of the disease.

Information on the findings of epidemiological investigations would be helpful. Did these individuals have a history of travel to locations with known COVID-19 cases? Or did they have contact with individuals returning from locations with known COVID-19 cases? Or contact with contacts at higher risk of exposure?

As these cases are appearing de novo, is it possible these individuals were infected with the MERS-CoV and not the coronavirus causing COVID-19? Follow-up media reports mention quarantining a large number of individuals in Qom and concern re: the number of contacts of these cases.

Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare said that 79 cases were confirmed after testing 607 people aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which sees its 14-day quarantine at Yokohama end today [19 Feb 2020]. Of the 79 cases, 68 do not have symptoms of the virus.

The ministry added that there are now 621 known cases on the ship, after testing a total of 3011 passengers and crew. The Wednesday [19 Feb 2020] announcement came after the ministry announced 99 new cases on Monday [17 Feb 2020] and 88 new cases on Tuesday [18 Feb 2020].

People who have tested negative for the virus began disembarking from the cruise ship on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020]. Local outlet NHK reported that about 500 people are due to leave the ship today [19 Feb 2020]. Japan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Tuesday [18 Feb 2020] the disembarking process will take about 3 days.

[Positive test results continue to come in. I have been unable to find an online resource giving the number of samples from the Diamond Princess that have already been processed and the number of samples still pending. It definitely appears as though there was significant transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 on board the boat. Whether it was all related to the pre-quarantine date or whether it reflects continued transmission on the boat awaits a final analysis. An "easy" assessment would be in finding returning individuals from the cruise positive after their returns, signaling transmission most likely occurred following the start of the quarantine. - Mod.MPP]

705 coronavirus cases confirmed in Japan
------------------
Japanese authorities confirmed 705 cases of the new coronavirus as of 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020]. The figure is based on reports from the health ministry and municipalities across the country.

70 of the cases mostly involve Chinese tourists or those who contracted the virus in Japan. 621 cases were found on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, including 79 new cases confirmed on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020].

The number of cases confirmed among those evacuated by government-chartered flights from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is 14. This includes 1 case confirmed on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020] among the 65 people repatriated on the 5th chartered plane.

By prefecture, 4 cases were in Hokkaido; 25 in Tokyo; 4 in Chiba Prefecture; 7 in Kanagawa; 8 in Aichi prefectures; 1 in Mie Prefecture; 2 each in Okinawa and Kyoto prefectures; 1 each in Osaka and Nara prefectures; and 12 in Wakayama Prefecture.

Furthermore, 3 government and quarantine officials were confirmed to be infected.

The health ministry said 20 of those diagnosed with the virus in Japan, excluding Diamond Princess crew and passengers, were discharged from hospital after recovery by Tuesday [18 Feb 2020].

South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 20 new cases of the virus on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020], raising the country's total from 31 to 51.

Of the new cases, the KCDC said that 15 are contacts of the 31st coronavirus case in the country: A 61-year-old South Korean woman who lives in Daegu, a city in North Gyeongsang province, 185 miles southeast of Seoul. The woman tested positive on Tuesday [19 Feb 2020]. 14 of the 15 attend the same church as the woman, and the other one had contact with the woman at a hospital.

"A further epidemiological investigation at the church is underway to determine who was the source of the infection and what the pathway was," KCDC Director Jung Eun-kyeong said in a briefing, according to The Korea Times.

Also among the new cases in South Korea is an 11-year-old girl, who is the daughter of the country's 20th case, a 41-year-old Korean woman who tested positive on [5 Feb 2020] while in self-quarantine.

Another case involves a 77-year-old man from Seoul who had not traveled outside South Korea recently.

Also, on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020] a South Korean government plane returned from Japan with 7 evacuees -- 6 South Koreans and a Japanese spouse -- who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, according to national broadcaster KBS. The evacuees are set to undergo isolation in South Korea for 14 days at Incheon International Airport's quarantine office.

[5] WHO Situation Report 30 (as of 19 Feb 2020*)
Date: Wed 19 Feb 2020

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200219-sitrep-30-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6e50645_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO is working with an international network of statisticians and mathematical modelers to estimate key epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, such as the incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset), case fatality ratio (CFR, the proportion of cases that die), and the serial interval (the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case). Reports of current analyses that have estimated these parameters are provided in this Situation Report as a summary of currently available evidence. These values should be considered preliminary and parameters will likely be updated as more information becomes available. Modelling can support decision-making but needs to be combined with rigorous data collection and a comprehensive analysis of the situation. Please see the Subject in Focus section for more information.

- Several online courses related to COVID-19 have been added to the OpenWHO platform:

A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov (available in French https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-au-ncov, Simplified Chinese https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov-ZH, and Spanish https://openwho.org/courses/introduccion-al-ncov as well).

Critical Care of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections

Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT https://openwho.org/courses/eprotect-acute-respiratory-infections

Subject in focus: Advanced Analytics and Mathematical Modelling
In order to mount an appropriate public health response for any epidemic pathogen, information and analyses of transmission dynamics, severity of disease and the impact of control and mitigation measures are needed. In addition to descriptive analyses of available epidemiologic and clinical data, mathematical modelling and advanced analytics are helpful tools that can be used to estimate key transmission and severity parameters.

WHO has been working with an international network of statisticians and mathematical modelers to estimate key epidemiologic parameters of COVID-19, such as the incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset), case fatality ratio (CFR, the proportion of cases who die), infection fatality ratio (IFR, the portion of all of those infected who die), and the serial interval (the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case).

To calculate these parameters, statisticians and modelers use case-based data from COVID-19 surveillance activities, and data captured from early investigations, such as those studies which evaluate transmission within clusters of cases in households or other closed settings. Preliminary estimates /1, /2, /3, /4, /5, /6, /7 of median incubation period are 5-6 days (ranging from 0-14 days) and estimates for the serial interval /4, /8 range from 4.4 to 7.5 days. Several estimates have been shared in pre-print and information will be updated as more information becomes available.

The confirmed case fatality ratio, or CFR, is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of confirmed cases at one point in time. Within China, the confirmed CFR, as reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, /9 is 2.3%. This is based on 1023 deaths amongst 44 415 laboratory-confirmed cases as of [11 Feb 2020]. This CFR does not include the number of more mild infections that may be missed from current surveillance, which has largely focused on patients with pneumonia requiring hospitalization; nor does it account for the fact that recently confirmed cases may yet develop severe disease, and some may die. As the outbreak continues, the confirmed CFR may change. Outside of China, CFR estimates among confirmed cases reported is lower than reported from within China. However, it is too early to draw conclusions as to whether there are real differences in the CFR inside and outside of China, as final outcome data (that is, who will recover and who will die) for the majority of cases reported from outside China are not yet known.

Modeling is a helpful tool to try to account for missed cases, such as those that are mild cases potentially missed in current surveillance activities, and the time lag between onset and death. Using an estimated number of total infections, the Infection Fatality Ratio can be calculated. This represents the fraction of all infections (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) that result in death. Based on these available analyses, current IFR estimates /10, /11, /12 range from 0.3% to 1%. Without population-based serologic studies, it is not yet possible to know what proportion of the population has been infected with COVID-19.

Modeling has also been used to estimate the impact of the [23 Jan 2020] Wuhan travel ban on reducing transmission both inside and outside of China. /13, /14 According to these models, travel restrictions alone are projected to have only a modest effect on the progression of the outbreak; they would need to be combined with other public health interventions, such as early case isolation, other forms of mobility restrictions, social distancing and population-level behavioral changes to be effective. This is in line with several studies on travel restrictions during past influenza pandemics, including H1N1, reported in the recently published paper on "Nonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings--International Travel-Related Measures" /15.

During the February 2019 COVID-19 WHO Global research and innovation forum, the international gathering of scientists stressed that additional information is needed to refine the forecasting models, and to inform targeted guidance and measures for the public health response. This information should come from early investigations, such as:

- in the community and in households
- through health care workers risk factor assessments
- through clinical characterization of hospitalized cases
- in returning traveller cohort studies

WHO has provided protocols for these investigations, which are available on the WHO website https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations. This information will help to update the estimates of parameters.

[Note that the table included in this update above has changed. It is now splitting locations of transmission into 3 possibilities:

1) China
2) Outside reporting country and outside China, and
3) In reporting country.

The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China remains at 14 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, and Egypt). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has been occurring on the ship.

Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
