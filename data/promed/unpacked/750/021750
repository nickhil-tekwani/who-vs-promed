From: Gary Wobeser <GARY.WOBESER@usask.ca>

In the explanatory material that accompanied the information on the
suspected epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) outbreak in New Jersey, the
statement is made that "a similar hemorrhagic disease called bluetongue
also occurs throughout the U.S. and Canada". This is in error.
Bluetongue is only known to have occurred in one small focus in Canada,
that being the very southern portion of the Okanagan Valley in British
Columbia. A brief report of describing the simultaneous occurrence of EHD 2
virus and bluetongue at that site is in the Veterinary Record 122:340. The
only other documented occurrence of mortality from EHD virus in Canada
occurred in a small area of southern Alberta in 1962.

[Gary, thanks for the correction and the reference. The wording of the
statement is in error. I offer my apologies. The statement should have read
that bluetongue has occurred in Canada and throughout the US. - Mod.TG
