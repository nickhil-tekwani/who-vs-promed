[1] CDC mask announcement
[1a] Fully vaccinated
Date: Thu 13 May 2021 5:49 p.m. ET

https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996582891/fully-vaccinated-people-can-stop-wearing-masks-indoors-and-outdoors-cdc-says


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that fully vaccinated adults can safely resume activities indoors or outdoors without masks or distancing, in gatherings large or small. The announcement marks a major milestone in the effort to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in the United States.

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky announced the new guidance Thursday [13 May 2021].

"You can do things you stopped doing because of the pandemic," Walensky said.

The new policy is based on recent real-world studies from Israel and the US on people who've been vaccinated, she said.

In response to a question, Walensky said the federal mask requirement on public transportation remains in force for everyone, vaccinated or not, including on buses, trains, and airplanes and in stations and airports.

"For travel, we are still asking people to continue wearing their masks," Walensky said. She said the policy continues to be under review.

However, under the new guidance, fully vaccinated people can resume domestic travel without needing to get tested before or after, and they do not need to self-quarantine. They also do not need to quarantine following a known exposure so long as they are asymptomatic.

The CDC says masks may still be required by state, local, tribal, or territorial laws as well as businesses and workplaces. But some local jurisdictions swiftly announced they would update their own regulations to conform with the CDC guidance, and more are expected to follow.

The updated guidance for fully vaccinated people does not apply to health-care settings, which have their own separate guidance.

Unvaccinated people "remain at risk" of illness and death, Walensky said, and should remain masked and observe physical distancing.

Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday [13 May 2021] afternoon, President Biden said, "Today is a great day for America and our long battle with coronavirus." The president and Vice President Harris both smiled widely and did not wear masks.

"I think it's a great milestone, a great day," Biden said. "It's been made possible by the extraordinary success we've had in vaccinating so many Americans so quickly."

He praised the American people for how much they had endured since the beginning of the pandemic, including lost jobs and missed life events, and particularly the more than 580 000 lives lost to COVID-19.

Biden emphasized that the new rules only apply to those who are fully vaccinated. People are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or 2 weeks after the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot.

Those not fully vaccinated should still wear a mask, the CDC said.

"We've gotten this far. Please protect yourself until you get to the finish line," Biden said. "Get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do."

In an interview Thursday [13 May 2021] with NPR's All Things Considered, Walensky said the new mask guidance was possible due to the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccines, the drop in US cases, and universal vaccine availability in the US for people age 12 and older.

Walensky noted that the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are all 100% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19, even if they don't prevent 100% of coronavirus infections. They are also effective against the coronavirus variants circulating in the US, she said.

The CDC director said it would be safe for a fully vaccinated person to go into a grocery store, even if there were unvaccinated, unmasked shoppers there.

Walensky noted that the guidance will take some getting used to for many people.

"We have been doing this for 15 months at this point, and not everybody's going to want to shed their masks immediately," she said. "It's going to take us a little bit of time to readjust."

[1b] Unvaccinated children
Date: Fri 14 May 2021 6:54 p.m. ET

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/14/997010917/what-the-new-mask-guidance-means-for-unvaccinated-kids-and-their-parents


So what's the mask guidance now for adolescents aged 12 and up?

As of this week, the Pfizer vaccine is available to people age 12 and up. (The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are currently approved only for those 18 and older.) That means kids age 12-15 who get their 1st Pfizer vaccine dose now will be fully vaccinated in about 5 weeks, 2 weeks after they receive their 2nd dose.

Once they are fully vaccinated, the CDC says it's safe for them to remove their masks in most settings, just like fully vaccinated adults. But state and local laws apply, as do school and business policies. And masks will still be required for all on buses, trains, and planes and at stations and airports.

What about kids under 12?

There aren't any vaccines currently approved for their use in the US, which means the younger set needs to keep masking for the time being.

The CDC says all unvaccinated people age 2 and older "should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don't live in their household."

Experts at the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend unvaccinated children 2 and older continue to wear masks around others when indoors, especially when they are among at-risk adults such as those who are immunocompromised or over 65.

"We know children over age 2 can safely wear masks to protect themselves and others from transmitting the COVID-19 virus. We've already seen how the masks have helped prevent the spread of respiratory infections within schools, camps, and other community settings, particularly when everyone wears them, washes hands, and follows other infection control guidance," Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement.

Dr. Emily Landon, who leads the infection control and prevention efforts at University of Chicago Medicine, says the data support the idea that fully vaccinated parents of unvaccinated children can safely take off their own masks.

"The vast majority of the data that's coming out -- and what we're seeing anecdotally on the ground, taking care of patients -- is that individuals who get COVID after they've been vaccinated, as long as they're not immunocompromised, they get really mild disease, and they have such low viral loads that they're not passing it on to their family members," Landon says.

For vaccinated parents, it's okay to remove your masks, Landon says: "As long as everybody in your family, including yourself, are low-risk, it's probably fine for you to have an unmasked lifestyle now."

[1c] Different opinions

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/951198


Differing Expert Opinions

"We have more people not vaccinated than vaccinated, and we are declaring victory," said Cheryl Healton, DrPH, dean of the New York University School of Global Public Health. With variants incubating, and hundreds still dying every day of COVID, ''that's still a lot of infection, and it's still a lot of deaths."

She will continue to wear a mask, she said. "I am doing it to be a role model at this point. Because I am very concerned that many people who are not vaccinated will not wear their masks in multiple places. Who is put at risk? Other unvaccinated people."

While Healton bemoans the unwillingness of the unvaccinated to accept science, she asked: "Should they die because of that? I don't think so."

"What's happening with the CDC is, it is kind of lurching from overcaution to abandoning caution," said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Center on National and Global Health Law. The abrupt change in CDC guidelines, he said, "speaks on its face to the idea that they are succumbing to public and political pressure."

However, other experts applauded the updated advice. "The new guidance is something many of us were waiting for," said Amesh Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.

[1d] Mixed reactions

While states continue to relax COVID-19 mitigation measures, concerns about vaccine uptake continue.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) announcement that people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not have to use masks in most settings has prompted some states to drop mask mandates. Others, however, have said they need to take time to look at their state's specific COVID situation, and health experts, state and local governments, business owners, and the public have had similar guarded reactions.

"I wouldn't want to declare victory [over COVID-19] prematurely, but I'm saying this is clearly a step in the direction that we want to go," Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jake Tapper.

At the same time, Fauci acknowledged that people such as store or restaurant owners will have to trust others to unmask responsibly. "They will not be able to know," he said. "I mean, you're going to be depending on people being honest enough to say whether they were vaccinated or not."

Fauci reminded CNN that while there will be no federally mandated vaccine passports, organizations such as colleges and businesses can require COVID-19 vaccination.

In light of the CDC's announcement, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America released a statement yesterday [Thu 13 May 2021] calling for continued vigilance with COVID-19 mitigation practices. The authors write, "SHEA strongly cautions against relaxing transmission mitigation efforts including masking in communities with ongoing high rates of transmission and within healthcare settings," the latter of which still require masking.

State-by-state differences
Minnesota is one state in which mask mandates changed in light of the CDC's announcement. However, unlike states such as Oregon, Kentucky, Washington, West Virginia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, Minnesota's new policy covers both the vaccinated and unvaccinated, the StarTribune reports. Minnesota health commissioner Jan Malcolm told Minnesota Public Radio that even though she would have preferred to keep a mask mandate for unvaccinated people, it's not feasibly enforceable.

The state had previously announced it would try to lift mask mandates by 1 Jul [2021] or whenever 70% of residents older than age 15 have received at least one vaccine dose; the StarTribune notes that as of Thursday [13 May 2021], the state has reached 60.9%. Local governments and other institutions may set up their own regulations, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has already said that the city will continue indoor mask use, according to the StarTribune. Some private businesses have also requested that people still wear masks.

States such as California, New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey are conferring with public health experts on next steps, and officials in Connecticut, Colorado, and Vermont said that they would implement the CDC's new guidelines in the next few days, according to NPR. [https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996331692/poll-finds-public-health-has-a-trust-problem?utm_source =&utm_medium= email& utm_ campaign=39123]

Vaccine uptake still needed
Yesterday [Thu 13 May 2021], Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker tallied 38 087 new COVID-19 cases and 802 deaths. New COVID-19 cases fell in the country by 21.3% in the past week, with hospitalizations falling 11.4% and daily deaths decreasing by 10%, according to data from the Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/]

The CDC cited vaccine efficacy rates as one of the reasons mask mandates could be lifted, and an agency press release said that a new study published today [Fri 14 May 2021] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) found that 500 000 US healthcare workers vaccinated with either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had 94% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 7 or more days after the 2nd dose. Among those partially vaccinated (defined by the study as 14 days after their 1st dose or up to 6 days after the 2nd dose), vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection was 82%. [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7020e2.htm?s_cid=mm7020e2_w]

On the other hand, CNN points to recent CDC data that say only 46% of US adults are fully vaccinated [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations], and an ABC News/Washington Post poll last month [April 2021] reported that 24% are "disinclined" to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trust-johnson-johnsons-coronavirus-vaccine-low-intent-inoculated/story?id=77218518]

"If you haven't been vaccinated, wear your mask for your own protection and the protection of the people who also have not been vaccinated yet," President Joe Biden said in a Rose Garden address today [Fri 14 May 2021], according to the Associated Press [https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-government-and-politics-a48e79a4e7a9445011999e91bb30135f]. While the US government will not enforce mask wearing on those not fully vaccinated, Biden said those people should get vaccinated and, in the meantime, continue wearing masks indoors.

Among those who have not been vaccinated, Hispanic adults are more likely than White adults to say they want to get a vaccine as soon as possible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation yesterday [Thu 13 May 2021] [https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-access-information-experiences-hispanic-adults/]. The results further emphasize the need for public health equity and continued targeted outreach.

In other news, the Biden administration said yesterday [Thu 13 May 2021] that, out of its USD 7 billion budget to expand the public health workforce, more than USD 4 billion would go to state and local health departments to support their COVID-19 needs, according to New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/13/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases/the-white-house-details-a-7-billion-plan-to-boost-hiring-for-public-health-planning].

German Infection Rate Sinks; Moscow Cancels Race: Virus Update
2021-05-15 09:33:01.910 GMT

Key Developments
-------------------

Global Tracker: Cases top 161.9 million; deaths exceed 3.35 million

Vaccine Tracker: More than 1.41 billion doses have been given

Soldiers Deployed for Tests in English Town (5:02 p.m. HK)

Soldiers will be sent to the English town of Bolton to hand out tests on the street, according to The Times. The town's infection rate has more than doubled in a week, with cases reaching 193 per 100 000 in the 7 days to 9 May [2021], government data show.

Singapore Reports 19 New Local Cases (4:50 p.m. HK)

Singapore reported 19 new local virus cases on Saturday [15 May 2021] and 12 imported infections. Checking in to a hotel room in Singapore, starting Sunday [16 May 2021], could also mean agreeing to random checks from staff to ensure only 2 guests are in the room, a step one hotel in the Marina Bay area is asking customers to agree to. People who breach the safety measures may be fined as much as SGD 10 000 (USD 7506) or jailed for as long as 6 months, or both, according to the document given to staycationers at check-in.

Moscow Cancels Popular Running Race (4:36 p.m. HK)

Cases in Moscow remained above 3000 for a 2nd day on Saturday [15 May 2021], after jumping to the highest level since January [2021] on Friday [14 May 2021]. While President Vladimir Putin oversaw his annual Victory Day parade on Red Square last weekend, a popular running race through the Russian capital scheduled for this Sunday [15 May 2021] was canceled because of the epidemiological situation. Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said the virus situation remains tense, and "the numbers don't make us happy," state news service Tass reported on Friday [14 May 2021].

Germany's infection rate falls further (4:16 p.m. HK)

Infections in Germany dropped to 87.3 per 100 000 people over the past 7 days, the lowest level since mid-March [2021], according to the RKI public-health institute. The country's lockdown law allows curbs to be loosened if the incidence rate falls below 100 for 5 consecutive working days. More than 30 million citizens, or 36.5% of the population, have received at least a 1st shot of COVID-19 vaccine, and more than 9 million are fully inoculated, Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a Twitter post.

Philippines Registers 6739 New Daily Cases (4 p.m. HK)

The number of cases in the Philippines remained elevated, rising by 6739, according to the latest update on Saturday [15 May 2021], as the total number of deaths surpassed 19 000.

Czech Republic Reports 1050 New COVID Cases (3:39 p.m. HK)

Infections in the Czech Republic slipped further. The country recorded 1050 new daily COVID cases in the past 24 hours on Saturday [15 May 2021], fewer than the 1218 in the previous 24 hours and less than half the daily level seen at the start of May [2021].

India Infections Maintain Downward Trend (1:50 p.m. HK)

India reported 326 098 new infections Saturday [15 May 2021], keeping with a downward trend the past week after hitting an all-time high of more than 414 000 cases earlier this month [May 2021], stirring hope the virus curve may have peaked in the Asian nation. India's total infection tally has now crossed 24 million, while COVID-related deaths have exceeded 266 200, according to latest data from India's health ministry. More than 180 million COVID vaccines have been administered in the country so far, according to Bloomberg's vaccine tracker.

Only 30% of Hong Kong Hospital Staff Vaccinated (11:05 a.m. HK)

Just 24 000 hospital employees in Hong Kong have been vaccinated, roughly 30% of the total, Henry Fan, chairman of the Hospital Authority, said on the RTHK radio show Saturday [15 May 2021] morning. Hong Kong had vaccinated just 12.6% of its residents as of 14 May [2021], despite having enough doses for the entire population. The government has urged people to be inoculated before September [2021] when some shots expire as unused vaccines pile up.

Taiwan Tightens Curbs After Surge in Local Infections (11 a.m. HK)

Authorities in Taiwan encouraged people to stay at home this weekend as a record 180 new local cases were reported on Saturday [15 May 2021]. Indoor family and social gatherings in Taipei will be limited to 5 people, while outdoor ones will be restricted to 10, they said. The alert level for Taipei and New Taipei city will be raised until 28 May [2021], Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said in a briefing on Saturday [15 May 2021]. Schools and offices will remain open.

Support for Japan's Suga Falls to New Low (10:55 a.m. HK)

Support for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga fell to 32.2%, the lowest since he took office in September [2020], in a poll published by Jiji Press late Friday [14 May 2021]. The proportion of respondents saying they didn't support him rose to 44.6%, the highest level so far, amid growing dissatisfaction over his handling of the pandemic and the vaccine rollout. The survey is the latest in a series to show flagging support, as Suga faces an election for leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in September [2021] and a general election that must be held by October [2021].

Thailand Reports New Cases (9:41 a.m. HK)

Thailand reported 3095 new virus cases on Saturday [15 May 2021], after registering a record 4887 infections 2 days earlier. Since 1 April [2021] it has added 70 282.

Rakuten CEO Warns Against Olympics (9:22 a.m. HK)

Holding the Olympics as planned in Tokyo this summer would be like a "suicide mission" because Japan has been so late in vaccinating its population, Hiroshi Mikitani, the chief
executive of Japanese online retailer Rakuten Group Inc. said in an interview with broadcaster CNN.

Work Begins on Reopening US-Canada Border (9:11 a.m. HK)

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has begun preliminary internal discussions about reopening the border with the US, even as Canada remains well behind its neighbor in vaccinations. Senior officials have begun to formally talk about options for how to proceed, 3 people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition they not be identified. One question under consideration is whether to employ a 2-track system in which quarantine and testing requirements would be relaxed for vaccinated travelers.

Oklahoma Reports India Variant (6:15 a.m. HK)

Oklahoma has found a cluster of 17 cases of a virus variant first found in India, the state's department of health reported. Among the cases, 3 people were fully vaccinated, and 2 were partially vaccinated. The B.1.617.2 variant, which is also spreading quickly in the U.K., is not listed as a variant of concern by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [The B.1.617.2 variant, which has been reported from U.K. as well as other countries, and is currently listed as a variant of concern (VOC) by the WHO, is not listed as a VOC by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As more cases are reported from the US, not an unexpected assumption, CDC may have to review this recommendation, particularly the mask-wearing recommendation for vaccinated individuals. - Mod.UBA]

Maryland, Virginia Lift Mask Mandates (5:59 p.m. NY)

Virginia and Maryland lifted their mask mandates in all but a few circumstances following new CDC guidance, while recommending that unvaccinated people continue to wear them. "If fully vaccinated, you should feel free to safely resume any activities without wearing a mask indoors or outdoors," Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, said at a news conference. "Those who have not been vaccinated are strongly advised to immediately do so."

Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, said on Twitter: "It's very simple. It's either a shot or a mask. It's up to you." For those not vaccinated, he said, "we strongly encourage you to wear masks in public." Both states carved out exceptions such as schools, and businesses are permitted to impose their own mask requirements. Virginia will be removing our universal indoor mask mandate for fully vaccinated individuals tonight [Sat 15 May 2021] at midnight, consistent with the latest @CDCgov guidelines.

Walmart Drops Masks for Vaccinated (5:20 p.m. NY)

Walmart Inc. said fully vaccinated staff and customers can now leave their masks at home, a decision that could influence how other businesses respond to the latest government guidance. The nation's biggest private employer said fully vaccinated staff need not wear a mask at work starting 18 May [2021], the same day the retailer reports 1st-quarter results. The rule applies to all of its US Walmart and Sam's Club locations, distribution centers, and offices. Customers who have been inoculated can also shop without face coverings as of Friday [14 May 2021], although masks could still be required by some local ordinances, Walmart executives said in a memo to employees Friday [14 May 2021].

CDC Had to 'Take a Chance' (4:45 p.m. NY)

The CDC's relaxed mask-wearing guidance is open to revision, particularly if there are local outbreaks or if gathering in relatively sparse crowds is found to cause an increase in cases, National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins said. "If it looks in certain communities the virus is coming back, or if there's a new variant that seems particularly contagious, then we may need to adjust that," Collins said on MSNBC. Even so, "it's time to take that chance, as they have now done, and to see if all of us can get a little closer back to normal life," he said.

N.J. to Keep Indoor Mask Mandate (4:38 p.m. NY)

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy is leaving the state's indoor mask mandate in place for public settings, according to a tweet. "We're making incredible progress, but we're not there yet." Among all US states, New Jersey, the most densely populated, has the 4th-lowest case count per capita, he wrote.

Vegas Resorts Move on Masks (1:35 p.m. NY)

Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp., 2 Nevada casino operators, will tell vaccinated guests they can stop wearing masks, following new guidance from state and federal regulators. Wynn plans to begin delivering that message to customers Friday [21 May 2021] evening, trusting guests to take the appropriate precautions based on their personal vaccination status, according to a statement. Sands said that while it won't ask vaccinated patrons to wear masks, it is still requiring staff to do so for now. MGM Resorts International, the largest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip, is expected to update its policy shortly.

[3] Blind spots in tracking variants
Date: Fri 14 May 2021 6:30 p.m. ET
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/scientists-tracking-coronavirus-variants-struggle-global-blind-spots


Last month [April 2021], Gytis Dudas was tracking a concerning new coronavirus variant that had triggered an outbreak of COVID-19 in his native Lithuania and appeared sporadically elsewhere in Europe and in the United States. Exploring an international database of coronavirus genomes, Dudas found a crucial clue: One sample of the new variant came from a person who had recently flown to France from Cameroon. A collaborator, Guy Baele of KU Leuven, soon identified 6 more sequences from people in Europe who had traveled in Cameroon. But then their quest to pinpoint the variant's origins hit a wall: Cameroon had uploaded a total of only 48 genomes to the global sequence repository, called GISAID. None included the variant.

With dogged legwork, Baele and Dudas, an evolutionary biologist at the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, learned another team had gathered as-yet-unpublished sequences from a COVID-19 outbreak at a great ape research center in the Central African Republic, near the Cameroonian border. Six people there carried the new variant.

Baele, Dudas, and their colleagues reconstructed the variant's evolutionary tree and geographic spread and concluded that the new variant most likely arose in Cameroon, as they reported in a preprint on 8 May [2021]. They note that the variant carries a suite of mutations seen in other "variants of concern" that are more infectious or dangerous.

"It looked like the typical thing that should raise all red flags," says Sebastien Calvignac-Spencer, an evolutionary biologist at the Robert Koch Institute, whose team sequenced samples from the ape station. But Cameroon and neighboring countries, where the team inferred the variant might already be prevalent, had been blind to it.

The researchers say the story of this variant, designated B.1.620, holds a warning for the world: "The sequencing effort in Cameroon and other African countries is not enough," says co-author Ahidjo Ayouba, a biologist at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development at the University of Montpellier. He is traveling to his native Cameroon next month to set up the country's 1st next-generation sequencer. The emergence of new variants with deleterious mutations in countries with no regular sequencing "may become an alarming norm," the researchers caution in the paper.

It is not just Africa. Of 152 countries for which data were available as of 10 May [2021], 100 had uploaded sequence data for less than 1% of their reported cases to GISAID (see map, below). Among those, 51 countries, including large nations such as India, Indonesia, Russia, and Brazil, had uploaded sequences for less than 0.1% of cases. Ten wealthy nations accounted for 82% of the more than 1.4 million sequences in GISAID's database. "We are working to change that," says Frank Konings, leader of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Virus Evolution Working Group.

Most countries with scarce sequencing also currently have little or no access to vaccines, and some have severe outbreaks. As the virus replicates unchecked, those regions can become breeding grounds for new mutants, which can then spread around the world. India, for example, is coping with a world-leading surge of cases. On 11 May [2021], WHO labeled the new variant B.1.617, which arose in India and has spread to dozens of countries, a variant of concern. "Where the pandemic is currently unchecked is where we can expect that variants are on the rise," Dudas says. "It would be much more interesting to sequence the last 1000 cases in the Central African Republic than the next 100 000 cases in Germany."

A patchy picture
Sequencing of the pandemic coronavirus is minimal in most countries around the world, so scientists often have little insight into emerging new variants. Globally, the obstacles to systematic surveillance are daunting. State-of-the-art sequencers cost USD 335 000, and local scientists must be trained to use them. Many areas lack the roads and refrigeration needed to speedily transport samples. In India, "the issue is sampling: Somebody has to collect and ship the samples and provide the clinical data. That takes some time," says Anurag Agrawal, director of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research's Institute for Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi. And costly sequencing reagents need to be continually imported.

"We ordered ... reagents [from a US company] in November [2020]. They are arriving now!" says Senjuti Saha, a microbiologist at the Child Health Research Foundation in Dhaka, Bangladesh. "This is not an exception; rather, it's the rule."

Saha is nonetheless pleased with a multilab effort that has allowed the country to scale up sequencing to 0.2% of 777 000 identified cases. "I don't think [that number is] great," she says. "But it was zero before. And we have never done this before."

The effort is already paying off, most recently on 8 May [2021], when 2 Bangladeshi patients who recently returned from India were found to be carrying B.1.617. Two days later, after a long meeting with scientists, Bangladeshi officials tightened quarantine at the border.

Other countries face geographical challenges. In December 2020, Brazilian scientists identified P.1, now a variant of concern globally, during a massive outbreak in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state. But sequencing coverage is poor in places like the neighboring rainforest state of Acre and in Brazil's northeast, says Ana Vasconcelos, a computational biologist at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing in Petropolis, Brazil. She says just 25 genomes have been uploaded from Acre. She enlisted colleagues there to provide 100 samples, then found there was no dry ice, needed for transport. She finally received the samples yesterday [13 May 2021], with the help of a French nongovernmental organization, the Merieux Foundation.

Some experts have suggested nations aim to sequence virus from 5% of cases, but others say such goals are wrongheaded. "The world is getting too obsessed with numbers," says Tulio de Oliveira, a computational biologist and director of KRISP, the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban. For example, he and South African colleagues identified the variant of concern that originated in South Africa soon after it arose, by strategically sampling regions fighting outbreaks rather than by boosting sampling evenly around the country.

De Oliveria and a huge team of other African scientists have now turned sparse sequence data in Africa into a big picture of how the virus has evolved within the continent. In a preprint posted yesterday [13 May 2021], based on nearly 9000 sequences collected in 33 African countries, they found that SARS-CoV-2 likely arrived in multiple African countries with travelers, mainly from Europe. Travel restrictions initially kept case counts in check. But then, the virus evolved into several concerning variants. "Although distorted by low sampling numbers and blind-spots," the authors write, "the findings highlight that Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a breeding ground for new variants."

That's true worldwide, Calvignac-Spencer says. "It's not really possible that we go on being so selfish with genomic surveillance, with vaccines," he says. "It's not understanding our own best interests."

[The above report is an apt summation of the challenges in keeping track of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and the potential impact on vaccination and therapeutics. More importantly, this has implications for when the countries can scale down on the social distancing restrictions and the concurrent public safety and transmission issues. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, India (326 123), Brazil (84 486), the USA (37 916), and Argentina (27 363, have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 546 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 12 May 2021 to late 13 May 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include India, Brazil, the USA, Argentina, Colombia (16 581), Turkey (11 394), Germany (10 247), and Iran (10 145). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 9.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.0%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 15.7% decrease in daily reported cases and 6.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approximately 700 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 162.52 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.37 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
