Abstract
--------
In June-November 2020, SARS-CoV-2-infected mink were detected in 290 of 1147 Danish mink farms. In North Denmark Region, 30% (324/1092) of people found connected to mink farms tested SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive, and approximately 27% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25-30) of SARS-CoV-2-strains from humans in the community were mink-associated. Measures proved insufficient to mitigate spread. On 4 Nov 2020, the government ordered culling of all Danish mink. Farmed mink constitute a potential virus reservoir challenging pandemic control.

Discussion
----------
In the current study, people in households located on Danish mink farms have been identified as having an occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 due to direct or indirect exposure in the farm environment. It can be assumed that at least one member of a mink farm household had regular access to the animals and farm area. Moreover, from our surveillance data, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in people connected to mink farms seemed to be closely related to the occurrence of the virus in mink. It should be noted, however, that it was not possible to identify employees living outside a mink farm [comment 1]. These factors may have led to an underestimation of the occupational risk of mink farming in areas with SARS-CoV-2-positive mink.

In addition, we observed from June 2020 the emergence of the mink variant of SARS-CoV-2, with transmission of this both in mink and people connected to mink farms. These strains also spread further in the community. At least 90 human cases were linked to the June 2020 outbreak caused by the mink variant, including residents and staff at a nursing home and participants in a bus trip to Bornholm [comment 2]. In the 2nd wave, starting in August [2020], community spread of the mink variant was seen in the municipalities with highest numbers of farms with SARS-CoV-2-positive mink, and at the peak of the epidemic, more than half of the strains sequenced from human samples in the North Denmark Region were mink-associated. This spread was of substantial public health concern, since it contributed to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in an area of Denmark that hitherto had had very few COVID-19-cases, relative to urban areas of Denmark.

Until June 2020, Denmark accounted for circa 40% of the world production of mink furs and had a mink population of some 17 million animals. Approximately 25% (290/1147) of the Danish farms had infected mink before the culling ended, corresponding to ca 3-4 million infected animals compared with less than 300 000 humans being infected, based on serological studies (3.1% positive blood donors as of 1st week of December 2020). A massive and susceptible animal population serves as a threat for infection and transmission, and for viral adaptation and potential immune escape that may spill back into the human population.

The Danish experiences are unique because of the magnitude of the Danish mink production. However, other countries with farmed mink may well experience similar risks.

The Danish experience calls for a global and coordinated One Health approach to understand and mitigate the risk that farmed mink may pose for the control of the pandemic and to act accordingly.

[1. It is known that mink farms in Denmark and elsewhere employed and/or still employ labor from other countries; such employees spend and spent vacations/leaves in their home countries. They could have introduced the mink-derived virus there, and investigations in this direction were warranted in all events of COVID-19 in farmed minks. The Danish mink variant was found to have spread to one or more persons in Croatia (see commentary in 20201105.7918210).

2. The mink variant was identified in several passengers of a travel company to Bornholm [a Baltic Sea island nearly 400 km (249 miles) south east of North Jutland, where COVID-19 was circulating on mink farms at that time]. Reportedly, in Bornholm, there was a secondary infection of at least one person.

Notably, the Swedish veterinary authorities included in their last update to the OIE (1 Dec 2020) on the COVID-19 situation in Sweden's farmed minks the following information:

"Through the Public Health Agency, a surveillance scheme targeting humans in contact with mink (mink farm owners and family as well as staff) has been initiated in order to assess the risk for mink-to-human and human-to-mink transmission and to allow a continuous monitoring of possible virus evolution related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission in mink farms. Samples collected from positive human cases in the affected municipalities are also followed up with whole genome sequencing. To date, all sequenced SARS‐CoV‐2 strains detected from mink and humans at the infected farms cluster together and belong to the Lineage B1.1.39. None of the amino acid mutations described on the spike protein of the recent Danish mink SARS-CoV-2 viruses has so far been detected in the spike gene of the Swedish mink SARS-CoV-2 viruses."

The entire report is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Sweden_1.12.2020.pdf.

Sweden's mink population, at the start of the event, counted about 600 000 animals kept in 40 farms.

A thorough investigation of the COVID-19 event was conducted in the Netherlands, the 1st country to discover the disease in farmed minks. The research included also sampling and testing of cats maintained on mink farms, as well as the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 by aerosols (Ref. 1-4).

It would be valuable to compare the Swedish, Danish, and Dutch observations/findings and, if possible, include scientific records from other mink producing countries in the study/assessment. OIE has established, for such undertaking, an ad hoc group entitled "COVID-19 and the animal-human interface," which "advises on investigations into the possible role of animals as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and in zoonotic transmission;" (https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/expert-groups-and-guidance/).

OIE's Technical Factsheet "Infection with SARS-COV-2 in Animals (Aetiology, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Prevention and Control, References)," was updated in January 2021. The document is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/EN_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2.pdf.
