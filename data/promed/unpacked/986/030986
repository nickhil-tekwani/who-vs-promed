Some thoughts about outbreaks of rotavirus infections in hospital nurseries:
1. These outbreaks in semi-closed populations are similar to those that
occur in child care centers.
2. The frequency of detection of a particular antigenic/genomic type is
related to the common exposure and should not be considered to be reflective
of the frequency distribution in the open, community population.
3. Tracing mechanisms of exposure is very difficult, for one can assume
universal exposure in such outbreaks. Thus, the commonly applied techniques
for tracing vehicles of exposure/transmission routes in open populations
won't work.
4. We know that transplacental antibody is protective against rotavirus
infection. Thus, in a nursery setting, who is infected might be determined
by gestational age.
5. We know that such antibody tends to confer type-specific protection.
Thus, it is possible that outbreaks with strains that have not been common
in the community, to which mothers would have developed serum antibody, are
more likely to cause
nursery outbreaks.
