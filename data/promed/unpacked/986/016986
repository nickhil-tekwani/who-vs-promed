With the 4th of July [2013] holiday right around the corner and summer recreation season about to kick into high gear, people are eager to learn what is causing the unusually high number of dead fish washing up on the shores of Canandaigua Lake.

"It's a deathly odor," said [a resident], who said she has followed the increasing number of dead fish in recent weeks during walks on the docks near her home in Canandaigua on Town Harbor Island.

An investigation into the cause involves the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and local officials, including Canandaigua Lake Watershed Manager Kevin Olvany. Olvany, who has been closely monitoring the dead fish, was also out on the lake this past week [24-30 Jun 2013] with lake-quality expert Bruce Gilman, professor of environmental conservation and horticulture at Finger Lakes Community College, to do the monthly water testing and scout for fish to collect.

"We, along with DEC, patrol the watershed on a regular basis and have seen nothing that would cause this and we have received no reports of any major pollution issue," Olvany stated Friday [28 Jun 2013] afternoon in an email.

The DEC earlier this month [June 2013] took samples of dead fish to test and more recently took samples of fish that were in the process of dying or that had recently died, in trying to pinpoint the cause.

Olvany said it could take a few more days to get the results of what is causing the die-off, which is lakewide and has lasted several weeks.

Initially, testing was focused on viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus. A serious pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish, the rod-shaped virus affects fish of all size and age ranges; it is currently causing a problem in the Great Lakes region and Canada and has also been the cause of fish dying in Irondequoit Bay. Once a fish is infected with VHS, there is no known cure. The VHS virus does not pose any threat to human health, the DEC says. In addition to VHS, said Olvany, the DEC is "also looking at a variety of other viruses and bacteria that could cause this die-off."

He added: "There is absolutely no indication that this die-off has anything to do with a pollution issue."

Due to wind patterns, the brunt of the dead fish are washing up along the north and east sides of the lake, noted Olvany. "I think it is important to note that Waneta and Lamoka Lakes along with Irondequoit Bay have also dealt with a fish die off this year [2013]," Olvany stated. "Skaneateles Lake had one a few years ago along with Chautauqua Lake. The Great Lakes have dealt with fish die offs. I have seen at least 4 substantial die-offs on this lake in 14-plus years of working here."
