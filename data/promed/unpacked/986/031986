[Brucellosis is caused by the bacteria of the genus _Brucella_ and in
animals is characterized by abortion, retained placenta and occasionally
orchitis and infection of the accessory reproductive glands in males. The
disease is present in many countries in the world. It primarily affects
cattle, buffalo, bison, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, elk and sometimes horses.
The disease in humans, sometimes known as undulant fever, is a serious
public health concern.
Raw materials, such as milk may transmit the disease to humans. When
infected droplets of the fluids involved in the birthing process splash
into the eyes, the mouth, or open cuts, people assisting those animals may
develop brucellosis.
The organism infecting goats presents the most serious disease in people. -
