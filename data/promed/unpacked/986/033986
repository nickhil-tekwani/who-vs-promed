Health authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have confirmed 7 new Ebola cases in the northwestern Equateur Province, bringing up to 13 the number of people who had contracted the deadly virus in the province, a UN-run radio station said Friday [29 Aug 2014]. "There are now 13 cases affected by the virus ... in addition to 16 other suspected cases," Health Minister Felix Kabange was quoted as saying by the Kinshasa-based Okapi radio. He asserted that the outbreak is still confined to Boende area in northern Equateur province, noting that Ebola cases reported recently in Kinshasa and Katanga proved negative.

On Monday [25 Aug 2014], Joseph Mboyo Limpoko, government medical inspector in Equateur, told Anadolu Agency that a total of 4 people countrywide had been confirmed dead from Ebola.

The tropical fever, which 1st appeared in 1976 in Sudan and the DRC, can be transmitted to humans from wild animals. It also spreads through contact with the body fluids of infected persons or of those who have died of the disease.

[There has been little official update regarding the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in DRC, and the numbers here are confusing. This report appears to indicate an increase in the number of confirmed plus suspected cases to 29, from the 24 suspected and confirmed cases reported by WHO in their last update from 27 Aug 2014. Thus far, the outbreak appears to be similar to past outbreaks in DRC, in contrast to the explosive spread in West Africa. - Mod.LM]

[2] Botswana blocks Congo exports

Botswana's authorities have blocked the transit of copper exports from the Democratic Republic of Congo after an outbreak of Ebola in the continent's top copper producer, the latest African nation to adopt measures to prevent the deadly virus from breaching its borders.

Scores of trucks carrying copper and cobalt exports from Congo's land-locked Katanga province have not been allowed to cross into Botswana since 25 Aug [2014], the same day Kinshasa confirmed its 1st case of the Ebola virus since 2008, Zambian and Botswana officials said on Thursday [28 Aug 2014].

Although the strain of Ebola virus in Congo is not the same as the strains that have ravaged West Africa in recent months, the latest outbreak of the disease has triggered fears in the region, prompting countries to heighten control measures across their borders.

"We are not clearing all vehicles from Congo until further notice," a Botswana customs official said by telephone from the border town of Kazungula. "We have advised them to use alternative routes."

Separately, Pascalina Musokotwane, Zambia's district commissioner, said the number of Congolese nationals and trucks stuck on the Zambian side of the border with Botswana, since the blockade there, threaten to overwhelm Zambia's facilities in the small but vital border town of Kazungula.

[Given the general level of concern regarding EVD, border and trade restrictions are not surprising, despite WHO's advice to the contrary. These types of restrictions more often hinder the response, burden the population and the economy, and do little to prevent the spread of disease. - Mod.LM
