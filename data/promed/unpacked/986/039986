E. COLI O157:H7 - JAPAN, NEW OUTBREAK
*************************************

[see also previous "new" outbreak":
E. coli - Japan: new outbreak 970420202408]
Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
Japanese officials indicated 26 June that 41 student nurses, 16 patients and
one other staff member at Okayama Rosai Hospital had been infected with a E.
coli O157:H7, which was responsible for a series of food poisoning deaths
last year. Those infected all ate the same meal on Monday. Five of the
infected, all of them patients at the hospital, had severe cases of bloody
diarrhoea, considered a serious symptom in the potentially fatal disease
caused by theis organism. Meals at the hospital have been stopped to prevent
further spread and until the exact source of the infection has been
determined. [I assume the patients will be fed something, albeit prepared
outside the hospital.]
The outbread has raised fears of a return of the deadly food poisoning
epidemic in Japan last summer that killed 11 people and made more than 10,000
ill. A spokesman for the Health and Welfare Ministry was quoted as saying,
"With only isolated cases of the strain since January this year, we thought
the trend had calmed down [sic]. But with the rainy season on us and summer
beginning to hot up, it is a time when the human body gets weaker and the
bacteria begin to multiply faster." The news indicated that the present
outbreak was recognized after health authorities in Hong Kong discovered the
organism in beef on sale in a Japanese supermarket in May, following an
earlier case [of this infection] in the territory in March.
