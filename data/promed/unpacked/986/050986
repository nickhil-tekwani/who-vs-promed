[1] Israeli booster dose efficacy

A 3rd dose of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE COVID-19 vaccine can dramatically reduce rates of Covid-related illness in people 60 and older, according to data from a short-term study in Israel. Starting 12 days after the extra dose, confirmed infection rates were 11 times lower in the booster group compared with a group that got the standard 2 doses, the analysis released Wed 15 Sep 2021 by the New England Journal of Medicine found. Rates of severe illness were almost 20 times lower in the booster group.

The study from Israel followed more than 1.1 million Israel residents, all 60 years or older, who had been fully immunized with the Pfizer vaccine. Researchers at Weizmann Institute of Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, the Israel Ministry of Health, Tel Aviv University and other collaborators compared infection and illness rates in those who got a 3rd dose to those who didn't.

A major caveat to the analysis is that it is based on short-term follow-up. Israel's booster campaign started 30 Jul 2021, and the study took place through 31 Aug 2021. Infection rates were calculated 12 days after boosters were administered to give them time to take effect.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
On 30 Jul 2021, the administration of a 3rd (booster) dose of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) was approved in Israel for persons who were 60 years of age or older and who had received a 2nd dose of vaccine at least 5 months earlier. Data are needed regarding the effect of the booster dose on the rate of confirmed Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the rate of severe illness.

METHODS
We extracted data for the period from 30 Jul through 31 Aug 2021, from the Israeli Ministry of Health database regarding 1 137 804 persons who were 60 years of age or older and had been fully vaccinated (i.e., had received two doses of BNT162b2) at least 5 months earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rate of confirmed COVID-19 and the rate of severe illness between those who had received a booster injection at least 12 days earlier (booster group) and those who had not received a booster injection (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the rate of infection 4 to 6 days after the booster dose as compared with the rate at least 12 days after the booster. In all the analyses, we used Poisson regression after adjusting for possible confounding factors.

RESULTS
At least 12 days after the booster dose, the rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4 to 12.3); the rate of severe illness was lower by a factor of 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 to 29.5). In a secondary analysis, the rate of confirmed infection at least 12 days after vaccination was lower than the rate after 4 to 6 days by a factor of 5.4 (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.1).

CONCLUSIONS
In this study involving participants who were 60 years of age or older and had received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 5 months earlier, we found that the rates of confirmed COVID-19 and severe illness were substantially lower among those who received a booster (3rd) dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.


Two related studies published in this same issue of NEJM deal with the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and its efficacy as a booster in generating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2:
Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine through 6 Months https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization with BNT162b2 Vaccine Dose 3 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113468

Israel was the first country on Earth to fully vaccinate a majority of its citizens against COVID-19, and Israel remains at the forefront of large-scale post-approval studies assessing vaccine efficacy and durability. Readers of ProMED will know that we have followed developments in Israel very closely during the July and August 2021 time frame in which the above BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) booster vaccination study was carried out. For recent ProMED coverage of the case surge, waning immunity, and booster campaign in Israel, see COVID-19 updates 251, 262, 275, 282, 284, 287, 289, and 298 under See Also below.

A key aspect of this study that is either assumed on the part of the reader or not highlighted in the original NEJM article or the Bloomberg news article above is that the booster campaign was carried out during a surge in COVID-19 cases in Israel driven by the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (see COVID-19 update (289)). Thus, this is an important and highly anticipated study for policy makers worldwide (mainly in developed countries with adequate vaccine resources) who are weighing the question of whether and when to institute COVID-19 booster vaccinations (3rd shots, in the case of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines) during an upsurge of delta variant cases. Indeed, in the USA, this Israeli analysis is expected to be highlighted during a meeting on Fri 17 Sep 2021 of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel that is evaluating booster shots in general, and Pfizer's application for FDA approval of its booster shot in particular. Such approval would bolster President Biden's announced booster program (for more details, please read the full Bloomberg article cited above).

Of course, booster shots should not be viewed as a panacea for controlling the delta variant-driven surge in COVID-19 cases. Other factors contribute to a decline in cases as well, including the sheer rise of people who have been previously infected and acquired natural immunity, an increase in people taking the initial (1st dose) vaccination, and -- as always -- nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and mask usage in public spaces. - Mod.LXL]

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries including the USA (164 509), UK (30 402), India (30 361), Turkey (28 224), Iran (19 731), Malaysia (19 495), Philippines (16 909), Russia (18 841), Brazil (14 780), Thailand (13 798), Germany (13 047), Mexico (12 929), and Vietnam (10 585) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed. A global total of 10 436 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 13 Sep 2021 to late 14 Sep 2021). A total of 57 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 32 of the 57 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 6.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 1.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 21.7% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approximately 550 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 227.25 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.67 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
