Cholera [bacterium found in Korean waters
-----------------------------------------
The cholera [bacterium has been found in sea water off Tongyeong,
North Gyeongsang Province, the National Institute of Health (NIH) said
yesterday.
It is the first time that the cholera virus has been found in Korea's
waters since the first case of infection was reported in late August
2001.
The NIH warned against eating raw fish and other sea products caught
in the area, which could be contaminated by the virus.
The confirmation of 3 new cases Sunday has brought the number of
cholera infections this year to 137, the NIH said.
