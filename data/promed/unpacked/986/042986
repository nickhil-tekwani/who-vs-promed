Veterinarians are urging dog owners to take precautions after the highly contagious canine influenza killed 2 dogs in North Carolina and is suspected of sickening others.

The sick dogs are apparently linked to dog shows last month [May 2017] in DeLand, Florida and Perry, Georgia. The dead dogs were from the Raleigh area and North Carolina's coast.

No cases have been reported in the Charlotte area, and sickened dogs usually recover from the flu. But because the virus spreads so easily, local vets, kennel owners, and shelters are on high alert.

"This is not a time to panic, not a time to be overly concerned, but it is a time to be prudent," said veterinarian Jim Dobies, who owns UrgentVet Pet Clinic in Belmont and Fort Mill, S.C.

Dobies recommends that healthy dogs be vaccinated. Dogs suspected of having the flu should be isolated from other dogs, and their vets consulted. Healthy dogs must be kept away from sick ones.

Clinical signs include coughing, lethargy, nasal discharge and fever and can mimic the highly contagious but nonfatal disease known as kennel cough. Canine flu can be tough to diagnose, Dobies said, because tests can reveal it only in a narrow window of time and can't be confirmed in-house.

Suspected cases have swept through the dog world since the flu was identified in Chicago in 2015, the American Kennel Club says. North Carolina reported 225 suspected cases that year. The AKC says recent outbreaks have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina and Texas.

The state agriculture department's Animal Welfare Section is closely monitoring vets, kennels, doggie daycare businesses and shelters. Dog owners can find up-to-date reports at http://www.ncagr.gov/vet/aws/canineflu/index.htm.

Dr. Patricia Norris, who heads the section, said that in addition to 2 dead dogs, a cluster of suspected cases has been reported in coastal counties, and a couple have been reported in the Raleigh-Durham area. One dog in Davidson County, northeast of Charlotte, was at the Florida dog show and is under quarantine.

Norris advises owners who suspect their dogs are sick to keep them from even casual contact with other dogs, such as at dog parks or greenways. Healthy dogs should be safe in such places, she said, but owners should be cautious.

Concerned dog owners should call their vet, Norris said. Vaccines are advisable in some cases but not in others, she said, depending on the dog's circumstances.

"We want to be careful," she said. "We don't want to cause a panic, but to be vigilant."

Canine Influenza [Source: American Kennel Club]:
- The virus spreads through the air and can travel up to 20 feet.
- It lives up to 24 hours on soft surfaces and 48 hours on hard surfaces.
- 80 percent of all dogs exposed to it will contract the virus, although not all will show signs.
- Sick dogs show signs within 48 hours and can spread the virus for up to 28 days.
- While most sick dogs will recover with treatment, untreated dogs can develop potentially fatal pneumonia.

[These dogs were at a dog show, which means this virus could be carried to multiple areas within multiple states. Please check with your veterinarian about an examination and necessary vaccinations. If you were at the dog show, your assistance in preventing the spread of this virus is very important. Keep your dog isolated from other animals for a minimum of 10 days.

This virus can be deadly, as the article points out. Since this was a dog show, we may be seeing a lot of scattered outbreaks in the near future, although we hope all dogs remain safe and uninfected.

All owners should be vigilant at dog parks, green ways and any other social outing with pets. The best protection is the vaccine and your vigilance regarding where you take your dog. - Mod.TG
