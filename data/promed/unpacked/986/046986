[1] Pakistan (Balochistan), 2 new cases - media

Another 2 more polio cases have been reported in Balochistan on [Wed 18 Dec 2019], taking the tally of such cases across the country to 106 this year [2019], ARY News reported.

According to the Health Ministry, the polio cases were reported from the Mastung district and Dera Murad Jamali area [Nasirabad district] of Balochistan. The authorities said a 16-month-old boy from Dera Murad Jamali and a 14-year-month old baby boy from Mastung were diagnosed with the crippling disease, adding that the minor was not vaccinated against the virus.

This is the 9th polio case which has been reported from Balochistan province during the ongoing year [2019]. The officials said that out of the total, 76 polio cases were reported in KP [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa], 14 in Sindh, 9 from Balochistan, and 6 in Punjab.

Meanwhile, a countrywide anti-polio campaign is being underway amid tight security measures. During a 5-day campaign in Punjab 19 million children under the age of 5 years will be administered anti-polio vaccine.

In Sindh over 2.3 million children while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan over [6.7] million and 2.5 million children up to 5 years of age will be administered anti-polio drops respectively.

[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) violence against polio workers
Date: Wed 18 Dec 2019

Gunmen shot and killed 2 policemen escorting a polio vaccination team on [Wed 18 Dec 2019] forcing a suspension of the immunization campaign in the Upper Dir district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the crippling disease is endemic.

Previous attacks have been inspired by religious hardliners spreading false rumors, and the latest ambush of a vaccination team comes at a time when the polio cases in Pakistan have jumped from 12 to over 100 in the last one year [during 2019], making it only 1 of 3 countries in the world where the disease is endemic.

The gunmen opened fire at the officials when they were escorting the vaccination team in Lower Dir district, said police official Sultan Ghani. "The polio campaign has been suspended after the incident in the area," he said.

Of the 104 total polio cases in Pakistan, 75 has been reported from northwest Pakistan, a region plagued by Islamist militancy.

No one claimed responsibility for [Wed 18 Dec 2019's] attack, though religious hardliners over the past year have raised a scare on social media that some children were being poisoned and dying from contaminated vaccines. In the past, militants have called vaccination teams foreign agents and peddled conspiracy theories that their campaigns were a Western ploy to sterilize Muslims. Pakistan's government has tried to counter those falsehoods with public education campaigns, recruiting Muslim religious leaders to reassure people that the vaccine only protects their children.

Afghanistan and Nigeria are the other countries where the poliovirus, which can cause paralysis or death, remains endemic.

[3] Pakistan (Sindh) violence against polio workers

https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2019/12/18/polio-team-attacked-looted-near-shikarpur/


A polio team was attacked and deprived of its valuables at gunpoint on Zarkhail road, some 5 km [about 3 mi] from New Faujdari police station of Shikarpur on [Wed 18 Dec 2019].

The 11 team members were on their way to Jangi Khan Brohi village from Shikarpur in a van to administer polio drops to the children when armed men stopped, tortured, and deprived them of 11 mobile phones, CNICs [National Identity Cards], jackets, cash, and other valuables at gunpoint.

The outlaws disappeared from the spot after the swift operation. A lady health worker fell unconscious during the attack. The health staff staged a demonstration and boycotted their polio campaign until the recovery of their snatched valuables and cash.

[I have included the 2 media reports on violence against vaccination activities following a report of 2 additional cases confirmed in Balochistan. This highlights the challenges facing Pakistan in interrupting transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV) and of the recent reports of cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus). The even more disturbing fact is that these attacks occurred in 2 different provinces, Sindh in the south of the country and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the North of the country.

The addition of the 2 newly confirmed cases in Balochistan brings the total number of cases reported by Pakistan this year (2019) to 106, and the global total to 130.
