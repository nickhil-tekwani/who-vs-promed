Cayman Islands Report First Case of West Nile Virus in the Caribbean
-------------------------------------------------
GEORGE TOWN (Cayman Islands): A man has been infected with what health
officials believe to be the first confirmed case of the West Nile virus in
the Cayman Islands. The man, who lives on the small island of Cayman Brac,
was admitted to a hospital in late August with viral encephalitis and is
now recovering, said Dr. Kiran Kumar, a government health officer. Test
results from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta confirmed he
was infected with West Nile virus, Kumar said. The virus, which has
flu-like symptoms, can cause a deadly inflammation of the brain. "This is
the first known case in the Cayman Islands," Kumar said. "However, there
are no new suspected cases."
Host animals usually are birds, but mosquitoes can transfer the virus from
birds to horses or other animals, including humans. He said 10 different
samples of mosquitoes on Cayman Brac and one on the main island of Grand
Cayman have all tested negative for the virus. Kumar said migratory birds
could be the source, and officials would test any dead birds that are found.
In the United States, the virus caused one death this year, an Atlanta
woman who died in August. Since 1999, the first year it was detected in the
Western Hemisphere, 9 other deaths in New York and New Jersey have been
blamed on the virus.

[D. Duffy adds the comment that: "If this is locally acquired, then West
Nile virus begins its sweep through the neotropical avifauna and through
the wintering birds that will scatter in spring throughout North
America." If the infection was acquired locally as early as late August,
it represents a significant extension southwards of the known range of West
Nile virus in the Western hemisphere - Mod.CP
[The Cayman Islands lie between Cuba & Jamaica. Assuming that (a) the
patient had no history of travel to the USA -- or other WNV endemic area --
(b) 2 serum samples were taken from him far enough apart to show a rising
titer against WNV, or PCR showed WNV
sequences, & (c) infection with St Louis encephalitis or another flavivirus
has been excluded, then this shows the first arrival of WNV in the
Caribbean with southward migrating birds. It can be assumed that it has
reached both Cuba & Jamaica, & that we may see it in Colombia, Venezuela &
Brazil this coming (southern) summer, beginning shortly.
ProMED-mail would like to know if anybody has seen any dead birds in those
-- or other -- Caribbean islands. - Mod.JW (in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
