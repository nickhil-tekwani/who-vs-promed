As the government focuses its attention on containing COVID-19, the death toll due to the neglected disease visceral leishmaniasis, commonly known as kala-azar, reached 33 in November 2021, the highest total in the past 7 years.

As per the data available from the website of the National Centre for Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) of the Union Health Ministry, Bihar tops the list with 24 mortalities followed by Jharkhand, which has reported 7 deaths. The fatalities are alarming as last year [2020], neither state reported any deaths due to kala-azar. Only Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal had reported 3 cases each last year. This year [2021], so far no deaths have been registered in these 2 populated states. In the first 11 months of this calendar year -- that is, till November 2021 -- 1163 cases have been reported compared with over 1900 reported last calendar year [2020].

The deaths suggest that the infection is not being treated on time. Health experts say that if left untreated, visceral leishmaniasis, which is otherwise a curable disease, can be fatal in over 95% of cases. It is caused by the protozoan parasite of the genus _Leishmania_. Its clinical manifestations include irregular bouts of fever, weight loss and anemia.

Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases too have increased from 617 in 2020 to 653 till November 2021. Kala-azar is the 2nd deadliest parasitic killer in the world after malaria. The World Health Organization estimates that 50 000 to 90 000 people globally are infected each year. India accounts for about two-thirds of the total global cases, and kala-azar is endemic to Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Though its incidence in India has declined over decades, the country has missed several deadlines -- 2010, 2015 and 2017 -- for its "elimination".

According to WHO, poverty is an increased risk factor, as are poor housing and domestic sanitary conditions (such as a lack of waste management or open sewerage). Other factors include malnutrition, population mobility, and environmental and climate changes.

The only drug available against leishmaniasis, miltefosine, is rapidly losing its effectiveness because of emerging resistance to this drug due to a decrease in its accumulation inside the parasite, which is necessary for the drug to kill the parasite, say the experts.

The National Kala-Azar Elimination Programme (NKEP) has made it mandatory for all states to report the diseases, including zero cases. To compensate for loss of wages by kala-azar and PKDL cases, the government provides INR 4000 [USD 53.68] per PKDL case and INR 500 [USD 6.71] per treated kala-azar case. Bihar and Jharkhand, in which most kala-azar and PKDL cases occur, provide an additional INR 6600 [USD 88.57] in compensation for wage losses.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in India. Leishmaniasis is a poverty-related disease and is associated with malnutrition, displacement, poor housing, illiteracy, gender discrimination, weakness of the immune system, and lack of resources. Leishmaniasis is also linked to environmental changes, such as deforestation, building of dams, new irrigation schemes and urbanization, and the accompanying migration of non-immune people to endemic areas. Ninety per cent of all visceral leishmaniasis cases occur in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal and Sudan (https://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/INDIA.pdf; https://www.who.int/news/item/29-07-2021-visceral-leishmaniasis-elimination-india-gears-up-to-overcome-last-mile-challenges).

The reservoir is mainly small rodents, but humans may also act as the hosts infecting the sandflies. Control rests on rodent and vector control.
