[1] New Jersey: recalled meat being sold
Date: Thu 25 Oct 2007

New Jersey consumer safety officials on Thu 25 Oct 2007, said its
inspectors were able to buy boxes of potentially tainted frozen
hamburgers at a store weeks after the meat was recalled, sparking
fear that a distributor may have delivered boxes to other stores.

"The public's health is clearly endangered by having these recalled
products available for purchase and consumption," Attorney General
Anne Milgram said. "We want to know what other stores may have
purchased these products from the distributor and immediately inspect
those stores."

To learn that information, the state subpoenaed the company that
delivered the beef to the store, Greater New York Frozen Food
Distribution Co. Inc., of New York.

The 19 boxes were purchased in Union City on Wed 24 Oct 2007, nearly
4 weeks after the New Jersey manufacturer, Topps Meat Co., issued a
nationwide recall on 29 Sep 2007 for 21.7 million pounds (9.84
tonnes) of frozen patties. Officials would not reveal the name of the
store because of the pending investigation, said Jeff Lamm, a
spokesman for the state Division of Consumer Affairs. Investigators
have not determined when the store received the shipment of frozen
patties, Lamm said.

State inspectors are also continuing to visit stores and search for
recalled Topps products, which are sold under the Topps brand as well
as Pathmark, ShopRite, Mike's, Kohler Foods, Rastelli's Fine Foods,
Roma-Topps, Sam's Choice, Sand Castle, and West Side labels. All
recalled products will have a USDA establishment number of EST 9748
on the back panel of the package or in the USDA logo.

[2] USDA-FSIS: new actions

The American Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection
Service (USDA-FSIS) today [23 Oct 2007] announced new, ongoing and
upcoming actions to protect public health against the risk of _E.
coli_ O157:H7, including expanded testing and more rapid recalls.
FSIS also provided an update on stepped-up efforts initiated in the
spring and summer of 2007.

"We want the American consumer to know that FSIS has taken a number
of aggressive actions to respond to a recent increase in _E. coli_
O157:H7 recalls and illnesses associated with this pathogen and we
are further expanding these efforts," said Under Secretary for Food
Safety Dr. Richard A. Raymond.

In June 2007, FSIS identified an increased number of _E. coli_
O157:H7 positive tests in beef, as well as a larger number of recalls
and illnesses caused by this pathogen than in recent years.
Immediately, the agency took a number of steps. For example, FSIS
increased the number of tests of ground beef for _E. coli_ O157:H7 by
more than 75 percent in July 2007 and began planning for a new
follow-up testing program for federally inspected beef plants that
had positive tests for _E. coli_ O157:H7. Additionally, FSIS
accelerated implementation of initiatives scheduled for spring 2008
in response to concerns about increased positives of _E. coli_
O157:H7. FSIS accelerated its plans to review suppliers and
processors based on a new checklist, once inspection program
personnel complete specialized training, which begins next week.

"Lessons learned from a number of recalls including the recent Topps
recall emphasized the need for us to do even more to strengthen our
policies and programs," said Raymond. "We also realized that to make
risk-based inspection in processing most effective, we need to
strengthen our database that will support that system."

FSIS determined steps were also needed to ensure that inspection
program personnel and the industry fully understand the nature of the
challenge presented by _E. coli_ O157:H7. The agency is ensuring that
suppliers, processors, and FSIS will be able to identify an emerging
problem as early as possible and to prevent contaminated product from
entering commerce.

On 4 Oct 2007, FSIS publicly outlined the timeline of the Topps
recall, the preliminary findings from its investigation of the Topps
recall, actions already taken by the agency and further steps to
reduce _E. coli_ 0157:H7. The agency has also outlined these actions
for consumer and industry organizations and sought their support in
working together to control this pathogen.

Key initiatives targeted to federally inspected plants that produce
raw beef products include:

Testing and analysis of trim
----------------------------
Based on preliminary data from the agency's beef trim baseline and
scientific literature indicating that contamination of trim is
related to contamination of ground beef, FSIS began trim testing in
March 2007, not waiting for final analysis of the baseline. By
testing earlier in the production chain to identify contaminated beef
trim intended for ground beef, FSIS prevents this source from
contaminating the ground beef available to consumers. This also gives
the agency more data to analyze in determining and implementing the
most appropriate actions to reverse upward trends.

Verifying control of _E. coli_ O157:H7
--------------------------------------
FSIS notified the beef industry that, as of November 2007, all beef
plants will be expected to verify that they are effectively
controlling _E. coli_ O157:H7 during slaughter and processing. The
agency also provided the industry specific examples of minimum
controls that would meet the minimum criteria for a "well-controlled"
process. Identifying which establishments achieve the minimums, and
which establishments do not, will provide FSIS the critical
information on establishments with vulnerabilities.

New checklist for verifying control
-----------------------------------
FSIS inspection program personnel will review both suppliers and
processors based on a new checklist, once they complete specialized
training beginning the week of 29 Oct 2007. Data from the checklists
will be completed in November 2007 and will be updated quarterly to
help the agency more quickly identify significant changes in plants'
production controls and ensure the company takes corrective action.
FSIS will analyze the checklist data and use it to adjust programs or
policies as needed.

Testing more domestic and imported ground beef components
---------------------------------------------------------
FSIS will begin testing materials that are used as components in raw
ground beef, in addition to the beef trim already tested, which is
the primary component. FSIS is also requiring countries whose beef is
imported to the USA to conduct the same sampling or an equivalent measure.

More rapid recalls
------------------
FSIS now takes into account a broader, more complete range of
evidence when evaluating whether to seek a recall or take regulatory
action. This gives the agency a credible approach to more rapidly
taking action when certain types of evidence are available. In 2
recent cases, FSIS acted upon epidemiological evidence that linked
illness to opened, FSIS-inspected product found in consumers freezers.

Targeting routine testing
-------------------------
In January 2008, FSIS will begin routine targeted sampling for _E.
coli_ O157:H7 at slaughter and grinding facilities. Currently, all
plants have an equal chance of being tested. Under this new
verification testing program, FSIS will test larger volume operations
more frequently than in the past. Data from the checklists will be
used to determine testing frequency for establishments.

Ensuring safety of imported beef products
-----------------------------------------
FSIS notified countries that export raw beef product to the USA of
new policies and programs and is working with them to ensure they
implement the same or equivalent measures to protect the public from
_E. coli_ O157:H7 risks.

A comprehensive list of actions by FSIS to reduce _E. coli_ O157:H7
is posted on the FSIS website at

Several state health departments, CDC, and the Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are
investigating a multi-state outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections.
On 29 Sep 2007, USDA issued a notice about a recall of 21.7 millions
pounds of frozen ground beef patties.

Investigators compared the "DNA fingerprint" patterns of _E. coli_
O157 strains found in ground beef with patterns of _E. coli_ O157
strains isolated from ill persons. As of 12 PM (ET) 18 Oct 2007, 40
cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection have been identified with PFGE
(pulsed field gel electrophoresis) patterns that match at least one
of the patterns of _E. coli_ strains found in Topps brand frozen
ground beef patties. Ill persons reside in 8 states [Connecticut (2),
Florida (1), Indiana (1), Maine (1), New Jersey (9), New York (13),
Ohio (1), and Pennsylvania (12)]. Of 33 patients with a detailed food
history, 29 (88 percent) consumed ground beef. 7 illnesses have
confirmed associations with recalled products because the strain
isolated from the person was also isolated from the meat in their
home. The 1st reported illness began on 5 Jul 2007, and the last
began on 24 Sep 2007. Among 32 ill persons for whom hospitalization
status is known, 20 (63 percent) were hospitalized. 2 patients
developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome
(HUS). No deaths have been reported. 18 (45 percent) patients are
female. The ages of patients range from one to 77 years; 48 percent
are between 15 and 24 years old (only 14 percent of the US population
is in this age group).
