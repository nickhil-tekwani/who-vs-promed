[During 2013, LPAI (in poultry) was reported in South Africa, predominantly on ostrich farms in the Western Cape province, followed by smaller outbreaks in 2 provinces (Eastern Cape and Free State). For all recorded 2013 foci, see map at http://tinyurl.com/q3m8thb. (Click on S. Africa to re-centre the map, zoom in).

The new outbreaks were caused by LPAI serotypes H7N7 and H7N1; a continuing outbreak has been caused by serotype H5N2. The latter, which reportedly started on 1 Jun 2012 in ostrich farms in the Western Cape province, is revisited in follow-up report No. 4 dated 23 Dec 2013. This report includes data of 7 new outbreaks; available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14112. A corresponding media report is available at http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/31005/low-pathogenic-bird-flu-in-western-cape-ostriches (thanks to ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall).

Captive egrets were reportedly infected by H7 in the Gauteng province, more than 1000 km away from any other reported H7N1 or H7N7 outbreaks; see 20130830.1914051. - Mod.AS
