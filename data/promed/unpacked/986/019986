Re: the posting from the health officials in Bangladesh regarding the
possible lack of
validity in "The Star"'s story. I find this very interesting, because I
found similar reports in the archives of several other Bangladesh based
publications. It was also reported by "The Independent" about a week prior
to the item in "The Star."
