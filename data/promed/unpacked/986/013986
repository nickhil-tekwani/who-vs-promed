A Case of Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Canada imported from Zambia and local cases
--------------------
The Ottawa GeoSentinel site reported HAT in a 59-year old Canadian woman who had visited Zambia in June 2015. She spent 9 days in the South Luangwa National Park, 3 days in the Lower Zambezi National Park, 1 day in Lusaka, and then returned to Ottawa on 30 Jun 2015. She felt unwell on her flight home with extreme fatigue, fever and chills. She sought medical attention on 6 Jul 2015 and was diagnosed with African trypanosomiasis with high-grade parasitemia on peripheral blood film. PCR was not performed. Her lumbar puncture was normal with no evidence of central nervous system involvement. Nevertheless she was critically ill and spent time in the ICU with respiratory distress. She was initially treated with intravenous pentamidine for approximately 1 week due to difficulty obtaining suramin, the drug of choice. Eventually, she completed 5 doses of suramin over 21 days and was seen in follow-up as an outpatient 2 weeks post-discharge without complications except for residual lethargy.

Dr. Lottie Hachaambwa, an infectious disease specialist at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, provided the following additional information on recent cases of East African trypanosomiasis in Zambia that were treated at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka: a 10-year-old child from Nyimba District (Eastern Province) in July 2015 and a 2-year-old from Rufunsa District, Lusaka Province. This 2nd patient was treated for suspected bacterial meningitis for 5 weeks until a Buffy coat smear was performed which revealed trypanosomes. This was followed by a lumbar puncture which revealed many motile trypanosomes in the CSF. This patient initially improved during treatment with melarsoprol but then deteriorated and died. The 10-year-child from Nyimba did have a normal lumbar puncture and was treated with suramin with good response. He was still doing well at 2-week review. There was also another adult patient who developed Stage 1 HAT after visiting Kafue National Park in March 2015. He was treated with suramin at a private hospital.

These cases provide evidence of ongoing transmission of HAT in Zambia and the potential risk of acquisition of infection by travelers to at least 2 of the national parks, as well as other rural areas of Zambia and the difficulty in obtaining suramin. Clinicians outside of Zambia should be aware of the risk of HAT and conduct appropriate diagnostic evaluations in returning travelers with fever and especially if there are central nervous system abnormalities on examination. Anti-vector daytime measures targeted to prevention of tsetse fly bites for travelers to rural Zambia are also highly recommended.

[Trypanososmiasis is still endemic in the southern and eastern parts of Zambia (see map: http://www.emedmd.com/content/human-african-trypanosomiasis). According to the latest WHO fact sheet on human trypanosomiasis, Zambia has reported fewer than 100 cases annually in recent years (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs259/en/). ProMED reported a small outbreak in April 2014 in Rufunsa District in Lusaka Province with 8 cases (see below). In 2010 ProMED reported 3 cases in travellers who had visited game parks in Zamibia like this patient and diagnosed in South Africa, USA and UK respectively. The cases in Zambian nationals further emphasize that trypanosomiasis is still a risk in rural areas and game parks in Zambia. Visitors to game parks should be aware of tse tse flies and avoid being bitten. - Mod.EP
