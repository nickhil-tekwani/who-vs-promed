A mystery disease that usually strikes horses in Nordic countries during the winter months has emerged in Iceland for the 1st time, leading to the death of 13 horses.

Equine polyneuropathy (AEP), also known as Scandinavian knuckling syndrome, 1st appeared in Scandinavia in 1995, and, despite extensive research, its cause has never been identified.

The illness presents as muscle weakness in the back of the body, which can cause the fetlock joints to knuckle forward, giving it its common name. Horses with the disease exhibit full consciousness, good appetite, and mostly normal behaviour.

AEP is neither contagious nor genetic and usually occurs in populations fed forage, between late winter and early May. While horses are able to make a full recovery, statistics from Norway and Sweden show that up to 30% of animals who contract the disease have to be put down.

The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) confirmed the country's 1st outbreak in a herd of horses at a large horse farm in northwest Iceland at the beginning of June [2019].

Further tests have brought the total of affected horses to 44, 12 of which had to be euthanised, while one was found dead.

In a statement, Sigridur Bjornsdottir, veterinary officer for health and welfare of the horse at MAST, said the disease was linked to hay the horses had been fed.

All affected animals had been fed with hay from the same field, although not all horses who ate the hay showed symptoms.

"AEP has not been found on any other farms in the country, and it can be assumed that the risk of discovering more cases this year [2019] is low, as most young horses are now grazing. There is a risk, however, that the disease will arise elsewhere in the future, as the conditions that cause it have now clearly appeared in Iceland," the statement added.

"As the disease is new to the country, MAST requests notification of all cases where AEP is suspected or confirmed."

AEP is found most commonly in Norway but also in Sweden and Finland, where it is typical for there to be a cluster of cases at one site.

[The 1st report on AEP in Iceland, early June 2019 (20190608.6509133), stated that detectable symptoms were observed in 22 horses at the farm, all between the ages of 2 and 7 years. Of these horses, 7 were put down, and one was found dead. According to the current report, the numbers have risen to a total of 44 affected horses, 12 of which had to be euthanised, while one was found dead. All have been observed on one, single holding.

AEP is an equine disease characterised by bilateral pelvic limb knuckling, observed, before its recent discovery in Iceland, in Sweden, Norway and Finland, and sometimes referred to as Scandinavian knuckling syndrome. A detailed description from Norway and Sweden, published in 2012, is presented in Ref. 1. Its Conclusions section follows:

"Acquired equine polyneuropathy, an emerging peripheral neurological disease in horses, is characterised by pelvic limb knuckling without other signs of general disease. Signs progressed to recumbency in 1/3rd of the cases, which led to euthanasia. Surviving horses returned to health and work after months of rest. Cases clustered in farms during winter/spring season and all cases and controls were fed wrapped forage. Horses of a younger age were more often affected than older horses but tended to recover more rapidly. A forage-related aetiology for this disease is a possibility but has not been proven. Other management risk factors for cases within affected stables were not identified."

A later (2017) report addressed the histopathological changes (Ref. 2). Its abstract follows:

"Acquired equine polyneuropathy (AEP), formerly also known as Scandinavian knuckling syndrome, is one of the most prevalent polyneuropathies in equids in Norway and Sweden, with more than 400 cases registered since 1st observations in 1995. Despite geographical clustering and an association to forage feeding, its aetiology remains unknown. Clinically, AEP is characterized by knuckling due to dysfunction of metatarsophalangeal extensor muscles. This neuropathological study aimed to gain further insights in the pathobiology of AEP and its underlying aetiopathogenesis. We thereby confirmed that all affected horses suffered from similar large fibre neuropathy, exhibiting conspicuous Schwann cell inclusions in most samples, suggestive of a primary disruption of Schwann cell metabolism leading to inclusion body schwannopathy with secondary inflammatory changes. The degree of nerve pathology was not predictive of clinical outcome."
