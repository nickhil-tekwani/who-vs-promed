Nature's Touch Frozen Food Inc. is recalling various frozen mangoes from the marketplace due to possible hepatitis A contamination. Consumers should not consume the recalled products. The products have been sold in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia and may have been distributed in other provinces and territories [the complete product list can be found at the source URL - Mod.LL].

This recall was triggered by findings during an investigation into a foodborne illness outbreak. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings.

The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing the recalled products from the marketplace. There have been reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.

[The number of affected individuals is not stated, nor is the source of the presumed imported fruit; further information would be appreciated. Unlike the continued multistate outbreak of hepatitis A in the USA, which is related to poor sanitation in homeless and/or substance-using individuals, this cluster of cases reflects one of the usual scenarios for hepatitis A virus acquisition in the developed world -- contaminated food. - Mod.LL
