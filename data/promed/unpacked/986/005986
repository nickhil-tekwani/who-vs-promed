Imported case of anthrax registered in Akmola region
----------------------------------------------------
A 26 year old resident of the Turkestan region, who developed symptoms of anthrax, was taken off the train to Kokshetau. The man and his wife were placed in the center of infectious diseases, Kazinform correspondent reports. According to the chief state health doctor of the city of Kokshetau, the man had a fever on the train when he and his wife went on vacation to a sanatorium in the Burabay district [Aqmola Region].

"As it turned out, earlier he and his friend bought meat from a relative -- horse meat. First, a friend fell ill, then this man was identified by contact. Since the infectious disease department is located in Kokshetau, he was immediately hospitalized yesterday to the infectious disease department, in a state of moderate severity. The diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax was confirmed. He was the only one with symptoms. But his wife is also in the hospital, although her test is negative. Contacts were identified for the car (train compartment). The medical service issued a decision on medical observation," K Iskakov explained.

As the interlocutor added, anthrax is transmitted only from an animal to a person when eating meat or when cutting carcasses. It is almost impossible to get infected from a sick person; this requires contact with the patient's blood. Meanwhile, the chief state health doctor of the Akmola region, Ainagul Musina, added that the last case of anthrax among Aqmola residents was registered in 2019.

[Akmola Province (Region in Kazakhstan): Akmola Region is a centrally located region of Kazakhstan. Its capital is Kokshetau. The national capital, Nur-Sultan, is enclosed by the region but is politically separate from Akmola Region. The region's population is 715 000; Kokshetau's is 157 000. The area is 146 200 square kilometers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akmola_Region).

Kazakhstan has been working hard over the past few decades to control anthrax and has largely succeeded. The present situation is but a fraction of what it was. To see their progress, read the following article, which has very useful maps, "Spatio-temporal analysis and visualisation of the anthrax epidemic situation in livestock in Kazakhstan over the period 1933-2016" at https://bit.ly/3HgDnBm. Until recently South Kazakhstan was rife with outbreaks but other than the outbreaks in 2021 (listed below) anthrax has essentially been absent since 2001.

Absence of disease outbreaks can result in a loss of caution. While the owner claims that his horse broke a leg, it was probably found moribund and was slaughtered, and then butchered. Horses are most often infected as a result of being bitten by a contaminated haemophagic tabanid fly. They are not vigorous grazers like cattle and do not browse like goats. I think we can presume that there have been a number of unreported unexpected deaths in the area, which may be attributable to anthrax. Absence of reports is not the same as absence of disease. We can look forward to a report from the veterinary authorities looking into the probable equine source and any related sick animals. - Mod.MHJ
