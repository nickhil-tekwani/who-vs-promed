A 2nd person with a suspected case of the measles has been confirmed in York County, according to the Pennsylvania Secretary of Health. The state health department [Sat 14 Sep 2019] released a list of new locations, dates and times when individuals may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease. The 1st case was reported 2 weeks ago, and affected sites in York and Hershey.

"WellSpan Health is in the process of notifying patients, staff and visitors who were in WellSpan Stony Brook Health Center during the identified times; however, if you have been properly immunized against measles, your risk of getting the disease is minimal," Secretary of Health Rachel Levine said.

The locations and times when residents may have been exposed [can be found at the URL above.]

There have been 14 cases of measles confirmed in Pennsylvania in 2019. And, there have been more than 1200 cases reported nationwide this year [2019]. The health department reported that the number of confirmed measles cases is the greatest number reported since 1992.

The federal Centers for Disease Prevention and Control notes that the most at-risk individuals are:
- Infants less than one year of age who are too young to have received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine;
- Individuals who refused vaccination; and
- Individuals from parts of the world where there is low vaccination coverage or circulating measles.

Additionally, people who have been previously vaccinated may still be at risk if they were vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine, which was used between 1963 and 1967, and have not been revaccinated; or born after 1957 and have only received one dose of MMR vaccine.

Amid a record number of measles cases nationwide, about 24 000 Colorado kids went back to school this fall with personal or religious exemptions from the vaccination that protects against the highly contagious disease.

Public health experts say Colorado is particularly susceptible to a measles outbreak because of low immunization rates, with the state's lenient exemption policies partly to blame. But efforts to tighten rules for non-medical exemptions, including a bill that died in the legislature last spring, have sparked fierce opposition.

A new report notes that Colorado's exemption rate among kindergarteners ticked up slightly last year [2018] while the share of kindergarteners fully immunized against measles fell to 87%, from 89% the previous year [2017].

Last year [2018], 2.75% of more than 864 000 Colorado schoolchildren had religious or personal belief exemptions from the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, commonly called MMR. Another 0.1% of students had exemptions for medical reasons. Meanwhile, the MMR vaccination status of nearly 7% of students was unknown, either because their shot records were incomplete or never submitted to their schools.

The report, from Children's Hospital Colorado and the Colorado Children's Immunization Coalition, also found growing resistance from schools to publicly reporting their immunization and exemption rates.

While state rules require schools to provide this information to the health department annually, only 89% of schools reported it last year [2018], compared with 94% the year before [2018]. The state publishes school immunization and exemption rates in a searchable online database to help parents and members of the public gauge local disease risk.

There has been one confirmed case of measles in Colorado this year [2019], and state health department officials say they have investigated at least 64 other reports of people suspected of having measles, but all were ruled out.

The number of measles cases has ballooned across the country in 2019, with outbreaks in several states, including New York, Washington, Oregon, and Texas. Nationwide, there have been 1241 cases in 31 states. In contrast, there were 372 measles cases nationwide in 2018 and just 63 in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 95% of people in a population must be vaccinated to prevent a disease like measles -- a concept known as herd immunity. Colorado's relatively low measles vaccination rate illustrates the state's vulnerability on a big-picture level, but the risk of an outbreak varies widely by community.

Pockets of unimmunized students can be found in plenty of Colorado schools, including charters with Montessori or Waldorf-inspired curriculums, district-run enrichment programs for homeschooled children, and some alternative schools. At least 67 schools across the state had measles vaccination rates under 80% last year [2018], according to data from the state health department.

[See searchable chart at URL above that] shows 2018-19 MMR vaccination and "personal belief" exemption rates for Colorado schools. The chart doesn't show the percentage of students with religious or medical exemptions, the percentage of students "in process," or the percentage who have turned in no vaccination or exemption paperwork at all. The data come from the Colorado Department Of Public Health and Environment.

http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/measles-cases-are-falling-cdc-says.html


Measles cases have been decreasing in recent weeks, with the CDC reporting only 7 confirmed cases for the week ended [5 Sep 2019]

As of [5 Sep 2019], the CDC had confirmed 1241 measles cases in 31 states this year. Of the 7 new cases, only 2 represent recent infections. The CDC noted measles cases peaked in April with 341 confirmed cases.

Here is a breakdown of 2019 measles cases by month: January - 127 cases; February - 125 cases; March - 303 cases; April - 341 cases; May - 181 cases; June - 77 cases; July - 50 cases; August - 24 cases

[4] US: measles-free status

If New York's outbreak continues into October [2019], the loss of measles elimination status will be a gut punch to public health.

Eliminating measles took decades of work to achieve. "It was a confirmation that our system of immunization was working really well," said Hotez. "The fact that measles is back is a worrying sign there's a problem nationally in our immunization system, that there's been a breakdown."

"It's a line in the sand," said University of Pennsylvania researcher Alison Buttenheim, "to go back to having regularly circulating measles in the country."

If that happens, we'll have to start worrying about the virus again in our communities. But even if America manages to hang on to its elimination status this year [2019], we'll have to wonder whether our children are in schools with high enough vaccine rates, and we'll have to think about measles whenever we travel with newborn babies or family members who can't be immunized. (Hotez said he got a booster shot to make sure he's up to date, and anyone who's worried about their measles immunization status can get a blood test to make sure they have antibodies for the virus.)

It's also possible that America gets the measles under control again soon, and that this doesn't lead to a full-blown disease resurgence.

On the other hand, measles could also be a signal for a bigger problem. Since it tops the list of contagious diseases, cases can begin to turn up even with a small decrease in vaccination coverage rates. And, again, the vaccine coverage rates required for herd immunity are much lower for other less contagious diseases, said Walter Orenstein, an infectious diseases professor at Emory University School of Medicine. "So measles may be the canary in the coal mine in terms of identifying a bigger problem with under-immunization. There's the potential if this continues to worsen; it may mean other diseases are making a comeback."

[The U.S. isn't alone. A total of 4 countries -- Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom -- recently lost their measles elimination status, which the World Health Organization defines as the absence of continuous disease transmission for over 12 months.

The U.S. would immediately lose its elimination status if there is any case connected to the current outbreak on or after 2 Oct 2019, according to CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. If there's a case that was not transmitted through the current outbreak, however, then the U.S. would not lose elimination status.

Only 2 states -- New York and Texas -- are currently experiencing outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases). The nation's largest outbreak this year [2019], concentrated in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of New York City, ended earlier this month [September 2019]. But 3 others are ongoing: in El Paso, Texas, and in New York's Rockland and Wyoming counties.

[5] New York: end of religious exemption
Date: Mon 9 Sep 2019

As children head to school this fall, the number of measles cases in New York has slowed to a trickle, and officials this week declared that the outbreak in New York City, which largely affected Orthodox Jewish families who avoided immunizations, is over.

But even though the New York outbreak -- which has sickened nearly 900 people in 2019 so far and accounted for 3-quarters of all cases nationwide -- may finally be fading, school vaccination requirements remain a contentious issue.

In [June 2019], Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation repealing religious vaccination exemptions for attending school. In addition, state officials last month [August 2019] tightened the rules for physicians to grant exemptions from school vaccinations for medical reasons.

Every state allows medical exemptions from school vaccination requirements, and 15 states allow exemptions for philosophical reasons, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. With the change in its law, New York joins 4 states that don't permit religious exemptions: California, Maine, Mississippi and West Virginia.

There were no new cases of measles in [August 2019] in New York City, which has accounted for about 2-thirds of cases statewide. A total of 10 new cases were reported outside the city, said Jill Montag, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health.

"We're guardedly optimistic," Dr. Demetre Daskalakis [New York City health department's deputy commissioner of disease control] said.

The Jewish faith doesn't discourage vaccinations.

"Measles is not a religious issue," Glatt [Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases and the hospital epidemiologist at South Nassau Communities Hospital on Long Island, who is also a rabbi] said. "I don't think any religion objects to vaccinations from a religious point of view."

Still, 26 217 students in public, private and religious schools, child care centers, nursery schools and prekindergarten programs had religious exemptions from school vaccine requirements in the 2017-18 school year, according to the state health department. Another 4571 had medical exemptions.

[6] California ex New Zealand
Date: Mon 9 Sep 2019

https://kutv.com/news/nation-world/tourist-may-have-brought-measles-to-disneyland


A New Zealand teenager who visited Disneyland and other Southern California tourist spots last week brought along more than just her luggage. She brought measles.

Public health officials in Los Angeles and Orange counties issued a warning on [Fri 6 Sep 2019] that people may have been exposed to the disease if they were at Disneyland or the Disney California Adventure Park on [12 Aug 2019].

The girl had measles when she arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on [11 Aug 2019] and went to the Desert Palms Hotel in Anaheim, officials said.

After Disneyland, she is believed to have gone to Universal Studios, the TCL Chinese Theatre and Madame Tussauds in Hollywood, and the Santa Monica beach and pier on [14-15 Aug 2019]., authorities said. The girl has since returned to New Zealand, said Dr. Nichole Quick, Orange County's health care officer.

The California Department of Public Health said it wasn't aware of any measles cases resulting from exposure to the traveler but is continuing to investigate.

Quick said she expects to see more measles cases, generally, among international travelers who visit California because of an increase in the illness overseas. "We're in general concerned with the outbreaks going on in places in this country as well as internationally," she said.

Measles cases are rising around the world. The number of cases nearly tripled globally during the first 7 months of the year [2019] compared with the same period in 2018, the World Health Organization reported this month.

New Zealand, and the United States, are dealing with their worst outbreaks in decades.

Disneyland officials on [Fri 6 Sep 2019] said no employees at the theme park were reported to have contracted the illness. Dr. Pamela Hymel, Disneyland's chief medical officer, said in a statement that health officials said the risk to employees and visitors "is likely low". "We maintain rigorous sanitation standards to protect guests and cast, and earlier this year [2019] we strengthened our immunization program and educational resources for cast members," the statement said.

Disneyland and adjacent Disney California Adventure Park are major tourist destinations, drawing tens of thousands of visitors a day. In 2015, a measles outbreak involving Disneyland sickened 147 people and spread across the U.S. and into Canada.

As of early this month [September 2019], Los Angeles County health officials reported 16 measles cases among county residents this year [2019] and -- in addition to the New Zealand girl -- 10 others among non-residents who traveled through.

People who attended a football tournament in Hamilton and some businesses are being warned they could have been exposed to measles. On [Wed 11 Sep 2019] the Waikato District Health Board confirmed there are 13 measles cases in the Waikato including Hamilton, Paeroa and Morrinsville.

The District Health Board is urging people who attended the New Zealand Secondary School Girls Football tournament in Hamilton to be aware they may have been exposed to measles.

The tournament ran from [3 Sep 2019] and organisers have been asked to alert all participating teams.
