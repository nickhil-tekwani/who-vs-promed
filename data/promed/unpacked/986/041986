- France has reported its first monkeypox case -- a man from the country's Ile-de-France region, which includes Paris. He had not travelled recently to a country where the virus is currently circulating, health authorities said Friday [20 May 2022].
- Belgium has reported 2 confirmed cases. They live in different cities but were at the same party (at an undisclosed location). Neither is seriously ill, although both are in isolation, AFP said citing Belgian media reports.
- Germany: first case was reported by Reuters, which quoted Focus, a German-language news magazine that, in turn, cited the German military.
- Italy on Thursday [19 May 2022] reported its 1st case.
- Sweden reported its 1st case on Thursday [19 May 2022].
- Portugal has 14 cases so far, with 20 others being monitored.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has detected 11 additional cases of monkeypox in England. The latest cases bring the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England since [6 May 2022] to 20.

Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser, UKHSA, said: we anticipated that further cases would be detected through our active case finding with NHS services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals. We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community. Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally. We continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals. We are contacting any identified close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice.

Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact NHS 111 or a sexual health service if they have any concerns. Please contact clinics ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you have been seen by a clinician.

A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men so we are particularly encouraging them to be alert to the symptoms and seek help if concerned. Clinicians should be alert to any individual presenting with unusual rashes without a clear alternative diagnosis and should contact specialist services for advice.

Key points:
- The men in their 30s and 40s are both recently returned travellers
- Both cases are experiencing mild symptoms and isolating
- Victorian health authorities are warning contacts of the monkeypox case to monitor for symptoms

There are 2 cases of monkeypox that have been confirmed, one in Melbourne and another in Sydney. The case in Melbourne is a man in his 30s who developed mild symptoms before returning home from London on [16 May 2022] and then sought medical attention. He remains in isolation at the Alfred Hospital with mild symptoms.

Monkeypox is a viral infection which does not spread easily between people and tends to be mild in presentation. Dozens of cases have been either confirmed or are under investigation across the US, Canada, Europe and the UK in recent weeks. It has raised alarm because the disease is usually only found in west and central Africa, and rarely spreads elsewhere.

Meanwhile NSW health authorities have confirmed the virus has been identified in a man who recently returned to Sydney from Europe.The man, in his 40s, went to his GP with mild symptoms several days after landing in NSW. It was determined his symptoms were clinically compatible with monkeypox and urgent testing was carried out. It's the first case to be confirmed in the state.

Chief health officer Kerry Chant said the virus was not a cause for panic given its low level of transmissibility between humans. "Usually, you need to have quite prolonged face-to-face contact," Dr Chant said. "It is not the same spread mechanism as COVID or the flu, where it [transmission] is more fleeting." However, Dr Chant said, people should still remain vigilant about potential symptoms of the virus. "It starts off with fever, muscle aches and pains. You can get those in large lymph nodes, headaches, feeling tired and lethargic," she explained. "And then it can be followed by a rash 1-3 days longer. Often the rash starts on the face."

The man and a close contact are now isolating at home with care and support being provided by NSW Health and his GP.

Belgian health experts were due to meet on Friday [20 May 2022] after the country detected its first 2 cases of monkeypox, authorities said. The cases were diagnosed in different cities, though Flemish broadcaster VRTNWS said both patients had attended the same party in an undisclosed location. Reuters could not immediately confirm this.

A leading virologist said the number of cases in the country would probably rise. "I do expect more cases," said Steven Van Gucht from national public health institute Sciensano. As things stood, he was however confident that Belgium would be able to control the spread of the virus, he told Reuters.

The first infected person, diagnosed in Antwerp but whose place of residence was not reported, was not seriously ill and they and their partner were both in isolation, a spokesperson for Belgium's Agency for Care and Health said.

The second case was a man from the region of Flemish Brabant, a Leuven-based virologist, Marc Van Ranst, said on Twitter. That patient was also not seriously ill, according to Belgian media.

Health authorities in Spain reported on Friday [20 May 2022] 24 new confirmed cases of monkeypox, mainly in the Madrid region where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. The total tally in Spain has now reached 30, while 23 confirmed cases have now been identified in neighbouring Portugal, where 9 new cases were detected on Friday [20 May 2022].

Madrid authorities have been working on tracing the cases mainly from a single outbreak in a sauna, regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero told reporters on Friday [20 May 2022]. The word sauna is used in Spain to describe establishments popular with gay men looking for sex rather than just a bathhouse.

"The Public Health Department will carry out an even more detailed analysis... to control contagion, cut the chains of transmission and try to mitigate the transmission of this virus as much as possible," he said.

The Extremadura region confirmed its first case on Friday afternoon [20 May 2022].

Another 18 suspected cases are under investigation in Spain, 15 in the Madrid region, 2 in the Canary Islands and one in Andalusia, the health authorities said.

Spain is assessing different therapeutic options, such as antivirals and vaccines, but so far all cases have mild symptoms and therefore no specific ad hoc treatment has been necessary, Spanish health minister Carolina Darias told reporters on Friday [20 May 2022].

"One person in the Stockholm region has been confirmed to be infected with monkey pox," Sweden's Public Health Agency said in a statement. The infected person "is not seriously ill, but has been given care," according to the agency.

"We still don't know where the person was infected. An investigation is currently under way," Klara Sonden, an infectious disease doctor and investigator at the agency, said in a statement. The health authority said it is now "investigating with the regional infection control centres whether there are more cases in Sweden."

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also said on Thursday [19 May 2022] it expects to publish a first risk assessment report "early next week." The European Union agency, which said it was "monitoring the situation closely", recommends that "suspected cases should be isolated and tested and notified promptly".

Italy on Friday [20 May 2022] confirmed 2 more cases of monkeypox infection at the Spallanzani hospital in Rome, bringing the total cases to 3 so far in the country. The Lazio region health commissioner Alessio D'Amato said in a statement that the 2 other suspected infections related to the first detected case had now been confirmed. The Spallanzani hospital said on Thursday [19 May 2022] that the first patient with monkeypox, a mild viral infection whose symptoms include fever, headaches as well as a distinctive bumpy rash, had come back to Italy from a stay on the Canary islands.

Andrea Antinori, a doctor at the hospital, which specialises in infectious diseases, said in a news conference that many of the cases reported in Europe had originated through human-to-human transmission. "Our cases confirm this trend," he said, adding that it was too early to say if the illness could be defined as a sexually transmitted disease.

D'Amato said during the news conference that each detected case had come into contact with about 10 people, so screening would concern 30 contacts.

There are 2 main strains [clades]: the Congo strain, which is more severe -- with up to 10% mortality -- and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate of about 1%.

Monkeypox is likely being spread from person-to-person by close, intimate or sexual contact with someone who has an active rash, US senior health officials said.

The one US case of the virus, usually contracted from infected animals, has no known link to Africa, where the disease is most commonly found, said the officials, who spoke without being identified as a condition of participating in the call. While the risk to the general public is low, health workers are being alerted to monitor possible cases and use protective equipment when needed, they said.

Unlike the COVID-19 virus, which is spread through the air and respiratory droplets, spreading monkeypox requires much closer contact. Sharing bedding, clothing or a toothbrush with an infected person would create greater risk, the officials said on the call.

New and suspected cases of monkeypox have been cropping up in Europe and North America recent days. The rare and potentially deadly cousin of the smallpox virus is traditionally confined to regions in Africa, but health officials are concerned about its wide spread.

The World Health Organization said it has confirmed 37 cases and is investigating 71 worldwide. Most of those detected so far are among men who have sex with men, health officials have said. An advisory group to WHO on infections with pandemic and endemic potential met on Friday [20 May 2022] to discuss monkeypox, which has been a priority pathogen for the agency for years, according to a spokesperson.

With the summer months approaching, more events and social situations may give opportunities for the virus to spread, the US senior health officials said on the call. They also said there are ample supplies of an antiviral medication that fights monkeypox, SIGA Technologies Inc.'s Tpoxx (tecovirimat, a drug designed for the treatment of smallpox https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-indication-treatment-smallpox. - Mod.SH), in the national stockpile.

[This outbreak of monkeypox (MPX) infection is remarkable because of its simultaneous occurrence in geographically widely separated localities. Transmission is from person to person, with no evidence of animals being involved as is the case in Africa. Although all cases so far have been reported in men, many gay or bisexual, it is not certain if sexual intercourse per se is involved in transmission or if other types of close physical contact, or both, are responsible. Some chains of apparent person to person transmission have been identified that may account for the appearance of cases in more distant places. In other cases, these geographic linkages are not as obvious. The bad news: given the scores of cases there are very likely many more that are undiagnosed and not reported. These reported cases may be just the tip of the epidemiological iceberg. The good news: the West African clade has been identified as responsible for the cases where sequencing has been done. This clade is less pathogenic than the Central African one and is likely why no severe cases requiring hospitalization or fatalities have been reported. It will be interesting to see a genomic study that compares MPX viruses from distant localities to see how genetically different or similar they are. It is highly likely that we will be seeing more cases in a variety of places in the near future. - Mod.TY]
