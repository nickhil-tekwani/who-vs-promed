Since late 2003, 62 countries around the world have reported cases of
highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (H5N1 HPAI) in poultry and
wild birds. Up to September 2010, the cumulative number of confirmed
human cases of H5N1 HPAI reported to the World Health Organization is
504, of which 299 have resulted in death.

The H5N1 HPAI global disease situation is now relatively stable, but
still alarming in some countries where the disease is considered
entrenched. In these locations, pockets of infections are closely
associated to well-known risk factors, such as high human and chicken
densities, large free-grazing duck populations, poor biosecurity in
smallholder units and culturally-determined food market habits linked
to poor poultry hygiene.

In 2007, the use of spatial cluster analysis revealed the presence of
more specific risk factors supporting the spread of infections in
selected geographical clusters, such as the higher percentage of
surface water which would support higher densities of domestic and
wild water birds compared with other adjacent regions.

For instance, in Southeast Asia the presence of agro-livestock
farming systems involving the combination of paddy rice production,
domestic water birds and poultry in the river deltas is ubiquitous.
These specific mixtures of factors are likely to be important for
maintenance of infection given that H5N1 HPAI thrives in the presence
of water, bird faeces, ducks and chickens. More recently, a study
published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases found
that 2 risk factors -- poultry density and road density -- had a
statistically significant correlation with the number of H5N1 HPAI
outbreaks in poultry at district levels in West Java Province,
Indonesia.

Both the medical and veterinary professions recognize the vital roles
played by identifying and understanding disease risk determinants.
Such knowledge underpins a multilayered approach to proactive disease
risk management; one that combines the interlocking elements of
foresight, prevention, impact mitigation, early detection, and swift
and effective reaction.

To accomplish its mandate of achieving food security for all, the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is
undertaking various studies to better understand the root causes that
underpin pathogen evolution, establishment and persistence. These
studies could potentially reveal viable options to address
high-impact transboundary diseases that are emerging and re-emerging
globally, thereby affecting animal and human health.

The latest HPAI outbreaks for the period 1-31 Aug 2010
----------------------------------------------
1. AFRICA

EGYPT
A total of 13 H5 HPAI positive cases were reported in 7 governorates
during 1-31 Aug 2010: Beni Suef (3), Dakahlia (3), Gharbia (1), Giza
(1), Kafr el Sheikh (1), Menoufia (3) and Qena (1) Governorates (The
number of outbreaks in the governorate is in brackets). All of the
outbreaks were in household poultry, except for one commercial farm
in the Kafr-el-Sheikh Governorate. There were also 2 human cases of
H1N5 infection confirmed in Cairo and Qalioubiya Governorates during
the same period. The case in Cairo had exposure to sick and dead
poultry.

2. ASIA

INDONESIA
The Participatory Disease Surveillance & Response (PDSR) programme
through 33 Local Disease Control Centres covers 71 038 villages in 84
percent of Indonesia's 448 districts and municipalities in 29 of its
33 provinces. During June 2010, PDSR conducted surveillance in 1780
villages (2.5 percent). The overall HPAI incidence was 0.4 infected
villages per 1000 villages under surveillance. The disease incidence
did not vary very much, as only a few provinces reported new infected
villages. The province with the highest incidence values was
Yogyakarta (6.8 per 1000 villages). The number of newly infected
villages found during June 2010 by island was: 5 in Sumatra, 23 in
Java, one in Kalimantan and Sulawesi.

[The chapter WORLDWIDE SITUATION is terminated by the following "Conclusions":]

CONCLUSIONS
-------------
Since 2003, 63 countries/territories have experienced outbreaks of
H5N1 HPAI. The last newly infected country was Bhutan in February
2010. Effective control measures for outbreaks in poultry have been
associated with reduced incidence of human infections in several
countries. However, H5N1 HPAI remains entrenched in poultry in parts
of Asia and Africa (Egypt), and thus the risk of human infection
remains.

The number of countries reporting outbreaks has been gradually
decreasing since it peaked in 2006. Surprisingly, 2010 has broken the
tendency, and the number of affected countries between January and
June 2010 already surpasses that of 2009. The total number of
outbreaks reported shows a similar, but more pronounced, trend, also
with a rise during 2010.

Between January and June 2010, 390 H5N1 HPAI outbreaks have been
reported, compared to 297 in the whole 2009. Nevertheless, the number
of reported outbreaks is a more subjective indicator than the number
of affected countries, because it is highly influenced by variables
such as the case definition used, the awareness level, the
intensity/effectiveness of surveillance programmes in countries and
the willingness to report.

Although there has been an improvement in disease awareness,
outbreaks/cases of H5N1 HPAI are still likely to be under-estimated
and under-reported in some regions because of limitations in the
capacity of veterinary services to implement sensitive and
cost-effective disease surveillance, the lack of proper outbreak
investigations in the field, and the absence or weakness of
compensation schemes.

Data from previous years have shown a peak during the January-March
period in terms of countries affected, number of reported outbreaks
and also human cases. In April 2010, numbers started decreasing
following high activity season, and such a trend has continued during
May and June 2010. While February 2010 constituted the peak of the
January-March 2010 season in terms of the number of outbreaks
reported, the peak in terms of number of countries affected was
reached in March 2010.

Overall, there is a decreasing trend in the height of the peak as
years go by. However, in terms of number of outbreaks, and against
the decreasing trend observed since 2004, the peak height reached
dimensions similar to the peaks of 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, and
considerably higher than the 2008-2009 peak. This is explained by the
higher contribution of Africa (Egypt) to the total number of
outbreaks, because of the implementation of a more intensive
surveillance programme (CAHO), together with the fact that
vaccination of backyard poultry was stopped in July 2009. It may also
be related to a reduction in the efficacy of control programmes
(fatigue).
