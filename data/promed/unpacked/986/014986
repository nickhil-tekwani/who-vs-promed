Four butchers died after being infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [CCHF] virus in September 2013.

Amid the paralysing spread of polio in Fata and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), the CCHF virus may be the next epidemic to hit the country. The virus may be a serious threat to human lives if timely precautionary measures are not taken, warned Dr Muhammad Najeeb Khan Durrani, the senior Surveillance Coordinator Communicable Diseases, Islamabad.

People in areas of Punjab, K-P and Balochistan have been exposed to the deadly virus, Dr Durrani, who is also member of the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network, told The Express Tribune. People think that because of its name, CCHF virus cannot be found in Pakistan, which is an ignorant assumption, he said. "CCHF virus is a reality in the country."

The virus causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a widespread tickborne viral disease in domestic and wild animals that affects humans. Domestic animals brought from Afghanistan to Pakistan through the border at Chaman carry the infectious ticks. The disease spreads among the animals through the ticks. In humans, it is spread by close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected animals or persons.

The virus was initially found in Loralai in 2006, where some butchers and livestock buyers died because of the disease, revealed Dr Durrani. Authorities took immediate precautionary measures then, and it was made mandatory for Afghan sheep to cross a pond filled with virus-killing medicine [sheep dip?]. This precautionary practice continued for some time, which helped in CCHF prevention. However, the practice has not continued for a few years due to negligence.

The recent outbreak of virus was reported on Sat 7 Sep 2013 in Haripur when 4 butchers lost their lives after they slaughtered and touched the meat of a sheep. Sohrab Ahmed, president of the Butchers' Association of Haripur, while reporting on the deaths of the 4 butchers, told The Express Tribune that the sheep were bought from the animals' market in Hazro, Attock. Ahmed said it is a known fact that the animals sold at the Hazro market are being brought over from Afghanistan.

The district administration of Haripur immediately imposed a ban on the slaughtering of animals for 7 days and arranged for a vaccine [disinfectant?] spray in the meat shops and houses of butchers. The butchers have also been provided with safety kits that include masks, hand gloves, and aprons that they still use. Generally, sheep, cows, and other animals are exported to Afghanistan from Pakistan via the Torkham border, but a large number of lambs are also brought for grazing in the mountainous areas of Balochistan from the eastern neighboring country. After the Afghan lambs are 2-3 years old, they are sold to local businessmen and cattle traders in Pakistan.

"It is most of the Afghan sheep that carry the infectious tick which spreads CCHF virus in Balochistan, Punjab, and K-P," said Dr Durrani.

[CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vectors. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies.

The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas, where they have been at the origin of human cases in Southern Africa. Generally, infected livestock carrying CCHF virus-infected ticks show no signs of illness.

It is likely that CCHF virus has been prevalent in Pakistan for some time, although, as argued in this press article, the greatest risk of infection is related to the importation of livestock for slaughter from Afghanistan and the current lack of veterinary control at border crossings.

General supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective.
