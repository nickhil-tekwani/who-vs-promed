Blood samples tested negative for Ebola and Marburg by PCR
----------------------------------------------------------------
Re the report of new cases of hemorrhagic fever in Watsa (see ref. below):
The Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Surveillance and Research Project in Watsa,
DRC, a collaborative undertaking of the Institut de Recherche Biomedicale,
Kinshasa, the Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, and
the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Johannesburg, has been assisting
the local health authorities in Watsa and neighbouring health zones in VHF
[viral hemorrhagic fever] surveillance and outbreak investigation activities
for more than a year.
According to our local project manager in Watsa, the last time that cases
compatible with VHF have been observed in Watsa was in September 2002. There
were 2 unrelated cases, both patients died. Their blood samples have been
analysed at NIV [National Institute of Virology, Johannesburg, South Africa]
and were found negative for Marburg [virus by] PCR. Furthermore, in
October/November 2002 our team has carried out an investigation of 6 suspect
VHF cases in Bengadi (Doruma health zone) and one suspect case in Dungu, all
unrelated to each other. All 6 are alive, and their blood samples tested
negative at NIV for Ebola and Marburg by PCR.
Our project manager has just spoken to WHO representatives in Isiro and
Kisangani via HF radio, who say [they are] not aware of new suspect VHF
cases in Isiro and Ango.
The last time that a Marburg [virus] case was confirmed in a sample from
Watsa was in August 2000.

[ProMED thanks Dr Borchert for this authoritative report. This leaves open
the fascinating riddle of exactly what did cause the hemorrhagic fevers in
these cases in 2002? Knowing Bob Swanepoel at the NIV, I am sure that
yellow fever, CCHF (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever), and all the other
known African agents that might cause hemorrhage have been excluded. -
