Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. James P. Nataro, Theodore Steiner,
and Richard L. Guerrant, University of Maryland School of Medicine,
Baltimore, Maryland, USA; and University of Virginia School of
Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA
Since first described in 1987, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)
have been recognized increasingly as agents of diarrhea in developing
countries and (more recently) in industrialized countries. We review the
data supporting the pathogenicity of EAEC, discuss clinical and
epidemiologic features, and summarize the current status of EAEC
pathogenesis research...
Conclusions: EAEC is an emerging diarrheal pathogen linked to acute and
persistent diarrhea in both developing and industrialized countries.
Both sporadic diarrhea and outbreaks (possibly foodborne) have been
described. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are being elucidated; likely
not all EAEC strains are equally pathogenic. The mechanism of the
association between EAEC and malnutrition is not entirely clear,
although plausible pathogenetic models can be proposed. Malnutrition
predisposes to persistent diarrhea; whether this is due to impaired host
immunity (preventing normal killing of pathogens) or to altered
intestinal physiology (predisposing to more severe infections) is not
known. However, it seems also plausible that asymptomatic colonization
with EAEC may lead to malnutrition caused by increased metabolic demand
secondary to intestinal inflammation, persistent mucosal damage due to
cytotoxins, and/or the presence of a barrier to the absorption of
nutrients imposed by the mucus/bacteria biofilm. A vicious cycle may
thus operate wherein malnutrition and infection perpetuate and enable
each other. The pathophysiologic machinery that propels children through
this circle is probably multifactorial and opens several possible
avenues for intervention against this important global problem.

[Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC) has typically been identified based on
adhesion to human HEp-2 tissue culture cells, unlike _E. coli_ O157 which
is defined serologically. EAEC is responsible for a significant proportion
of the diarrheal disease experienced by children in the developing world.
The organism is reported to have been isolated from up to 20-30% of
children with chronic diarrhea in India. - Mod.ES]
