[1] Cases in various countries
Asia
Nepal
- Dharan region. 4 Jun 2019. Dengue Nepal now said to be out of control in Dharan region, 75 cases so far... https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/dharan-dengue-outbreak-out-of-control/

- Sunsari District. 24 May 2019. A 29-year female visited our hospital to evaluate her condition after she was diagnosed with dengue virus (NS1 antigen positive) in Bargachi-15, Dharan (sub-metropolitan city), Sunsari district, and reconfirmed by our hospital's laboratory (NS1 antigen positive). Her symptoms appeared 3 days ago with high-grade fever, nausea, severe joint pain, rash, body ache but without a history of retro-orbital pain. According to her, there are several others, who showed symptoms similar to those of dengue fever (hers).
Dengue is usually observed or peaks during the post monsoon period in Nepal. It is, therefore, atypical to see dengue outbreaks during this pre-monsoon season, and thus warrants investigation to understand the cause this outbreak.

- Kathmandu. 22 May 2019. On 20 Feb 2019, a 26-year male, resident of Bhotebahal, Kathmandu visited the out-patient department of Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital with a 5-day history of fever with chills and rigors, headache, bleeding from the gums and pain behind the eyes. He had no history of rash, but experienced noise or ringing in his ears (tinnitus), which is not a typical symptom for dengue fever. He denied any history of travel outside Kathmandu. He tested positive for dengue virus (IgG) but negative for scrub typhus and leptospira. This is the 2nd reported case of indigenous dengue fever in Kathmandu this year [2019]. The 1st case of indigenous dengue was reported in Kathmandu in February 2019. (ProMED-mail archive 20190216.6318840).

For the last few years, dengue has been periodically observed in Kathmandu. It is, therefore, essential to raise awareness of preventive measures against dengue involving local stakeholders to avoid from possible future outbreaks in Kathmandu.
