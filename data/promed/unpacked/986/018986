2004/005 1st finding of Stolbur phytoplasma in Austria
------------------------------------------------------
The National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) of Austria recently
notified the EPPO Secretariat of the first finding of Stolbur phytoplasma
(EPPO A2 list) on ware potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_). The disease was
detected by a farmer in the district of Neunkirchen (Niederosterreich), and
the local plant protection service in Niederosterreich was notified. The
occurrence of the pathogen was confirmed officially.
The local plant protection service ordered that the potatoes from the
infested field be marketed for consumption only and not for planting. The
field will be inspected officially in the current season (summer 2004), and
volunteer plants will be destroyed. The source of this infection is unknown.
The declared status of Stolbur phytoplasma in Austria is: present, first
found in 2003, only in one farm in Niederosterreich, under observation.

[Phytoplasma-induced diseases are an increasingly common factor in
production of major food crops. Disease management basically depends upon
planting certified seed in areas free of phytoplasmas or, in the case of
areas infested with infected weeds and leafhoppers, use of chemical
insecticides to reduce vector populations. Stolbur disease incidence in
potato can be high, leading to significant crop loss, but the disease tends
not to persist in stocks. Development of resistance to phytoplasmas may
offer a measure of control. - Mod.DH]
