A Comment on the Host Range of Cowpox virus
-------------------------------------------
Cowpox has also been reported in zoo and circus elephants in Europe. The
disease can be quite debilitating in Asian elephants with fatal
dissemination documented in neonatal animals. Localized cowpox lesions have
also occurred in humans exposed to elephants with cowpox.

[I am indebted to Dr. Montali for this information. Derrick Baxby has
pointed out that early workers on cowpox and monkeypox viruses failed to
appreciate the difference between reservoir hosts and indicator hosts, and
these viruses were given inappropriate names. In the case of cowpox virus,
bovine infection is very rare and the domestic cat is the most common
victim. The likely reservoir hosts are rodents; susliks and gerbils in the
territories of the former Soviet Union, and bank voles and wood mice in the
UK. Dr. Montali's experience demonstrates that cowpox can be transmitted to
a variety of exotic animal species in zoological gardens in addition to
felids. - Mod.CP
