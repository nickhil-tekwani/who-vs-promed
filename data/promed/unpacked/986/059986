With regard to the very interesting reports from Ecuador on pneumonic
plague, and the recent cases in domestic animals in New Mexico, I offer the
following for anyone who may wish more background on plague epidemiology:
In the Western Hemisphere, plague foci are found in several discrete areas.
Quoting from the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases
information on plague: "In North America, plague is found from the Pacific
Coast eastward to the western Great Plains and from British Columbia and
Alberta, Canada southward to Mexico. Most of the human cases occur in two
regions; one in northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, and southern
Colorado, another in California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada. In
South America, active plague foci exist in two regions; the Andean mountain
region (including parts of Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador) and in Brazil."
Plague in humans typically takes one of three forms: bubonic (most common
and having the best survival rate), septicemic, and pneumonic.
Bubonic plague results from dermal inoculation of plague bacilli, usually
via the bite of an infected flea. In addition to headache, fever, and
general malaise, regional lymph nodes become extremely swollen and painful.
The case fatality rate for untreated bubonic plague is 50%-60%; prompt and
appropriate antimicrobial treatment greatly improves chances for survival,
but in the United States plague is sufficiently rare that some cases remain
undiagnosed until too late.
Plague septicemia results when plague bacilli are disseminated throughout
the body via the blood stream and pneumonic plague occurs when the lungs
become involved. Mortality is very high with both septicemic and pneumonic
plague. Untreated, these forms are almost invariably fatal; prognosis is
often poor even when appropriate treatment is administered.
Although septicemic plague usually develops from untreated bubonic plague,
and pneumonic plague is usually secondary to septicemic infection, both
septicemic plague and pneumonic plague can occur as primary infections.
The April 8, 1994, issue of the CDC's _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report contains a report of human plague cases in the southwestern United
States in 1993 and 1994. Of 10 human plague cases reported to CDC during
1993, seven were bubonic, two were primary septicemic, and one was primary
pneumonic. Two of these patients were apparently bitten by fleas and two
patients were infected by cats that showed signs of plague infection. The
mode of infection was not determined in the remaining five, but there was
apparently an association between these cases and plague epizootics in local
populations of rock squirrels, woodrats, or peridomestic rodent species.
Of the two cat-transmitted cases, one was bubonic and acquired via a scratch
from an infected cat. The other was a primary pneumonic infection contracted
by a veterinarian who had examined a plague-infected cat, apparently by
inhaling infectious aerosol.
Regarding the likelihood of acquiring plague from infected cats, the CDC
says: "Before 1977, domestic cats were not reported as sources of human
plague infection; however, since 1977, cats have been identified as the
source of infection for 15 human plague cases. In addition, the proportion
of human plague cases with primary pneumonic plague has been substantially
higher among cat-associated cases (four of 15 cases) than among cases for
which cats were not sources of infection (one of 236 cases). Persons working
in veterinary practices should be warned of the risks associated with
handling plague-infected cats. Four of the 15 cat-associated cases occurred
in veterinarians or their assistants. In addition, CDC recommends that
veterinary personnel wear gloves and eye protection and take appropriate
respiratory precautions when examining sick cats in or from plague-endemic
areas, especially cats with lymphadenopathy, oral lesions, or pneumonia."
