Boston Children's Hospital said on Tue [30 Sep 2014] that it is monitoring patients who have developed polio-like symptoms, possibly related to enterovirus D68.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is currently investigating 9 cases in Colorado where symptoms consisted of weakness in one or more limbs and an MRI showed distinctive findings in the central portion of the spinal cord causing weakness.

Dr. Mark Gorman of Boston Children's Hospital said at a Tuesday [30 Sep 2014] press conference that patients who meet 3 sets of criteria will have additional samples sent to be tested by the CDC.

Patients who are under 21 years old, have experienced limb weakness on or after [1 Aug 2014] and have an MRI that show lesions near the spinal cord will be tested for enterovirus D68.

Gorman said Children's Hospital has seen 4 patients who met the criteria set by the CDC. Of the 4, one had a nasal sample that was negative for enterovirus D68, and the other results have not yet come in.

The patients admitted to Children's Hospital range from 4 to 15 years old. None of the 4 had enterovirus D68 detected in their spinal fluid. One of the 4 children has since been discharged from the hospital.

There is not a clear relationship between enterovirus and the polio-like symptoms, doctors said. Gorman added that it is a 2-part illness where patients develop respiratory symptoms followed by neurological symptoms about 2 weeks later.

"I should be clear that these patients do not have polio," said Gorman.

Gorman added that Children's Hospital doctors are working with medical centers nationally to gather more information and determine how to help children and families impacted by the symptoms.

CBS Denver reported that 9 children were recently taken to an Aurora, Colorado hospital with muscle weakness and some with loss of feeling in their arms or legs. Colorado doctors ran additional tests, and 4 of the patients tested positive for enterovirus D68.

Families are reminded to take preventative steps to help avoid illness in themselves and their children.

Gorman said good hand washing is the 1st step to avoiding illness. He also said that if parents or children have an active illness, they should stay home, adding that anyone with unusual symptoms should seek immediate medical attention.

[2] Colorado, 1 new case
Date: 30 Sep 2014

State health authorities have confirmed a 10th case of paralysis-like symptoms in a Colorado child, an outbreak that state and federal officials say might be linked to concurrent viral outbreaks.

The 10th child is at Children's Hospital Colorado, where the other 9 children were diagnosed, said Dr. Larry Wolk, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and a pediatrician.

At a news conference at the hospital Monday [29 Sep 2014], Children's Hospital doctors said it is too soon to know whether the afflicted kids will recover from the paralysis or how long that recovery might take. And they're no closer to understanding why Colorado appears to be the focus of the ailment.

Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director of infection prevention and control at Children's Hospital, said the affected group -- kids averaging 8 years old -- provides fertile ground for the spread of viruses, especially at this time of year.

"You have a new strain of virus circulating in a susceptible population that likes to spread things back and forth to each other. It's really a perfect storm for spreading viral illness through school settings, day care settings and really from the middle of the nation throughout the rest of the nation," Nyquist said. "We really can't say this is something specific to Colorado's environment."

Doctors emphasized that it remains uncertain whether the muscle weakness is connected to the viral outbreak.

The Colorado cases were identified between [8 Aug and 17 Sep 2014] among children ages 1-18, most from the Denver area.

8 of the 9 children originally diagnosed with what Wolk called myelitis, an infection or inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord, were tested for viral outbreaks. 4 children tested positive for enterovirus 68, and the other 4 were positive for rhinovirus or another enterovirus. There was no information given for the 10th child.

Dr. Joyce Oleszek, who specializes in pediatric rehabilitation medicine, said there are no cases where the children are completely unable to move, just varying degrees of muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, weakness in the neck and trunk, and difficulty walking. She said it was too early to know whether the paralysis is permanent. "Only time will tell," she said.

The parents of one of the 10 Colorado children affected by the illness said their daughter came down with respiratory symptoms 7 weeks ago, but they didn't take her complaints very seriously. By the end of August [2014], though, a fever surfaced, and then got worse until "she was sicker than I've ever seen her," said the girl's mother, who agreed to talk on condition her daughter's identity would be protected.

The girl's left arm weakened. She couldn't cross the monkey bars anymore or steer her bicycle. When she played the piano, her left hand suddenly struggled to touch the keys. When she wasn't better by Labor Day, her parents took her to see a doctor and learned of the similar symptoms that had struck other Colorado children.

The girl, a Denver grade-schooler, still suffers from the illness. And though she never was paralyzed, the prognosis for her left arm is unclear. She is undergoing physical therapy now and is stable. Despite her daughter's hospitalization in mid-September 2014, her mother said, "we also count our blessings. It could have been a lot worse."

Doctors still don't understand how the illness is attacking the body, said Dr. Sam Dominguez, a microbial epidemiologist at Children's. And they remain concerned that they may see more cases emerge.

It will probably take weeks to determine whether enterovirus was the cause of the paralysis, Dominguez added, but doctors may never know.

On Friday [26 Sep 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a national alert for doctors in other states to watch for patients suffering from limb weakness accompanied by lesions on the spine.

"Parents shouldn't panic," Nyquist said. She pointed out that millions of children are being infected with enterovirus 68 across the nation and have nothing more than simple cold symptoms. "Doing those things you can do for your children in the beginning is really the most important thing for parents to focus on, and when to go get health care," Nyquist said.

Difficulty breathing or walking or weakness in a limb are all warning signs that parents should seek medical care, regardless of whether there are respiratory symptoms.

Nyquist noted that Children's Hospital had seen 4021 kids with severe respiratory illness in the emergency room or in urgent care between [18 Aug 2014] and the past weekend [27-28 Sep 2014]. Of those, about 10 percent were admitted to the hospital, a higher than usual number for this time of year.

[3] Colorado 10 cases, Missouri 3 cases RFI

What started out as a typical enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) outbreak has changed into something more serious. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is looking into a link between the recent enterovirus D68 outbreak and paralysis in children. Bloomberg Businessweek reported on [29 Sep 2014] at least 10 cases of children with paralysis in Colorado and 3 in Missouri. All 13 children had EV-D68.

40 states have reported cases of EV-D68 with only 277 confirmed cases. Hospitals in Colorado have reported thousands of suspected cases. In New York, they are only testing children with the most severe symptoms due to the high number of pediatric emergency room events. Missouri hospitals have reported many cases, 3 of which included paralysis symptoms.

It is known that EV-D68 can cause muscle weakness and paralysis in the limbs. It was thought to be a very rare symptom of the disease. Out of the thousands of suspected cases of the virus this year [2014], only a few have developed muscle weakness or paralysis. The Huffington Post says the symptoms are not polio related. Most of the children with paralysis symptoms or severe muscle weakness are current on their polio vaccinations.

WCVB5 in Boston quoted Dr. Joyce Oleszek of Children's Hospital Colorado as saying: "It seems to be attacking the spinal cord and brain stem." Oleszek elaborated that at least 10 children admitted to the hospital between [9 Aug 2014 and 28 Sep 2014] have some form of paralysis. It can range from severe muscle weakness to the ability to use a limb or hand. It does not appear to have the full body paralysis associated with polio. She said the type of paralysis they are seeing at Children's Hospital seems to affect the shoulders, biceps, triceps, and hips.

Some of the children with paralysis symptoms underwent an MRI. The results showed abnormalities in the spinal grey matter. The children's spinal fluid was tested for traces of EV-D68. All tests came back negative. It is unknown whether the paralysis is permanent. Three children in Missouri had similar symptoms. The CDC is investigating whether there is a link between the virus and the symptoms they are seeing.

Experts say that the spread of the virus is controllable. It is important to wash your hands frequently. Sneeze or cough into your elbow, not your hands. Watch your children carefully if they start to develop flu-like symptoms, especially if they have respiratory problems.

[According to the above media reports, there are now cases of paralytic disease reported in children in Colorado (10), Massachusetts (4) and Missouri, in addition to the cases reported in California earlier this year (2014, see Polio-like illness - USA: (CA) enterovirus 68 susp, RFI 20140224.2296126). Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) infection has been identified in a number of these cases, leading to the current theory that these paralytic cases may well be related to infection with EV-D68.

The clinical descriptions mention in most cases a history of a respiratory infection approximately 2 weeks preceding the onset of paralysis and or weakness, and MRI studies of the spinal cords have demonstrated disease in the grey matter, consistent with lesions in the anterior horn cells, similar to what is seen with poliovirus infection. All studies to date have ruled out the possibility that the paralyses are due to infection with poliovirus. While there is increasing circumstantial evidence that EV-D68 may be the etiologic agent, definitive studies demonstrating this have not been done as yet.

As a reminder, poliovirus is a member of the enterovirus family. There has not been a case of poliovirus associated paralysis acquired in the USA since 1979, and the last case of wild poliovirus associated disease diagnosed in the USA was an imported case in 1993 (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt12-polio.html. Other non-polio enteroviruses have been implicated in polio-like illnesses, such as EV-D68 and EV71 (see references below and prior ProMED-mail posts listed below for more information). This moderator is curious as to whether laboratory studies have included stool and throat swabs for virus isolation as well as paired sera (acute and convalescent) for evidence of recent EV-D68. In the case of poliovirus, the highest virus identification came from stool specimens followed by oropharyngeal (throat), and the lowest yield was from blood or spinal fluid.

Since the CDC announced an alert for states to report cases of acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after 1 Aug 2014 and an MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to grey matter (see Polio-like illness - USA (02): (CO) enterovirus 68 susp, alert, RFI 20140927.2809908), it is not surprising to learn of cases in other states as we are now in a "seek and ye shall find" mode of active surveillance. It is curious that the date of active surveillance begins on 1 Aug 2014, so that the initial reported series of cases in California will not be included as part of this current "outbreak."

More information on the demographics and results of investigations in the recently reported cases in Colorado, Missouri and Massachusetts would be greatly appreciated.
