The American Phytopathological Society publishes the journal "Plant
Disease," which is a monthly international journal of applied plant
pathology including original research articles, reports of new diseases and
epidemics, and feature articles on needs, approaches and accomplishments.
Each number usually contains one feature article. However, the December
1997 issue of Plant Disease (Volume 81, Number 12) was a special issue on
emerging plant diseases that included four feature articles, with each
covering a different emerging plant disease problem. The citations, along
with authors and an address and email to contact the first author, are
provided below.
