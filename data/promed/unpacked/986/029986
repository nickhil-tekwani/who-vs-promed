Mass destruction of 205 000 sheep announced: all sheep, even if healthy,
that can be traced to FMD infected locations (e.g., if a flock includes
sheep purchased at Longtown market near Carlisle) are to be destroyed. 550
farms are currently under restriction in the UK.
Devon has been identified as a particular problem area, and MAFF is to
establish veterinary inspections of all farms within 3 km of known infected
premises.

British ministers were drawing up a raft of new measures Thursday to step
up the fight against foot-and-mouth disease, including the pre-emptive
slaughter of animals showing no signs of the disease.
The number of outbreaks in Britain now stands at 234 after a record 26 new
cases were reported Wednesday and 3 more early Thursday.
Downing Street said Wednesday that the cull could affect more than 100 000
sheep which, although showing no signs of foot-and-mouth, could have come
into contact with others carrying the disease.
The National Farmers' Union welcomed the move. Deputy director general Ian
Gardiner said that, while regrettable, "controlling the disease immediately
is far better than waiting for diagnosis."
Brown was also expected to announce measures to ease restrictions in parts
of the country that have so far remained clear of the virus. Other expected
measures include moves to step up the pace of slaughter and disposal of
animals, with the army possibly becoming involved.
Prince Charles is donating 500 000 pounds (720 000 dollars, 790 000 euros)
to 6 charities to help ease the plight of farmers. In a statement, he said
the "dreadful outbreak" was imposing "severe stress and anxiety" on the
farming community. The announcement of a specific sum to help the farming
industry is a break with royal protocol, even though the Prince's charities
hand out money to good causes every year.
