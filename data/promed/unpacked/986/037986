Queensland Health has confirmed that 10 of the 11 people exposed to
Hendra virus [infection] on the Sunshine Coast have shown no sign of
the disease in initial testing. Authorities are still waiting to test
the 11th person, who is interstate.

A week ago, a horse with the virus was put down on a property at
Tewantin on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. The property owner noticed
the horse's condition on Monday [24 May 2010] morning, and a vet,
wearing protective equipment due to his suspicion of Hendra virus,
examined the horse. The natural host for Hendra virus in Australia is
the flying fox, but it is not clear how horses become infected.

Queensland Health says the group will need to be re-tested over the
next 5 weeks. To date, 4 people have died out of 7 who contracted the
virus in Queensland, including vet Dr Ben Cunneen, 33, who died in
August 2008 while working at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic, east of
Brisbane. Another outbreak at a Cawarral property near Rockhampton in
central Queensland in August last year [2009] also killed 4 horses
and claimed the life of vet Dr Alister Rodgers.

The Queensland government says a Hendra virus vaccine for horses
could be 5 years away. Primary Industries Minister Tim Mulherin says
federal and state governments will each contribute USD 300 000
towards the development of the vaccine. "We've also done a hell of a
lot of work, particularly in community engagement, raising awareness,
because a vaccine will be 5 years away," he said. "We want to make
sure that people are aware of this issue so education is part of the process."

CSIRO spokesman Dr Martyn Jeggo says the Hendra virus is unlikely to
mutate, so a vaccine would remain effective. "So we think that if we
can produce a vaccine for this, it will be one that will be stable
over quite a number of years."

[Some background information about Hendra virus from the ABC Factbox
(<http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/11/2652404.htm>):

"Hendra virus (genus _Henipavirus_, family _Paramyxoviridae_) affects
horses and humans and is potentially deadly for infected people.
Hendra virus 1st emerged in Australia in August and September 1994
when 13 horses died in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra (hence the
name), and 2 horses died in an apparently unrelated outbreak in
Mackay. In Hendra, the horse Drama Series became the 1st recorded
death from the virus, and 2 people became infected after contact with
the mare. One of them, prominent horse trainer Vic Rail, died as a
result. In October 1995, a Mackay farmer, Mark Preston, 35, became
the 3rd person to be infected with the virus, and he also died as a
result. It was only after Mr Preston's infection and death that
authorities discovered the initial August 1994 infection of 2 of his
horses and made a retrospective diagnosis.

Since 1994, there have been 13 outbreaks of the disease; 6 people
have become infected, and 4 people have died.

The mortality rate for horses is extremely high, with 70 per cent of
infected animals dying from the virus. Hendra virus is commonly
spread by fruit bats. They are the natural carriers of the virus, and
they are thought to spread the virus through their urine, faeces or
reproductive fluid. It is believed that Hendra virus is not highly
contagious in people, but because all 6 cases of human infection have
been in people who have close contact with infected horses, there are
strict quarantine guidelines.

There is no evidence of human-to-human spread or human-to-horse
spread of the disease. The incubation period in humans is estimated
at 5-14 days. The virus commonly affects the respiratory system, and
symptoms can often resemble influenza and pneumonia.

The virus may affect the brain as well with encephalitis type
symptoms, such as headaches, high fever and drowsiness, which can
lead to convulsions or coma."

Ten of the 11 people considered likely to have been exposed to Hendra
virus in the current outbreak have tested negative in initial tests.
The result of the test for the 11th person will not be reported
separately unless it proves to be positive.
