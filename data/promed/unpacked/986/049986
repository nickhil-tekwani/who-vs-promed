To date there have been more than 6,500 clinically presenting cases of
Dengue Fever. Some of these cases have shown signs of Dengue Haemorrhagic
Fever (DHF), a more serious form of the disease. There have been eight
deaths due to suspected DHF to date, all reported from CWM hospital in
Suva. The most recent death occurred in an eight year old boy on Monday, 26
January at the CWM Hospital after he had been admitted for four days. This
brings the death toll to eight. There have been two additional deaths
suspected as being dengue, but they are not yet unconfirmed.
Viti Levu is currently in the midst of a massive and serious Dengue Fever
epidemic. CWM Hospital Medical Superintendent Mary Schramm reports that CWM
has treated over 3,000 patients with suspected Dengue Fever. Hospital
records show that 2,323 cases were seen between the 13th and 27th of
January, with 162 admissions in the same period. Accurate outpatient data
prior to the 13th January was unavailable at the time of this release, but
there could have been at least 1,000 clinical cases seen prior to that date
at CWM. This would indicate that at least 5,000 cases have been seen in the
Central and Eastern Divisions since the outbreak began (roughly 6% of the
population has been affected).
Dr. S. Veitogavi, Divisional Medical Officer Central / Eastern reports that
in the rest of Central Division the following cases have been seen to date:
No. dengue cases
Facility to date (clinical) Admitted
CWM 2,323* 260

Rotuma 2 no report
Total 3,969 at least 260
* Includes only outpatients seen since 13 January. Actual number is higher.
** No facilities for admitting patients.

Dr. Veitogavi warned that school children were the latest victims of the
dengue epidemic, with increasing numbers seen in area health centres since
schools re-opened. Health inspectors found that many of the schools in the
Division had not implemented clean-up measures, and mosquito larvae were
found. He urged schools not to waste any more time in implementing clean-up
measures, fearing the trend in infected school children would continue to
increase.
In the past week (19 to 27 January), at least 569 clinically diagnosed
cases were reported by Divisional Medical Officer Western, Dr. Yogen
Narayan. All six medical subdivisions are currently affected - Nadi,
Lautoka, Ba, Rakiraki, Tavua and Sigatoka. There were 290 cases seen during
the previous week (12 to 18 January) making 859 cases seen in the past two
weeks. To date, there have been at least 1,500 cases seen in the Western
Division.
In the Northern Division, there have been at least 35 clinical cases of
dengue reported from Labasa Hospital to date, and 25 of those have been
admitted. In addition, there have been at least two suspected cases seen at
Nabouwalu Hospital.
Large scale clean-up efforts continue despite heavy rains affecting much of
the country, particularly in affected areas. There have been reports of
rising diarrhoea cases in children as well from around the country, with at
least two deaths reported in children - an eight year old boy and a nine
month old baby.
