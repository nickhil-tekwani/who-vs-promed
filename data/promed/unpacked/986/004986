A yellow fever vaccination campaign targeting to reach 700 000 people in certain regions of Ethiopia has achieved 93% of its target amid the COVID-19 outbreak's challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Monday [11 Jan 2021].

The vaccination campaign was conducted last November [2020] in the country's Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR) and Oromia region.

It aimed to put an end to the spread of a yellow fever outbreak that was first reported in Enor-Ener Woreda in the Gurage Zone of the SNNPR "by vaccinating eligible age groups in 12 woredas (districts), one of them in Oromia," said the WHO statement.

Regarding the beginning of the campaign, the WHO said it was first conducted in March 2020 in 17 kebeles, or sub-districts, of Enor-Ener, bringing the outbreak rapidly under control.

"As we all work together to respond to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO works with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and regional health bureaus to support the continuation of essential health services like immunization and strengthen the response to other health emergencies such as this yellow fever outbreak," the report quoted WHO Representative Dr Boureima Hama Sambo as saying.

"We must address all health issues and emergencies to protect the health of the Ethiopian people," Sambo added.

"The Ministry of Health's Ethiopian Public Health Institute collaborated with the WHO and other immunization partners to launch the campaign in the 12 high-risk woredas in the 2 regions targeting populations aged 6 months to 50 years," said the WHO.

A total of 86 cases and 4 deaths were reported in this outbreak, it added.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease that causes symptoms including chills, fever, nausea, loss of appetite and muscle pain, especially in the back, and headaches.

[The number of confirmed yellow fever (YF) cases in the last report was 4. The report above indicates that there are 86 cases with 4 deaths in this outbreak. Yellow fever (YF) cases have occurred in several localities. The rainy season has begun, so occurrence of additional cases can be expected given the low proportion of the population that has been vaccinated. The ambitious YF vaccination campaign is timely.

This situation illustrates the need to maintain yellow fever routine vaccination coverage at 80% or above to prevent outbreaks as happened in Angola. This is not easy to do since YF cases are sporadic, and cases often are separated by a lapse of several years. The cost of maintaining ample coverage is less than the emergency expenses of dealing with an outbreak. - Mod.TY

The World Health Organisation (WHO) will change its policy to recommend using partial doses of the yellow fever vaccine in times of shortages during an outbreak -- thanks to results of a recent study led by the Doctors Without Borders [Medecins Sans Frontieres, MSF] Epicentre in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, Institut Pasteur de Dakar, and the WHO itself.

Most cases of yellow fever -- a mosquito-borne acute viral hemorrhagic fever that causes 30 000 deaths per year, occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The disease as of yet has no cure. Hence, prevention is essential -- especially as predicting outbreaks is difficult and vaccine production takes up to 12 months to complete.

[Doses reduced to 1/5 the usual volume were employed successfully during the large yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Angola and DR Congo in 2015-2016 when there was not a sufficient amount of vaccine available to vaccinate several million individuals at risk of YF infection with the full dose.

The current WHO decision to recommend reduced doses in situations of inadequate stocks of the vaccine available to permit full doses in the face of an outbreak was likely influenced by the success of the use of reduced volume application during the Angola-DR Congo outbreak. - Mod.TY
