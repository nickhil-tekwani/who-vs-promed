While on vacation, a teenager traveled to the forest to earn a living as a worker. All went well until he began to feel ill, could not bear it and returned to Ayacucho city. His health continued without improvement and so he was taken to the hospital where he was admitted in serious condition in the intensive care unit. After an intensive fight for life that lasted for 5 days, he died as a result of yellow fever [YF]

According to family members, the student had good health at the start of the year [2017] in Mozobamba Alta, located in Santa Rosa [district] (La Mar [province]) and later after a few weeks returned in very bad health and so was immediately taken to the health facility.

When he was taken to the Ayacucho Regional Hospital this past [Fri 24 Feb 2017], the physicians who examined him saw him to be in serious condition. He remained so until this past [Wed 1 Mar 2017] and at 7:20 of the evening he passed away.

Laboratory tests discarded dengue illness, but in any event the [sample for] tests were taken to Lika city for a more detailed study.

According to the [YF] diagnosis, the disease caused severe damage to his liver that caused multi organ failure.

It is worth noting that this is the 1st fatal case so far in 2017 caused by yellow fever.

[It is unfortunate that this young man was not vaccinated against yellow fever before venturing into the forest. The Amazon Basin, including the part pertaining to Peru, is endemic for yellow fever (YF) virus, where it is maintained in the sylvan (forest or jungle) cycle. Sporadic human YF cases occur here. In 2015 Peru reported 21 cases of human sylvan yellow fever in 7 regions. Apparently no mention is made of the deaths of YF virus infected monkeys in the forest, which is often the indicator of circulation of the virus in the area. Sylvan human cases bring the risk of subsequent spill over into urban and suburban human populations when infected individuals bring the virus into areas where the urban cycle vector, _Aedes aegypti_ occurs, and when these populations are not vaccinated.
