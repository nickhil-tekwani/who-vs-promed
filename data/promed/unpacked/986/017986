The United Nations (UN) gave 400 000 euros (USD 600 000) in aid to
the tiny west African nation of Guinea Bissau to fight a cholera
epidemic that has claimed 40 lives to date, the UN said Saturday [16
Aug 2008].

"The funds complement contributions by all the local UN agencies," in
response to an urgent June [2008] appeal by the government, the UN
said in a statement. The money will partly be used to help train
health agents and for a public awareness campaign via the media.

Some 1900 cases of cholera have been registered over the last 2
months, a medical official said, with the capital city [Bissau] hardest hit by
the epidemic. Strong rains have "facilitated the rapid spread of the
disease," said Agostinho Pedro Semedo, director of Bissau's central
hospital.

A cholera outbreak in Benin since July 2008 has killed at least one
person, with 90 others infected by the disease, said reports reaching
Lome [Togo] Monday [11 Aug 2008].

Cholera outbreaks are a regular occurrence in the Beninese economic
capital Cotonou and its surrounding areas due to flooding during the
rainy reason, say experts.

[4] Cholera - India (Delhi)

Delhi has reported 450 cases of cholera in 2008, the civic
authorities said [Mon 25 Aug 2008] and felt that the situation may
worsen in the wake of the recent floods in Yamuna.

"Cholera has been a constant problem in the city. We have so far
reported over 450 cases," said VK Monga, head of the health committee
of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).

"As the water in the Yamuna river has receded, people living along
the river bank, especially the slum dwellers, need to be extra
careful. They need to be careful about their water intake to prevent
the spread of cholera and other gastroenterological problems. The
stagnant water would also assist in spread of dengue," he added.

Monga said MCD has already launched a campaign to spread awareness
about cholera across the city.
