Imported Cases of Poliomyelitis in Bulgaria
-------------------------------------------
COPENHAGEN: The first 2 cases of polio in Europe since 1998 have been
diagnosed in Bulgaria, the World Health Organization and Bulgarian
officials said on Thu 17 May 2001. Bulgarian health authorities determined
that a baby, a Gypsy in the Black Sea city of Burgas, had [acquired the
virus in April 2001. Other children in the community of Gypsies, also known
as Roma, were immediately vaccinated. "Good surveillance by local
authorities has allowed for rapid response to this case," said a WHO
official, Dr. Steven Wassilak. However, on 15 May 2001, the same virus was
identified in a 2-year-old Gypsy child in the city of Yambol, 60 miles west
of Burgas, health Bulgarian officials reported. The conditions of the
ailing children were not disclosed.
Laboratories in Paris, Rome, and Atlanta studied the virus and traced it to
northern India, according to a statement from WHO's European region
headquarters in the Danish capital. "The fact that the virus was imported
from India shows just how important worldwide vaccination campaigns are,"
WHO spokesman George Oblapenko said. "Without constant vigilance, Europe's
polio-free status and the global eradication efforts would both be in danger."
Poliovirus was last identified in Europe in November 1998, when it was
found in a Turkish province along the Iranian border. Poliomyelitis has
been wiped out in 155 nations, including all of North and South America,
China, and Australia. But even children in polio-free countries must be
vaccinated because infected travelers can easily spread the disease.

[The occurrence of wild poliovirus circulation in Bulgaria is a setback for
the European region that was on track for certification of poliomyelitis
eradication. A region is certified as polio free when there has been no
circulation of wild poliovirus in the region for 3 years. The occurrence of
2 cases geographically separated, albeit among the same ethnic group that
may have social interactions, suggests circulation of the wild poliovirus
in the communities. In recent years, the majority of poliovirus isolates
can be traced to India and the subcontinent. This article does not mention
which serotype of poliovirus is involved. There are 3 serotypes, numbers 1,
2, and 3. Northern India had been the last remaining area in the world with
circulation of wild poliovirus type 2 until circulation was interrupted in
1999 (see:
