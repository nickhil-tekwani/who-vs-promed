Vermont health officials are warning clinicians to be on the lookout for signs of _E. coli_, after at least 5 Vermont residents contracted infections caused by the potentially foodborne bacteria. The locations of the 5 laboratory-confirmed cases, and a 6th case listed as "probable", were not divulged by the Vermont Department of Health, which asked doctors to report instances of patients with diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, and vomiting to state health officials immediately.

"Additional confirmed cases are possible," according to a Wed 23 Sep 2015, email from department spokesman Ben Truman. Mike Barwell, a spokesman for Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center [DHMC], said the hospital has seen only one case in recent weeks. "We had one patient who was discharged on [14 Sep 2015] in Vermont," he said. "We have no current patients," Barwell said staff at the hospital had not yet seen the state health alert, and that he was unsure whether the DHMC case was considered part of the current outbreak.

According to the CDC, most forms of _E. coli_ are a normal and healthy part of the human intestine, but some strains produce toxins that can cause infections. The current cluster of cases was caused by one of several strains known as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [also referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli or EHEC]. Most of those infections subside on their own within 5 to 7 days, but an estimated 5 to 10 percent of those who are infected can become seriously ill, with some developing a potentially life-threatening kidney disorder called hemolytic uremic syndrome. Very young children and the elderly are more likely to develop serious illness as a result of the pathogen, but older children and young adults can also become seriously ill, the CDC said.

While the health alert was directed specifically at clinicians, the state department website includes information on how to prevent the spread of _E. coli_, which is generally transmitted when a person eats or drinks something that could be contaminated by the fecal matter of cattle. Undercooked meat, particularly ground beef, fruits, vegetables, unpasteurized fruit juice or milk, and sewage contaminated water are all possible vectors for the disease. The infection can also be spread from one person to another.

Outbreaks of _E. coli_ in the state are rare; the last time the Vermont Department of Health issued an alert involving _E. coli_ was a 2011 warning related to travelers coming back to the USA from Germany, which saw a massive outbreak that caused 470 hemolytic uremic syndrome cases and 9 deaths. [This outbreak was due to a unique chimeric strain containing genetic information from an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and from an enteroaggregative _E. coli_, E. coli O104:H7.] The most recent _E. coli_ alert in Vermont before that was in 2008. The CDC estimates that, nationally, 265 000 Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ infections occur each year.
