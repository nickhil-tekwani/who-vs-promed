Coronavirus as a Possible Cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By: J S M Peiris, S T Lai, L L M Poon, Y Guan, L Y C Yam, W Lim, J
Nicholls, W K S Yee, W W Yan, M T Cheung, V C C Cheng, K H Chan, D N C
Tsang, R W H Yung, T K Ng, K Y Yuen, and members of the SARS study group.
Background: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has
been reported in Hong Kong. We investigated the viral cause and clinical
presentation among 50 patients.
Methods: We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50
patients with SARS, representing more than 5 separate epidemiologically
linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk
factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents
by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and
sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for
microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose
identity was masked.
Results: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia,
and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest
radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were
disproportionately mild. Patients who were household contacts of other
infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were
associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family
_Coronaviridae_ was isolated from 2 patients. By use of serological and
reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with
SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.
Interpretation: A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that
might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and
molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory
diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether
other cofactors play a part in disease progression.

Commentary: Novel Coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
--------------------------------------------------
"The terror of the unknown is seldom better displayed than by the response
of a population to the appearance of an epidemic, particularly when the
epidemic strikes without apparent cause." This quote from 1977 by Edward
Kass (1), describing the fears surrounding the newly recognised
legionnaires' disease, aptly describes the public response to the recent
appearance of an unexplained atypical pneumonia referred to as severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Joseph Peiris and colleagues provide strong evidence that SARS is
associated with a novel coronavirus that has not been previously identified
in human beings or animals, and begin the process of eliminating the many
unknowns from this new syndrome. The investigators used classic viral
culture and serological techniques, as well as modern molecular genetic
methods, to characterise and to determine the cause of the disease in 50
patients with SARS in Hong Kong. One of the strengths of their report, and
an important means of establishing causality, is their analysis of
specimens from control patients. None of 40 respiratory secretions from
patients with other respiratory diseases contained coronavirus RNA, and
none of 200 serum samples from blood donors had serum antibody to this new
coronavirus. These findings significantly strengthen the tentative
aetiological association reported by other investigators from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) in Atlanta and from Toronto, who
have also isolated a novel coronavirus from patients with SARS (2,3). As
other pathogens, such as _Human metapneumovirus_ and _Chlamydia spp_, are
identified in SARS patients, it will be important to use control groups to
determine the role of these other agents in causality or as cofactors for
severe disease (2,4).
The clinical features associated with SARS are rapidly becoming available
through Peiris and other reports (2,5). The Hong Kong investigators
identified 5 clusters of patients by using a modified WHO case definition
for SARS, and describe the clinical manifestations of this serious disease.
It is notable that nearly 40 percent of the patients developed respiratory
failure that required assisted ventilation. Clinical descriptions will be
important in modifying the case definition of this syndrome should it
spread -- as is likely -- beyond the tightly linked clusters that have
characterised the epidemiology of SARS thus far. Unfortunately, the early
clinical appearance may not allow ready distinction from other common
winter-time respiratory viral infections (6,7). However, certain
characteristics of SARS are noteworthy. The constellation of absence of
upper respiratory symptoms, the presence of dry cough, and minimal
auscultatory findings with consolidation on chest radiographs may alert the
clinician to the possible diagnosis of SARS. The presence of lymphopenia,
leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes and creatinine
kinase may also raise suspicion.
Clinical diagnosis will become particularly problematic once the
association with travel or case contact is lost. Thus, rapid and accurate
diagnostic tools will be critical in the management of this epidemic. Given
the experience with other respiratory viruses, it is likely that culture
and direct antigen-detection from respiratory secretions will not suffice
in view of the lethality and contagious nature of this new agent. Rapid
diagnosis of SARS, which is important for infection-control measures and
potential treatment,will require very sensitive and specific methods. Real
time RT-PCR, currently in use for other respiratory viruses primarily in
research settings, may be required as a routine test in clinical diagnostic
microbiological laboratories (8,9).
Peiris and colleagues suggest that early therapy with intravenous ribavirin
and high-dose glucocorticosteroids may be beneficial. However, the lack of
untreated control patients precludes a firm conclusion about benefit.
Clinicians often find it difficult to withhold potentially beneficial, yet
unproven, therapy in life-threatening situations. Controlled studies may be
difficult to do, and there are obviously no historical controls for the
treatment of SARS. Therefore it will be important for treating physicians
to carefully document the dose, timing, and types of therapies used, and
the clinical and viral status of patients, so that experiences can be
pooled and information productively analysed.
It is truly remarkable and unprecedented that the progress reported by
Peiris and colleagues, and elsewhere, on the aetiology and clinical and
epidemiological characteristics of SARS has been achieved in less than 2
months. It is fortuitous that this outbreak occurred at a time when viral
surveillance systems headed by WHO in collaboration with CDCP are in place
throughout the world. The work of individual laboratories, such as the ones
in Hong Kong, Toronto, and CDCP, and cooperation between health authorities
in many countries provides protection from the inevitable threat of new
epidemic diseases.

SARS: As of Tue 8 Apr 2003 - Status of currently available diagnostic tests
--------------------------------------------------
SARS diagnosis is still being made on clinical grounds and exposure only
(Case Definitions for Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -
SARS). However, several countries and areas (Canada, France, Germany, Hong
Kong SAR, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States
of America) are beginning to routinely conduct laboratory testing of SARS
suspect and probable cases. Tests are still being developed and improved,
but using them now helps to understand how SARS and human coronavirus are
connected.
Status of currently available diagnostic tests
Antibody tests:
(1) ELISA (IGM/IGA) detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients
reliably as from about day 20 after onset of clinical signs. Antibodies
already are detected in some patients between 14-21 days;
(2) Immunofluorescence Assays (detecting Immunoglobulin M) in SARS
virus-infected VERO cells detects antibodies in serum after about day 10 of
onset of disease. This is a reliable but demanding test requiring amongst
others, use of live virus in cell culture and an immunofluorescence microscope.
Molecular tests:
(1) PCR can detect genetic material of coronavirus in various specimens
(blood, stool, or respiratory secretions). For this test, several primers
have been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
United States of America, Federal Laboratories for Health Canada, Hong Kong
University, and the Governmental Viral Unit of Hong Kong, and they have
been shared on the WHO web site. Some laboratories in the WHO multi-centre
collaborative network on SARS are currently comparing these tests and first
results are will be forthcoming shortly.
Cell culture: Virus in specimens (respiratory secretions, blood) from SARS
patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures such as VERO cells.
Interpretation of positive test results: Indicate that SARS patients are,
or recently were, infected with the coronavirus. A negative coronavirus
test does not mean that the patient does not have SARS.
Interpretation of negative test results: SARS is diagnosed not on the basis
of laboratory tests but on clinical evaluation and possible past exposures.
Reasons for negative test results in a patient with SARS may be: (1) Tests
are incorrect ("false-negative"). Current tests need to be further
developed to improve sensitivity. (2) Patient is not infected with the new
coronavirus. The cause of infection could be another pathogen (virus,
bacteria, etc.) causing respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia.(3) Specimens
were not collected at a time when virus or its genetic material was
excreted. Excretions may be for a brief period only, depending on the type
of specimen tested.
