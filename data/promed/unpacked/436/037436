Influenza update 146
------------------
Summary
- The influenza season is largely finished in the temperate countries of the northern hemisphere and most countries in the northern temperate zone have stopped weekly reporting or moved over to out of season surveillance schedules.
- In the tropical zone, the countries to report notable influenza activity are Bolivia, Brazil, and Honduras in the Americas; Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa; southern China, including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Viet Nam in Asia.
- The influenza season has commenced in most temperate countries of the southern hemisphere. In Argentina, however, influenza remains nearly undetectable.
- Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the most commonly reported type/sub-type in recent weeks in the Southern Hemisphere temperate region in Chile, South Africa, and Australia; however, significant numbers of influenza type B were also reported in South Africa and to a lesser extent, Australia. Very few influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been reported with exception of Paraguay and some countries in Central and tropical South America.

[2] WHO Global Influenza Surveillance & Response System update 20 Jul 2012

Influenza virus activity in the world
-----------------------------
Based on FluNet reporting (as of 17 July 2012, 11:45 UTC), during weeks 26 to 27 (24 June 2012 to 7 July 2012), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 67 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 16 337 specimens. 2265 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1 895 (83.7 percent) were typed as influenza A and 370 (16.3 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 142 (8.3 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1571 (91.7 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 45 (83.3 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 9 (16.7 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Summary
-----
- During weeks 26 and 27, influenza activity continued to increase in the southern hemisphere with varying levels of activity reported. Globally, influenza A(H3N2) viruses remain the predominant virus followed by influenza B and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

- In New Zealand influenza activity increased above the expected baseline level. A(H3N2) remained the predominant circulating virus in Australia and New Zealand.

- In the southern and central African region, some countries reported increased co-circulation of Influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses, except Ethiopia where A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated.

- In Central and South America, increased activity of influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses was reported in Ecuador, while Chile and Paraguay experienced continued activity of A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 respectively. Influenza B viruses were predominant in Cuba, Panama and Peru.

- In Asia, previously reported unusual levels of influenza A(H3N2) activity in China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region started declining.

- In the northern hemisphere sporadic detection of influenza viruses continued to be reported.

[3]ECDC Surveillance Weeks 2-15 July 2012

Main surveillance developments in weeks 27-28, 2012 (2-15 Jul 2012)
----------------------------------------------------------
The 2011/12 influenza season has ended but influenza surveillance will continue during the off-season period; until week 40/2012, the bulletin appears on a fortnightly basis.

- During weeks 27-28/2012, all reporting countries stated they were experiencing no activity or only sporadic activity of influenza-like illness.

- During the same period, only two of 33 sentinel specimens tested were positive. Both were type B influenza viruses. Since week 40/2011, 89.3 percent of the detected influenza viruses have been type A and 10.7 percent were of type B. The A(H3) subtype represented 97.2 percent of influenza A type viruses subtyped during the 2011/12 season.

- Many of the A(H3) viruses reacted poorly with post-infection ferret antisera raised against the A/Perth/16/2009 H3N2 vaccine component, prompting the WHO's decision to recommend a change to the A(H3N2) component for the 2012/13 influenza season (northern hemisphere). The need for change is consistent with an observed low field vaccine effectiveness for the A(H3N2) component in observational studies.

Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI)/acute respiratory infection (ARI):
----------------------------
During weeks 27-28/2012, all reporting countries experienced low-intensity influenza activity and decreasing or stable trends; except Slovakia, which reported an increasing trend for week 28/2012.

Virological surveillance:
-------------------
Of 33 sentinel specimens, 2 were positive for type B influenza virus.

[Significant features of the current situation are the virtual eclipse of the A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the southern hemisphere winter outbreak and the predominance of influenza A/(H3N2) virus and influenza B virus. The alteration of the composition of the vaccine for use in the northern hemishere may compensate for this change in influenza epidemiology. Respiratory syncytial virus infection in children remains a greater concern than influenza in some southern hemisphere countries. - Mod.CP]
