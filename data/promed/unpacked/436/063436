Imported human rabies case in Switzerland
-----------------------------------------
Rabies was diagnosed in a US citizen who was transferred to Switzerland on 29 Jul 2012 after a progressive course of neurological disease with unknown etiology in the United Arab Emirates. Clinical symptoms started on 5 Jul 2012. Analgosedation [analgesia and sedation] was applied on 8 Jul 2012, but after release the patient remained in persisting coma. He died on 31 Jul 2012, after therapeutic measures were discontinued with the consent of the family.

The 1st indication for rabies diagnosis was a high titer of rabies antibodies measured by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) on 8 Aug 2012. The diagnosis was confirmed by fluorescence antibody testing (FAT) in brain smears. Phylogenetic analysis of an RT-PCR nucleotide fragment derived from the N region coding sequence of the rabies genome pointed to an unrecognized exposure to a bat in the USA (American bat rabies strain associated with the insectivorous bat _Tadarida brasiliensis_) as the probable source of the infection.

Public health investigation based on the recommendations of WHO and CDC is ongoing. The maximal possible infectious period of the patient before the appearance of the 1st clinical symptoms is estimated at 14 days (21 Jun 2012). The patient stayed in the USA from 14 to 18 Jun 2012. He travelled then to Thailand, went back to Iraq on 5 Jul 2012, and finally to Dubai on 8 Jul 2012. All involved public health authorities and other involved parties have been informed by official ways.

[In the United States bats are probably the principal source of human rabies virus infection. Often victims may be unaware of their exposure due to the nocturnal habits of the vector and the insignificant nature of a bat bite. It is likely that the patient hospitalised in Berne was infected in the southern region of the United States and not in Dubai (UAE) or any of the other countries visited by the victim. Presumably being unaware of the bat bite the victim did not seek post-exposure prophylaxis.

The Mexican free-tail bat (_Tadarida brasiliensis_), also known as the Brazilian free-tail bat, is a midsize bat with a dark brown or a gray colour (an image can be seen at http://www.rw.ttu.edu/sp_accounts/mexican_free-tail_bat/default.htm). The most notable characteristic of the Mexican free-tail bat is that the later part of the tail extends freely beyond the interfemoral membrane, also known as the uropatagium. The uropatagium is the area of the wing membrane between the hind limbs and the tail. In a non free-tail bat the tail would end at the uropatagium. It also has broad ears that do not join in the midline area of the skull. These distinctive traits, as well as others such as vertical wrinkles along the lips, solid color, and bristles on their feet help to identify this species of bat. The average size of the Mexican free-tail is 93 mm (3.7 in) total length; 33 mm (1.3 in) tail length; 8 mm (0.3 in) hind foot; and 16 mm (0.6 in) ear. Females average 12.9 g (0.5 oz) and males weigh an average of 11.7 g (0.4 oz). Their distribution stretches from southern Oregon across the Southwestern United States through the Southeastern US into southern North Carolina. This species can be found south of this line across the United States, including the tip of Florida and all of Central America creating the southern boundaries. - Mod.CP]
