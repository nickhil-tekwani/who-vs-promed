Indonesia polio cases hit 8, one treated in Jakarta
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia has detected 2 new polio cases, bringing the total number of
infected patients in the country's 1st outbreak of the crippling disease in
a decade to 8 children, a senior health official said on Saturday [14 May
2005].
All cases so far come from villages near the West Java city of Sukabumi,
but one of them is now being treated in a Jakarta hospital.
Indonesia is the 16th country previously believed to be polio-free to be
re-infected in the past 2 years.
"Our update today [14 May 2005] is 8 positive cases of polio. The
additional 2 cases come from the same cluster in Sukabumi," said Yusharmen,
director of epidemiology at Indonesia's health ministry.
Asked about the 20-month-old polio patient who is now in Jakarta, Yusharmen
said: "She came from Sukabumi and was brought to Jakarta by her family."
Polio mainly hits children under 5 and can cause irreversible paralysis,
deformation and sometimes death.
The outbreak occurred last month [April 2005] in Girijaya village near
Sukabumi, about 100 km (62 miles) south of Jakarta. Additional confirmed
cases have since emerged in neighboring villages, with several suspected
cases still being investigated.
Around 5000 children in West Java have been vaccinated in recent weeks.
Preparations are under way for a major program to vaccinate 5.2 million
children at the end of the month [May 2005] across the provinces of West
Java, Banten and the city of Jakarta, which, administratively, is a province.
The WHO has said the Indonesian cases are almost identical to a strain
circulating in parts of Africa and that the disease may have reached the
country from Africa via the Middle East.
Health officials said it may have been carried by a migrant worker or a Haj
pilgrim who visited Saudi Arabia before returning to Indonesia, the world's
most populous Muslim nation.

Outbreak of polio in Indonesia - updated 13 May 2005
-----------------------------------------------
On 13 May 2005, 2 additional polio cases were reported in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 8. The new cases are in the same
district as the 1st case. Vaccine has been shipped to the provinces where
supplemental immunization activities are scheduled to take place at the end
of the month [May 2005] in response to this outbreak.
11 May 2005: Confirmed today are 6 additional "positive contact" cases,
from the same village as the index case, bringing the total number of
positive contact cases to 14. All positive contact cases are from the same
village as the index case. A "contact case" is the positive isolation of
wild poliovirus from stool samples collected from a healthy child. During a
polio outbreak, stool samples are frequently collected from healthy
children in and around an affected area. This helps to determine the extent
of the wild poliovirus circulation in the immediate environment.
10 May 2005: 8 positive contact cases were confirmed from the same village
as the index case. The 1st round of the mop-up immunization campaign in
West Java, Banten and Jakarta provinces will be conducted on 31 May-2 Jun
2005. The 2nd campaign will be held on 28 Jun-1 Jul 2005. Both campaigns
will aim to reach all of the provinces' 5.2 million children under the age
of 5 years.
On 5 May 2005, 3 additional polio cases were reported in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 4. 2 of the 3 cases are from the same
village as the index polio case, and the 3rd is from a neighboring village.
The cases are 2 boys and one girl, all previously un-immunized, who had
onset of paralysis on 2, 9 and 10 Apr 2005. An immunization response has
already been conducted around these cases.
On 2 May 2005, the global reference laboratory in Mumbai, India confirmed a
wild poliovirus type 1 isolate, from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case
identified by the national surveillance system in Gin Jaya village,
Sukabumi District, West Java, Indonesia. The case, an 18-month-old child
who was previously un-immunized, had onset of paralysis on 12 Mar 2005.
The findings of the investigation suggest recent introduction of wild
poliovirus, as genetic analysis of the virus demonstrates that its origin
is in west Africa, similar to the viruses which caused the 2003/04
outbreak. Further analysis suggests the virus traveled to Indonesia through
Sudan, and is similar to recently isolated viruses in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

More children tested for polio
-------------------------------
Bogor Health Agency is testing feces and urine [poliovirus is excreted in
feces - Mod.MPP] samples of 5 children believed to have contracted polio
amid the recent outbreak in the country.
Agency head Djono Karjoeki said on Sunday [15 May 2005] that the agency had
previously tested 3 other children, and the results were negative.
Djono said around 101 health centers in the regency were scheduled to carry
out a massive immunization program on March 31 [presumably a typo in the
newswire, and the date should be 31 May 2005. - Mod.MPP]
There have been at least 8 cases of polio as of 14 May [2005], all coming
from villages near the West Java town of Sukabumi. One of them is being
treated in Jakarta.

Indonesia polio outbreak nearly contained: officials
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia has nearly contained its 1st polio outbreak in a decade because
of fast action in vaccinating children in affected areas and a willingness
to seek international help, health officials said on Monday [16 May 2005].
Indonesian officials have detected 8 polio-infected patients since
discovering the 1st case last month [April 2005] about 100 km (62 miles)
south of Jakarta. Several suspected cases are under investigation, and a
mass vaccination is set for 31 May [2005].
All the infected children live close to the 1st case in Girijaya village
near the West Java city of Sukabumi, although one patient suffering from
the virus was brought to a Jakarta hospital by relatives who were oblivious
to the outbreak.
"We acted quickly," said Muhammad Nadirin, head of epidemiology
surveillance at the health ministry. "In less than 72 hours after the 1st
case, we conducted an outbreak response immunization in 15 villages around
the original location."
He said 12 800 children under the age of 5 in the area have been immunized
against the disease, which can cause irreversible paralysis, deformation
and sometimes death.
Indonesia's response contrasts with an explosion of cases in Yemen, another
country beset by a revival of polio. The World Health Organization (WHO)
says Yemen's outbreak could cripple more than 100 children before it is
brought under control.
The twin outbreaks in Indonesia and Yemen raised fears that the virus was
spreading from Africa and the Middle East to Asia and dealt a setback to a
WHO campaign to stop global transmission of polio by year-end [2005].
Indonesia plans to vaccinate about 5.2 million children on 31 May [2005]
across the provinces of West Java, Banten and the city of Jakarta, which,
administratively, is an individual province. On 28 Jun [2005], the same
children get a 2nd round of vaccinations.
"There are only small pockets that have not received immunization, mostly
in remote areas where they lack information," Nadirin told Reuters.
Another key factor is Indonesia's years of experience which have left more
than 80 percent of its children already immunized. Support from
international agencies, especially the U.N.'s World Health Organization and
UNICEF, was also crucial.
"No hesitation"
John Budd of the UN children agency told Reuters that Indonesia was quick
in setting up a reporting mechanism for cases of paralysis, which enabled
them to target other areas at risk.
"There was no hesitation. It was a very aggressive approach," he said.
"Nothing more could be done. You can't do any more than they have announced
very early on what they are going to do."
Asked about the patient moved to the capital, Nadirin said her parents had
the right to find medical care where they could but that future suspected
cases should be referred to hospitals in the Sukabumi area.
Indonesia is the 16th country previously believed to be polio-free to be
re-infected in the past 2 years.
The top WHO representative in Indonesia, Georg Petersen, said Jakarta had
plenty of experience with polio vaccination programs and that officials
"have done exactly what they are supposed to do."
The WHO has said the Indonesian cases are almost identical to a strain
circulating in parts of Africa and that the disease may have reached the
country from Africa via the Middle East.
Health officials said it may have been carried by a migrant worker or a Haj
pilgrim who visited Saudi Arabia before returning to Indonesia, the world's
most populous Muslim nation.

[The number of confirmed cases of paralytic polio are increasing in this
current outbreak, not surprising as there were pending suspected cases at
the time of the 1st announcement (see prior ProMED-mail postings). The
additional information on the identification of 14 "positive contact cases"
is also not surprising, as this is an area where immunization coverage with
polio vaccine was identified to be low, and therefore, there was a
significant susceptible population. As discussed in earlier postings on
polio, the range of paralytic to non-paralytic infections observed during
outbreaks has been between one in 50 to one in 1000, with an average cited
as one in 200 (for each case of paralytic polio, there are between 50 and
1000, with an average of 200, others infected with poliovirus, but, who do
not develop paralytic disease). Hence, one would expect to find "positive
contact cases" in the general area as an indication of current circulation
of the wild poliovirus. As to whether there has been further circulation of
the wild poliovirus to other geographic areas on Java or other islands in
the Indonesian archipelago, only time and good surveillance for AFP will
tell. - Mod.MPP]
