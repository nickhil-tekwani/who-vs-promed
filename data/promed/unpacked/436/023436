LEISMANIASIS, IMPORTATION RISK - USA

The CDC currently rates the U.S. disease risk of Leishmaniasis as
relatively remote. However, increased human traffic between Western
nations and Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle East, concurrent
globalization that includes increased domestic animal travel, and a vector
that presents problematic isolation and control make me wonder whether
greater educational, precautionary, prevention, and potential response
efforts should be encouraged.

[ProMED-mail reported on Leishmania in dogs in the US in 2000 and
2001. One posting by Charles Calisher said that the vector is in the US;
the vector for the infections referred to above was never resolved.
If the capacity is there and the climate favors transmission, there is the
risk of infection being brought into the country, not only by dogs but also
by exotic rodents kept as pets. - Mod.EP]

Though there are several genera of phlebotomine sandflies, some such as
_Sergentomyia_ feed not on mammals but on reptiles and are not vectors of
infections to humans. Medically the 2 most important genera are
_Phlebotomus_ and _Lutzomyia_; species in the 1st genus are restricted to
the Old World, and _Lutzomyia_ species occur in the Americas. Both are
vectors of several infections to humans, the most important being
leishmaniasis.
There are about 14 species of _Lutzomyia_ in the USA, biting man and other
mammals. Cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission has been recorded in
south-central Texas, although rarely. The parasite involved is _Leishmania
mexicana_, which is common in Central America, and the sandfly considered
to transmit the infection to man is _Lutzomyia diabolica_. The transmission
cycle involves rodents, especially woodrats (_Neotoma micropus_), and the
vector in this instance is possibly _L. anthophora_. I might add that in
southern Texas, seropositive coyotes have been found, and there has been a
report of an infected domestic cat.
As leishmaniasis is common from Mexico down through much of South America,
it is not surprising that it is occasionally reported in Texas. In
contrast, I would guess the chances of transmission of leishmaniasis from
people (or pets) infected in Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Middle East
entering the USA are minimal, although obviously health authorities should
be aware of the possibility of transmission and human cases so that rapid
diagnosis and treatment can be made.
An account of the sandflies of North America is given by D.G. Young & P.V.
Perkins (1984) _Mosquito News_, 44, 263-304.
Good accounts of the leishmaniases and their vectors are given by
1) L.C. Rutledge & R.K. Gupta (2002) in the book, Medical and Veterinary
Entomology edited by Gary Mullen & Lance Durden, Academic Press, New York.
2) R.W. Ashford (2001) in the book, The Encyclopedia of
Arthropod-transmitted Infections of Man and Domesticated Animals, edited by
Mike W. Service, CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK.
3) D.H. Molyneux & R.W. Ashford (1983)in their book, The Biology of
_Trypanosoma_ and _Leishmania_, Parasites of Man and Domestic Animals,
Taylor and Francis, London.

[As stated in previous ProMED-mail postings, Canine visceral leishmaniasis
has been confirmed in 21 states. The discovery was made by scientists at
North Carolina State University (NCSU) College of Veterinary Medicine, the
National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Walter Reed
Army Institute.
The disease is very hard to diagnose, and until researchers determine how
leishmaniasis is transmitted in the United States, the threat to human
health is not known.
There are vectors for leismaniasis in the United States. International
travel and shipping, especially to the Middle East, may result in other
vectors being brought in. As Mod.EP pointed out, the origin of the canine
infections was never determined, and we know the disease is documented in
21 states, not all of them in the south. - Mod.TG]
