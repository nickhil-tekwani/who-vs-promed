Farmers have called for urgent monitoring amid reports the parasitic disease toxoplasmosis is on the increase in native animals and stock. New Tasmanian research shows animals living in areas with high cat numbers are 5 times more likely to have the toxoplasma parasite.

It also reported evidence of feral cat spikes in areas where devils had been wiped out by facial tumour disease.

"There is a real issue around toxoplasmosis that needs to be dealt with, as well as other animal diseases like tularemia (from possums)," Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association chief executive Jan Davis said.

"We feel this has been put in the too-hard basket but these diseases, as well as a concern on farms, are a risk for humans, too. We want the Government to invest in research and monitoring."

Toxoplasmosis aborts unborn lambs, in particular, and can kill and in humans can affect unborn babies. There have been reports of wallabies and bandicoots dazed and blind. It is fatal to the vulnerable eastern barred bandicoot which can be run over or eaten because they lose sight.

A paper presented in New Zealand last month [December 2011] states: "Evidence is emerging of feral cat increases in many areas of Tasmania, which may be a consequence of declining devil densities.

"The highest toxoplasmosis seroprevalance (positive test) in pademelons occurred in areas where cat density was the highest, being almost 5 times higher than in regions with the lowest cat densities."

The research was conducted by Tracey Hollings and Menna Jones, of the University of Tasmania, Hamish McCallum, of Griffith University, and Nick Mooney from the Department of Primary Industries.

The highest numbers of positive tests were in eastern quolls. Last year [2011], Tamar Natural Resource Management trapped dozens of feral cats that were all infected.

In September 2011, Tasmanian Country reported on farmers concerned about a drop in wallaby numbers. Reports of diseased wallabies were made from Bothwell to the Tasman Peninsula.

A Bothwell farmer said "they went blind and just pined away ... you could walk up to them and they were just sitting up looking at the sky."

The Department of Primary Industries said illness was often triggered when animals were stressed from hunger, age or the weather.

Monitoring from 2005 to 2008 showed a big decline in pademelons in the south, although drops in native species were expected because of drought. Surveys were continuing but the department said there had been no reported increase in animal deaths.

Landholders and others can report unusual symptoms or disease in wildlife to 6233 6556 or notifiable diseases to 1800 675 888.

Toxoplasmosis in an infection with the parasite _Toxoplasma gondii_. Cats are the definitive host of this parasite. This disease is known worldwide and affects a variety of animals and birds as well as humans.

In humans the infection may be acquired through organ transplants, or blood transfusion. Because the organism can be passed through the placenta to the fetus, pregnant women are continually cautioned about handling cat litter and cat feces. Congenital toxoplasmosis is possible when the organism passes through the placenta. The disease can also be acquired by eating contaminated soil, or consuming raw or undercooked meat (beef, lamb, or pork.). Toxoplasmosis can affect people with weakened immune systems. Blindness is known to occur in people that are affected with this disease.

Cats infected with the parasite rarely show any clinical signs.

Since the disease is so tightly linked to cats and clinical signs in humans are not unlike what this article describes in other animals, this seems like a logical conclusion given the increase in feral cats in the areas where animals seem to be affected.

Antibiotics can be used to treat infected cats and people. However an antibiotic or antiparasiticide program for wildlife seems like a leap, but clearly preservation of some species is going to demand a closer look at this situation. - Mod.TG]

[It is important to emphasize that _Toxoplasma gondii_ in wildlife will be transmitted to livestock. Felines are important because oocysts from cat feces contaminate the pastures, infecting grazing livestock. Ecological (green) pigs will also pick up _T gondii_ as they are kept in outside facilities and can also become infected by consuming feed or water contaminated by cat feces containing the oocysts.

Although there is not much one can do about _T. gondii_ in wildlife, screening of food which is sold without being thoroughly cooked or frozen could be a way to ensure it does not reach the consumer. - Mod.EP]
