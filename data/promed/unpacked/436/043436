Europol warning on the illicit sale of false negative COVID-19 test certificates
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as travel restrictions remain in place due to the pandemic, it is very likely that criminals will seize the opportunity of producing and selling fake COVID-19 test certificates, warns a Europol Early Warning Notification published today [1 Feb 2021].

Several cases have already emerged of fraudulent COVID-19 test certificates being sold to travellers:
- a forgery ring selling negative test results to passengers was dismantled at the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France;
- in the UK, fraudsters were caught selling bogus COVID-19 documents for GBP 100 [about USD 140];
- in December 2020, a fraudster was apprehended by the Spanish National Police for selling fake test results for EUR 40 [about USD 50].

Europol received additional intelligence on the alleged use of a mobile application by the Rathkeale Rovers Mobile Organised Crime Group which allows members of the organised crime group to manually falsify test results.

Given the widespread technological means available, in the form of high-quality printers and different software, fraudsters are able to produce high-quality counterfeit, forged, or fake documents.

Member states are encouraged to share any relevant information on criminal activities related to fake COVID-19 test documentation with Europol.

Europol warning notification (from the Hague 1 Feb 2021)
The illicit sales of false negative COVID-19 test certificates
--------------------------------------------------------------
Background
To contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, an increasing number of countries in the EU and beyond are obliging passengers to present a proof of negative COVID-19 test to be allowed entry when travelling from a high-risk area. The measure generally concerns passengers travelling by air and in some cases, international train and coach traffic.

What is happening?
Several cases have emerged in open sources of fraudulent COVID-19 test certificates being sold to travellers. The latest case of detected bogus test certificates was reported from Luton Airport in the UK [1] when a man was arrested trying to sell false COVID-19 test certificates.

Earlier reports included the arrest of a forgery ring at the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris selling forged negative test results to passengers. The amount charged for the fake test documents ranged between EUR 150 to EUR 300 [about USD 180 to 360] [2]. Intelligence suggests that in the UK, fraudsters were caught selling bogus COVID-19 test documents for GBP 100 [about USD 140], faking the name of a genuine laboratory on the false certificates [3]. In December 2020, a fraudster was apprehended by the Spanish National Police for selling false negative PCR certificates on the surface web for an amount of EUR 40 [about USD 50] [4]. In the Netherlands, scammers were discovered selling fake negative test statements for EUR 50-60 [about USD 60 to 70] through messaging apps [5].

Europol received additional intelligence on the alleged use of a mobile application by the Rathkeale Rovers Mobile Organised Crime Group which allows members of the organised crime group to manually falsify test results [6].

Why is this relevant?
The detection of fake COVID-19 negative test certificates confirms that criminals -- be it organised crime groups or individual opportunistic scammers -- seize profitable opportunities once they arise. As long as travel restrictions remain in place due to the COVID-19 situation, it is highly likely that production and sales of fake test certificates will prevail. Given the widespread technological means available, in the form of high-quality printers and different software, fraudsters are able to produce high-quality counterfeit, forged or fake documents.

What do we need from you?
The purpose of this notification is to increase further awareness of the illicit production and sales of fraudulent COVID-19 negative test certificates. Member states are encouraged to share any relevant information on criminal activities related to fake COVID-19 test documentation with Europol.

With countries across the globe now requiring passengers to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test prior to departure, there is now a risk of fake COVID-19 test certificates undermining the sector's efforts to limit the spread of the disease and open up air travel again.

Following the UK government's decision to suspend all travel corridors, which came into force on [18 Jan 2021], passengers arriving to the UK were said to be faced with unprecedented scenes at London Heathrow Airport (LHR), with long delays, social distancing rules breached, altercations between passengers and border officials, GBP 500 [about USD 680] on-the-spot fines and passengers being refused entry to flights for holding invalid COVID-19 certificates.

The UK now requires that all arriving passengers provide verifiable proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before departure to England.

Chief executive officer of VSTE Enterprises (VSTE), Louis-James Davis, has warned of the very real and serious threats facing airlines, airports, and passengers from fake COVID-19 test certificates and vaccination record cards, social distancing breaches, and the use of health passports with 'unsafe' QR code and barcode technology, which have to be scanned within close proximity. He also warned of the serious implications of potential data breaches using 'unsecure' code scanning technology in health passports.

There has reportedly been an alarming rise in the number of fake COVID-19 test certificates available on the black market, with instances of counterfeit negative test certificates in Brazil, France, and the UK. Passengers who carry fake COVID-19 test results in order to travel undermine the sector's efforts to limit the spread of the disease and open up air travel again.

The possibility of barcodes and QR codes being hacked is also a real issue and, therefore, any airline who considers using this form of authentication for COVID-19 testing risks a breach of passenger data.

[Unfortunately dishonesty, self-centered focus, and greed will find a way to "beat the system". People who refuse vaccines have gotten fake vaccination cards. As we've seen in prior reports, people have lied by omission about positive PCR tests and boarded planes. This appears to be a global challenge, not restricted to one culture alone. It seems that point of service rapid tests administered by airport staff and other travel nodes such as train stations and bus stations may be a solution to this problem, with the costs being passed onto the travellers. A sad state of affairs. - Mod.MPP]

[2] China: counterfeit vaccine
Date: Mon 1 Feb 2021 16:36 GMT

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/china-fake-covid-vaccines-intl/index.html


China has said it is cracking down on a crime ring making "fake vaccines" for COVID-19 that has been running since September [2020], state media report. Police departments in Jiangsu, Beijing, and Shandong have arrested more than 80 people involved in producing more than 3000 fake Covid-19 vaccine doses, Xinhua News Agency reported.

Xinhua said China's Ministry of Public Security is investigating crimes related to the manufacture and sale of counterfeit vaccines "and the illegal practice of medicine and fraud under the guise of the vaccines". Police found that since September 2020, those involved "have been making huge profits by [filling] saline solution into injectors to process and make fake coronavirus vaccines and selling them at a higher price", the agency said.

China has been vaccinating its population with shots from 2 companies, Sinovac and Sinopharm, and both have also been rolled out in other countries, including Turkey. Both companies initially said their vaccines were more than 78% effective, but late-stage trials of the Sinovac candidate in Brazil reported an efficacy rate of 50.38%. Sinovac has stood by its vaccine, even as some countries have placed it under review and paused rollouts, but scientists have called on the company to release more data. Sinopharm, the state-owned company whose vaccine was the 1st to be approved in China, said its product was 79.34% effective in trials.

[3] Canada (Ontario): meat packing plant, variant
Date: Mon 1 Feb 2021 12:00 PM ET
Source: CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News [abridged, edited]
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-officials-update-covid-886-february-1-1.5896069


City of Toronto [Ontario] officials held a briefing Monday [1 Feb 2021] as 961 new cases were reported, which was an overcount due to data entry changes. Toronto Public Health (TPH) has confirmed the first workplace COVID-19 outbreak where employees have tested positive for the B.1.1.7 variant. The outbreak occurred at Belmont Meats.

There are 78 confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to the workplace outbreak, with 2 of those people testing positive for the B.1..17 variant first detected in the UK. Employees who have tested positive are now in quarantine for 14 days and monitoring for symptoms, a spokesperson for Belmont Meats said in a statement to CBC Toronto. "We have asked all our other employees and everyone who has had close contact with them to get tested as soon as possible, self-isolate, and monitor for any COVID-19 related symptoms," the statement reads.

Toronto's medical officer of health Dr Eileen de Villa said the city will be conducting more testing in the coming days to see if others were also infected by a novel coronavirus variant. The facility said it made "significant investments and implemented stringent safety protocols" to protect employees and prevent further spread of the virus." The city said there's also evidence of secondary transmission of the variant in household member cases associated with an employee in the workplace.

At this time, there is no indication that any cases identified in the outbreak had recently travelled or had contact with a person who travelled recently. According to Monday's [1 Feb 2021] provincial numbers, Toronto has seen 15 cases of the COVID-19 variant first detected in the UK, to date.

On Monday [1 Feb 2021], the city reported 961 new cases of COVID-19, an overcount consequential of data entry changes, de Villa said. "Today's case counts are higher as a result of adjustments due to the transition to the provincial information system for case and contact management," she said.

The overall number of patients hospitalized with the virus reached 397. Of that number, 105 are in the intensive care unit. The city confirmed 18 more people have died of the virus. To date, more than 2400 Torontonians have died after contracting the virus.

Toronto mayor John Tory said during the 2nd lockdown, the city's 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases has gone from 1023 at its peak to 592 as of 28 Jan 2021. But he said now is not the time to let up on restrictions. "We simply have to stay the course to see this thing through," he said.

Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 87 644 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Overall, 78 378 people have recovered, the city said.

"Abstract [edited]
------------------
"Policy responses to the COVID-19 outbreak must strike a balance between maintaining essential supply chains and limiting the spread of the virus. Our results indicate a strong positive relationship between livestock-processing plants and local community transmission of COVID-19, suggesting that these plants may act as transmission vectors into the surrounding population and accelerate the spread of the virus beyond what would be predicted solely by population risk characteristics. We estimate the total excess COVID-19 cases and deaths associated with proximity to livestock plants to be 236 000 to 310 000 (6 to 8% of all US cases) and 4300 to 5200 (3 to 4% of all US deaths), respectively, as of 21 Jul 2020, with the vast majority likely related to community spread outside these plants. The association is found primarily among large processing facilities and large meatpacking companies. In addition, we find evidence that plant closures attenuated county-wide cases and that plants that received permission from the US Department of Agriculture to increase their production-line speeds saw more county-wide cases. Ensuring both public health and robust essential supply chains may require an increase in meatpacking oversight and potentially a shift toward more decentralized, smaller-scale meat production."

Large meatpacking plants appear to contribute significantly to virus spread. The suggestion Taylor et al make to consider shifting towards smaller scale facilities is a good one to protect the workers and the community. A well written commentary on the cost benefit ratio of keeping meat packing plants open as they currently exist can be found at Graff Zivin J, Sanders N. The spread of COVID-19 shows the importance of policy coordination. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020 Dec 11; 117(52): 328420-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2022897117. Epub ahead of print.

[Weekend reporting artifact is seen with a 30.4% drop in globally reported cases since Fri 28 Jan 2021 and a 32.8% drop in reported deaths; at the country level, there was an 80.9% drop in reported cases by France; a 58.5% drop by South Africa; a 56.9% drop by Brazil; a 32.8% drop by Argentina; a 48.2% drop by Germany; a 31.4% drop by India; and a 17.0% drop by the USA.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (144 146), Brazil (25 285), and Spain (22 251) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 463 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 31 Jan 2021 to late 1 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (7 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, UK (18 607), Russia (17 648), Mexico (12 478), and Indonesia (10 994). A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 46 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region -- unchanged from yesterday.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 15.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 0.22% increase in reported deaths -- virtually no change.

Impression: The global daily reported cases have dropped to just over 400 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 48 hours with over 103.93 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.24 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports and weekend reporting artifact, although there is a definite increase in reporting seen in some African countries and Western Pacific countries. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are having an impact on transmission. - Mod.MPP]
