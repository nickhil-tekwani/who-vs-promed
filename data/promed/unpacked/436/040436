Foot and mouth, bluetongue... new disease plagues UK farmers
------------------------------------------------------------
London, UK -- November 1, 2007 -- A mysterious skin disorder affecting
farmers at lambing time has been discovered by a Hampshire farmer and a
team of doctors from Southampton, the British Journal of Dermatology will
reveal.

Following several turbulent months for UK farmers, with outbreaks of foot
and mouth and blue tongue, dermatologists have now discovered a disorder
which affects the farmers themselves. The strange disorder specifically
targets the ears, which initially become hot, itchy and sore and soon
suffer blistering and crusting which can be painful and unsightly. No other
parts of the body are affected.

The symptoms are also confined to lambing season (which usually lasts from
one to 3 months) and disappear promptly when lambing is over.

In some farmers, the blistering appears every year during lambing, in one
case for the previous 30 years, and in all patients both ears are affected.
It also occurs in farmers who are calving, but less frequently.

The condition was discovered by George Heathcote, a farmer from Hampshire
and one of the study's authors, who experienced blistering on his ears and
consulted doctors in Southampton. He said: "I was convinced that lambing
was involved, so I decided to place a letter in Farmer's Weekly magazine
and equivalent overseas publications, asking other farmers with similar
symptoms to contact me. I received responses from 69 affected UK farmers
but, interestingly, none from abroad."

The Southampton doctors reviewed his and 4 comparable cases seen over a 4
year period, and discovered striking similarities that suggest a new skin
disorder linked to the farming practice, which they named "lambing ears".

The reasons for the phenomenon remain unclear, but the study's authors
suggest several possibilities. Biopsies showed a similarity to 'polymorphic
light eruption' (PLE), a rash that comes up after exposure to sunlight.This
led to the idea that sunlight or artificial light sources could be part of
the problem. The absence of reported cases in Australia, a sunny climate
where lambing tends to take place outdoors, suggests that indoor artificial
lighting is a more likely culprit than sunlight. However, this could also
be due to the minimal contact with the sheep involved in outdoors farming.

It is also thought that lighting alone is not responsible, as the disorder
only occurs specifically during lambing, whereas lighting is used for other
farming practices throughout the year.

Consultant dermatologist at Southampton General Hospital and one of the
study's authors, Professor Peter Friedmann said: "During shearing, which
takes place in May or June and may be indoors or outdoors, the same farmers
who suffer lambing ears can shear the sheep with no symptoms at all. This
suggests that bodily fluids from the sheep, such as amniotic fluid, sac and
placenta, or chemicals used as part of the process, play a part, although
intriguingly, the disorder does not affect the hands, which have maximum
contact with fluids and products involved in lambing.

"The disorder is far more common in farmers who conduct lambing indoors.
Bodily fluids are the only unique factor at lambing time, and give another
reason aside from natural lighting why 'lambing ears' may not occur in
farmers who conduct lambing outdoors, as these farmers have far less
contact with the ewes during the birth."

Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists said: "This study is
fascinating and illustrates how dermatologists are coming up against new
diseases all the time. Following foot and mouth and blue tongue, the
discovery of a disease affecting the farmers themselves may seem like an
extra blow. However, it is actually positive that the disorder has been
identified and can now be shared with dermatologists across the UK, as it
will allow for more research and shared knowledge. The next step is to
carry out an epidemiological study to clearly define the numbers of farmers
affected."

[The phenomenon is more akin to an allergic reaction to some placental
component rather than exposure to an infectious agent. Orf virus, an ovine
papilloma virus or an ovine herpesvirus might be appropriate candidates for
a viral etiologic agent, but their presence would have been easy to detect.

In case an infectious agent is to be considered at all, investigating the
(far fetched) possible involvement of Chlamydia psittaci var. ovis
(Chlamydophila abortus) may (arduously) be included. This, since this agent
is the only zoonotic agent I am aware of as being quite common in British
sheep. This led British authorities, years back, to warn pregnant women
from approaching sheep during the lambing season. I failed finding
correlation between chlamydia and (human) skin involvement, besides
erythema nodosum, related to Chlamydia pneumoniae, in several Scandinavian
papers. Again, rather far fetched!

The article does NOT indicate what the farmers might come into contact
with-- is this a contact type of "allergy" that ears are not washed as
often as hands and the ears are subject to a phototoxicity,
photodermatitis? Is this the result of a systemic situation? It does not
indicate if blood tests were done on the farmers or if fluid from the
blisters on the ears was examined. The only connection is the photo aspect
and the unusual timing of lambing/calving season. Is this a case of the
first time hats have been worn in a season? Is this a dermatitis from mold
in hats? Maybe not a noticible mold but spores nonetheless? Orf-- I really
would have very serious doubts and I would put it way down on my
differential list.

It may well be related to a combination of photodermatitis combined with a
contact dermatitis to a product of conception. The piece does not say if
recurrences occurred from year to year.

This piece has generated considerable interest, and ProMED-mail would be
pleased to receive well informed suggestions as to the likely aetiology. -
