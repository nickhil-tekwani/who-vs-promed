FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN BAHRAIN
Emergency report
----------------
Text of an e-mail received on 21 December 1998 from Dr Khalid A.M. Hassan,
Head of Veterinary Service Section, Ministry of Works and Agriculture, Manama:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical.
------------------------------
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 4 December 1998.
----------------------------------------------------
Location Description of affected population
-------------------------------------------------------
Bouri village local cattle kept under intensive system
Janabiya village local sheep and cattle (farm was vaccinated two weeks
before with a trivalent FMD vaccine)
quarantine centre cattle imported from a country in southern Africa
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
-----------------------------------------
species Bovine Ovine
susceptible 2,000 300
cases 150 20
deaths 3 0
destroyed 0 0
slaughtered 0 0

Diagnosis:
----------
in progress at the OIE World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth
Disease (Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom).
Control measures during reporting period: ring vaccination.
-----------------------------------------
[While it is most probable that this outbreak is merely a local spread of
the ongoing endemic situation in the region, i.e. from Kuwait, the hint of
a possible importation from "southern Africa" should not be overlooked. FMD
deaths are usually in calves and from myocarditis ("tiger heart"). - Mod.MHJ
