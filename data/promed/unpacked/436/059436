_Salmonella_ outbreak with unknown food source
---------------------------------------------

Investigation notice
--------------------
A specific food item has not yet been identified as the source of this fast-growing outbreak. If you have symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection, talk to your healthcare provider and report your illness to your health department to help investigators solve this outbreak.

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 419 (140 new)
Hospitalizations: 66 (40 new)
Deaths: 0
States: 35 (6 new)
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

CDC and public health and regulatory officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg infections. The investigation has not yet identified a food linked to illness.

Since the last update on 23 Sep 2021, 140 more people were added to this outbreak. As of 29 Sep 2021, 419 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg have been reported from 35 states (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Jun 2021 to 14 Sep 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/epi.html).

Texas / 111
Utah / 2
Virginia / 38
Wisconsin / 10

Sick people range in age from less than 1 year to 91 years, with a median age of 37, and 56% are female. Of 214 people with information available, 66 (31%) have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported, as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Laboratory data
---------------
Whole genome sequencing of bacteria from one food sample and 289 people's samples did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. One person's sample was predicted to be resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone, and one person's sample was predicted to be resistant to gentamicin, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if therapy is needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of antibacterial used to treat most people because it is rare.

[The number of cases identified has continued to increase prominently. ProMED awaits more information about the source of this growing outbreak of salmonellosis. Of note, 174 of the reported 419 cases (41.5%) are from the bordering states of Texas and Oklahoma. The previous CDC report noted that the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg was found in a sample taken from a takeout condiment cup containing cilantro and lime. The sick person reported that the condiment container also contained onions, but none were left in the cup when it was tested. Because multiple food items were present in the container and in the sample that was tested, it is not possible to know which food item was contaminated. No additional information regarding the vehicle for the organism is contained in this week's report. - Mod.LL
