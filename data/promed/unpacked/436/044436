A measles outbreak affecting several European countries has killed 30 people in Romania, most of them children, health authorities in Bucharest said on Friday [23 Jun 2017].

More than 7200 people in the European Union's 2nd-poorest country have contracted the illness since late 2016, Romania's contagious disease monitoring centre said.

There was also a 31st suspected fatality.

The respiratory disease, characterised by high fever and small red spots, usually triggers only mild symptoms, but it remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally.

The World Health Organization recommends 2 doses of vaccination, the 1st by a child's 1st birthday, to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, saying they should cover 95 percent of the population.

But in Romania, due not only to poverty but also a lack of vaccines and poor access to health care, the rate is only 80 percent for the 1st shot and 50 percent for the 2nd.

The Romanian government is currently pushing through legislation that would make vaccination obligatory in order for children to be allowed to go to school.

Compounding the problem, a growing number of parents are refusing to have their children immunised, with religious groups and public figures also launching anti-vaccination campaigns.

The WHO warned in March 2017 about a rising number of measles cases in Europe, with the largest outbreaks in Romania and Italy. France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland and Ukraine were also affected.

On Thu [29 Jun 2017], a 6-year-old boy with leukaemia died from measles in Italy. He had an 85-percent chance of being cured of his leukaemia, but his parents refused to have him vaccinated for measles, Italian authorities said.

They said that at least 3074 measles cases have been recorded this year [2017], 40 percent of whom had to be hospitalised. The WHO said on Tue [27 Jun 2017] that 43 percent of cases in Europe were in Italy.

A 9-year-old girl died in a Rome hospital on 28 Apr 2017 from complications from a bout of measles, which she had not been vaccinated against, the Bambino Ges√π Hospital said Wed [28 Jun 2017]. The girl, who lived near Latina south of Rome, was admitted on 19 Apr 2017 with a gene-related disease, a chromosome abnormality.

She came down with a fever and conjunctivitis on 14 Apr 2017 and was diagnosed with measles on 26 Apr 2017. The complications that resulted included pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency, the latter of which was cited as cause of death.

The government recently made it compulsory to have 12 vaccinations before being allowed into school up to the age of 6.

[This points out one reason why it is important for children who are immunocompetent without exacerbating conditions to be vaccinated with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, specifically to prevent infection of those most vulnerable who cannot be vaccinated safely.

[3] Italy summary

In Italy, since the beginning of this year [2017], measles has already claimed the lives of 2 individuals.

Complications were recorded in 35% of those with the disease, and 40% reported having been admitted to the hospital. Emergency room visits were necessary in 22% of the cases. And, even if the average age of the patients was 27 years, it is important to take note of the fact that 18% of the individuals were under 4 years of age.

These are the latest data published in Italy's weekly bulletin released by the Ministry of Health and the Italian Institute of Health (ISS). The bulletin, in fact, was created to monitor and announce punctually the scenario involving the measles epidemic that has been evolving in Italy since last January [2017].

Lack of funds needed to train vaccinators caused the deaths of 16 children during the botched measles vaccination campaign in South Sudan, an official said on Tue [27 Jun 2017].

"The measles campaign was carried out by UNICEF [UN Children's Emergency Fund] with the World Health Organization and Ministry of Health. When we asked for funding to train nurses and volunteers who were to administer the vaccines, there was no funding from UNICEF," Kapoeta state governor Luis Lobong told the Council of States.

35 children, who received the measles vaccine, fell ill in Kapeota.

Last month [May 2017], South Sudan's health minister, Riek Gai Kok attributed the bizarre incident to what he described as typical "human error."

However, while appearing before the country's lawmakers on Tue [27 Jun 2017], Gai explained that steps were being taken by the health ministry, WHO and UNICEF to ensure mistakes [do not] occur again.

"We regret the death of the 15 children, who showed the same symptoms after being vaccinated with measles [vaccine]. The health volunteers were not trained, and they mistakenly used one syringe to [vaccinate] many children. We sincerely extend our condolences to the families and the victims of this mistake," said Gai.

Unconfirmed reports say children as young as 10 years participated as volunteers to administer measles vaccines in the botched campaigns in Kapoeta, despite the lack of electric power to moderate the vaccine's temperature as well as poor handling of medical sets.

South Sudanese lawmakers, however, demanded justice for families affected, yet some citizens wanted those officials concerned to be impeached for their alleged failure to provide proper leadership.

South Sudan is acknowledged to have some of the worst health indicators in the world.

[The deaths of the vaccinated children were completely avoidable. Surely, if public health officials were giving the vaccine to the children, they should know best practices to preserve the safety of the vaccination process, i.e., the importance of changing needles between individuals. It is difficult to imagine that children "as young as 10" who would not have that expertise were allowed to give vaccinations.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a travel-associated confirmed case of measles in Franklin County.

The last reported measles case in Maine was in 1997. The Maine CDC said no other causes are under investigation.

"The Maine CDC is working with clinicians to identify potentially exposed individuals and make appropriate recommendations to prevent transmission," State Epidemiologist Dr. Siiri Bennett said in a statement.

Health officials said the public may have been exposed to the measles if they were at the locations listed in the URL above during the defined times.

The Maine CDC said people potentially exposed should review their vaccine history, and monitor for symptoms.

Individuals with symptoms should contact their health care provider for instructions before arriving at the provider's office or hospital. If symptoms are consistent with the disease, testing may be performed to determine whether the individual is infected. Individuals without symptoms should not be tested.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red eyes.

Measles can cause severe health complications including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Measles is transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes; infected people are contagious from 4 days before their rash starts through 4 days afterwards.

After an infected person leaves a location, the virus remains alive for up to 2 hours on surfaces and in the air. The incubation period -- the period from exposure to onset of symptoms -- is typically 10-14 days but can be as long as 21 days.
