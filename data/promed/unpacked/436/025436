An urgent health alert has been issued after a bat riddled with a fatal disease similar to rabies was found at a busy market stall in Brisbane.

The animal was found on the ground near death at the popular Davies Park markets in the city's west end, sparking grave concerns for those who may have come in contact with it.

Queensland Health has urged anyone who may have touched the bat, which tested positive to the deadly Australian Bat Lyssavirus, to come forward.

Anybody who came in contact with the bat requires urgent post-exposure vaccinations. The disease is only treatable if victims takes a rabies vaccine before symptoms set in. 3 people have died from lyssavirus since it was discovered in 1996.

In 2013, an 8-year-old boy died after frothing at the mouth, writhing with seizures and tearing out the IV lines doctors had inserted into him.

Doctor Kari Jarvinen from Metro South Health said she held grave concerns for market-goers who may have come in contact with the bat. "We are really trying to get the message across, that please don't do that," he said. "Do not handle bats at all."

"The lyssavirus that we've got unfortunately in a small proportion of our Australian bats, it's related to the classical rabies virus and causes a very similar disease."

[A good article on the difference between rabies and Australian bat Lyssavirus (ABLV) can be found at:
http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/infectious/factsheets/pages/rabies-australian-bat-lyssavirus-infection.aspx.

ABLV, which is closely related but not identical to rabies, does occur in Australia, and is transmitted from bats to humans. 3 cases of human infection with ABLV have been recorded since the virus was originally identified in 1996. Post-exposure treatment is with the same post-exposure treatment as rabies in the US. - Mod.TG

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_ and are the largest bats in the world. There are several species. For a picture of the impressive flying fox, go to

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL) is a potentially lethal zoonotic virus. It was initially identified in 1996 and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure. - Mod.PMB
