The third case of BSE has been diagnosed at a farm in Frieselo the
Netherlands. All 90 cows from the farm will be culled and examined for TSE
as well as all family lines.
Six year old cow, "Candy Can Be", has been diagnosed with BSE in the north
of the country from a diary herd in Vriescheloo (Groningue county). She was
slaughtered on 18th August. Brain is being analyzed in the ID-DLO
(Lelystad). Candy was born in 1992 (a BAB case, 'Born After the Ban'). The
herd (90 cattle) was slaughtered on the 27th of August.
Parent stock and descendants of the affected cow will be traced and
removed. Cows born on the farm in the same year as the affected cow will
also be traced.
"The village of Vriescheloo is only about 10 km from the German border with
no iron curtain."
