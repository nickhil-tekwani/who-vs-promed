Bulgaria - anthrax confirmed
-----------------------------
Bulgaria's veterinary service has confirmed an anthrax outbreak among
sheep in the northeastern village of Brestovene, it said in a
statement Tuesday [1 Sep 2010]. An outbreak of the disease was
already suspected after 5 sheep died earlier [last] month, sparking
fears that the herd's 64-year-old owner and his 8-year-old grandson
might also be infected. Doctors later ruled out that the 2 had caught
the disease.

[This just leaves the possible south eastern outbreak awaiting
confirmation. The previous case we reported in Bulgaria in 2006 was
also in the north-east and involved sheep. From 2002 through 2008
they have had 1 to 2 human cases each year with an equally sporadic
number of bovine and small ruminant outbreaks with vaccination.
Cattle vaccination is around 50 percent and sheep and goats at around
30 percent, though officially in 2008 only 11 173 out of 2.3 million
sheep and goats were vaccinated. The trick is to target the high risk
areas and make sure that the owners there get their stock vaccinated.
