Paraguay is facing "an epidemic explosion" of mosquito-borne dengue fever
and needs to declare a medical emergency to mobilize resources to battle
the outbreak, the country's health minister said on Thursday. The outbreak
is known to have caused at least one death already. Local media have
estimated that tens of thousands of people out of a population of 5 million
have fallen ill.
"We are faced with an epidemic explosion of standard dengue at a national
level, and we have outbreaks of hemorrhage dengue," Health Minister Martin
Chiola told Reuters. "As health minister I am going to suggest that the
president decree a medical emergency, which would grant the ministry access
to public and private clinics," he said.
Congress also has asked President Luis Gonzalez Macchi to declare an
emergency, an action that would make extra funds available to combat
dengue. The outbreak has hit 14 of the landlocked South American country's
17 departments and is especially grave in Ciudad del Este, on the border with
Brazil, and the capital Asuncion.
Paraguay's cash-strapped government has recorded no reliable figures for
the number of those ill, but Chiola said "the incidence is very high."
Dengue fever causes fever, rash, headaches and muscle pains. It affects
some 100 million people worldwide, principally but not exclusively in
tropical regions. There is no vaccine against dengue, which, in its
virulent form of haemorrhagic fever, can cause internal bleeding and death.
Paraguay's hot and humid climate provides good conditions for mosquitoes to
breed.
"Our main worry is haemorrhagic dengue. Up to the moment, we have only
detected nine cases, of which one was fatal and two have already
recovered," said Chiola. "With the increase in our control measures, we
believe that the growth in the number of cases should slow down in 10 days,
and the epidemic should be almost completely under control within three
weeks," he added. The government intends to prohibit protests against
economic policy planned by peasants and public transportation drivers in
the second half of the month because large numbers of people in one place
could contribute to the spread of the disease, Chiola said.

The Tropical Medicine Institute (IMT) of Paraguay treated 535 patients for
hemorrhagic dengue over the last two days, IMT Director Adolfo Galeano told
EFE Friday. "There was a real avalanche of patients suffering of slight
hemorrhages. There were so many that 280 came the first day, and 255 on
Thursday," the doctor said. Galeano said that the number has declined since
then, even though they still do not have definite figures. The doctor
attributed this public reaction to recent nonstop media reports about the
death of a 41-year-old man, whose identity has not been disclosed and who
suffered similar symptoms.
"We are currently seeing cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever (a variety of
classic dengue fever) in Paraguay because patients experience bleeding
noses, gums and other sensitive parts, where the hemorrhage is limited and
can be controlled in a matter of hours and minutes," Galeano said.
From March 3 to March 9, IMT doctors have treated a total of 1,434 dengue
fever cases, while other public hospitals saw more than 350 cases. Media
reports said that dengue fever has affected 42,000 people in recent weeks
across the country, even though health authorities still refuse to declare
a nationwide state of emergency.

[Dengue is a disease that clearly has emerged. It is now found in
essentially all tropical and many subtropical areas of the world, either as
an endemic and persistent disease or as an endemic and irregularly detected
disease. This Paraguayan situation is reported here because of the obvious
risk for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) there. For DHF to develop, the
usual situation is that a preceding epidemic caused by a different dengue
virus occurred in that same area. This indicates a persistent, not a new,
vector/virus [albeit a different dengue virus relationship and
demonstrates that in the past inadequate steps had been taken to rid the
place of the vector. Altogether too common in too many places these days. -
