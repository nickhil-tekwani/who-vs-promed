Disease strikes down poultry, no threat to people
-------------------------------------------------
Poultry on 11 farms on Mahe and Praslin have been struck down by the avian
virus Gumboro disease, but officials have been quick to reassure the public
that it poses no risk to human health. Dr Bernard Moulinie, director
general for Animal Health and Development in the Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources, said on Tuesday that the impacts of the disease are
being closely monitored and stressed again that it presents no danger to
public health.
Dr Moulinie said that the ministry was first informed of the
disease-related fatalities in March and that it has subsequently been
recorded on a total of 11 farms; 7 broiler farms and 4 layer farms. The
latest outbreak has caused mortality rates of up to 9 per cent in the
broiler sector and up to 39 per cent in the layer farms, but has been
limited in most cases to young replacement chicks, not the main farm flocks.
According to Dr Moulinie, Gumboro disease was first identified in
Seychelles in an outbreak in 1991, with the help of experts from the Food
and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the Dutch Poultry Health Institute,
who warned at the time that, due to the cyclical nature of the virus, it
was likely to return. The 1991 outbreak caused mortality rates of up to 50
per cent on some farms and led to the introduction of new guidelines for
intensive chicken farms. "Strict farm hygiene is the key factor to
combating this," said Dr Moulinie, who added that sanitation controls and
regulating the movement of staff have been very effective in limiting
further outbreaks.
In a bid to reduce future occurrences of the disease Dr Moulinie said that
the 46 poultry farmers operating in Seychelles will be brought together in
a workshop to discuss preventative measures and how to stop the disease
from spreading. While unsure of how the disease first arrived in Seychelles
Dr Moulinie said that migratory birds are thought to be the most likely
cause, but added that, as it is transmitted through the birds' faeces, it
may have been transported on shoes or wheels, or by rats or mice.

[Infectious bursal disease (IBD, Gumboro disease) is a worldwide avian
disease caused by a virus that is now classified as a member of the genus
_Avibirnavirus_ of the family _Birnaviridae_. Although turkeys, ducks,
guinea fowl, and ostriches may be infected, clinical disease occurs solely
in chickens. Only young birds are clinically affected. Severe acute disease
of birds 3 to 6 weeks old is associated with high mortality, but a less
acute or subclinical disease is common in 0 to 3 week old birds. This can
cause secondary problems due to the effect of the virus on the bursa of
Fabricius (a thymus-like lymphoid gland in birds that is an outgrowth of
the cloaca and the site of B cell maturation). IBD virus (IBDV) causes
lymphoid depletion of the bursa, and if this occurs in the first 2 weeks of
life, significant depression of the humoral antibody response may result.
Both live attenuated and inactivated (killed) vaccines are available to
control the disease. Further details, in particular regarding laboratory
diagnostic methods of IBD (a list B disease) and vaccine
production/control, can be accessed at
