[The outbreak is nearly over. WHO recommends waiting 2 full incubation periods (42 days) after the last person tests negative a 2nd time before declaring the end of the outbreak. No new cases have been reported in the DRC since 17 Feb 2020. Almost there! But support is still needed; see post below. - Mod LK]

Yesterday [19 Mar 2020] in their weekly update, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there have been no new cases of Ebola reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since 17 Feb 2020.

"However, because there is still a risk of re-emergence of EVD [Ebola virus disease], it is critical to maintain surveillance and response operations until and after the end of outbreak declaration," the WHO said.

In order to do so, the WHO said it needs USD 20 million to fund response efforts through May 2020 and said no new funding for Ebola has been received since December of 2019. "If no new resources are received, WHO risks running out of funds for the Ebola response before the end of the outbreak," the WHO said.

During the outbreak, which began in August of 2018, the overall case fatality rate has been 66%. 28 percent of cases were seen in children under the age of 18 and 5% in healthcare workers.

There have been no new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 17 Feb 2020. However, because there is still a risk of re-emergence of EVD, it is critical to maintain surveillance and response operations until and after the end of outbreak declaration, as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.

Unfortunately, the response faces increasing limitations that could result in delayed detection and control of flare-ups. These limitations include a funding shortfall, ongoing insecurity and lack of access to some areas, and limited staffing and resources amidst other local and global emergencies.

No funding for the Ebola response has been received by WHO since December 2019. An urgent injection of USD 20 million is required to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations through to the beginning of May 2020. If no new resources are received, WHO risks running out of funds for the Ebola response before the end of the outbreak. For more information, please see this statement.

Ongoing response activities include investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnosis of suspected cases (which continue to be detected), supporting survivors through a multi-disciplinary programme, and strategically transitioning activities. From 9 to 15 Mar 2020, over 32 000 alerts were reported and investigated. Of these, 2550 alerts were validated as suspected cases, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. During this same period, 2760 samples were tested, including 1565 blood samples from living suspected cases, 405 swabs from community deaths, and 790 samples from re-tested patients.

As of 17 Mar 2020, a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1), including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1931) were female, 28% (n=975) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers [see updated case number in 1st report, WHO Dashboard. - Mod LK].

Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone. Data as of 17 Mar 2020 [Excludes n=148 cases for whom onset dates not reported. Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. "Non-active zones" indicate health zones that have not reported new cases in the last 42 days.]

[Total cases and areas affected during the last 21 days are based on the initial date of case alert and may differ from date of confirmation and daily reporting by the Ministry of Health.]
