[According to the WHO daily summary of reported cases, there were no
reports of probable cases of SARS worldwide for 27 Jun 2003. As of the
time of production of the daily summary table
(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/2003_06_27/en/>) there was a
cumulative total of 8450 probable cases with 810 deaths reported from 30
countries. This is a net decrease of 6 cases from yesterday's
report. This decrease was seen by the identification of Influenza B as the
etiology of the probable case in a Taiwanese tourist visiting Japan, Italy
has excluded 4 cases, and Taiwan excluded one case. In the past 24 hours
there was one new death attributable to SARS reported from Taiwan.
Of note, according to the Health Canada website
(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>) SARS
update for today, 27 Jun 2003, there was one additional probable case
reported today that is a former suspected case that was reclassified to
probable. This case will be reflected in the next WHO summary expected on
Monday, 30 Jun 2003 due to time zone differences.
As a reminder, the most recent date of onset of probable cases of SARS are
15 Jun 2003 in Taiwan, and 12 Jun 2003 in Canada, 12 and 15 days ago
respectively. - Mod.MPP]
