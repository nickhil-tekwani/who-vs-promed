The United Nations Children's Fund is kicking off a yellow fever [YF]
vaccination campaign in Cote d'Ivoire despite growing [political]
instability and hostility to U.N. staff following a disputed
presidential election in November [2010]. UNICEF plans to vaccinate
more than 800 000 adults and children in north-central Cote d'Ivoire
against YF over the next week. Health workers will target 4 rural
districts, including Katiola and Beoumi where 66 cases of the
mosquito-borne illness have been recorded since November [2010],
including 25 deaths. UNICEF says just one case of the highly deadly
disease constitutes an epidemic.

UNICEF spokesman in Cote d'Ivoire, Louis Vigneault-Dubois, said the
vaccination campaign was delayed by the tense political gridlock that
has gripped the country since a 28 Nov [2010] presidential poll. "Now
it has reached a point where it is urgent to vaccinate the people, to
stop the epidemic in the 4 districts that are concerned by the
current campaign and to make sure that the disease does not spread
further beyond the 4 districts that are concerned," said Vigneault-Dubois.

[The YF outbreak situation in the Cote d'Ivoire grows of increasing
concern. The 5 Jan 2011 report (ProMED-mail archive number
20110105.0048) stated that there were 21 suspected YF cases and 11
deaths. Now, there are 66 cases and 25 deaths. It is difficult to
predict if the political conflicts and attacks on UN personnel will
become a major obstacle in mounting this urgent vaccination campaign.
One hopes that no interference will occur. The virus will not await a
political resolution, and more cases and deaths will occur if that
resolution is not accomplished.
