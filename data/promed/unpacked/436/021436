Schmallenberg virus - Belgium: 1st case
---------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the month [December 2011], an increasing number
of abortions and births of deformed lambs have been observed in
Belgium. The affected farms are mainly located in the north of the
country.

Affected lambs have been submitted for postmortem examinations at the
Animal Health Center of DGZ Vlaanderen [Animal Healthcare Flanders].
In some lambs, brain abnormalities were observed, such as
hydranencephaly or hypoplasia. On 22 Dec 2011, samples from 5 lambs
from one farm were tested by the Belgian reference laboratory for
animal diseases (CODA-CERVA); in 3 lambs the Schmallenberg virus was
detected in the thymus by RT-PCR (according to the protocol kindly
provided by FLI [Friedrich Loeffler Institute], Germany).

The affected lambs came from a farm of about 180 ewes located in
Hoogstraten, in the Province of Antwerp, close to the Dutch border.
The 1st epidemiological investigations indicated that 60 ewes gave
birth, among which 20 gave birth to lambs with defects such as
torticollis (crooked neck) and arthrogryposis (deformed joints). Most
deformed lambs were born dead, but some were born alive as indicated
by the presence of milk in their stomach; nevertheless, those were not
viable and did not survive for long.

Additional samples coming from several suspect farms will be analyzed
during the next days.

[The firsthand, authoritative information above on the 1st discovery
of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in newborn, congenitally-affected ovines,
is gratefully acknowledged. These affected lambs are the belated
clinicopathological expression of an infection which had taken place,
most probably, about 3-4 months ago, namely in August/September 2011.

The chronology of the events in Germany, Netherlands, and Belgium is
remarkable. The same 3 countries were the first to be infected (and
report; see ProMED-mail 20060821.2353), in August 2006, by the BTV-8
virus, heralding its introduction to Europe. The fact that both BTV-8
and SBV started their activity in August may reflect the presence of a
similar vector in all 3 counties. But why on earth (literally) did it
start, in both events, not only during the very same season, but also
within an almost identical geographical realm?! Food for thought --
and for intensified epidemiological studies. - Mod.AS]
