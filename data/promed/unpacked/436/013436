An epidemiological alert was declared in the hospital in Florida, Uruguay because 2 multidrug-resistant, KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase]-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were detected during the last month. These microorganisms affected 7 patients.

The 1st case was identified last 22 Aug 2014. The patient died after being admitted to the hospital for cancer surgery. "He developed an infection, a urine culture was performed, and a multidrug-resistant microorganism was identified", explained Dr. Richard Tessier, director of the hospital in Florida, Uruguay. In spite of this, Dr. Tessier gave assurances that the patient succumbed to his underlying condition rather than because of the bacterial infection. "The bacteria just caused an urinary tract infection," he pointed out.

Subsequently, 6 additional infected patients were identified. Four have been confirmed (to be infected with the multidrug-resistant microorganism), and 2 more are still under study.

These 6 patients are from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Florida hospital, and 2 of them died. Although Dr. Tessier explained that "these patients were severely ill" and that their death "is something that could happen," he admitted that they will determine whether the multidrug-resistant microorganism was the ultimate cause of death or whether it led to their death.

An "epidemiological alert" has been set up in the hospital, and a "crisis committee" has been appointed, Dr. Tessier explained. Also, "a control committee has been appointed looking for persons in contact with the affected patients," and a laboratory capable of "rapid diagnoses" is available.

The (local) General Health Direction is constantly monitoring the current situation in this hospital and in some other public health facilities.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli. KPCs are a type of beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. KPCs also hydrolyze all other beta-lactam antibiotics, and consequently KPC-producing organisms are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics. KPC-producing organisms are also resistant to multiple other classes of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones due to linked resistance genes.

KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) are plasmid-encoded enzymes 1st found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). Subsequently, KPCs have been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs are now commonly encountered in the USA, and have also been reported worldwide in countries such as Israel, China, France, and Italy, as well as countries in Central (http://healthmap.org/news/kpc-bacteria-kills-50-panama) and South America, such as Colombia (1) and Brazil (2,3).

Patients at risk of infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms include those with prolonged hospitalization, particularly in intensive care units, those who are critically ill or immunocompromised, those exposed to invasive devices (such as ventilators or central venous catheters), and those receiving long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The US CDC has published guidelines for control of these organisms in health care facilities (Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm).
