Public health officials are urging hospitals to do a better job of
promoting hand-washing after dozens of people were sickened by
norovirus at 3 Boston hospitals in recent weeks.
The Boston Globe reports that at Massachusetts General Hospital, 31
staffers and 13 patients fell ill with the gastrointestinal disease,
which causes vomiting and diarrhea but generally leaves no lasting
health effects.
Brigham and Women's Hospital reported that 8 patients and 22 staff
members contracted norovirus [infection]. And an outbreak at a
Children's Hospital day care facility left 33 children and adults
sick.
While the virus is difficult to stop entirely, experts say hospitals
can slow its spread by encouraging employees to vigorously wash their
hands with alcohol-based gel or soap after treating patients.

[Norovirus is living up to its reputation as the "winter vomiting
bug" and hospitals are particularly vulnerable at this time of year.
This year promises to be a vintage year for outbreaks of
norovirus-associated disease. Currently at least 56 hospital wards in
England and Wales have been closed to new admissions and it has been
estimated that more than 100 000 people a week in the UK are
contracting norovirus infection.
It should be noted that noroviruses (and caliciviruses in general)
are resistant to inactivation by organic solvents and therefore
alcohol-based cleansing agents may not have any additional advantage
over conventional soap and water hand cleansing in controlling the
spread of infection. - Mod.CP
