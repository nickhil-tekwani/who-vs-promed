The National Association of Onion Farmers in Kebbi has said that it has lost over NGN 1 billion [USD 2.75 million] worth of onions to 2 strange diseases affecting farms and storage facilities in the state. No fewer than 20 000 farmers were affected. "Two unknown diseases emerged and affected the seeds we used as well as the ripened onions in our local storage facilities. We have never witnessed such kind of diseases in decades."

The farmers believe that the diseases have no remedy for now. However, the association had not reported the outbreak to relevant government agencies but would do so immediately. The acting permanent secretary, state Ministry of Agriculture, Muhammad Lawal, said, "We have no information on the outbreak [or] in our records. We assure that we are going to take necessary action."

[A large number of fungal, bacterial and nematode pathogens are known to affect onion (_Allium cepa_) and related crops, as well as several viruses and phytoplasmas. Most of the major diseases of this crop are soilborne. Some fungi and bacteria that affect the growing plants can also be carried over on the bulbs after harvest, leading to post-harvest rotting, as mentioned above. Thus, the two "diseases" may actually be due to just one pathogen.

A similar disease or disorder was reported from the area earlier (see ProMED-mail post 20110117.0196). However, it seems a diagnosis is still not available. However, reliable diagnosis of the causes and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is needed before any management strategies can be designed.
