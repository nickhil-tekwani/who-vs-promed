MEASLES, ESTIMATED FATALITIES - UK

"I hate to be a wet blanket with all the wonderful information coming
out about vaccines, but I must point out that there were nowhere near
3,000 deaths per year in the UK from measles in the 1960's - try about
30. Oh well, what are a few zeros among friends?"

Making a very rough estimate based on US figures, I would say that
3000 measles deaths is only 1 zero too many. In 1965 there were
approximately 450,000 reported measles cases in the US. If the rate
of measles infection was approximately the same in the UK as in the US
(which would have depended on the use of measles vaccine that was just
getting started) there would have been about 112,000 cases of measles
in the UK in 1965. (The population is roughly 25% of the US
population.)

Using the more recent case fatality figures of 1-2 per 1000 cases
that comes out to be 112-224 estimated deaths from measles in the UK
in 1965.
