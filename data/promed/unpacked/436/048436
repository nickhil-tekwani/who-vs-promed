Indonesia: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 50
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed 2 additional cases
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The first case occurred in an 8-year-old boy from Central Jakarta. He
developed symptoms of fever and cough on 8 Dec 2005. He was
hospitalized on 13 Dec 2005, and died on 15 Dec 2005. Family members
and close contacts were placed under observation and tested for
possible infection; however, none have developed symptoms.
Investigations have been undertaken to determine the source of the
boy's exposure and samples from pigeons around his household are
being tested.
The 2nd case occurred in a 39-year-old man from East Jakarta. He
first reported symptoms of fever, headache, cough and shortness of
breath on 9 Dec 2005. He was hospitalized on 11 Dec 2005 and died on
12 Dec 2005. Family members and close contacts were placed under
observation. Investigations are being undertaken to determine the
source of the man's exposure. While he did not keep poultry in his
household, chickens and other birds were found in his neighbourhood.
Samples from these birds have been taken and are undergoing tests to
determine whether they may have been the source of infection.
These newly confirmed cases bring the total number in Indonesia to
16. Of these cases, 11 were fatal.
