[The occurrence of equine cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in
the area where 114 human cases have occurred is not surprising. Dr
Paul Reiter pointed out that, "A recent serosurvey of horses in a
large area in eastern Romania (also associated with the EDEN
project), approximately 30 percent were seropositive but there are no
reports of clinical cases" (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20100824.2972). The occurrence of clinical equine cases in the
current Greek outbreak is another indication that virulence of WNV
strains for a given vertebrae species may vary in time and space. Dr
Jimenez pointed out in his remarks that virulence of WNV strains from
Morocco and Spain differed in virulence (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20100826.3022). One hopes that WNV from the Greek outbreak will be
isolated for comparative genetic and pathogenesis studies. - Mod.TY]

[This report confirms that horses as well as humans are becoming
infected with some type of current circulating West Nile Virus in
Macedonia. In the past 2 years, previous OIE reports have implicated
both horses and wild birds, particularly hawks. In the last few
years, Austria has had outbreaks in wild birds in 2008 and 2009;
Hungary in wild birds in 2008 and 2009; and Spain had outbreaks in
wild birds in 2009. Italy had a very large outbreak of West Nile
Virus in horses in both 2008 (206 farms) and 2009 (119 farms). Cyprus
and Romania both identified the presence of the virus but provided
little data about distribution of the virus in various species and
the extent of the outbreak. So, again, comparative genetic and
pathogenic studies would help to shed additional light on the
epidemiology of this particular outbreak. - Mod.PC]
