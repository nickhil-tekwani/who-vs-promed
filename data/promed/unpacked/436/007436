Hundreds of sheep in Iceland have died off, and no one seems to know the exact cause. Research is currently underway to find the culprit.

RUV reports that the deaths have hit especially hard in Borgarfjordur in west Iceland, Eyjafjordur in the north, and across east Iceland. The wide area over which the deaths are occurring -- as well as the alarming rate at which sheep are dying off -- has many farmers worried. In some cases, half of entire flocks have been lost.

Svavar Halldorsson, chairperson of the National Association of Sheep Farmers, told reporters that he believes disease may be to blame. As such, he and other farmers have begun taking blood samples from ill sheep to be analyzed by the National Veterinary Authority.

More specifically, MBL reports that bad hay may be killing the sheep.

Svavar has no exact figures on how many sheep have fallen so far, but told reporters that the deaths have "been a heavy weight on our farmers, to miss so many animals."

[The above reports does not specify numbers, age, husbandry methods (e.g., housed or pasturing animals) and other epidemiologically significant data. Such information, and in particular results of the veterinary investigations (epidemiology, postmortem findings, laboratory) and detailed statistics are requested.

In case hay is confirmed as the vehicle of contamination, 3 etiological agents may initially be taken into consideration: listeriosis, botulism and mycotoxicosis. Obviously, others should not be ignored,

Iceland's sheep population is reportedly (2014 OIE data) 471 434, kept in 2459 establishments (density, 4.58/sq km). - Mod.AS
