Examination of milk samples for Schmallenberg virus [SBV] shows that many herds in southern Norway have been infected by the virus.

Fisheries and the Veterinary Institute have conducted a survey of bulk milk samples for antibodies against SBV from herds in southern Norway. Out of ca. 2400 herds that have been examined, in more than 400 herds, antibodies against the virus have been demonstrated, with most of the herds situated along the coast and rivers. There are large regional differences in the proportion of positive herds, with more than 50 percent positive in the counties of Ostfold, Vestfold and Aust-Agder, while it is less than 2 percent in Rogaland.

SBV is transmitted by biting midges, can infect cattle, sheep, goats, and wild ruminants, and cause serious birth defects when infection occurs during the 1st half of gestation. Surveys in Europe in 2011 and 2012 have found SBV infection in approximately 4 percent of bovine herds and about 7 percent in sheep farms.

FSA is monitoring the situation and will follow up with further studies during 2013.

For the 1st time, the proliferation of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] has been confirmed in Sweden, and studies show that the infection is widespread in the country. Viruses have also been demonstrated in the midges that spread the disease. Infection with the virus can lead to malformed fetuses in sheep, goats, and cattle. The infection will not lead to any restrictions imposed by the Board of Agriculture, and the holders will be able to move their animals as usual.

In late 2011, a new virus was found in ruminants in Germany, Holland, and Belgium. In 2012, it spread to many more countries in Europe. The virus is named after the place where it was 1st discovered, Schmallenberg. The virus does not spread to humans, and it is not dangerous to drink milk or eat meat from animals that have had the infection. Agriculture and the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) have conducted a national survey of cow's milk from many farms investigated, because antibodies to the virus are excreted in the milk. A large proportion of the samples indicates that there are antibodies. The SVA has also demonstrated virus in samples from 3 midges, the insect that spreads the disease.

In view of the recent reports on SBV circulation in neighboring countries, the results [in Sweden] are not unexpected. Since the infection is spread by midges, no spread is to be expected during the winter, says Erika Chenais, epidemiologist at SVA.

[The Norwegian report, available at the source URL, includes an SBV map of Norway.

It will be interesting to obtain results of serological or other epidemiological investigations for SBV from the Baltic counties, where the presence of another culicoides-borne virus, namely bluetongue, has recently been suspected.

In south Europe, The virus has been found in France, Spain (Andalusia) and Italy (including Sardinia). - Mod.AS
