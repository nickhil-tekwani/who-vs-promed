[Unfortunately, ASF has been detected in Perak State. Perak is located on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula and has land borders with the Malaysian states of Kedah to the north, Penang to the northwest, Kelantan and Pahang to the east, and Selangor to the south. Thailand's Yala and Narathiwat provinces both lie to the northeast. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perak)

Until this detection in Perak, ASF has been only detected in Sabah State, located on the northern portion of Borneo, in the region of East Malaysia.

"Malaysia confirmed the 1st ASF outbreaks in February 2021 in Sabah State at the northern part of Borneo Island. So far, 46 outbreaks have been officially confirmed in the country, only in Sabah State. Media reported that ASF cases were detected in three districts in the south-eastern side of Sabah State."

Classical swine fever (CSF) is a viral disease with severe economic consequences for the swine industry. Except for Australia, North America, and Europe, the infection is endemic in most other parts of the world with swine farms. The Eurasian wild boar (_Sus scrofa_) is equally susceptible to infection with CSF virus as domestic pigs, and the course of the disease is comparable in both. In areas with domestic pigs and wild boar, the infection is frequently transmitted from domestic pigs to wild boar and vice versa. CSF virus has no known reservoir other than swine. - Mod.PMB]
