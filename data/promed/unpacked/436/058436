Abstract
-------
In early 2017, a UK-born person in their 20s [years of age] presented with a skin ulcer on the foot 3 weeks after returning from Ghana. The patient had last received a diphtheria-containing vaccine in 2013, completing the recommended course. MALDI-TOF of a cutaneous swab identified _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. Real-time PCR ascertained the species and presence of the diphtheria toxin gene. An Elek test confirmed toxigenicity. The isolate was macrolide-sensitive and penicillin-resistant. The local Public Health England (PHE) Health Protection Team obtained the patient's clinical history and traced contacts to inform appropriate public health action. One close contact (in their early 80s [years of age] with uncertain immunisation status who had not recently travelled) had a positive throat swab for toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ and reported a history of mild coryzal symptoms. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that strains from the index case and contact had sequence type 463. Diphtheria is extremely rare in the UK due to high vaccine coverage, and this is the first documented transmission in 30 years. Clinicians and laboratory staff should remain highly suspicious of lesions in overseas travellers, even when patients are fully vaccinated. Older individuals who might not have completed a full immunisation course may have higher diphtheria susceptibility.

Introduction
-----------
Diphtheria is a disease caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ and, in some cases, also by _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ bacteria [1]. It is transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. The early signs of respiratory diphtheria are sore throat, loss of appetite, and slight fever with classic symptoms including the development of a white (turning to grey) membrane in the throat and on the tonsils [2]. Severe cases of diphtheria may develop a swollen neck and obstructed airway. Cutaneous diphtheria lesions can be highly variable, including presentation as painful ulcers covered with a dark pseudomembrane, serous oozing lesions, or dry, nearly healed scaly lesions [3].

Infection with toxigenic diphtheria is rare in the UK; in 2016, there were 6 cases infected with toxigenic strains of corynebacteria reported in England: 4, _C. diphtheriae_; 2, _C. ulcerans_ [4]. Diphtheria vaccination is highly effective, and immunisation coverage of the UK population remains high [5,6]. A review of UK diphtheria cases between 1986 and 2008 found the majority had mild infections with the affected individuals either only being partially immunised or fully immunised adults with waning immunity [7]. Sero-epidemiological studies have demonstrated waning immunity among adults in the UK and other Western European countries, although this is not likely to present a risk of widespread disease re-emergence [2].

In February 2017, the PHE East of England Health Protection Team, which conducts local disease surveillance and outbreak investigations, was advised that a potentially toxigenic isolate of _C. diphtheriae_ had been isolated from a cutaneous lesion of an East of England resident. This article summarises the public health investigations and actions taken, and discusses their implications for future diphtheria outbreak investigations and policy.

"_Corynebacterium diphtheriae__ is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus with 3 biotypes -- gravis, intermedius, and mitis. _C. diphtheriae_ causes respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications -- myocarditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (e.g., paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans.

"Either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_ can cause cutaneous diphtheria. Cutaneous diphtheria due to toxigenic strains is endemic in tropical countries and has been responsible for infections in travelers to these countries, even in those who are vaccinated. In the United States, cutaneous diphtheria has been most often associated with homeless persons [poor sanitation, poverty, and crowded living conditions] and the organisms isolated from recent cases were nontoxigenic (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by skin ulcers, which are usually chronic and may become coinfected with other pathogens such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_. Cutaneous diphtheria is uncommonly complicated by toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations.

"Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

"Cutaneous diphtheria is treated with erythromycin or penicillin for 14 days. The disease is usually not contagious 48 hours after starting antibiotics. Elimination of the organism should be documented by 2 consecutive negative cultures after therapy is completed. Management of contacts of cutaneous diphtheria should include screening for possible respiratory or cutaneous diphtheria and obtaining nasopharyngeal cultures for _C. diphtheriae_. For close contacts, especially household contacts, a diphtheria booster, appropriate for age, is given. Contacts should also receive antibiotics -- benzathine penicillin G or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin. Identified carriers in the community should also receive antibiotics. However, if the strain is shown to be nontoxigenic, the CDC recommends that investigation of contacts can be discontinued (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Since 1980, cutaneous diphtheria is not a nationally reportable disease (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt01-dip.html)." - Mod.ML
