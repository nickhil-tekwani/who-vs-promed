West Nile Virus Activity - United States: Wed 16 to Tue 22 Jun 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Human cases
-----------
As of Tue 22 Jun 2004, 7 states reported a total of 32 human cases of West
Nile virus (WNV) illness to CDC through ArboNET. Twenty cases were reported
from Arizona, 6 cases from California, 2 cases from Florida, and one case
each from Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 23 (72 percent)
of the cases occurred in males; the median age of patients was 52 years
(range: 9 to 78 years), and dates of illness onset ranged from 8 May to 7
Jun 2004. 16 (50 percent) of the patients had neuroinvasive WNV illness, 14
(44 percent) had West Nile fever, and 2 (6 percent) had clinically
unspecified illness.
[Since the previous ArboNET report for the period Wed 9 to Tue 15 Jun 2004,
the number of human cases has increased from 14 to 32 and the number of
states reporting cases from 5 to 7: the new states being Florida (2) and
Nebraska (1). Arizona leads with 20 cases (up from 10) followed by
California with 6 (up from 1). - Mod.CP]
Blood Donors
------------
A total of 13 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors have been reported
to ArboNET. Of these, 12 were reported from Arizona, and one was reported
from New Mexico. Of the 13 donors reported to ArboNET, one person aged 69
years subsequently had neuroinvasive illness, and 3 persons aged 22, 51,
and 52 years had West Nile fever.
[Since the previous report the number of WNV-positive blood donors has
increased by one (in Arizona). - Mod.CP]
Birds and Equines
-----------------
During 2004, a total of 616 dead corvids and 58 other dead birds with WNV
infection have been reported from 20 states, and 17 WNV infections in
horses have been reported from 6 states (Alabama, Arizona, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia).
[In addition one seropositive sentinel horse was reported from Puerto Rico:

20040620.1644. - Mod.CP]
Sentinel Chickens and Mosquitoes
--------------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 65 sentinel chicken flocks from 4
states (Arizona, California, Florida, and Louisiana). A total of 129
WNV-positive mosquito pools have been reported from 8 states (Arizona,
California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas).

Georgia: Unpredicted Consequence of Mosquito Control
----------------------------------------------------
Moss-draped live oaks, which comprise the city's lush, green canopy, are
being attacked by tiny insects that are turning the trees' eaves a sickly
brown. City officials noticed the Kermes scale outbreak about 4 weeks ago,
and the suspected culprit is the city's battle against mosquitoes. Heavy
aerial spraying last year, in response to the West Nile virus scare, killed
off small, parasitic wasps that normally feed on the insects. "These scale
have always been around, but it's more of an epidemic this year," said
Savannah Park and Tree Director David White. Kermes scale typically spend
their entire life on an oak and limit their feeding to upper branch tips,
but in some areas of the city, they have infested large portions of the
oaks. Such outbreaks rarely kill mature live oaks, though they do stunt
tree growth and make branches weak. Saplings are the most susceptible to death.
"It could be a number of things going on, and that is why we need to be
careful not to point fingers," said Elmer Gray, public health specialist
for entomology at the University of Georgia. Drought-like conditions this
spring also could have weakened the trees, making them more susceptible to
heavy mosquito spraying. A similar outbreak occurred in Southport, N.C., in
1998 when at least half the city's oaks were infested with Kermes scale.
Eventually, the city's mosquito-control program was found to be the cause.
The city cured the trees by using fire hoses to spray the bugs off the
leaves, then applying horticultural oil. Southport also targeted where it
would spray for mosquitoes and cut its pesticide use by a third.
Chatham County Mosquito Control Director Henry Lewandowski said 2002 and
2003 were busy years for his department. West Nile and equine encephalitis
scares were rife, and heavy rain in March 2003 forced him to order spray
flights in Savannah almost everyday. Although light rain this year has kept
the planes grounded, Lewandowski realizes his department could be the
culpable party in the Kermes scale outbreak. He said he is willing to
change how his department combats the mosquito problem, and he is exploring
the use of horticultural oil on the oaks. Gray acknowledged the difficulty
of balancing mosquito control and the health of live oaks.

Belize: Update on Equine Case(s) of West Nile Virus Infection in 2003
--------------------------------------------------
On 4 Mar 2004, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) published a
report on encephalitis caused by West Nile virus (WNV) detected in a
4-year-old horse from Indian Creek, Orange Walk district, in the northern
part of Belize. On 27 Oct 2003, the affected animal began to develop
symptoms of ataxia, hind-limb paresis, pain, and recumbency. Samples were
sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa,
USA, where tests were carried out for detection of IgM antibodies using
capture- ELISA techniques and neutralization for the diagnosis. The samples
tested positive, with results received on 23 Feb 2004.
Active surveillance detected a total of 4 suspect cases of equine
encephalitis in the following areas: Corozal (1 case in Little Belize),
Orange Walk (1 case in Shipyard and 1 in Blue Creek), and Cayo (1 case in
Lower Barton Creek). 2 cases (the one from Blue Creek and the one from
Barton Creek) turned up positive for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEEV).
The other horse tested negative for WNV and VEEV. The WNV-infected horse
was subsequently euthanized. In Indian Creek, vector-control measures were
carried out, as well as serological screening of horses. Materials were
also prepared for public awareness of the disease. The affected area is
located in a place where private horse ownership is common. There also
exists a history of arbovirus activity being detected (VEEV) in 1996. In
addition, the area is a major habitat for migratory birds.
There has been active surveillance to detect the spread of WNV in Belize
since 2002. That year, 2000 samples were gathered, mainly from the northern
part of the country. In 2003, another 2000 samples were studied from the
southern part of the country. Results were negative in all cases. Given the
results obtained in October 2003, new serological tests were carried out on
birds in the affected area. Since this incident, no additional suspect
cases have been reported in horses, birds, or humans.
