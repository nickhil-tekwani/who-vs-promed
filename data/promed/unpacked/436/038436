The total collapse of the Syrian health infrastructure has led to the spread of diseases, including polio, measles, and now, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).

The most common form of leishmaniasis, CL causes skin lesions and ulcers to develop on the body, very often leaving scars and serious disability to the victim. Also known as the "Aleppo Boil," the disease is reportedly spreading in the rural areas of ISIS-controlled Syria.

"As a result of abominable acts by ISIS that included the killing of innocent people and dumping their corpses in the streets, this is the leading factor behind the rapid spread of leishmaniasis disease," said Dilqash Isa, head of the Kurdish Red Crescent, to the Kurdish media network
Rudaw [see comment below].

Leishmaniasis in Syria is unfortunately not new. Previous to the civil war in Syria, CL was a documented yet well-controlled disease -- since the outbreak of war it has increased 10-fold. Syria currently has the highest estimated case counts of CL in the world.

The Syrian Ministry of health recorded 41 000 cases in the 1st 2 quarters of 2013 alone. It is currently unknown how many cases exist in the region.

CL is caused when the Leishmania parasites are transmitted by the bite of infected sandflies.

Lack of doctors and drugs
--------
In Syria, according to the World Health Organization, at least 160 doctors have been killed and hundreds of others have been jailed as of [2014]. Additionally, there has been an emigration of an estimated 80 000 doctors. Health officials estimate that the availability of pharmaceuticals that are locally produced has been reduced to only 10 percent of the previous stockpile -- a major shortage of necessary medications.

"Rather than providing a safe place of care and refuge, the Syrian health care system has been integrated into the civil war battlefield," writes the authors of a 2014 paper published in PLOS: Pathogens. "The shattered medical infrastructure, the exodus of health care workers, and the deterioration of immunization programs have created a dangerous vacuum in essential health care provision."

The threat of diseases like CL poses a danger to other countries as well -- as untreated refugees seek shelter in neighboring nations, the disease spreads. Before 2008 there had been no cases of CL in Lebanon; by 2013 there had been 1033 cases confirmed. Of those infected, 96.6 percent were Syrian refugees.

[ProMED has previously posted information on the increasing number of cases of cutaneous leishmanaisis in both government- and ISIS-controlled areas (see below). The spread of the disease into neighboring countries -- especially Turkey-- has also been reported, but the data from Syria are new.

Contrary to the report above, it is not correct that leishmanaisis can be spread by corpses. The sandflies become infected from feeding on rodents (the main reservoir) and infected people. Sandflies do not feed on corpses, but the unhygienic conditions increase the breeding of sandflies; at the same time the population of the rodent reservoir is expanding, increasing transmission.

The exodus of physicians as described here and the lack of drugs further emphasize the magnitude of the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. - Mod.EP
