An additional 40 people have been identified with signs and symptoms consistent with salmonellosis -- this time in Davie County.

The Davidson County and Davie County health departments this week began working with the NC Division of Public Health to investigate a gastrointestinal illness outbreak among patrons of a local restaurant. As of Tue 23 Jun 2015, the health departments had identified more than 30 individuals in Davidson County with signs and symptoms consistent with salmonellosis. On Wed 24 Jun 2015, the investigation expanded to include 40 additional people in Davie County.

Health officials said all people with symptoms ate at Tarheel Q, located in Lexington, several days before becoming ill. At least 7 of the individuals had to be hospitalized due to their illness.

Every year, salmonella is estimated to cause 1 million illnesses in the USA, with 19 000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths, according to the CDC. Most persons infected with salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, for some, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.
