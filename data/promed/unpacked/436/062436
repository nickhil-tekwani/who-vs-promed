Vets say toxin likely killed 21 horses at Florida polo match
------------------------------------------------------------
The sudden death of 21 polo horses in Florida may have been caused by a
toxin that has yet to be identified by tests and could have been in the
animals' feed, vitamins or supplements, veterinarians said on Monday [20
Apr 2009]. The horses from the Venezuelan-owned team Lechuza Caracas became
ill just before a tournament on Sunday [19 Apr 2009], collapsing and dying
on the scene or while being treated at vet clinics or transported,
officials said.

Dr Scott Swerdlin, a veterinarian at Palm Beach Equine Clinic near the polo
grounds, treated one of the sick horses. He said it appeared that the
animals died of heart failure caused by some kind of toxin that could have
been in tainted food, vitamins, or supplements or some combination of all 3
that caused a toxic reaction. [Oleander is common in Florida and contains a
cardiac glycoside. Oleander could also have been baled in hay. - Mod.TG]

"A combination of something with an error in something that was given to
these horses caused this toxic reaction," Swerdlin told reporters. It may
take days or weeks to get the results of toxicology tests that could
identify the toxin, he said.

Another veterinarian who was at the scene said something triggered heart
failure among the horses. "Well clearly, it's an intoxication, clearly
there's some sort of a poison," Dr James Belden told NBC's "Today Show."

The team is owned by Venezuelan businessman Victor Vargas but most of the
horses and players are Argentine, Swerdlin said. The team travels most of
the year. Swerdlin said the team has up to 60 horses. All of those who fell
sick have died, he said.

The Lechuza Caracas horses were being unloaded from their trailers Sunday
afternoon when 2 collapsed and others acted dizzy and disoriented,
according to the International Polo Club Palm Beach. 7 horses died at the
scene and the rest while being treated elsewhere or en route to medical
care. [Although it is not likely, carbon monoxide in an enclosed trailer
could be a possibility, but it does not explain the other horses or other
trailers. - Mod.TG]

The polo grounds in Wellington, a wealthy equestrian and golfing community
in central Palm Beach County in Florida, hosts the US Open every year. John
Wash, the polo club's president of club operations, told reporters Monday
that doctors had ruled out any sort of airborne infection. "This was an
isolated incident involving that one team," Wash said. [If this team was
stabled in one barn, then I cannot see how they can rule out airborne
exposure. - Mod.TG] "This was devastating," he said. "It was heartbreaking
to see that many horses to get sick all at once."

Veterinarians already at the event quickly tried treating the horses,
inserting intravenous lines and trying to cool them down with fans and
water. Observers hung blue tarps to shield some of the horses from the
crowd's view. [It is unclear if the heat mentioned here is because of
ambient temperature, or if the horse's temperature was rising. If the
temperature of the animal was rising then it may provide a clue to the
potential toxicant, possibily an uncoupler of oxidation phosphorylation? -
Mod.TG]

The match in the US Open Polo Championship was postponed and an exhibition
game with a substitute team was held in its place.

The carcasses of at least 14 horses were taken to a state agricultural
laboratory for necropsies to learn the causes of their deaths. Wash said
these types of horses can be worth from USD 10 000 to USD 200 000 each. He
also said that because doctors had ruled out an infection, the games will
resume on Wednesday [22 Apr 2009].

[Cocaine has been known to produce clinical signs similar to the ones
described here. I would hope that the pathologist posting these animals
collects urine in addition to a full set of tissues for toxicology testing.
Urine can be used for drug testing/confirmation. - Mod.TG]
