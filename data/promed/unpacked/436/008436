Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Jim Logan in Riverton said this week the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) outbreak has now been documented throughout the state.

The disease is manifested primarily in horses, but also cattle and other hooved animals, he said. The signs include slobbering and blisters that pop and break open leading to a raw open sore on the tongue, lips and sometimes on the coronary band above the hooves of horses and in the udder and genital area of cattle and other hooved animals, including sheep, pigs and goats. The signs can also appear on the muzzle and inside the ears of horses.

Animals with the disease can lose weight because it is painful for them to eat, or they can become lame.

"It was 1st noted clear back in May [2015] in Texas, then Colorado, and from there the next cases were noted in Arizona and then Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming. Since then, other cases have been noted in Nebraska and South Dakota," he said. "The 1st cases in Wyoming were in a horse in Goshen County. It was then found in Laramie County, then Platte and Sublette counties. It bounced around and was also noted in Albany, Fremont, Converse and Natrona counties."

Logan said flies and biting midges are the main vectors, or carriers, of the VSV. The virus is also spread through direct contact with infected livestock and indirectly through contact with contaminated equipment and tack. Fly control is the most important step in preventing the disease.

Wyoming's most recent outbreaks of VSV were in 2005 and 2006, according to the Wyoming Livestock Board. Nearly all of the affected equines during those years were pastured along drainages or had very recent history of exposure to low-lying, riparian areas. "We advise livestock owners, if possible, to move their healthy animals to higher, dryer ground until the VSV insect vector season subsides. That is generally after 2 hard frosts," according to a news release from the Livestock Board.

"Once it gets established in a county, it will be there until the biting midges and flies go away when it gets cold, and hopefully that will be soon," Logan said.

In Fremont County, Logan said 20 different locations are under quarantine for the disease that is impacting a total of some 100-125 animals. "Not that many are affected, probably only one or 2 per site, but the healthy animals where there is one with the virus are all being quarantined." According to a local equestrian who did not want to be identified for fear of losing business, one horse in their herd had gotten the disease, but none others. "I know quite a few folks who have horses with the VSV but haven't reported it," the source said. Logan agreed. "Livestock owners are supposed to report this, but I suspect many don't for whatever reason."

Logan, reading from a state livestock board memo, said "VSV is particularly significant because it is clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease, and vesicular exanthema of swine, all serious foreign animal diseases (FAD). Because of similarities to these FADs, it is essential to quickly confirm a diagnosis with laboratory testing. Of the vesicular diseases, VSV is the only one that affects horses, and the presence of lesions is suggestive of VS."

Cases of VSV should be immediately reported to the Wyoming State Veterinarian at 307-857-4140 or to the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services' Wyoming Office at 307-432-7960.

[While this disease does tend to resemble foot and mouth disease (FMD), it must be remembered that FMD does not occur in horses.

Nevertheless, out of caution, it is likely that other states will slam their doors shut regarding animals from Wyoming. This is expected. However, and fortunately, most animals heal within approximately 3 weeks.

If you are planning on moving animals out of Wyoming, please check with the state of destination for regulations. - Mod.TG
