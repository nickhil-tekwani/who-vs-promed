[The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation", June 2018 (see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/June_GMR2018_01.pdf), notes that: "Four independent FMD events involving cattle, occurred between [19 May-6 Jun 2018] respectively at Anhui, Shanxi, Hubei, and Guizhou. The outbreaks were all caused by FMDV serotype O. In all cases, the Lanzhou National Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (OIE reference laboratory) carried out the diagnosis using gene sequencing and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For none of the outbreaks was it possible to identify the source of infection. The control measures that were in general adopted were movement control inside the country, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), while no treatment is being provided to the affected animals."

A summary of the animals involved and location of outbreaks are available in the same EuFMD June 2018 report.

In July 2018, 2 events of FMDV serotype O were also reported in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces; see reports below. - Mod.CRD
