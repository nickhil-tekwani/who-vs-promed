A state of alarm has broken out in several schools in the tourist resort area of B치varo-Punta Cana, in this province [La Altagracia], by an outbreak of skin disease that is presumed to be contagious. Children in different schools in the tourist destination have been infected by a kind of fungus in the skin that has caused panic among residents and managers of schools. Such is the case at the Cabeza de Toro elementary school.

The picture presented by these infants ranges from pustules, fungal [?], rash, constant itching, redness, and scabies. The situation has caused alarm and concern among the parents of the students, who fear that this will get out of control and call for the assistance of the public health authorities. For several weeks, locals have been taking their children to medical centers, where they are only prescribed drugs that temporarily calm the discomfort, but do not cure the skin problem.

La Altagracia is the easternmost province of the Dominican Republic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Altagracia_Province). The coastline is a series of beaches with megaresorts starting from Cabeza de Toro in the north to Punta Cana in the south. B치varo was originally developed as a town for resort workers, but is now the center of services with shopping malls, fast-food stores, drug stores, restaurants, banks, clinics, workshops, supermarkets, and schools. A map of this area can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B치varo#/media/File:Mappuntacana.jpg.

The news report describes a contagious, very itchy rash that is occurring in schoolchildren in B치varo-Punta Cana. Fever is not mentioned as one of the clinical findings. 3 non-febrile possibilities include scabies, impetigo, and ringworm. Scabies is an intensely itchy, contagious rash caused by an infestation with mites (_Sarcoptes scabiei_) that burrow into the upper layer of skin. Scabies is transmitted person-to-person by direct skin-to-skin contact. Small red papules, blisters, and red burrows appear on the wrists, between the fingers and toes, arms, and on skin covered by clothes. Scabies can spread in crowded places like childcare facilities.

Impetigo also is a highly contagious skin infection caused by group A streptococci or _Staphylococcus aureus_. An itchy red, crusted rash on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, spreads to the rest of the body. Impetigo mainly affects infants and children.

Ringworm is a common skin infection caused by fungi (species of _Trichophyton_, _Microsporum_, and _Epidermophyton_) that live on skin and surfaces such as clothing, towels, and bedding. It is acquired by contact with someone who has ringworm or with contaminated surfaces. Ringworm appears as a circular red, scaly, itchy rash that is associated with bald spots when it occurs on the scalp.

There may be multiple etiologic agents at play that include, in addition to the above, contact dermatitis, allergies, eczema, and scratching induced by witnessing others with rashes in some of the children.

ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information from knowledgeable sources about this outbreak. - Mod.ML]
