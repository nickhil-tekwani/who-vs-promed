Resurgence of malaria in the suburbs of Dakar
---------------------------------------------
At the end of winter, malaria is reappearing in certain districts of
the suburbs of Dakar. At the health center, Dominic Pikine, 13 813
cases were recorded between July and October 2010. This disease is at
the top for consultation in this center.

According to the head doctor, Dr. Dia Marieme Ndiaye, at the Dominic
Pikine health center, although many people sleep under a mosquito
net, they spend a lot of time outdoors during the night, when the
mosquito that transmits the disease starts to bite at 1 o'clock in
the morning. Yesterday [4 Nov 2010], she received a team of French
and Senegalese journalists, as part of a field trip organized by the
National Programme to Fight Against and the Roll Back Malaria.

Dr. Ndiaye has explained that the period from July to October, 50
percent of suspected cases of malaria were recorded positive. Of the
patients 87 percent are aged 5 years or more, 11 percent under 5
years, and 1.25 percent are pregnant women. However, no deaths have
been noted. All patients were treated on the spot, because drugs are
available in quantity.

After Dominique, the journalists visited the health post at Deggo, a
few kilometers from here. Patients are lying on the ground because of
severe pain. A young patient suffers fever like other patients, along
with his mother, who get an annoyed glance from the health post chief
nurse, Ms Fatou Ndiaye Koba. The nurse seems overwhelmed, but takes
time to watch everyone.

"We welcome more than 250 patients per day, whereas we are only 2
nurses. We're really overwhelmed," she says. More than 50 percent of
patients suffer from malaria. "Every month we receive 6000 patients
with more than 2000 suffering from malaria. We are overwhelmed by
this disease at the end of winter," said Ndiaye.

[Malaria is endemic in the southern parts of Senegal, but so far the
prevalence in Dakar has been regarded as low. The increasing number
of cases are in contrast to a recent study using satellite mapping of
Dakar, which concluded that "the results indicated there are benefits
of urbanization in Dakar, since the proportion of the low risk
population increased while urbanization progressed" (Machault V et
al. Malar J. 2010 Sep 3;9:252).

Another recent study from Dakar found that severe malaria was found
as much in adults and in children, showing that transmission in Dakar
is not high enough to induce clinical immunity (Bob et al. PLoS One.
2010 Mar 23;5(3):e9817). A 3rd study found that "malaria transmission
was highly focal in Dakar" and the The Human Biting Rate ranged from
0.1 bites per person per night in Yoff Village to 43.7 in Almadies
(Machault V et al. Malar J. 2009 Jun 24;8:138). - Mod.EP]
