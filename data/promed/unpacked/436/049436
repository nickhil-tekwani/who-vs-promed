[The current final confirmation of LPAI in Sri Lanka -- the 1st of its kind -- was preceded by 2 earlier media-based ProMED-mail posts. Initially, LPAI was suspected and information requested; later, the diagnosis was apparently denied. Sri-Lanka's OIE reporting performance is exemplary; the report covering the 1st 6 months of 2011 was submitted during July 2011.

The OIE notification includes an interactive map showing the location of the event. - Mod.AS
