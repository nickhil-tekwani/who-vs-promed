Hawke's Bay District Health Board [HBDHB] is warning about an outbreak of listeriosis in Hawke's Bay. 4 people have been diagnosed with listeriosis; 2 of those, who were elderly and immuno-compromised, have subsequently died, and 2 have recovered.

Samples of ready-to-eat meats supplied to the hospital have tested positive to _Listeria_. All of the hospital's supplied ready-to-eat meat has since been quarantined, and the results are now part of an investigation into the source of the outbreak, he said.

Director of Public Health Caroline McElnay said listeriosis has a long incubation period of up to several weeks. Dr McElnay said listeriosis is very rare, and there are only about 25 cases a year in New Zealand. The disease is only dangerous to pregnant women, their babies, the elderly, and people with a lowered immune system. Almost all other people are not harmed by it.

The outbreak served as a warning for anyone who was immuno-compromised, elderly, or pregnant to be very aware of food safety. People at high risk should not eat ready-to-eat foods like soft cheeses made with pasteurised and unpasteurised milk, processed meat and poultry [The relatively high moisture content of soft cheeses favors proliferation of _Listeria_ even at refrigeration temperatures. The ubiquitous nature of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in the environment means that contamination of soft cheeses may occur at any point post-pasteurization.]. If high-risk people develop flu like symptoms such as a mild fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, aches and pains, or a mild cough or cold, they should seek medical advice.

How did _Listeria_ get into food at the hospital? The food samples were all pre-packaged ready-to-eat meat, which is supplied to the hospital by an external provider. The Ministry for Primary Industries is making further enquiries.

How does HBDHB ensure food is safe? As part of the hospital's food safety programme, Nutrition and Food Services only purchases from approved suppliers. For a medium to high-risk product like cooked meat, this means that suppliers must have an NZ Food Safety Authority approved food safety or risk management programme in place. HBDHB's kitchen has a Certificate of Registration from Hastings District Council, which was achieved with "excellence" from 31 Mar 2012 until 31 Mar 2013. High-risk foods are restricted to [sic] certain at risk groups, e.g. ante-natal patients.

Did listeriosis cause the deaths of these 2 people? It appears that listeriosis was the cause of death in at least one of these patients, and in the other patient, it probably was a contributing factor. Both patients were immuno-compromised.

What action has HBDHB taken? "As part of our investigation, the hospital kitchens were inspected and food samples taken. We withdrew all pre-packaged ready-to-eat meats from the kitchen on Tue 10 Jul 2012 and reviewed our internal processes. These samples of ready-to-eat meats from the kitchen have now tested positive to _Listeria_. The Ministry for Primary Industries is making further inquiries regarding the source of _Listeria_ infection. We are informing the public now in order to raise awareness about the ever-present risk of listeriosis to vulnerable patients."

Has anyone else gotten sick from listeriosis and been hospitalised? There have been no other hospitalised cases or further notifications in Hawke's Bay.

What has happened to the food that has tested positive? "We have withdrawn it."

In New Zealand, around 25 cases occur annually. Of those, about 20 percent are associated with pregnancy or newborn babies.

[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in the 4 prior ProMED-mail posts this year (2012) on a nosocomial outbreak in Northern Ireland: Listeriosis - UK (04): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120517.1136357;
Listeriosis - UK (03): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, background 20120420.1107753; Listeriosis - UK (02): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, comment 20120418.1105643;
and Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822.

The news report above confirms that _Listeria_ has been cultured from samples of ready-to-eat meats supplied to the hospital from an outside vendor. Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the cases with each other and with those of strains isolated from the ready-to-eat meats would help to establish whether a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source.

The pre-packaged ready-to-eat meats were withdrawn from the hospital's kitchen on 10 Jul 2012. However, the incubation period for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days, with the median incubation period being 3 weeks. Although there have been no new cases since 29 Jun 2012, with such a long incubation period, we may continue to see more cases of listeriosis for at least the next several weeks.
