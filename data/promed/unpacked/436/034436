Rare virus poses new threat to troops
-------------------------------------
US military officials sent a medical team to a remote outpost in southern
Afghanistan this week [week of 2 Nov 2009] to take blood samples from
members of an Army unit after a soldier in the unit died from an Ebola-like
[that is, hemorrhagic fever] virus [infection]. Dr Jim Radike, an expert in
internal medicine and infectious diseases at the Role 3 Trauma Hospital at
Kandahar Air Field, told The Washington Times that a 22 year old sergeant
from River Falls, Alabama, died on 16 Sep 2009 from what turned out to be
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] after he was bitten by a tick. The
virus is transmitted by infected blood and can be carried by ticks,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr
Radike, who is with the Navy, said the medical team "will be taking blood
samples and the results may take several weeks to get back." He called it
"a precautionary measure." Dr Radike did not say how many individuals would
be tested or why the military had waited until now to act. The unit
involved is the 5th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry division, A-Company 2-1
Infantry.

Dr Radke said the [CCHF] hemorrhagic fever is similar to Ebola [hemorrhagic
fever] "in that the end there is internal degeneration and external
bleeding. From the Black Sea to upper Turkey, you'll see a dozen or more
cases a year. Afghanistan falls right in the middle." The disease was first
reported in the Crimea in 1944, then in the Congo in 1956, according to the
World Health Organization. An outbreak was reported 8 years ago in Quetta,
the capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan province, which borders Afghanistan.

Symptoms of CCHF include sudden fever, dizziness, neck pain, aching
muscles, soreness in the eyes, and sensitivity to light. Early on, nausea,
vomiting, and sore throat occur. The virus incubation period depends on how
the virus was acquired. If the infection is via tick bite, the incubation
period is roughly 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days, Dr Radike said. If
the illness is not caught early, it is often fatal, he said. The mortality
rate is 30 per cent, according to CDC.

Lt Col Jeffrey French, the sergeant's battalion commander, told The Times
from Forward Operating Base Ramrod, to the west of Kandahar City, that the
soldier's death "was a tragic loss for everyone." It started out as a small
bite on the foot, Col French said.
