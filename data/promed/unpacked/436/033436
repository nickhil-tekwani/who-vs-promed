Nebraska Beef, Ltd, an Omaha, Nebraska, establishment is recalling
approximately 531 707 pounds (241.2 tonnes) of ground beef components
that may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, the USA Department
of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS)
announced today [30 Jun 2008].

The following products subject to recall include:

The problem was discovered by FSIS through traceback investigations
and ground beef samples collected from 2 federally inspected
establishments positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7, as well as multiple
samples of Kroger brand ground beef positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7,
with matching pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. FSIS
is continuing its investigation into any products that may be
contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 or that are associated with
illnesses and will take appropriate action when necessary.

Kroger brand ground beef samples were collected by the Michigan and
Ohio Departments of Agriculture and Health from patients in Michigan
and Ohio. Nebraska Beef, Ltd, was identified as a common supplier to
those stores in addition to 2 federally inspected establishments
where FSIS obtained a positive ground beef sample that was matched to
the outbreak strain identified in Michigan and Ohio.

The epidemiological investigations and a case control study conducted
by the Michigan and Ohio Departments of Agriculture and Health and
the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) determined
that there is an association between the ground beef products and 35
illnesses reported in Michigan (17) and Ohio (18). The illnesses were
linked through the epidemiological investigation and by their PFGE
pattern, or DNA fingerprint, found in PulseNet, a database maintained
by the CDC.

Also as a result of the investigation, on 25 Jun 2008 FSIS announced
a recall of ground beef products sold at Kroger retail establishments
in Michigan and Central and Northwestern Ohio Kroger retail
establishments.

[The list of recalled beef products is partially reproduced to
illustrate the multiple "cuts" of beef coming out of the production
line and how many of them are secondarily processed so there is no
clear way of identifying the "beef of concern." A "smoking burger"
has been found, that is, the Kroger ground beef has yielded the
outbreak strain. Although distribution of the more than half million
pounds of beef was widespread, all cases, to this point, have
occurred in Michigan and Ohio. - Mod.LL]
