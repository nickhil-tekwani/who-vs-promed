Suspected Ebola Case Reported in Tanzania
------------------------------------------
By Ongeri John - Dar es Salaam
Initial unconfirmed reports on possible Ebola cases first surfaced on
Sunday [5 Nov 2000, with Kagera's regional medical office reporting one
suspected Ebola case at Kanyigo Clinic on Monday.
National health permanent secretary Mariam Mwaffisi confirmed that
government had dispatched a team of experts to Kagera, on Tanzania's border
with Uganda, after unconfirmed reports that an Ebola patient was admitted
to Kanyigo Clinic. The clinic serves the heavily populated Muleba Rural
District.
"We dispatched the task-team the moment we received initial reports, but
want to caution people that last time we had a reported Ebola case it
turned out to be nothing more than a serious malaria infection," said Mwaffisi.
A Kagera Clinic official in Tanzania, who refused to be named, told African
Eye News Service (South Africa) telephonically on Tuesday that the
suspected Ebola victim was a frequent business traveller between Tanzania
and Uganda's southern districts.

indistinguishable from an infection with Ebola virus. We await laboratory
studies. - Man. Ed. DS
