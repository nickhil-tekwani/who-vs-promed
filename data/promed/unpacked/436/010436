German investigators believe Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a new deadlier, slow-acting form of Novichok, according to a report.

Navalny, 44, was roused from an induced coma in Berlin this week after falling ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on 20 Aug 2020. He has been able to talk, but it is unclear whether he will suffer from long-term nerve damage.

Germany's chemical weapons laboratory in Munich is certain it found Novichok in samples of Navalny's blood, urine, skin and a bottle he was drinking from. [Previously it was reported he drank from a cup, specifically tea from a cup, not a bottle. - Mod.TG]

The compound is a slow-acting form of the nerve agent used against Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the Salisbury attack in 2018, German paper Die Zeit reported.

The new structure of the nerve agent, originally formulated by Soviet chemists in the 1970s, is believed to have been previously unknown to Western agencies.

What is Novichok and how does it kill?
The Novichok family of nerve agents were secretly developed over 2 decades at a research facility 50 miles [80.5 km] outside the Russian capital.

Many times more potent than other better known chemical weapons, Novichok agents can render gas masks and protective equipment useless.

Sometimes described as "gases" they are in fact liquid, intended to be delivered as a fine spray.

A series of poisons, known as Novichok 5, 7, 8 and 9 to identify them, were produced amid conditions of complete secrecy.

They all kill the same way -- by inhibiting enzymes controlling nerve receptors in the brain.

One expert said victims simply "forget to breathe." A tiny drop, almost undetectable, placed on the skin or inhaled can cause death within minutes.

It is believed that an agent tailing Navalny slipped the poison into his drink at the airport, believing he would fall severely ill on his plane with no chance of survival at 30 000 ft [9.1 km].

After Navalny fell ill, the aircraft made an emergency landing in Omsk, and he was rushed to hospital in the Siberian city.

The following weekend he was airlifted to Berlin, where doctors at the Charite treated him with the antidote atropine and kept him in a medically induced coma.

The hospital said in an initial statement last week clinical tests "indicate poisoning with a substance from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors," which are used in medicines and insecticides but also in nerve agents.

[Nerve agents are a class of chemicals designed to block the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages. The disruption is caused by the blocking of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme catalyzing the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. The acetylcholine builds up, causing the nerve to continue to fire, thus constantly stimulating a muscle or organ.

When exposed to a low dose of nerve agent, causing minor poisoning, characteristic symptoms are increased production of saliva, a runny nose, and a feeling of pressure on the chest. The pupil of the eye becomes contracted (miosis), which impairs night-vision. The accommodation capacity of the eye is also reduced so that short-range vision deteriorates, and the victim feels pain when trying to focus on an object nearby. This is accompanied by headache. More nonspecific symptoms are tiredness, slurred speech, hallucinations, and nausea.

Exposure to a higher dose leads to a more dramatic development, and symptoms are more pronounced. Bronchoconstriction and secretion of mucus in the respiratory system lead to difficulty in breathing and coughing. Discomfort in the gastrointestinal tract may develop into cramps and vomiting. Involuntary discharge of urine and defecation may also form part of the picture. The discharge of saliva is powerful, and the victim may experience runny eyes and sweating. Symptoms from the skeletal muscles are very typical. If the poisoning is moderate, this may express itself as muscular weakness, local tremors, or convulsions.

When exposed to a high dose of a nerve agent, the muscular symptoms are more pronounced. The victim may suffer convulsions and lose consciousness. To some extent, the poisoning process may be so rapid that earlier mentioned symptoms may never have time to develop.

Muscular paralysis caused by nerve agents also affects the respiratory muscles. Nerve agents also affect the respiratory center of the central nervous system. The combination of these 2 effects is the direct cause of death. Consequently, death caused by nerve agents is a kind of death by suffocation.

However, the Novichok agents seem to affect the victim much more quickly than any of the previously mentioned agents.

This article mentions that a slower-acting form of Novichok was used. If it is slower acting, perhaps it would not be recognized for what it really is? Or perhaps it is formulated like a time-release drug? I am unclear how this agent has been modified, or if it has been.
