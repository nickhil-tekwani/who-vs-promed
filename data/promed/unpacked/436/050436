Toxocariasis, Kemerovo region
------------------------
[Roundworms of the genus _Toxocara_, which cause toxocariasis, have] been
discovered in sandboxes in children's playgrounds.
Several cases of toxocariasis, which can be transmitted in the feces of dogs
and cats, have been diagnosed in the city of Novokuznezk in the Kemerovo
region. Parasitologists investigated the sand and dirt near the kindergarten
and did not discover anything suspicious. When the physicians from the
Sanitary Epidemiology Surveillance Center investigated the backyards of
childrenÂ´s homes, they found eggs of Toxocara. The symptoms of the disease
they produce are non-specific, including fever and malaise.
Physicians recommend that adults make sure children wash their hands
carefully, and wash fruits and vegetables bought in the market, because they
can also carry infection.

[_Toxocara canis_ and _T. cati_ are widespread in temperate climates, but
clinically apparent infection is rare. Dogs and cats are the main hosts,
and the eggs are shed in feces, where they can stay alive for months in the
environment. The clinical picture for humans is called "visceral larval
migrans," which has unspecific symptoms; occasionally eye symptoms may
result when the worm is located in the eye. The active infection is always
followed by a rise in total IgE and eosinophils. - Mod.EP]
[For the interested reader, there are many other parasitic infections which
dogs have been documented to transmit to humans, including _Trichuris
vulpis_, _Ancylostoma braziliense_, _A. caninum_, _Uncinaria stenocephala_,
_Taenia (Multiceps) multiceps_, & even a case report of transmission of
_Strongyloides stercoralis_. Dogs can also serve as reservoirs of parasites
such as _Dirofilaria immitis_ and _Leishmania_ species that can be
transmitted to humans via arthropods. - Mod. DS]
[To which can be added babesiosis & ehrlichiosis. Cats can transmit many of
the same parasitic diseases, plus toxoplasmosis (dangerous to the fetus in
pregnant women) & sporotrichosis -- refs. can be found by searching the
ProMED archives. - Mod-JW]
