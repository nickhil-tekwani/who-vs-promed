The number of cases of children with measles continues to increase in Angola. In the last 3 weeks alone, health authorities have recorded more than 2000 new cases of the disease. The Secretary of State for Health, Pinto de Sousa, promised to intensify the vaccination campaign in the coming days. "The most affected provinces are Bi√©, Cabinda, Cuanza Sul, Huambo and Luanda. Here, the most important thing is to identify the focus", explained Pinto de Sousa.

With the sound of the alarm, the Ministry of Health and strategic partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) mobilized means and human resources to try to bring the measles vaccine to as many children as possible. Felismina Neto, coordinator of the Vaccination Program in Luanda, said that the focus of vaccination is the most critical points, especially in suburban areas.

"Kilamba Kiaxi has started and is focusing on this vaccination, mainly in the gray areas of the municipality -- in Rasta, Malangino, Golf and other locations. We will continue to vaccinate until the situation is normalized", he guaranteed.

Data from the Ministry of Health indicate that, until 21 Aug 2022, more than 1.5 million children under 5 years of age were vaccinated in the 8 target provinces. It is equivalent to a coverage of about 92%.

[Measles is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the measles virus. This disease spreads easily as airborne respiratory droplets from infected persons when coughing or sneezing and can be fatal to small children. Bronchopneumonia, keratoconjunctivitis, and, rarely, encephalitis can be seen in children under one year of age. The disease death rate has declined worldwide due to the measles vaccine, but it is still very serious. Health promotion and community awareness are important to prevent the spread of the disease. - Mod.MA]

Measles outbreak update - Limpopo province
------------------------------------------
As of 31 Oct 2022, the number of measles laboratory-confirmed cases has increased to 12 in the Greater Sekhukhune district, and 2 new measles-positive cases were reported in the Mopani district on 28 Oct 2022, increasing the number of measles cases to 3 within 30 days in the Giyani area. The Giyani area in the Mopani district meets the case definition for the measles outbreak.

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases is awaiting the measles case investigation forms from the Mopani district to update the measles information from the Giyani area. The ages of the measles confirmed cases in the Greater Sekhukhune district ranged from 9 months to 24 years, with 7 males and 5 females. The ages of measles cases in the Mopani district ranged between 2 to 5 years. In the Greater Sekhukhune district, 3 children were fully vaccinated against measles, 7 had unknown measles vaccination histories, and 2 children had not been vaccinated against measles. Of the new cases, none were hospitalised.

Measles patients present with fever, rash, and one or more of these symptoms, cough, red eyes, and runny nose. Complications of measles include pneumonia, diarrhoea, dehydration, encephalitis, blindness and death. Measles complications are severe in malnourished children and those young infants under 2 years of age. Persons of any age who are not vaccinated can catch measles and develop the disease.

Clinicians and caregivers should be on alert for anyone presenting with the above symptoms and signs and check children's road-to-health booklets to ensure measles vaccinations are up to date. Measles vaccines are given routinely at 6 and 12 months of age. It is never too late to vaccinate against measles.

["Limpopo and Greater Sekhukhune District health officials have since started public health response activities with the support of the NICD and the World Health Organisation (WHO).

These activities, according to the NICD, include evaluating medical records to identify missing measles cases, contact tracing, screening for suspected measles and collecting blood and throat swabs for measles diagnostic tests." (https://allafrica.com/stories/202210280154.html)

It also should be noted that measles complications are severe in malnourished children and those infants under the age of 2.

This retrospective descriptive study reviewed measles surveillance data in South Africa for the period 2015 to 2020 to document the epidemiology of measles and the progress made towards meeting the 2020 measles elimination goal. ...

South Africa displays intermittent measles outbreaks approximately 6-yearly interspersed by inter-epidemic periods in which the country meets measles elimination targets. Intense effort is needed to increase vaccine coverage to avoid periodic outbreaks. Enhanced molecular testing of each case will be required as measles incidence declines regionally. - Mod.LK
