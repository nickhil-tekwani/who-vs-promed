Severe leaf blighting due to southern rust has occurred throughout
central and southern Iowa [in early September 2007]. The last severe
outbreak of southern rust in Iowa was in 1999. This disease was
reported in Nebraska and Kansas earlier in the growing season;
however, it was only in mid- to late August [2007] that we started to
notice a few lesions in our field trials. Temperatures and
precipitation in Iowa throughout August [2007] were well above normal
and thus highly favorable for southern rust.
Southern rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia polysora_. Like all
rusts, _P. polysora_ spores are windblown to Iowa from the South.
High humidity and warm temperatures favor the development of the
disease. Under these conditions, new infections can occur every 7
days, resulting in numerous new rust lesions and extensive leaf blighting.
Two types of rust occur on corn. Common rust is widespread each year
in Iowa. Southern rust occurs less frequently. Southern rust can be
distinguished from common rust in 2 ways. Color: common rust spore
pustules are brick red; southern rust spore pustules are bright
orange. Development of lesions/pustules: common rust pustules develop
on both upper and lower leaf surfaces; southern rust pustules develop
predominantly on the upper leaf surfaces.
Southern rust can develop rapidly, resulting in severe and early
senescence and considerable yield loss. In Iowa this year [2007], we
"dodged the bullet." It is unlikely that this southern rust epidemic
will affect yield noticeably since disease development started late
in the grain-fill period. Registered fungicides are effective against
southern rust, but with disease occurring so late in the season, an
application was unnecessary. Fields in which a fungicide application
was made earlier in the growing season are still at risk for southern
rust since fungicides are only effective against foliar pathogens for
14 to 21 days after application.

[_Puccinia polysora_ causes southern rust (also called polysora or
tropical rust) in maize. The fungus occurs in most tropical and
subtropical regions and can cause significant losses of over 50
percent. Southern rust is favoured by warm, humid conditions making
it an important disease in tropical areas.
Infection reduces the photosynthetic ability of the affected leaves
interfering with kernel development. With heavy infections, leaves
may die prematurely, and defoliate from the base up. Therefore
infection before grain fill has been completed is more damaging to
crop yield than infection late in the crop cycle. _P. polysora_ needs
living host tissue for survival and spores are wind dispersed. No
alternate hosts of the fungus are known. Resistant or tolerant ('slow
rusting') varieties are being developed.
Common rust of maize is caused by the related species _Puccinia
sorghi_. The disease is found worldwide in subtropical, temperate,
and highland environments with cooler temperatures and high humidity.
Rust development is much more likely in pre-tassel stage corn,
because a large whorl provides a humid, protected environment, and
young leaf tissue is more susceptible to infection than emerged
leaves. Resistant maize varieties are available. This fungus can also
affect _Oxalis_ species as alternate hosts producing light
orange-coloured pustules, which are another stage of the same fungus.
