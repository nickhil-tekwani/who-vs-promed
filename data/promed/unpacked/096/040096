A suspect case of vesicular disease in cattle
----------------------------------------------
"A suspect case of vesicular disease in cattle is under investigation
at a premises in Surrey.
"Samples have been submitted to the laboratory for testing. At the
present time there is no timescale for results.
"Following Defra's contingency plans, and under the precautionary
principle, a temporary 1km zone has been imposed. This requires a
movement standstill of all ruminants within this zone."

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
[The differential diagnosis of a vesicular disease in cattle in the
UK should include, in addition to foot and mouth disease (FMD),
several other viral diseases such as bluetongue, vesicular
stomatitis, bovine papular stomatitis, bovine virus diarrhoea/mucosal
disease, malignant catarrhal fever and rinderpest. If -- hopefully --
FMD is excluded, bluetongue virus serotype 8 becomes a main suspect.
Laboratory test results are expected the earliest .- Mod.AS]
