Measles hits Romania
--------------------
A measles outbreak in Romania has infected more than 4000 children and
killed 10 others, officials reported on Monday [5 Dec 2005].
The Black Sea port of Constanta has been especially hard hit. So far this
year [2005], more than 1000 children in that city have contracted measles;
more than half of them are younger than one year old.
In response to the outbreak, health minister Eugen Nicolaescu ordered a
hastening of the nation's measles vaccination campaign. He also disbanded
Romania's Center for Disease Control, saying the agency had failed to
coordinate vaccinations and prevent the spread of measles, the Associated
Press (AP) reported.
Nicolaescu said the outbreak occurred because the immunization program had
missed some children. In addition, a shortage of vaccines disrupted
measles, mumps and rubella vaccination schedules this year [2005].
Opposition politicians said the outbreak was caused by the government's
failure to react quickly after the 1st measles cases were detected in March
2005, the AP reported.

[The World Health Organisation Regional Committee for Europe met in
Bucharest, Romania on 12 to 15 Sep 2005 and issued the following statement.
While immunization coverage levels vary widely from country to country,
poor vaccination coverage is by no means limited to the less developed
member states. In 2004, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland,
Turkey, and the United Kingdom reported measles coverage under 85 per cent
for the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1). (WHO target coverage
rate is 95 per cent.) The statistics can also mask differences within
countries, where vulnerable communities, minority groups and remote rural
communities often lack access to immunization. From 17 to 23 Oct 2005, the
WHO Regional Office for Europe is launching an awareness and advocacy
campaign to put immunization back in the spotlight. 6 member states across
the WHO European Region, namely Belarus, Ireland, Italy (South Tyrol
region), Serbia and Montenegro, Tajikistan, and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, will launch the 1st European Immunization Week. The
objective is to increase vaccination coverage by drawing attention to and
increasing awareness of the importance of every child's need and right to
be protected from vaccine-preventable diseases. The focus will be on
activities to reach vulnerable groups.
The number of member states of the EU reporting a measles incidence of less
than one per million population (one criterion for measles elimination) has
increased from 13 in 2001 to 27 (52 per cent) in 2004. The number of
measles cases reported has also declined by 92 per cent over the last
decade, but more than 27 000 cases were still reported in 2004. Measles
outbreaks have occurred during the last 4 years in at least 13 member
states in western, central, and eastern parts of the Region. Almost 50 per
cent of imported measles cases within the European Union (EU) are from
other EU countries. The region is also an important exporter of measles to
the region of the Americas, with 37 per cent of all measles cases imported
into the United States between 1993 and 2001. - Mod.CP]
