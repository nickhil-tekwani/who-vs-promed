Russia: epizootic of rabies in Krasnodar region
-----------------------------------------------
In January 2005, 2 women died from rabies in the Adlersk district of the
city of Sochi in the Krasnodar region. Both of them had been bitten by
domestic puppies. One of victims, a 70-year-old woman, did not seek medical
attention. The other, a 78-year-old woman, received only one vaccination
and refused the follow-up vaccinations. In December of last year [2004],
also in the same district of the city of Sochi, another woman died after
being bitten by a dog. Vaccination of domestic and wild animals is being
carried out now in the foci of this dangerous infection.
Representatives of the State Epidemiological Surveillance Center of the
Krasnodar region believe that the reason for the rapid spread of infection
is the uncontrolled migration of animal vectors of rabies from the Republic
of Abkhazia, where the vaccination and destruction of sick animals has been
neglected.
The Vice-president of the Society of Hunters and Fishers of the Krasnodar
Region, Michael Ivanchenko, on the other hand, believes that the reason for
the outbreak of rabies is a rapid increase in the density of foxes (more
than 4 animals per 1000 hectares). The increase in the fox population has
been caused by a warming of the climate.
In 2004, 140 cases of rabies were recorded among wild animals and pets in
the Krasnodar region, and in January 2005, there have already been 38
cases, stated Murad Muradyan, the Head of the Anti-epizootic group. Across
the whole of the Krasnodar region, and especially in the city of Sochi,
where the situation is most serious, control measures have been initiated.
In Krasnodar city (the administrative center of the Krasnodar region), only
one case of rabies was identified in 2004, involving a domestic dog in a
suburb. Now in January 2005, 2 cases of rabies have been recorded already.
Nonetheless, the population is not taking the situation seriously enough.
The Municipal Veterinary Science, in the past year [2004], vaccinated 16
000 domestic pets, whereas the owners of pets have sought vaccination only
for 1200 pets, despite the fact that inoculations are free-of-charge for
all animals.
