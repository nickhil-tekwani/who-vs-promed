Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 22 Jun 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has announced an additional 4 laboratory-confirmed cases with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The 1st case is a 43-year-old female in the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region who has recovered. The other 3 cases are female health care workers aged 29, 39 and 45 from Taif governorate [Makkah Region] who cared for 2 previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases and were detected as part of the outbreak investigation and contact tracing. Of these 3 cases, 2 were asymptomatic and all 3 tested weakly positive by PCR [polymerase chain reaction].

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 68 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 38 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

2 New Cases of Novel Coronavirus Recorded and 1 Case Passed Away
----------------------------------------------------------------
Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 2 confirmed cases of this virus have been recorded. The 1st case is a 41-year-old Saudi female in Riyadh [Ar Riyad Region], from the contacted people to one of the confirmed cases, but her condition is stable. The 2nd case is a 32-year-old Saudi citizen in the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region, who is suffering from cancer and now at the ICU receiving the proper treatment.

Within the same vein, MOH has announced the death of one case in the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region, who had been previously announced to be infected with this virus and admitted to hospital on [26 Apr 2013] (corresponding to 16th of Jumada Al-Akhera, 1434 H).

[According to the MOH press release in Arabic, the death occurred in an 81-year-old male in the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/HealthAwareness/Corona/PressReleases/Pages/mediastatement-2013-06-21-001.aspx).

With the addition of these 2 cases and one death, presumably not included in the WHO update in section [1] of this post, this will bring the global total of laboratory-confirmed cases to 70, including 39 deaths.

This brings the total number of confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia to 55, including 33 deaths.

[3] Case count reporting challenges - ProMED-mail

As several readers have pointed out to us, in ProMED-mail prior post, MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (32): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130621.1783453, this Moderator erroneously projected the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to be 72 at that time, with the inclusion of these 4 additional cases reported on the Saudi MOH website. This error resulting from an assumption (a known dangerous practice -- "assuming") that in the absence of a WHO announcement specifically confirming the 4 newly announced cases, and the announcement of the Saudi MOH of new cases on the Saudi MOH website several hours after the WHO update, that these new cases had not been included in that day's total. Obviously it was a hazardous assumption that led to the erroneous report on this moderator's part.

In an earlier post, this moderator had commented on the difficulties in keeping track of exact numbers of laboratory confirmed cases, as there were many different sources of information that were at times a challenge to reconcile.

For example, in the prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (31): Jordan, retro. case ID, WHO, RFI 20130617.1777989, there was information from a newswire announcing the confirmation of 8 additional MERS-CoV infections involved in the 1st known cluster of cases in Jordan in April 2013. Of these 8 newly confirmed (retrospectively) cases, 7 had mild clinical disease and one was reportedly asymptomatic. These individuals have not as yet been added to the global case count of laboratory-confirmed cases. This moderator presumes (a hazardous undertaking) that the definition of "laboratory-confirmed cases" is being further defined as "PCR positive" cases, and does not include retrospective serologic studies as yet.

We do apologize for the erroneous calculation/projection.

We will continue to post regular updates from WHO as well as the Ministries of Health when there are additional cases confirmed, and hopefully will be able to reconcile reports. In addition to the WHO Global Alert and Response updates, the FluTrackers blog maintains a line listing of confirmed cases that is updated regularly and is available at http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=205075. - Mod.MPP

[4] Saudi Arabia outbreak investigation follow-up - newswire
Date: Wed 19 Jun 2013
Source: Metro News Canada, The Canadian Press report [edited]
http://metronews.ca/health/712340/saudi-mers-outbreak-showed-sars-like-features/


A long-awaited report on a large and possibly still ongoing outbreak of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia reveals the virus spreads easily within hospitals, at one point passing in a person-to-person chain that encompassed at least 5 generations of spread.

The study, co-written by Toronto SARS expert Dr. Allison McGeer, also hints there may have been a superspreader in this outbreak, with one person infecting at least 7 others.

The study lays out what is known about an outbreak of MERS that erupted this spring [2013] in 4 hospitals in the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region of Saudi Arabia, in an area whose name translated into English can be spelled Al-Ahsa or Al-Hasa (the study uses the 2nd version). It was reported online on Wednesday [19 Jun 2013] by the New England Journal of Medicine [NEJM].

Superspreaders played a key role amplifying SARS cases during the 2003 outbreak. That, combined with the symptoms patients manifest when they become sick and the long and varied incubation period, paint a picture that is reminiscent of SARS for the authors, several of whom, like McGeer, worked in Toronto to contain that coronavirus.

"This virus is closer to SARS than anything else," McGeer, an infection control expert at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said in an interview from Cairo, where she was attending a World Health Organization meeting on MERS on Wednesday [19 Jun 2013]. She travelled to Al-Hasa to help investigate the outbreak in May [2013] and was on a WHO mission to Saudi Arabia earlier this month [June 2013].

"If you want to think about how you're going to prevent and manage hospital outbreaks, SARS is the place that all of us would start."

The 2003 SARS outbreak infected more than 8400 people in 31 countries, killing at least 916. In the main it was an outbreak of hospitals, wreaking its devastation on staff, patients and visitors of facilities in which it spread. MERS and SARS are members of the same viral family.

McGeer said there are some fortunate distinctions -- few health-care workers appear to be getting infected with MERS -- as well as some worrisome ones. The high attack rate among patients was "pretty unnerving," she said, as is the fact that it appears people are infectious earlier in their illness than SARS patients were.

SARS cases were contagious mainly late in their illness, which gave health authorities a chance to diagnose and isolate patients before they could make others sick. If MERS is contagious earlier in the course of illness, "that's not good," McGeer said. "If it's true, it's a real challenge because identifying cases early with either SARS or MERS is really difficult."

Others too could see similarities to SARS based on the findings of the study.

"Clearly, like with SARS, the health-care environment is a significant risk factor for ongoing transmission," Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert who has been following MERS closely, said after reading the paper. He was not involved in the work.

"It means that unless the index of suspicion is very high and patients are immediately handled with the highest level of infection control, you could surely expect that you're going to see additional episodes outside of the Middle East like are being seen in the Middle East."

Osterholm, who is director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said when cases have arrived undiagnosed in European countries, hospitals there have been relatively quick to figure out what they have on their hands and take measures to protect against spread.

Still, imported cases triggered onward spread in Britain, Italy, Tunisia and France, where transmission took place in a hospital. In all those countries, transmission events ended after a generation or 2 of spread because of measures taken to isolate patients.

"The issue that we all worry about is what happens if this gets into a country that doesn't have the same level of infection control capability in a health-care setting, and what does that mean?" noted Osterholm.

Saudi Arabia, which is one of 4 countries from which MERS has spread and which has recorded the lion's share of cases, draws millions of religious pilgrims each year from around the Muslim world. The kingdom is also host to many guest workers, people from poorer countries drawn to Saudi Arabia for work. Experts have worried that both those patterns of movement could disseminate MERS to parts of the world that might be ill-equipped to battle it.

The study gives details of the 1st 23 cases in the Al-Hasa outbreak, infections that date from [1 Apr 2013 to 23 May 2013]. It does not say whether the outbreak in Al-Hasa has ended.

However, in the weeks since [23 May 2013], the kingdom's health ministry has announced 16 additional cases of MERS. The ministry statements suggest at least 11 of the new cases were from the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region.

The statements do not say if these new infections are part of the outbreak in the hospitals. Other possibilities are that they are people who caught the virus from its still-unknown source in nature or, potentially, from other infected people outside hospital settings.

McGeer said she does not know if any of the cases reported since [23 May 2013] are part of the Al-Hasa outbreak. She also does not know if the outbreak is over, but warned with a disease that has an incubation period as long as MERS -- out to nearly 15 days in some cases -- it can take a long time to be confident that transmission has been stopped.

She could not rule out the possibility that the chains of transmission in this outbreak might now stretch beyond 5 generations, saying only that it is possible they extend longer. That type of sustained spread suggests the virus has no difficulty going from person to person, at least in the right settings.

Dr. Trish Perl, another author who went with McGeer to Saudi Arabia, says this virus is capable of sustained spread.

"I think that's one of the more important things that we show, is that there really is ongoing human-to-human transmission. This is not a single generation," said Perl, an infection control expert at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

McGeer, Perl and their fellow authors acknowledged this outbreak may actually have been substantially larger than what it appears to be based on the confirmed cases. Nearly a dozen [12] people were identified as probable cases, based on their exposure histories and their symptoms. They tested negative, but it has been seen elsewhere that some patients only test positive after repeated testing.

"I'm not sure that we effectively identified all of the probable cases outside of the hospital," McGeer said. "I don't think it was twice the size. But it was probably larger."

And some were not tested at all because the hospitals were using the WHO's case definition, which requires pneumonia. So people who were sick with respiratory symptoms and who had had contact with MERS cases but who didn't have pneumonia were not investigated as possible cases.

Perl said it may be time to amend the WHO definition, to encourage broader testing in situations like Al-Hasa.

The data in the study is the 1st large-scale revelation of what is happening in Saudi Arabia with MERS.

[This article gives more information from some of the authors involved in the investigation, raising the issues of probable cases that were not laboratory confirmed, suggesting the magnitude of the outbreak; also, the generations of transmission suggest the organism is now capable of lengthy transmission chains.

The reports of additional cases from the Eastern [Ash Sharqiyah] Region since the end of the period of the study reported in the NEJM (and in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (32): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130621.1783453) suggest that there may be continued transmission as part of this outbreak -- or, as mentioned above, that the original source of infection in the Eastern Region (as yet unknown) is still present, leading to new infections and possible new chains of person-to-person transmission. It would be helpful if there were epidemiologic updates on the situation that provided more information on the possible contact information of newly identified cases.
