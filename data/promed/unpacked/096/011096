In regard to your recent note about Armenia.
Seems to me, it would be important also to check on what is happening in
Azerbaijan in regard to malaria. They have hundreds of thousands of
refugees living in camps in low marshy regions, and in the past few
years there were hundreds and hundreds of cases of malaria.
I haven't heard what is going on there this year. But there is a great
likelihood that the problem has not been solved.
Does anyone know if WHO can tell us what the situation is there right now,
especially in the Sabirabad, Imishli, Saatli, Barda region where the
refugees are living -- in unprotected shelters -- tents and mud brick. It's
a great tragedy.
