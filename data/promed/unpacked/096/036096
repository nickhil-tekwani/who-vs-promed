Only 2 days ago, in PRO/AH/EDR> Rabies - India (06): (CH) human, canine 20150416.3302837, ProMED posted dramatic evidence that a single suspected case of human rabies is capable of making banner headlines in Chandigarh, hub of a metropolitan area of more than 2 million people. This response is not consonant with an event, a human rabies death, which purportedly occurs in India 20 000 times per year. It is, however, consonant with the reality that India experienced only 138 documented rabies deaths in all of 2013, according to the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBI).

The CBI has tracked human rabies fatalities since 2003, and has documented a general downward trend, with only a couple of upward blips, over that time. From 2005 through 2011, the CBI found, India had 274, 361, 221, 244, 260, 162, and 223 human rabies deaths, respectively: an annual average of 249.

This followed the finding of the 2003 WHO-sponsored National Multicentric Rabies Survey, led by M K Sudarshan. This survey found that human rabies appeared to be "endemic and stable" at 235 human deaths per year, based on data collected from government hospital isolation units. Since government hospitals administer free post-exposure rabies treatment, are the only hospitals that do, and are the only hospitals mandated and equipped to handle rabies patients, there is no reason to believe that substantial numbers of human rabies cases are occurring anywhere else.

I have repeatedly pointed all of this out before:

Today [17 Apr 2015], ProMED posted without critical comment a media release from the Global Alliance for Rabies Control [GARC], which claimed:

"A global study on canine rabies [20150417.3304445] published today (17 Apr 2015), has found that 160 people die every single day from the disease ... the study says that around 59 000 people die every year of rabies transmitted by dogs." These numbers were projected largely from the claim that "India has the highest number of fatalities, with over 20 000 human deaths annually." Upon what is that claim based?

There are actually just 6 mentions of India in the entire GARC paper, as published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709. Of these mentions, only one refers to data other than abstract projections: "According to our estimates, India, the world's 2nd most populous country (with close to 18 percent of the global population) accounts for over 35 per cent of the global rabies burden (approximately 20 800 deaths). This is broadly consistent with a recent verbal autopsy study, that estimated 12 700 deaths from furious rabies alone in India."

The "verbal autopsy study" in fact projects barely half as many human rabies deaths as the GARC paper claims.

Meanwhile, this figure of 20 000-odd human rabies deaths has been kicking around for more than 100 years now, projected from the same data as commonly cited and comparably exaggerated claims for the numbers of human rabies deaths in Bangladesh and Pakistan, all of which originated with a survey of government hospitals done by David Semple and William F Harvey in 1911, at a time when India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan were all under British administration. The Semple and Harvey survey was preliminary to the introduction of post-rabies exposure vaccination to India. It was in effect the "before" study, for which the WHO-sponsored National Multicentric Rabies Survey of 2003 and the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence data collections are the "after," all of them using essentially the same methodology.

[Merritt, who has some fair experience of rabies incidence in India from visits to that country, makes a fair point in suggesting that the GARC paper may have significantly over estimated the number of rabies cases in India. And thus by extension maybe elsewhere. Informed comment would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
