News of the response
Security situation
-----------------
- Armed men launched several attacks in the town of Butembo on Wed 8 May 2019 around 5:30 am. The attackers were repulsed by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC). A dozen attackers were killed and 6 were captured. A policeman from the city also died in the attack. Because of this new security incident, the response teams have limited their movements in the city. Only a minimum service was performed. Since the beginning of May [2019], this is the 5th consecutive day in which the response teams have not been able to carry out all the necessary response activities in Butembo, such as active case finding in the community, vaccination and dignified and secure burials.

- The triage of the Masiki Health Center in Katwa Health Zone was set on fire on Tue 7 May 2019.

- A dignified and secure burial team officer was murdered in Vuhovi on the night of 7 to 8 May 2019. It was in this health zone that the nurse in charge of the Isonga health area had been kidnapped and killed in February 2019.

Vaccination
------------
Since the beginning of the vaccination 8 Aug 2018, 112 485 people have been vaccinated

The report states that it was on the eve of the assassination on [Tue 7 May], the triage of Masiki Health Center in Katwa Health Zone was set on fire. Violence and disrespect are rampant. The intention seems to be to disrupt the control efforts, but these may very well not be viewed as truly control efforts but rather a danger to the people. Otherwise, it is totally senseless. - Mod.LK]

- 2 new healed from the ETC of Butembo.

News of the response
Security situation
-----------------
- The response activities were not able to completely resume this Tue 7 May 2019 in Butembo because of a rumor shared on social networks that the vehicle of a team of the riposte would have overthrown a biker who died on the spot. This rumor having caused a risk of uprising of the population, the teams of the riposte had to limit their displacements in the city this Tue 7 May 2019. However, at the end of the day, the president of ATAMOV, the bikers' association, denied this rumor. An accident did occur but the motorcycle taxi driver did not die and he continued to work during the day. Since the beginning of May [2019], this is the 4th consecutive day in which the teams have not been able to carry out all the necessary response activities to Butembo.

A meeting was held on Tue 7 May 2019 between the city's urban safety committee and motorcycle taxi drivers. The bikers confessed before the members of the urban security committee that they are infiltrated by enemies who commit incidents on their behalf and that some of their members are used by malicious people to destabilize the city. Among the decisions taken, there is notably the census of all true taximen today. The Urban Safety Committee warned motorcyclists that if they are still at the base of security incidents impeding the response to Ebola, the committee will be forced to take tougher action against them.

- The triage service of the Sainte Famille Mukuna hospital center in the health zone of Katwa was burned by "inciviques" [uncivils or lawless ones]. As part of the Ebola outbreak, triages were constructed at the entrance of the city's main hospitals and health centers. The triages are structures through which patients wanting to go to the hospital must pass to disinfect their hands and shoes as well as take their temperature. In order to reduce the risk of hospitalization of confirmed patients and thus nosocomial infections in the health facilities of the city, it was important to sort the patients before they entered the hospital.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 112 225 people have been vaccinated

- On Tue 7 May 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) released several recommendations to adapt the Ebola vaccination strategy to address insecurity and community feedback. These recommendations include expanding the targeted population by adding an additional experimental vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson [adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein/MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN)], as well as the greater use of pop-up vaccination and targeted geographic vaccination. In addition, it was recommended that vaccine doses be adjusted to increase the number of people who can be vaccinated.

The targeted geographic immunization strategy is the strategy already used by Ministry of Health vaccinators in unsecured areas such as villages controlled by community militias (Mai-Mai). Targeted geographic vaccination, which is wider than ring vaccination, consists of vaccinating several houses around a confirmed case, or even an entire village or neighborhood, when the security conditions do not allow the necessary investigations to be made to establish the list of contacts.

- To date, the authorized Congolese authorities, namely the Scientific Committee, the Ethics Committee, the Expanded Program on Immunization and the Directorate of Pharmacy and Medicine (DPM), have not approved the use of a vaccine other than rVSV-ZEBOV, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck. Congolese authorities have already received applications for the use of 3 other vaccines as part of the ongoing Ebola outbreak. The different requests are being analyzed. A comparative scientific analysis of these different vaccines is needed to determine which one will be most effective in limiting the number of Ebola victims in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.

Weekly Summary Of Epidemiological Data
--------------------------------------
For the week of 29 Apr to 5 May 2019, we recorded:
- 1840 suspected cases investigated and tested in the laboratory
- 106 new confirmed cases: The main focus of the epidemic remains Katwa with 41 of the 106 new confirmed cases of the week, or 38.7%.
- 88 deaths of confirmed cases: The town of Butembo is also the main focus of confirmed case fatalities reported last week. The health zones of Butembo and Katwa together reported 49 of the 88 new confirmed cases, or 55.7%; Other important foci are Mabalako and Mandima; Of the 88 deaths, 47 were community deaths, or 53.4%, and 41 occurred in an ETC.
- 28 new healed people came out of ETCs.

[Is a comparative scientific analysis of the different vaccines now under consideration to evaluate efficacy? Is there really time to do this in the middle of the outbreak? This is a difficult decision even once safety is assured. While more vaccines are needed, one would not want to risk administering a vaccine that was not protective in the human. - Mod.LK]

Situation update
---------------
The escalation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this past week, with a total of 106 new confirmed cases reported.

The majority of these cases originated primarily from hotspot areas within Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, Musienene, Beni, and Mabalako health zones.

In the 21 days between 15 Apr and 5 May 2019, 76 health areas within 14 health zones reported new cases, representing 47% of the 163 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 298 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Katwa (40%, n=120), Mandima (13%, n=40), Butembo (13%, n=38), Musienene (8%, n=25), Mabalako (8%, n=24), and Beni (6%, n=19).

Of 1572 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 55% (870) were female, and 28% (445) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 95 (6% of total cases), including 34 deaths.

The past week showed a continued deterioration of the security situation in Butembo city. Response activities were temporarily suspended in Butembo and neighbouring health zones from 4 to 5 May 2019 following a civil demonstration by members of a local moto-taxi drivers union. Although response operations later resumed following negotiations with community leaders, threats of attacks persisted against some healthcare facilities and healthcare providers. In a separate event, on 3 May 2019, a safe and dignified burial (SDB) team in Katwa was also attacked after conducting a SDB of a confirmed case.

In Butembo, current efforts aim to enhance security measures collectively through the UN Security Management System. Efforts included updating security risk management processes by addressing procedural, operational and physical security measures.

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In its latest weekly situation report, the World Health Organization (WHO) said events over the past week reflect a deteriorating security situation in Butembo, with threats of attacks persisting against some health facilities and providers in the wake of the latest violence.

To address the insecurity in Butembo, the WHO said the United Nations security management system will update the security risk management process by addressing procedural, operational, and security measures.

Officials weigh vaccine applications
------------------------------------
Regarding the alternative vaccination strategy recommendations, the WHO advisory group announced yesterday --which included adding the Johnson & Johnson Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine-- the health ministry said it hasn't yet approved the use of another vaccine besides Merck's VSV-EBOV. Authorities, however, said they have received applications for the use of 3 other vaccines and are considering them.

[Violence continues to increase, and with it, the number of cases including yet another HCW. The motivation behind the attacks seems very simply to disrupt the Ebola response. Contacts of cases continue to flee, potentially spreading the virus. There is no good news, except the decision to vaccinate more people including those who are not immediate contacts. - Mod.LK]

Heavy fighting between the army and local militiamen in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola-stricken city of Butembo killed at least 9 people on [Wed 8 May 2019], the mayor said.

Butembo mayor Sylvain Kanyamanda Mbusa told Reuters that 8 militiamen and 1 police officer were killed in fighting as the gunmen tried to storm the city. Security forces successfully repelled the attack before the assailants could reach the city's Ebola treatment centers and made several arrests, Kanyamanda said.

Militiamen attacked a Butembo hospital last month [April 2019] and killed a Cameroonian doctor working for the World Health Organization (WHO) and injured 2 others.

[4] Vaccine strategy and response

[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/07-05-2019-who-adapts-ebola-vaccination-strategy-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-to-account-for-insecurity-and-community-feedback

Adapting ring vaccination operational approaches: pop-up and targeted geographic vaccination
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SAGE [Strategic Advisory Group of Experts] endorsed the use of pop-up and targeted geographic approaches to vaccination when appropriate. These vaccination approaches have already been used successfully in the field by WHO to make the ring vaccination process faster, more secure, and more responsive to community feedback.

In view of the fact that insecurity limits the time that vaccination teams can spend in some communities, and in response to community requests, SAGE recommended steps to streamline implementation of the vaccination protocol. SAGE also endorsed a modified follow-up for safety monitoring.

Adjusting rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine dosage and eligible population
--------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to vaccinating contacts and contacts of contacts, SAGE now also recommends vaccinating those who could be part of tertiary chains of transmission, such as people in villages and neighborhoods where cases have been reported within the past 21 days. SAGE noted that increasing access to vaccination in the broader community may help enhance community acceptance of the vaccine and other control measures.

SAGE also recommended adjusting the dose of the vaccine currently being used.

"The SAGE emphasized that ring vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts continue to be the preferred strategy. However, the Working Group recognized that the current emergency and the available evidence called for a dose-adjusted approach to ensure vaccine continues to be available and offered to individuals at greatest risk of Ebola," said Helen Rees, Co-Chair of the SAGE Ebola Vaccines Working Group.

People at highest risk (contacts and contacts of contacts) will now receive 0.5ml of vaccine instead of 1ml. This dosage is equal to that used in the successful Ebola ça suffit ring vaccination trial in Guinea in 2015, and is expected to provide the same level of protection.

Those for whom a rapid evolution of the immune response is less critical (people who are considered lower-risk / those who could be potentially involved in tertiary transmission) will receive 0.2ml (1/5 of the current dose).

Use of additional Ebola vaccines: plans for deployment of an additional vaccine underway
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SAGE reiterated its previous stance stating the need to assess additional Ebola vaccines. SAGE now additionally recommends offering an alternative vaccine (other than rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) to those at lower risk within affected health areas.

Proposed studies should be scientifically and epidemiologically justified, have appropriate approvals including from all relevant national and other regulatory and ethics authorities, and have defined endpoints suitable for licensure.

The adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) investigational Ebola vaccine, developed by Johnson & Johnson, is being considered and a coalition led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and other partners, with support from WHO, are at an advanced stage towards the deployment and assessment of this vaccine.

Training and engaging more members of affected communities
----------------------------------------------------------
WHO and partners are working to further engage Congolese nationals from within Ebola-affected communities. The goal is that by end of the month a majority of vaccination team members are healthcare workers, doctors and medical students from affected communities who also speak the local languages.

[As was done with the yellow fever vaccine, cutting the dose should be effective. As long as an individual gets infected with the virus in the vaccine, s/he will mount an immune response. It is not clear how long immune protection will last with a lower dose, but it should protect in the immediate future, and perhaps be sufficient for a lifetime since natural infection would lead to an anamnestic response and antibody titer would rise and protect against severe disease. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 7 May 2019. Dwindling vaccine stockpiles
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/rising-cases-and-dwindling-stockpiles-who-suggests-alternative-ebola
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today SAGE, the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, released new guidelines to address several growing concerns about vaccination strategies currently being used in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak.

Despite vaccinating more than 111 000 people with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, a highly protective unlicensed Ebola vaccine, the outbreak has worsened dramatically in the last month due to violent attacks and a communication breakdown between community members and response workers. And cases with no connection to an ongoing transmission chain are increasingly being diagnosed.

In light of these developments, SAGE is recommending the use of a new vaccine, Johnson & Johnson's adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein/MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN), and a dose-sparing strategy with rVSV-ZEBOV, which will provide a smaller dose of the vaccine to case contacts.

"We know that vaccination is saving lives in this outbreak," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. PhD. "We also know that we still face challenges in making sure the contacts of every case receive the vaccine as soon as possible. These recommendations account for ongoing insecurity and incorporate feedback from experts and from the affected communities that will help us continue to adapt the response."

Dose changes should not limit efficacy
--------------------------------------
Since August [2019], a ring vaccination strategy has been used in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which demands that close case contacts and front line health workers are the 1st to receive the vaccine, followed by a widening circle of contacts' contacts.

SAGE's new proposal will have people at highest risk (contacts and contacts of contacts) receiving 0.5 mL of vaccine instead of 1 mL. This dosage is equal to the dose used in the successful Ebola ring vaccination trial in Guinea in 2015, and is expected to provide the same level of protection, SAGE said.

SAGE also recommends vaccinating a tertiary set of people: those who live in villages and neighborhoods where cases have been reported within the past 21 days, but are not case contacts or contacts of contacts. Those people could be administered rVSV-ZEBOV at a dose of 0.2 mL (one-5th of the current dose). "Increasing access to vaccination in the broader community may help enhance community acceptance of the vaccine and other control measures," SAGE said.

To address issues of insecurity and violence, SAGE recommends vaccination happen at "pop-up" stations in remote villages, and not at contact's homes.

Finally, SAGE said they recommend recruiting and training more Congolese medical staff to carry out the vaccinations. "The goal is that by end of the month a majority of vaccination team members are healthcare workers, doctors, and medical students from affected communities who also speak the local languages," SAGE said.

More than 100 cases in first week of May
----------------------------------------
The DRC's Ministry of Health will likely confirm 13 more cases of Ebola today [Tue 7 May 2019], raising the outbreak total to 1585.

"Katwa is still the main focus of the outbreak, reporting 41% (121/292) of all confirmed cases in the past 21 days," the WHO said. Two more health workers have also been diagnosed as having Ebola, raising the total number of affected health workers to 94, with 33 deaths. Besides Katwa, Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mandima, Katwa, Mabalako, Musienene and Vuhovi have reported new cases within the last week, and bed occupancy has been reached at the Mangina Ebola treatment center and the Kayna transit center.

[STAT News, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Helen Branswell]

Now, people even further removed from individuals who have contracted the virus -- an additional ring of contacts -- will be offered Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine. And others in the region who are deemed to be at some but not high risk of being exposed to Ebola will be offered another experimental vaccine, made by Janssen, the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson.

Responders, including the WHO and other organizations, will also set up more pop-up vaccination clinics to allow people who want to be vaccinated to go outside their neighborhoods to get the shots. In Butembo and Katwa, the highly charged hot spots of transmission, some people who want to be vaccinated are being threatened for cooperating with the Ebola response, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program.

"They want the vaccine," Ryan told STAT. "The fact that neighbors and other political forces and people are manipulating and threatening and actually punishing families for accepting vaccination is one of the reasons why we have to set up pop-up vaccination."

The WHO hopes to be vaccinating about 1000 people a day in coming weeks. At times in this outbreak, vaccination teams have managed to inoculate as many as 800 to 900 people a day.

[New York Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/health/ebola-vaccine-congo.html
[Byline: Donald G. McNeil Jr.]

As violence makes it harder to reach stricken villages in Congo, experts plan to stretch supplies and to give the vaccine to everyone not just contacts of victims. Because driving to villages with Ebola victims is so risky, the agency intends to launch brief and unexpected "pop-up" vaccination campaigns in communities considered safe.

The WHO. also wants to shift to immunizing as many people in each target area as possible, instead of relying solely on its current tactic: "ring vaccinating" the immediate contacts of each known case, along with health care workers.

Before such a change is made, the Congolese government must accept the recommendations made Tue by a WHO panel of experts. Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who heads Congo's ethical review board, welcomed the recommendations and said he would work to see them implemented quickly. Demand for the vaccine is increasing in the affected districts of eastern Congo, Dr. Muyembe said.

There have been contradictory reports from the area about acceptance of the vaccine. Some observers said villagers and even health workers were rejecting the vaccine. Others said villagers were angry that the vaccine was given only to contacts of victims when everyone was afraid of the infection.

A consortium, including the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, which develops vaccines against pandemic diseases, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is planning how to safely roll out the new vaccine.

[United Nations, abridged, edited]
https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sgsm19571.doc.htm

The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres:

The Secretary-General is concerned by the number of new Ebola cases in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He reiterates the support of the whole United Nations system for efforts to end the outbreak.

The Secretary-General commends the Government, institutions and people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the response to date, which has contained the current outbreak within parts of 2 provinces.

He applauds the bravery of security, health and humanitarian workers who have put their lives on the line in a challenging environment marked by conflict and insecurity, including attacks on Ebola treatment centres and health care facilities. They have vaccinated over 100 000 people and saved the lives of hundreds of people who have contracted the disease.

Despite these efforts, the outbreak is now in its 10th month and has claimed more than 1000 lives. The Secretary-General expresses his condolences to the families of the victims.

With important shifts in the response now being implemented, the Secretary General has emphasized his commitment to a collective United Nations wide approach, both in Kinshasa, where the United Nations is led by his Special Representative, and in the areas affected by the virus, where the response is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), all in close liaison with Congolese leaders both in Kinshasa and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Secretary-General reiterates that the full involvement and engagement of local people remains the key to successfully controlling the outbreak. The Secretary General urges all Congolese leaders to work together across parties and across communities to tackle the outbreak.

At this critical juncture, additional resources are needed. The Secretary General calls on Member States and partner organizations to ensure the responding agencies have the resources needed to succeed.

In a breakthrough that could lead to a simple and inexpensive test for Ebola virus disease, researchers have generated 2 antibodies to the deadly virus.

The antibodies, which are inexpensive to produce, potentially could be used in a simple filter paper test to detect Ebola virus and the related Marburg virus. (If the filter paper turns color, the virus is present.)

Corresponding author Ravi Durvasula, MD, and colleagues report their findings in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene. Dr. Durvasula, a world leader in global infectious diseases research, is a professor and chair of the department of medicine of Loyola Medicine and Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. First author Adinarayana Kunamneni, PhD, is a research assistant professor in Loyola's department of Medicine.

Ebola and Marburg viruses can cause severe bleeding and organ failure, with fatality rates reaching 90% in some outbreaks. The diseases spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person, monkey, gorilla, chimpanzee or bat.

Ebola and Marburg belong to a class of viruses native to Africa called filoviruses. There are 4 known types of Ebola virus and 2 known types of Marburg virus. They are textbook examples of emerging diseases that appear quickly, often in remote areas with little or no public health infrastructure. There were major Ebola outbreaks in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. There is no effective vaccine or drug to treat the diseases.

Early symptoms of Ebola and Marburg, such as fever, headache and diarrhea, mimic more common diseases, so there's a critical need for a rapid diagnostic test. Such a test could help in efforts to limit outbreaks by quickly quarantining infected people. But existing diagnostic tests either are inaccurate or are expensive and require extensive training to administer.

Antibodies could be key to diagnosing Ebola and Marburg viruses. An antibody is a Y-shaped protein made by the immune system. When a virus or other pathogen invades the body, antibodies mark it for the immune system to destroy.

Using a technology called cell-free ribosome display, researchers generated 2 synthetic antibodies that bind to all 6 Ebola and Marburg viruses. (The research involved the use of non-hazardous proteins that sit on the surface of Ebola and Marburg viruses. Because the actual viruses were not used in the study, there was no risk of infection to researchers or the public.)

It will take further research to validate the antibodies' potential for diagnosing Ebola and Marburg viruses, Drs. Durvasula and Kunamneni said.

[excerpt: We have generated a panel of mouse single-chain Fv-antibodies (scFvs) to filovirus glycoproteins (GPs) using cell-free ribosome display and determined their cross-reactivity profiles to all known filovirus species. Two scFvs (4-2 and 22-1) were able to detect all known Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus species. This is the 1st report on ribosome display scFvs that can detect a broad set of filovirus GPs, which demonstrates the potential for use in diagnostics.]
