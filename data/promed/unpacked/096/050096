Yellow fever in Senegal - WHO Update 2
--------------------------------------
As of Thu 17 Oct 2002, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 18 cases and 2
deaths of yellow fever. The outbreak has affected Touba, Mbacke and Bambey
departements, Diourbel region and Gossas departement, Fatick region.
Laboratory confirmation was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the
Institut Pasteur in Dakar; 15 of the cases were reported from Touba.
A mass immunization campaign began on 1 Oct 2002 and a total of 800 000
people have been vaccinated in the following 4 health districts: Touba,
Diourbel, Bambey, and Mbacke. An assessment by WHO indicates that the
campaigns are proceeding well, but additional vaccine is urgently needed to
complete the immunization program.
A second campaign for spraying insecticide in the city of Touba was
conducted by the National Service of Hygiene between 15 and 17 Oct 2002.
Entomological studies in Touba found high indices of _Aedes aegypti_, the
mosquito responsible for explosive epidemics of urban yellow fever. As a
result, vector control activities will also include larviciding and health
education programs for removing mosquito breeding sites. Health units
throughout the country have been notified to increase surveillance for
yellow fever. The units have been instructed to report to the central level
within 24 hours, all cases fitting a standard case definition. Particular
emphasis is focused on strengthening surveillance and vector control in Dakar.
Teams with staff from the Ministry of Health, Institut Pasteur-Dakar, and
WHO are conducting surveillance and case investigation activities. Samples
from over 150 suspect cases have been sent to laboratories for testing. WHO
is assisting the Ministry of Health in the areas of surveillance,
immunization and coordination of the response to the outbreak. WHO has also
contacted potential donors for assistance with purchasing vaccine.
