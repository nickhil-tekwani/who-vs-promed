CCHF: 7 cases and 2 deaths in South Kazakhstan
----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 20 April 2010 there have been 7 confirmed cases of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the South Kazakhstan Oblast
[region]. The regional public health authority announced that more
than 1500 people had sought medical care after receiving tick bites
during the period 30 Mar to 20 Apr 2010. Of the 7 CCHF cases 2 died,
whereas the remaining 5 cases experienced mild to moderate illness.
About 127 of the contacts of these 7 are now under medical surveillance.

Some settlements have recorded higher numbers of tick bites probably
because of denser tick populations or inadequate tick control
measures. More than 266 000 individuals who may be at risk are being
contacted daily by healthcare workers, in order to encourage tick
avoidance behavior and to check for suspicious symptoms and signs.
Farm livestock are being treated with acaricides.

[There were 22 CCHF cases (and 8 fatalities) in the South Kazakhstan
region last year (2009), including 5 fatalities in a hospital
nosocomial outbreak. The 7 fatalities and 2 deaths recorded during
the 1st 4 months of 2010 are a cause for concern. Treatment of farm
animals to reduce tick infestation and information and education of
the local population are immediate priorities. All patients with
fever and thrombocytopenia who may be at risk of infection should be
tested for CCHF virus infection. - Mod.NP]

[It is likely, but not certain from the information provided above,
that the 2 fatalities listed are the same 2 fatal cases described in
detail in the previous ProMED-mail report: "Crimean-Congo hem. fever
- Kazakhstan: (SK) 20100419.1273".
