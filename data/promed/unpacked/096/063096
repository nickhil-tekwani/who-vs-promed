Pesticide theory backed in hotel deaths
---------------------------------------
World Health Organisation (WHO) experts suspect that a pest-control
substance is a cause of the mysterious deaths at a Chiang Mai hotel.

Chiang Mai's head of public health Surasing Visaruthrat, who joined
the WHO investigation team in examining the Downtown Inn on Friday [20
May 2011], said the world body's experts agreed with his team that it
was unlikely that New Zealand tourist Sarah Carter died of a bedbug
spray containing chlorpyrifos as had been suggested.

"We are looking into a toxic substance other than chlorpyrifos," Dr
Surasing said. He refused to name the substance, saying only that it
was "a pest control chemical."

Carter was one of 7 people who died mysteriously in the northern
province between January and February [2011]. 4 of them had stayed at
the Downtown Inn.

The mystery over Carter's death resurfaced recently after an
investigation commissioned by the New Zealand TV3 show 60 Minutes
found traces of chlorpyrifos in the hotel. But Thai authorities cited
a medical report that found no trace of insecticide in Carter's body,
while the hotel manager has denied using the highly toxic substance.

Dr Surasing said WHO officials and his team examined over 10 guest
rooms, including Room 516, where Carter and 2 of her friends stayed.
The WHO officials cut out part of the carpet under the hotel beds for
laboratory testing. They also inspected the hotel kitchen and swimming
pool, he said. According to Dr Surasing, the carpet samples were sent
to a WHO-certified laboratory at Ramathibodi Hospital in Bangkok.

The WHO investigation team is expected to return to Chiang Mai for
further investigation after lab test results early next week, he said.
Chiang Mai governor Panadda Disakul said yesterday [21 May 2011] the
WHO investigation would ensure a transparent inquest following
conflict over earlier theories of whether a virus or exposure to a
chemical toxin had caused the deaths.

The investigation would boost confidence for all parties currently
trying to uncover the cause of the deaths, the governor said after
meeting WHO representative Richard Brown. ML Panadda said he would
like the investigation to uncover the truth as soon as possible for
the sake of the "good image of Chiang Mai and Thailand," which have
been marred by media coverage of the deaths.

[This article does little more than tell us that a new pesticide
investigation is underway and that chlorpyrifos is not the cause of
the deaths. The article also tells us that the WHO is now involved.

We can hope that this investigation will be more productive for the
sake of those seeking to know the cause of their love ones' demise. -
