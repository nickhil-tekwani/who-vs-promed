[1] Cholera - Yemen

In a follow-up to a report last week on the cholera outbreak in Yemen, the Ministry of Public Health and Population in Yemen has confirmed additional cases of cholera and cholera-related deaths in the country.

As of today, 23 Oct 2016, a total of 644 suspected cases of cholera, including 3 deaths, have been reported. 31 cases have been laboratory-confirmed so far. Among the deaths, 2 occurred in Sana'a and 1 death occurred in Aden governorate. Acute watery diarrheal diseases are endemic in Yemen. It is the 2nd most common cause of death, especially among infants and school children. As a result of the ongoing conflict, 2/3 of Yemenis do not have access to clean water and sanitation services are limited, especially in cities, further increasing the risk of catching cholera.

WHO is working in coordination with the Ministry of Public Health and Population and partners on the ground to run a joint health/WASH task force to coordinate the daily response. WHO is also supporting the Ministry to take necessary public health measures to stop transmission and prevent the spread of cholera to other areas, enhance surveillance, improve case management and raise community awareness in high-risk areas.

[2] Cholera - Yemen

Yemen's government announced on [Sun 23 Oct 2016], that 9 people had died of cholera in 2nd city Aden as the infectious disease spread across the war-torn country. 10 other people in the southern port city have been diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease which is transmitted through contaminated drinking water and causes acute diarrhea, the health ministry said.

A ministry statement said 190 cases of severe diarrhea had been admitted to hospitals in Aden, which hosts the government's temporary headquarters. The ministry said that around 200 cases of cholera had been reported nationwide.

The UN in October 2016 announced an outbreak of cholera in Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country even before the war broke out. A Saudi-led coalition began a bombing campaign in March 2015 against rebels who seized the capital Sana'a and large parts of Yemen in a war the UN says has killed nearly 6900 people.

The WHO said it had confirmed 11 cases of cholera in Sana'a and warned that the scarcity of drinkable water has worsened hygienic conditions and fuelled a marked increase in cases of severe diarrhea, in particular among people displaced from their homes in central Yemen.

[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. These 2 posts differ widely in both the total number of presumed cases and the number of deaths. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but is likely to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman. - Mod.LL
