A 28-year-old man from McKinley County died this week from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and a 49-year-old man from Otero County still is hospitalized with the viral infection, but improving.

Otero County is Ruidoso's neighbor to the south. New Mexico this year [2014] has seen a total of 6 HPS cases, 3 resulting in death.

Hantavirus [infections can cause a] a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. The deer mouse [_Peromuscus maniculatus_] is the main carrier for Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus strain found in New Mexico.

"Each year, our state has a few cases of hantavirus [infections]," Department of Health Cabinet Secretary Retta Ward said. "While cases are rare, they often have tragic consequences. There are important steps people can take to lower the risk of contracting this dangerous illness."

"People are usually exposed to hantavirus around their homes, especially when they clean out enclosed areas that have lots of mouse droppings," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. "With the cold weather, mice may try to enter buildings for food and shelter, so it is important to seal up homes and other structures that are used by people. Mice can squeeze through holes the size of a dime."

State health officials urged healthcare workers and the public to familiarize themselves with the symptoms of hantavirus [infection]. Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and a cough that progresses to respiratory distress. These symptoms develop within one week to 6 weeks after rodent exposure. Although no specific treatment for HPS exists, chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early, they said.

Important steps to follow to prevent contracting hantavirus [exposure] include:

- Trap mice until they are all gone.

- Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant.

- Don't sweep up rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled.

- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.

- Get rid of trash and junk piles.

- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

The other 4 of the 6 cases of HPS in New Mexico in 2014 include fatal cases in a 67-year-old woman from San Juan County and a 59-year-old man from McKinley County. A 32-year-old woman from San Juan County and a 50-year-old man from San Juan County both recovered.

Since the virus 1st was diagnosed in 1993, New Mexico health officials have reported 100 lab-confirmed HPS cases with 42 deaths, the highest number of cases for any state in the nation. Nationally, since 1993, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported 639 cases with a fatality rate of 36 percent.

[With the beginning of winter, deer mice are likely to move into houses and outbuildings with the onset of cold weather. The precautions noted above are good ones to reduce the risk of exposure to Sin Nombre virus. Although infections are rare, including in New Mexico, HPS is a very serious disease and the case fatality rate is relatively high, especially if medical attention is sought late in the course of the infection.

As noted in the report above, the rodent host of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_; an image can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
