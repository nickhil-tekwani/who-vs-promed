A dog at the Lee County Humane Society has tested positive for rabies. The
case, confirmed on Friday [25 Sep 2009], was brought to the attention of
the LCHS staff after an employee was bitten by the dog, said Heather
Meadows, executive director of the Lee County Humane Society.

The dog was in the adoption area of the Humane Society for a short period
of time, between 11-12 Sep 2009, Meadows said. The LCHS is encouraging
anyone who thinks they may have been in contact with the small, black and
tan, young adult un-neutered male, which resembled a miniature pincher with
floppy ears and a long tail, to see their doctor for further guidance.

[The article does not provide much detail about how long the dog had been
there, whether there was a history of previous biting, or even why the dog
was there. The article does not even tell us whether the person who was
bitten is receiving post exposure prophylaxis; it is likely, as it is
probably part of the safety policy of the humane society. As the article is
the 1st regarding this incident, there may be many people who came into
contact with this animal. - Mod.TG]
