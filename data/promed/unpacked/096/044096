First report of stem rot and wilt of chickpea caused by _Sclerotinia
minor_in Queensland, Australia
--------------------------------
M J Fuhlbohm <michael.fuhlbohm@dpi.qld.gov.au >, JR. Tatnell, MJ Ryley,
Queensland Department of Primary Industries. Australasian Plant Pathology
Journal, 32 (2), 323-324.
In Australia, 3 closely related _Sclerotinia_ species, _S. sclerotiorum_,
_S. trifoliorum_ and _S. minor_, [Sm] infect chickpea [_Cicer arietinum_]
(1). Sm isolates have previously been lodged in Victoria and New South
Wales. In Western Australia, Sm is suspected to cause significant losses in
certain years.
In June 2001, seeds of chickpea cv. Jimbour were sown in 5 rows in a small
plot (1 x 2 m) at a Sm-infested site at Kingaroy, Queensland. In September
2001, wilting of stems and leaves, stem necrosis and bleaching near the
soil surface were observed on several plants. White mycelium was evident on
diseased tissue and small, black irregularly shaped sclerotia (0.5 - 2 mm)
were observed on stems and in pith tissue.
Sections of diseased plant tissue were washed thoroughly and blotted dry on
sterile paper. Sections (5 mm) were transferred to PDA amended with 1
percent streptomycin sulphate. Isolation plates were incubated in the dark
at 23 C for 5 days. Colonies exhibiting sclerotial morphology of Sm were
transferred to fresh PDA plates. Isolate (BRIP 28138) was lodged at BRIP
(Queensland Department of Primary Industries herbarium).
Isolate BRIP 28138 was selected for pathogenicity testing. Five 6-week-old
chickpea plants of cv. Jimbour were inoculated by placing an infected PDA
block adjacent to the stem at soil level. 3 plants inoculated with agar
plugs only were used as controls. The pots were incubated in a controlled
environment cabinet at 100 percent humidity, 21 Â± 1 C and with a 15 h
light/9 h dark cycle for 7 days and then moved into a glasshouse for
further observation.
Inoculated stems developed symptoms of wilt and necrosis, with white-fluffy
mycelium and sclerotial formation on the surface of the stems, whereas
control plants remained healthy when examined after 7 days. Sm was
re-isolated from the diseased stems of 5 plants.
Stem rot and wilt of chickpea caused by Sm could pose a threat to chickpeas
across a significant portion of Australian production areas in certain
years, particularly where other host crops such as canola, sunflower and
peanut are part of the rotation. The wide host-range coupled with the
longevity of its sclerotia may mean that inoculum-reducing strategies are
difficult to achieve in rotations incorporating dicotyledonous crops.

[Sm occurs worldwide, primarily in cool, moist regions. In addition to
chickpea, its host range includes cabbage, common bean, cucumber, lettuce,
peanut, pepper, potato, spinach, sweet potato and tomato. In peanut, crop
losses can exceed 80 percent. Other soil-borne pathogens that infect
chickpea include Ascochyta blight, Fusarium wilt and Fusarium root rot.
Disease management utilizes the use of resistant cultivars. USDA scientists
are studying the soil-inhabiting fungus _Sporidesmium sclerotivorum_ which
infects and kills the sclerotia of Sm and _S. sclerotiorum_. Spores of
_Sporidesmium_ germinate only in the presence of susceptible host plants,
and research is being directed at determining the organic compounds that
trigger spore germination. -Mod.DH]
