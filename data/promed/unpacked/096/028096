Several outbreaks of illnesses have hit clusters of Iowans in recent
weeks and yet another mystery case has appeared now in Waterloo/Cedar
Falls. The Black Hawk County Health Department is investigating more
than a dozen cases of what's known as serious diarrheal illness.
Health officials right now aren't exactly sure what's causing it, but
they've not ruled out food poisoning. Since Wed [6 Dec 2006], at
least 10 people have gone to area hospitals to be treated for
symptoms that include respiratory illness and serious diarrhea.
Officials are saying that norovirus is likely not the cause, however,
they're still looking into the matter.

[The combination of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms
suggests a viral infection. The exclusion of norovirus infection,
usually associated with sudden onset illness of short duration,
suggests that the symptoms are not resolving rapidly. Further
information from an informed local source would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
