New Caledonia: Death toll Reaches 13, including 3 children
------------------------------------------------
A dengue fever outbreak gripping the French Pacific territory of New
Caledonia since January 2003 has claimed 13 lives and made 4000 people ill,
health authorities said today. A 66-year-old woman who was being treated in
a Noumea hospital became the latest victim. 3 of the 13 dead were young
children.

Dengue fever, spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is expected to
subside with the onset of winter in the southern hemisphere. The government
has battled to raise awareness of the outbreak and has carried out aerial
spraying of insecticides to kill mosquito larvae, although humidity and
intense heat have dampened efforts to thwart mosquitoes breeding.

Australia: Further 5 Suspected Cases in Townsville (Northern Queensland)
--------------------------------------------------
Townsville residents will soon get more information about dengue fever,
amid concerns about a growing number of locally acquired cases. Deputy
mayor Ann Bunnell says there are a further 5 suspected cases in the city,
and she is urging residents to play their part in preventing an epidemic.
Councillor Bunnell says residents will get letters outlining what they can
do to help.

"The message we need to get to the public of Townsville is dengue fever is
totally preventable," she said.

Vietnam: 8000 Cases and 16 Deaths in Southern Mekong Delta Region
--------------------------------------------------
About 8000 people have been infected with dengue fever in Vietnam in the
first 5 months of 2003, a 50 percent rise over the same period in 2002. The
health ministry says that 16 of those struck down with the disease have
died. The worst affected provinces are in the southern Mekong Delta region,
where moist and humid conditions provide ideal breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. The region has accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
Health officials say that serious outbreaks of the virus, which first
appeared in Vietnam in 1969, tend to occur every 4 or 5 years.

India (Kerala): 78 Dengue Fever Cases and 4 Deaths in Thiruvananthapuram
---------------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of dengue fever across the city. Faced with a
rising incidence of malaria and dengue fever cases in the city, the Health
authorities have sketched out an exigency plan to effectively tackle the 2
mosquito-transmitted diseases. The Director of Health Services, V. K.
Rajan, had convened an urgent meeting on Mon 2 Jun 2003 to discuss measures
to counter the twin menace.

Dengue cases [have been reported from] Venganoor, Pozhiyoor, Athiyannoor,
Parassala, Vamanapuram, Andoorkonam, and Sreekariyam. According to official
figures, there had been 78 cases of Dengue fever so far in 2003. At least 4
persons had been victims of dengue infection in the city, the latest death
being that of a 4-year-old child who had developed complications clinically
resembling Dengue Shock Syndrome following a viral infection at the SAT
Hospital last week. Health Department surveys have found that the incidence
of dengue was centred on rubber plantations.

Philippines: Dengue Fever Cases 61 Percent Higher Than 2002
-------------------------------------------------
Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit warned yesterday of increasing dengue cases,
with Metro Manila now having the highest number of reported cases. Although
there were no "hotspots" or outbreaks observed, Dayrit said 875 cases were
reported in the National Capital Region, more notably from Pinagbuhatan,
Pasig City. On the other hand, Central Visayas reported 752 cases of dengue
while 634 were recorded in Northern Mindanao. "Aside from SARS (Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome), we should be vigilant against dengue, as cases
are starting to increase," Dayrit said.

The Department of Health (DOH) has reported 4026 dengue cases nationwide as
of Mon 2 Jun 2003. This figure is 61 percent higher compared with the same
period in 2002. There were 54 deaths recorded. Ages of cases ranged from
one month to 87 years. 48 percent of the cases belonged to those aged 1 to
9 years. Case fatality ratios of one percent and above were noted among age
groups less than one year and 1-9 years.

Dayrit called on the public to maintain clean surroundings by discarding
old tires, bottles, or any receptacle [that could hold water] and unclogging
sewers and drain pipes to prevent dengue-carrying mosquitoes from breeding.
Dayrit explained it takes about a week for a larva to mature into a
mosquito. "[M]osquitoes should never be given the chance to breed and
multiply," he said.
