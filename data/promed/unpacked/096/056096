In the last four weeks, a total 28 cases of proven cholera have been
reported in the department of Arequipa. Added to the 39 cases reported
this year prior to October, a total of 67 cases is considered significant
because there has been a decrease in the incidence of cholera in recent years.
The figures were provided by the regional director of the Ministry of
Health, Gustavo Rondon Fudinaga, who denied that the new cases indicate
outbreak of the disease. Much to the contrary, he claimed that the cases
are isolated incidents among those who have ignored proper hygiene.
Moreover, he pointed out that new cases indicate a need for continued
education concerning hygiene and food handling. A preventative program has
been recently funded by the Ministry of Health.

[Earlier reports cited above remind us that there was a very large outbreak
of cholera in Peru in 1991-92. Health authorities have viewed subsequent
cases as "sporadic" cases. This situation bears watching, and ProMED-mail
would appreciate updates. - Mod.ES
