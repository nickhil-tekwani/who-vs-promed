A woman at Olimohamadpet in Kancheepuram town died today, while 9
persons were hospitalized with symptoms of cholera. Though officials
did not confirm the reason for the death of the woman, who was
admitted with severe vomiting and diarrhea, they did not give any
reason for the death of the lady and the illness of 10 persons who
were admitted with severe vomiting and diarrhoea.
Olimohamadpet is situated in the outskirts of Kancheepuram town and
several appalam factories and rice mills were functioning in the
area. [appalam (also called papadum, papadam, and papad) is an Indian
and Sri Lankan flatbread. Typically, it is prepared using black gram
bean flour, rice flour, or lentil flour with salt and peanut oil
added. The ingredients are made into a dough and formed into a thin,
round shape similar to a tortilla. As the dough is prepared, the
papadum can be seasoned with a variety of different ingredients such
as chilies, cumin, garlic, black pepper, or other spices - Mod.LL] It
is reported that the sewage discharged from the rice mills was
blocking the drainage pipes, resulting in stagnation of sewage water.
The sewage water had collected around the drinking water pipe in
Varadhappan Street. According to local people, the sewage water could
have contaminated the drinking water used by the people. This could
have caused cholera in the area, they said.
Kancheepuram municipal commissioner N.S. Prema visited the spot where
the sewage water was surrounding the drinking water pipe. She ordered
the removal of the drinking water pipe. A free medical camp for the
treatment of residents of Olimohamadpet is being organized and sewage
blocks were being cleared.

The 2-month-old cholera epidemic sweeping Sao Tome and Principe shows
no sign of letup, having claimed 5 more lives and doubling the number
of reported cases. According to reports reaching here on Mon, 19 Dec
2005, the spokesman for the national committee overseeing the
anti-cholera campaign, Jose Manuel de Carvalho, said that 5 more
people had died from the disease in the preceding 2 weeks for a total
of 25 fatalities.
In the same period, de Carvalho added, the number of cases more than
doubled to 1374 from 650. The outer island of Principe has so far
been spared. He repeated government appeals for increased attention
to personal and public hygiene to help staunch the highly infectious
disease.
Last week, a riot erupted in the archipelago's capital when a police
officer tried to enforce a ban on the sale of street food at a Sao
Tome market.

Malawi has made great strides in curbing cholera since 1973 when the
first cases were reported in the country. Deputy Health Minister
Charles Mchacha said while Malawi continues to face cholera every
rainy season, it is encouraging that the number of cases has
gradually reduced.
According to Mchacha, 166 cases of cholera have been reported in 2005
and among them, only 3 deaths have occurred. Affected districts
include Mangochi, Dedza, Blantyre, Thyolo and Chikwawa.
Malawi experienced one of the worst cholera outbreaks in 2003 when 33
000 cases were reported. That year, 1000 people died.
