Bacteria found in food of pricey birthday party at Boca Resort
-----------------------------------------------
A bacteria usually found in raw and undercooked seafood was detected in 2
of at least 96 people who got sick after an USD 80 000 birthday party at
Boca Raton Resort and Club, health officials said on Fri 24 Sep 2004.

While taking pains to not assign blame, the Palm Beach County Health
Department now thinks the bacteria _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ caused the
outbreak of severe diarrhea, nausea, cramps, and fever after the 18 Sep
2004 soiree, a spokesman said.

"We have an indicator now to include in our investigation of the party,"
department spokesman Timothy O'Connor said. "This fits the symptoms that
all the people had." The department is still investigating whether the food
contamination stemmed from improper handling at the resort, bad products
from food suppliers, or some other cause, O'Connor said. "It doesn't put
the blame on anybody at this point," he said.

The outbreak began the day after the 45th birthday party for a plastic
surgeon. The feast featured a menu of hors d'oeuvres, shrimp and scallop
appetizer, lobster, filet mignon, and cream-filled pastries. Health
investigators have talked to 121 of the 189 guests, 96 of whom got sick,
O'Connor said. Lab tests from more guests, and from food samples at the
resort, are pending.

The bacterium can be easily avoided by cooking seafood to at least 158
degrees for 15 minutes.
