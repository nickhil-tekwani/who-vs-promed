A parasitic disease once confined to developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America has surfaced in a Melbourne woman who has never been overseas.

The 25-year-old was found to have cysts on her brain after suffering migraines with 'visual aura' and blurred vision for 6 straight days. She was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, a serious disease that causes symptoms including seizures, headaches, blindness, meningitis, and dementia -- and had to have brain surgery to remove a lesion.

The medical community is mystified as to how she got the disease, which is usually confined to countries with poor sanitation and free-ranging pigs that have access to eating vegetation contaminated by human faeces.

The woman lived with her parents and siblings in an outer suburb of Melbourne and worked as a barista.

A case report on the Melbourne woman has been published by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene to put physicians on high alert for the possibility of infections in places like Australia where they least expect them.

Cysticercosis has previously been found in Australia only in immigrants or travellers recently returned from endemic areas.

'This is the 1st recorded autochthonous (homegrown) case of NCC (neurocysticercosis) in Australia,' the report says.

The disease is caused by a parasitic tapeworm found only in pigs and humans called _Taenia solium_.

The life-cycle of the parasite depends on humans passing the eggs in their faeces, which are then ingested by the pig. The pig develops parasitic cysts called cysticerci that lodge in its muscles.

When humans eat undercooked pork from the pig, they ingest the cysticerci which result in adult tapeworms attaching to their intestines -- and they can stay there for many years.

This does not cause the disease, however. The disease is caused when people excrete the tapeworm eggs in their faeces, and get some on their hands and don't wash them properly. Then they either put their hands in their mouths, infecting themselves, or prepare food for others, spreading the eggs.

Cysticercosis is caused when humans ingest the eggs of the tapeworm. The eggs hatch into tiny larvae that travel around the body in the blood and can lodge themselves in the heart, the central nervous system, and the brain where they cause cysticerci.

Neurocysticercosis is when cysticerci grow in the brain. 'These larval cysts ... are a major cause of adult onset seizures in most low-income countries,' the US CDC says on its website.

The case has sparked warnings that increasing international travel is spreading diseases such as neurocysticercosis to Australia.

According to the Melbourne woman's case report, she had suffered from regular migraines for 7 years -- since she was 18 years old. She would get a visual aura and migraine 2 or 3 times per month, which doctors dismissed with pain medication such as paracetamol or metoclopramide for migraines.

At age 25 when her headache lasted 6 days straight, however, doctors sent the woman for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan which found a lesion. When they operated on her and removed the lesion they found pork tapeworm larvae in a cysticercus.

After DNA testing, they determined the Melbourne woman's infection was linked to a strain common in Asia.

While less than 10 per cent of residents in the woman's suburb were born in Asia and less than 6 per cent in India, her work as a barista put her in contact with a wide range of people who were from or travelled to endemic areas.

'It is not surprising that with the high frequency and ease of travel between endemic and non-endemic regions, sporadic infection can occur in people, who would otherwise be considered at no or very low risk of infection,' the case report said.

A review of CC [cysticercosis] in SE Asia:
Aung AK, Spelman DW. _Taenia solium_ taeniasis and cysticercosis in Southeast Asia. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2016; 94(5): 947-54. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0684. Epub 2016. PMID: 26834197; PMCID: PMC4856625.

The strength of the report is that _T. solium_ was confirmed by sequencing of the cyst material removed from the brain.

It is not a surprise that the serology for _Taenia solium_ was negative. The brain is a sealed compartment and if the infection happened perhaps some years ago this would be suspected.

There is no doubt the patient must have been infected in Australia if travels to endemic areas can be ruled out, which seems to be the case. The report by Forster et al. hypothesizes that she was infected by someone from SE Asia excreting eggs of _T. solium_ in feces. - Mod.EP
