Biosecurity Queensland has confirmed a horse on a property near Bundaberg has been diagnosed with deadly Hendra virus. The infected horse was from a property in South Kolan on the western outskirts of Bundaberg.

Bundaberg vet Andrew Marland has told the ABC the sick animal was examined on Saturday and tests have confirmed it was suffering from Hendra. The horse was euthanized yesterday [18 Mar 2014].

"Oh look, it was a property that people, that the owners had taken basically every precaution they could to avoid this from happening other than unfortunately vaccinate their horses," he said.

Queensland chief vet Rick Symons says it is the 1st case of Hendra virus detected in Queensland this year [2014].

Dr. Symons says there is one other horse on the affected property.

"Tracing and risk assessments are being undertaken on any animals that may have had contact with the infected horse to work out if further testing needs to be done," he said.

"The property has been quarantined, which means restrictions apply to moving horses and horse materials on and off the property. The quarantine will be in place for at least one month.

"The timing of this case highlights the need for horse owners to remain vigilant in taking steps to reduce the risk of infection as Hendra virus can occur year-round.

"Vaccination is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses. It is recommended that horse owners speak to their veterinarian about vaccinating their horses.

"If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately. People in contact with horses need to remember to continue to practice good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus."

Last year [2013], there were 7 recorded outbreaks across Australia, across Queensland and northern New South Wales.

Hendra virus was 1st detected in a Brisbane racing stable in 1994.

[Hendra virus is a zoontic virus, meaning humans can become infected with the virus. As such, it seems that in an effort to protect the horse owners and veterinarians, Biosecurity Queensland would make the very effective vaccine mandatory.

It is very sad to lose your horse, but even worse if the virus were to claim the life of your loved one when a vaccine may well have prevented the heartache. In one of these outbreaks in the last few years, a dog was exposed and euthanized.

Horse owners need to vaccinate their horses and remove access from around fruit trees where flying foxes may roost.
