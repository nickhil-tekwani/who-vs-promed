Some 14 people hospitalized with suspected anthrax in Kyrgyzstan
----------------------------------------------------------------
Some 14 people were hospitalized with suspected anthrax in the
Jalal-Abad Region of Kyrgyzstan, the press service of the Kyrgyz
Ministry of Emergency Situations told Itar-Tass on Friday [2 Jul 2010].

"Six people sought medical aid in the Suzak district of the Jalal-Abad
Region. The anthrax diagnosis was confirmed in one of them. The
medical tests of other patients staying at the district hospital are
being examined," the press service reported.

A total of 7 more residents of the neighboring Nooken district are
also undergoing treatment at the district hospital, the ministry press
service said. "The preliminary tests showed that people could get
infected with anthrax in the Nooken district from the meat of an ill
domestic animal, which is under examination at a laboratory of the
Jalal-Abad sanitary epidemiological centre," the press service
reported. One more woman with the same diagnosis was hospitalized in
the Bazar-Korgon district.

Medical specialists believe that several anthrax spots are nested in
southern Kyrgyz regions. Local residents get infected with this
dangerous disease from time to time.

[Our thanks to Sabine for forwarding this report. The severe ongoing
hyper-enzootic condition in this part of Kyrgyzstan, which adjoins and
surrounds a similarly afflicted part of western Uzbekistan, was well
described by Jalalidin Gaibulin, Director of the Centre of Quarantine
and Dangerous Infections, Ministry of Health, Kyrgyz Republic in
January, 2009 (see 20090130.0415):

"Most cases were recorded in the Jalal-Abad region [province] with
Osh, Batken, and Chuy provinces next in the ratings. This bad
situation is connected with the high number of ground foci of anthrax.
Altogether in the republic, 1234 such places have been registered,
with 485 foci in Chuy province; 354 foci in Jalal-Abad province; 247
foci in Osh province; 124 foci in Issyk-Kul [Ysyk-Kol] province; 23
foci in Talas province; 5 foci each in Naryn and Batken provinces; and
1 focus in the city of Bishkek.

"The main reason for this ongoing situation is incomplete vaccination
coverage of livestock. The inhabitants also facilitate the situation.
They slaughter animals without veterinary inspection and sell the meat
of sick animals at markets. So, not only the people who slaughtered
the animals and contracted the disease, but also sellers and
customers, are at risk. The effective measure is compensation for
slaughtered animals. But the question now is not resolved."
