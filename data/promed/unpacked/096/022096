Form of avian flu found in BC
---------------------------------
A form of H5 avian flu virus has been found in wild birds in British
Columbia, the province's chief veterinarian said on Tuesday [1 Nov
2005], a day after nearly 3 dozen birds were reported to have the
virus in Quebec and Manitoba.

Dr. Ron Lewis said the result doesn't hike the risk to commercial
poultry farmers; rather, it serves as a reminder of the threats
carried by wild birds.

Farmers should focus their efforts on maintaining strict biosecurity
to keep their chickens from being exposed to wild birds, he said.

Lewis held a conference call in Victoria to announce that officials
found strongly positive samples of the H5 virus in 14 ducks in the
central Interior of British Columbia.

But he expects further tests to show that there is no evidence of the
H5N1 strain that is ravaging poultry stocks and occasionally
infecting people in Southeast Asia.

Provincial medical health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said the finding
poses no additional threat to human health.

"I would think hunters have been shooting and killing and eating
these birds that carry H5 and H7 and other influenza viruses for
centuries," Kendall said.

"Treat them like a chicken you would buy in a supermarket and
exercise appropriate hygiene. Wash your hands, don't get contaminated
raw juices mixed with other foods and cook the meat well."

Tests have determined about 174 ducks were positive for the H5 virus
from more than 700 samples that were taken from young ducks in
Merritt, BC in August 2005.

Lewis said 75 of those samples were weak or slightly positive and are
being tested again.

"I can tell you right off the top, there's no question we were
surprised by the large number of H5 samples," he said.

"But having said that, we've never tested birds in this flyway
before, so we really don't have any idea whether this is a normal
factor or whether these are increased numbers or whether they're
decreased numbers. It is just a snapshot surveillance at one
particular point in time."

The results provide no insight on what viruses may be carried by wild
fowl in the Fraser Valley, where the province's poultry operations
are concentrated. It was in this area last year [2004] that avian
influenza spread, likely from wild birds, to commercial poultry
barns, forcing the slaughter of 17 million birds.

Lewis said the evidence of H5 in Merritt is another wake up call for
farmers, not that they need another one.

"It gives poultry producers additional information that there's a
threat out there to their commercial poultry populations, and since
last year [2004], when we had that avian influenza outbreak as we're
all aware of in the Fraser Valley, there's been an awful lot of
effort both on the part of the Ministry of Agriculture and on the
part of producers to enhance biosecurity and beef things up
significantly to make sure that they're not exposed to viruses that
are in the environment that could pose a threat to their birds," Lewis said.

He hastened to say that there is little opportunity for wild birds
and commercial poultry to interact because of enhanced biosecurity.

BC is sending 57 samples to the National Centre for Foreign Animal
Disease in Winnipeg for further testing.

6 provinces are involved in testing wild waterfowl in Canada.

On Monday [31 Oct 2005], the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said
nearly 3 dozen wild waterfowl in Quebec and Manitoba have tested
positive for H5 avian flu viruses

Lewis said none of the birds tested in BC is sick, and none was
associated with any commercial poultry operations.

"There is no evidence of any disease in commercial poultry, no
evidence of any disease in waterfowl and certainly no evidence of any
disease in people handling these waterfowl," he said.

"We fully anticipate that when additional testing is done, these
samples will prove to be another strain apart from the H5N1 that
everybody is so very much aware of."

The outbreak of avian flu in 2004 eventually hit farms in a
70-km-wide swath from Vancouver's eastern suburbs to Chilliwack in
the eastern Fraser Valley. In the end, only about 3 million birds
were found to be diseased, and the rest were allowed to be sold to consumers.

On Monday [31 Oct 2005], Canadian officials said additional testing
of samples taken from the 28 wild birds in Quebec and 5 in Manitoba
should indicate by the end of the week whether the viruses are of the
H5N1 subtype or another H5 variety.

Even if the viruses turn out to be H5N1, that doesn't mean they are
closely related to the Asian strain, experts have said. Molecular
analysis of the viruses will have to be done to determine whether
they are linked. A different H5N1 could be far less dangerous than
the ones circulating in Southeast Asia.

Experts say typically there is little mingling of avian flu viruses
from the flyways of Eurasia and the Americas.

[We are anxious to find the results of the test. Although there are
other types of H5 influenza, there is clearly much awareness about
this particular strain, H5N1, of avian influenza. - Mod.TG]
