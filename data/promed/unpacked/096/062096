According to California State University (CSU) Immunization Requirements (Executive Order [EO] 803), students are permitted to attend a CSU for up to an entire academic year before providing proof of full immunization upon the campuses' discretion.

University spokesperson Matt Lazier wrote in an email to Mustang News that the CSU immunization policy requires proof of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines within 1 year of enrolment and for students who are 18 years old or younger when starting at a university must show proof of hepatitis B immunization. Lazier wrote that Cal Poly follows these rules. Religious exemptions and exemptions for distance learning students are allowed.

On 5 Mar 2019, a Cal Poly student was diagnosed with varicella, otherwise known as chickenpox. The varicella vaccine is not one of the required vaccinations, according to Lazier. Only the MMR and hepatitis B vaccines are required.

"Students who do not provide proof of full immunization by the beginning of the 2nd term of the academic year (that is, fall, winter, spring) shall not be allowed to enrol in future classes until proof of full immunization has been provided to the campus," the Cal Poly Immunization Policy reads.

How a student may bypass vaccinations past their 2nd term
---------------------------------------------------------
In January of 2016, Governor Jerry Brown passed a bill titled "SB 277", which banned the "personal or religious belief" vaccination exemption for schools. Currently, students can be exempt from immunization if forms are submitted by a physician stating that it would be medically unsafe for the individual to be immunized. After Brown's bill passed, the rate of medical exemptions nearly quadrupled, according to a study by the Journal of Pediatrics.

Currently, the CSU-wide immunization policy is under revision. According to Lazier the revised EO 803 will go into effect in the fall of 2020. Because the EO 803 is not yet revised, all students who either received vaccinations or were exempt while attending California Public School have satisfied the requirement to be admitted into the CSU System. "Students enrolled in a California Public School for the 7th grade or higher on or after 1 Jul 1999 will have satisfied this requirement," Chancellor Charles B Reed wrote in the EO 803.

In an immunization requirement form posted on Cal Poly's website, the form states that "students who graduated from a California Public high school after January 2005 do not need to complete and submit this form to provide proof of immunization against measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B." However, due to the permissible "personal belief" exemption that was in place prior to 2016, there is no promise that all public school kids were vaccinated, according to County of San Luis Obispo Public Health Department Health Agency communications coordinator Tara Kennon. "While the state public health department and local school systems would have recommended that people who attended public school in [California] receive immunizations, personal belief exemptions were allowed until 2016 -- so there was no guarantee that all public school students would be vaccinated," Kennon wrote.

Data collected from the California Department of Public Health concluded that in San Luis Obispo county the overall average percentage of students up to date on their vaccines in the 7th grade public school system was 96.78%. The county-wide private school system's percentages were significantly lower, at 89.8% up to date in the 2017-2018 school year. In order to prevent measles from spreading, 90-94% of people must be vaccinated in order to achieve "herd immunity."

[Varicella vaccination is not one of the required immunizations to enrol at CSU and Cal Poly; only MMR and hepatitis are actually required. And proof of vaccination with MMR and hepatitis vaccines is not required for up to one year following entry at CSU. The Executive Order currently is being revised and will be in place in 2020, but there is no indication varicella will be included. Medical exemptions to the MMR and hepatitis vaccines is allowed, but unfortunately, after passage of the bill disallowing personal and religious exemptions in 2016 in California, medical exemptions quadrupled (See Mohanty S, Buttenheim AM, Joyce CM, et al. Experiences with medical exemptions after a change in vaccine exemption policy in California. Pediatrics. 2018; 142(5): e20181051; http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30373910). This study concludes that "without additional legal changes, including a standardized review of medical exemptions, some physicians may continue to write medical exemptions for vaccine hesitant parents." This is a hurdle to achieving 95% immunization rates to provide herd immunity. As a matter of note, meningococcal immunization is also voluntary. - Mod.LK
