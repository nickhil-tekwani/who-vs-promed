HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME - CANADA (BRITISH COLUMBIA): CORRECTION

As Moderator I have to apologise for propagating an error in my
comment appended to the ProMED-mail post entitled "Hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome - Canada (BC) Archive number 20060622.1725." My
comment was copied verbatim from an earlier post (Hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome - Canada: background 20030415.0919) containing
data extracted from the Gideon Database).
The data in the Gideon Database were subsequently amended and I
failed to recollect that Dr. Mike Drebot, Head of Viral Zoonoses at
the National Microbiology Laboratory, Health Canada, Winnipeg had
written to ProMED-mail in April 2003 (Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
- Canada: background (02) 20030418.0954 and earlier) indicating that
my statement that 7 different hantaviruses had been identified in
Canada was incorrect.
Dr. Drebot wrote that: "Although it is possible that several
species/genotypes of hantaviruses are present in Canada, only Sin
Nombre virus and Prospect Hill virus have actually been documented by
serological and phylogenetic characterization (Drebot et al., 2000,
Can Commun Dis Rep 26-08, 65-69; Drebot et al., 2001, Virus Research
75:75-86) to be associated with rodents in this country."
I am indebted to Dr. Drebot for drawing my attention to this error. - Mod.CP]
