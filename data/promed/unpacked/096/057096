[About 2 years ago, in March of 2016, Mexico reported 3 outbreaks of Newcastle disease in the state of Jalisco. See section 3 of the Mexico OIE Annual report, available at https://tinyurl.com/y6y5f7al. Given that these recent cases were all identified in backyard flocks, it is likely that the virus is circulating more broadly in such environments. Increased surveillance in the affected states may uncover additional cases. - Mod.CRD
