----------------------------------------------------------------------
The description of fever with body aches and skin rash, fever lasting 2-3 weeks, negative for dengue and chikungunya by lab tests, occurring in the post-heavy-rains season, in Mysuru, looks very much like Leptospirosis.

Lab diagnosis for leptospirosis is not widely available, but local Health Department staff can access the National Center for Disease Control in Delhi and get immediate guidance. One helpful clinical sign I have noted is calf tenderness which is not common in other fevers with body aches. Early antibiotic treatment will not only reduce the period of fever but also prevent subsequent complications affecting various organs. Calling every outbreak of fever as viral is a common error.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr John for his comments and suggestion that leptospirosis may be the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of the unspecified number of cases termed viral fever. Although leptospirosis is a possible cause of these cases, one should also consider the possibility of Seoul hantavirus since the symptoms of the 2 pathogens are identical, as pointed out recently by Dr. Jan Clement (see Leptospirosis - India (03): (MH) comment 20171115.5445916). Adequate laboratory support is essential to establish a reliable diagnosis in outbreaks of undiagnosed illnesses such as these. - Mod.TY
