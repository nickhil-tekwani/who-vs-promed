Follow-up report No. 1
Text of a fax received on 6 July 1998 from Dr J.M. Scudamore, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Surbiton:
End of previous report period: 22 May 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[20, 73, dated 22 May 1998). End of this report period: 6 July 1998.
Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) has been confirmed on four marine salmon
farms in addition to the original two farms notified to the OIE. This
brings the total number of farms in Scotland on which ISA has been
confirmed to six: two in Loch Nevis, one in Loch Snizort and three in Loch
Creran.
On the confirmed [affected farms, fish have been killed and destroyed
under the supervision of the official service; dead fish were ensiled in
propionic acid (pH < 4.0), and then disposed of in accordance with the EC
animal waste directive (90/667/EEC). Where fish have been of a size
suitable for marketing, those without any clinical signs of disease were
slaughtered and gutted under the supervision of the official service for
processing and marketing for human consumption; the fish have been
transported to the processing plant in such a way that all infectious
material was contained, the fish waste and offal has been disposed in
accordance with the EC animal waste directive 90/667/EEC, and the waste
water from the processing plant has been disinfected.
Two farms remain in these 'infected' Loch systems and both are considered
as suspected of being infected. Additionally, within the wider coastal
area, three farms (in Loch Linnhe, close to Loch Creran) have now been
declared suspected of being infected. All these suspect sites are subject
to control action in accordance with the EC control measures directive;
movement restrictions have been put in place, disinfection has been put in
place at entrances and exits of all sites, disposal of dead fish is being
carried out in accordance with the EC animal waste directive and sites are
subject to intensive surveillance by the official service. Where
appropriate, early harvest of marketable fish is being encouraged.
Farms in the wider coastal area remain under official surveillance.
Diagnosis: Advice and assistance on diagnosis of the disease continues to
be received from the OIE Reference Laboratory for ISA (National Veterinary
Institute, Oslo, Norway) and the EU Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases
(at Arhus, Denmark).
Epizootic investigations: Epizootic investigations have been set in hand.
These comprise an investigation of the duration of the infection, the
origins of the virus, movements of fish, people or equipment likely to have
transmitted the infection, and the possible existence and distribution of
carriers. Investigations are in their early stages.
