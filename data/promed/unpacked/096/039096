As of 1 PM (ET) Tue 3 Oct 2006, 192 persons infected with the outbreak
strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported to CDC from 26 states.
Among the ill persons, 98 (51 percent) were hospitalized, 30 (16 percent)
developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS),
and an adult in Wisconsin died. 136 (71 percent) were female and 20 (11
percent) were children under 5 years old. The proportion of persons who
developed HUS was 28 percent in children (less than 18 years old), 9
percent in persons 18 to 59 years old, and 14 percent in persons 60 years
old or older. Among ill persons who provided the date when their illnesses
began, 80 percent became ill between 19 Aug and 5 Sep 2006. The peak time
when illnesses began was 30 Aug to 1 Sep 2006; 31 percent of persons with
the outbreak strain became ill on one of those 3 days.
_E. coli_ O157 was isolated from 11 packages of spinach supplied by
patients living in 9 states. All packages were marketed as baby spinach and
labeled with the same brand name. The "DNA fingerprints" of all 11 of these
_E. coli_ match that of the outbreak strain.

[Since the last CDC posting reported through 1 pm as of 28 Sep 2006, in the
last 5 days, there have been 5 more infections included, with an additional
hospitalization and an additional case of HUS. Two more "smoking gun" bags
of spinach have been identified. No additional states are included, and the
2 other possibly linked deaths are still being investigated.
The number of cases of HUS in this cluster has been higher than usual,
especially since most cases were not in young children. It is possible that
this particular strain of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC, also
called VTEC (for Verotoxin Producing _E. coli_) may have been more
virulent. For a discussion related to this, see the moderator's discussion
near the end of this posting. - Mod.LL]

_E. coli_ similar to that linked to a recent deadly outbreak has been found
in 8 fecal samples collected near 2 California farms that may have been a
source of contaminated spinach.
It will be several more days, however, before investigators know whether
the type of _E. coli_ found matches the strain of the bacteria that, since
the end of August 2006, has sickened 193 people in 26 states and Canada and
killed at least one elderly woman in Wisconsin.
The FDA late last week rescinded its mid-September 2006 warning to
consumers to avoid all fresh spinach and declared it safe to eat, with the
exception of spinach recalled by Natural Selection Foods LLC, a processor
linked to the outbreak, and 4 other packers Natural Selection supplied.
Investigators narrowed the potential source of the outbreak to 12 fields on
9 farms in California's Salinas Valley and have collected hundreds of
water, soil, plant and animal waste samples, which are still being analyzed.
The 8 samples that tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7 were taken from
cattle feces collected from pastures adjacent to spinach fields on 2 of the
farms, Kevin Reilly, a top California food safety official, said yesterday
[3 Oct 2006].
The discovery of this particularly toxic strain of _E. coli_ in cattle
feces "was not a big surprise," Reilly said. _E. coli_ is normally found in
the digestive system of humans and other warm-blooded animals.
The question for investigators, he said, is whether there is "any link
between this particular finding and the outbreak strain."
_E. coli_ in pastures could potentially contaminate spinach growing nearby
if it ends up in irrigation water or runoff, Reilly said.
The latest _E. coli_ outbreak is the 20th associated with leafy greens over
the past 10 years and the 9th traced to the Salinas Valley.

[Analysis of these and any other environmental isolates of the organism are
awaited to see whether there is a genetic link to the outbreak strain,
which may well be a more virulent form of the organism.
Soon to be published are a manuscript (Bielaszewska M, Friedrich AW, Aldick
T, et al: Shiga toxin activatable by intestinal mucus in _Escherichia coli_
isolated from humans: Predictor for a severe clinical outcome. Clin Infect
Dis - in press) and an editorial (Orth D, Wurzner R: What makes an
enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_? Clin Infect Dis - in press) that
address the issue of virulence of STEC, particularly in relationship to the
genotypes of Shiga toxins Stx1 and Stx2.
As summarized by Orth and Wurzner (the citation numbers are those in the
editorial),
"Stxs can be divided into 2 major groups: Stx1 (which is almost identical
to Stx produced by _Shigella dysenteriae_) and Stx2. The Stx1 group
consists of Stx1, Stx1c, and Stx1d. The Stx2 group consists of Stx2, Stx2c,
Stx2d, Stx2dactivatable, Stx2e, and Stx2f (4).
There is an increasing body of evidence that the stx genotype is associated
with the severity of disease and strongly determines the likelihood of
progression to HUS. Patients infected with EHEC strains that harbor stx2 as
the sole stx gene have been found to develop HUS significantly more
frequently than patients infected with strains harboring stx1 alone or stx1
in combination with stx2. In addition, stx2c has been associated with HUS (4).
Although the presence of stx2 and stx2c is associated with an increased
probability of HUS development, STEC that carry stx2d or stx2e can be
considered to be LP-STEC [LP = low pathogenicity - Mod.LL], irrespective of
the presence of other virulence factors. The former strains have been
associated with non-bloody diarrhea but not with HUS (4, 5); the latter
strains mainly cause edema in pigs, and the rare human isolates originate
from patients with mild diarrhea or from asymptomatic carriers (6).
In their report, Bielaszewska et al. (7) focus on a very interesting Stx:
namely, a type of Stx with cytotoxicity that is activated by human and
mouse intestinal mucus and, therefore, is designated Stx2d-activatable.
Bielaszewska et al. show that the activatable phenotype is regularly
expressed by the clinical isolates that harbor the corresponding gene.
Therefore, the activation of this Stx by human intestinal mucus in vivo
during infection may increase the virulence of such strains."

by intestinal mucus in Escherichia coli isolated from humans: predictor for
a severe clinical outcome. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43:XXX-XX.
Indeed in Bielaszewska's paper, she and her colleagues in Munster, Germany
report that:
"The stx2d-activatable gene was identified in 60 (6.5 percent) of 922 STEC
strains [not all O157:H7 - Mod.LL]; in 31 of these strains, it was the sole
stx gene. 30 of these 31 strains produced Stx2d-activatable. All of them
lacked the intimin-encoding eae gene. Among eae-negative STEC, which
typically cause mild diarrhea or asymptomatic infection, production of
Stx2d-activatable was significantly associated with the ability to cause
severe disease, including bloody diarrhea (p less than .001), and with
systemic complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (p less than .001)."
This activatable genotype of Stxd appears to be an important marker to
assess risk of serious outcomes in STEC infections. It would be quite
interesting to see whether it is present in the current outbreak strain.
Additionally, in the editorial, the authors report that the EU-ENTERNET
meeting held in Prague in September 2006 felt that the following terms for
STEC organisms are useful:
HI-STEC: HUS-inducing STEC
DI-STEC: Diarrhea-inducing STEC
LP-STEC: STEC that does not produce diarrhea (low pathogenicity) - Mod.LL]
