Virus blamed for deer die-off near Corvallis
--------------------------------------------
Adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD) is the
likely cause of death in as many as 20
black-tailed deer in a Corvallis neighborhood
during the past month, according to pathology
tests conducted by state veterinarians. Since 23
Jul 2010, veterinarians from the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife and Oregon State
University have confirmed AHD as the cause of
death in 2 deer carcasses recovered in the Timberhill area.

Several other carcasses collected in the
Timberhill area also have signs consistent with
AHD, according to Dr. Julia Burco, the
department's district wildlife veterinarian.

Timberhill is located in northeast Corvallis next
to the university's McDonald-Dunn Research Forest.

AHD affects only deer and poses no risk to
humans, pets or livestock, according to Burco.
The disease is spread primarily by direct
deer-to-deer contact and has signs that include
foaming or drooling at the mouth, diarrhea, seizures and weakness.

Fawns are the most susceptible to the disease
because of their poorly developed immune systems.
Deer exposed to the virus often die within 3 to 5
days. There is no known cure or effective treatment for affected animals.

So far the outbreak appears to be limited to a
herd concentrated in the Corvallis area, although
the disease has shown up at other times in other parts of the state.

It was described as the cause of a die-off
affecting thousands of California mule deer in
1993 and 1994. It also was responsible for a
smaller outbreak, killing more than 400 animals
in 2002 in the Crooked River Ranch area near
Sisters. Deer are more susceptible to the virus
when they congregate in small areas, according to Burco.

To keep that from happening, Fish and Wildlife
staff encourage people not to provide water or
feed for deer to reduce the likelihood they will
gather in groups, increasing the possibility of
disease transmission between animals. In addition
to spreading disease through direct contact,
infected deer can shed the virus into a water
source or feed pile, possibly infecting future
deer that try to eat or drink at the site.

[The scientific name is _Odocoileus columbianus_
for Black-tailed deer or Blacktail deer. White
tail deer are _Odocoileus virginianus_. The
black-tailed deer, just like the white-tailed
deer are members of the family Cervidae.

Adenoviruses belong to a small group of viruses
that can infect a wide variety of animals, both
wild and domestic. The AHD virus of deer was 1st
identified in California in 1994.

Infected deer can have clinical signs common to
other diseases such as bluetongue or pneumonia.
Chronic symptoms include ulcers and abscesses in
the mouth and throat. Acute symptoms include
rapid or open mouth breathing, foaming or
drooling at the mouth, diarrhea (possibly
bloody), weakness, and copious amounts of fluid
in the body cavity. Death can occur within 3 - 5
days from the time the deer was exposed to the virus.

In 2001, the Oregon State University Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the presence of
AHD in one adult black-tailed deer doe from
southwest Oregon. Biologists suspect that the
deaths of several dozen other deer from the same
area also may have been caused by AHD. In 2002,
ODFW and the Oregon State University Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the presence of
AHD in a viral disease outbreak in Central Oregon
(Deschutes, Jefferson, and Wasco counties).
Between 9 May 2002 and 1 Aug 2002, an estimated
400-plus deer died from the virus in the Crooked
River Ranch area and near Sisters, Oregon.

AHD can cause large-scale disease outbreaks under
certain conditions. AHD has been diagnosed in
both mule deer and black-tailed deer in
California. Researchers suspect white-tailed deer
also could be susceptible. There is no treatment
for individual deer infected with AHD.
Monitoring, proper carcass disposal, and not
moving infected live deer are methods to minimize
movement of the disease to new areas. ODFW staff
are currently attempting to determine how
widespread the disease may be. The 1993Â—1994
California outbreak killed several thousand deer in 17 counties.

Transmission is by direct contact between deer,
contact with bodily fluids, and possibly airborne
routes. High density deer populations could have
a higher risk for the disease due to the ease of
transmission. The time between exposure to the
virus and showing signs of illness or death is
commonly less than one week. It is not known if
this disease has been present long-term in Oregon
deer herds, or if it recently arrived. ODFW staff
is encouraging people to avoid providing feed or
water stations for deer because these activities
may assist in spreading the disease if it is present.

There are no known cases of humans getting sick
from AHD. However, if living or hunting in an
infected area, it is a good idea to wear rubber
gloves when handling carcasses. People who may be
sick for any reason or who have a compromised
immune system should also take special
precautions around these carcasses. There are no
known health risks of eating meat from a deer
infected with AHD. However, experts recommend
thoroughly cooking any the meat from animals from an infected area. - Mod.TG]
