600 bird carcasses found in Ladakh, bird flu spread ruled out
-----------------------------------------------
About 600 carcasses of migratory birds, blamed for the spread of bird
flu in several countries across the globe, were found near the
Pangong Lake in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir some weeks
ago, sources said today [5 Feb 2006].
They said the dead birds were found near the Lake, which lies in the
northeast of Leh, in December last year [2005].
The sources said the birds could have possibly died of H5N1 avian
influenza (commonly known as bird flu).
However, the sources ruled out spread of the bird flu or any disease,
as there is no population around the famous blue brackish lake, half
of which runs to the other side of the India-China border.
The black-necked Siberian crane could be found around the Mahe
marshes, which are the only breeding ground for the migratory birds
in the lake.
The sources said one bird death was reported from Hokursar bird
sanctuary near here. The carcass has been sent to the High Security
Laboratory at Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh, which has a facility for
diagnosis of bird flu.
Talking to UNI, Deputy Director of the state Animal Husbandry
Department, Dr. Farooq Ahmed Kaloo, said there have been no reports
of the H5N1 virus in poultry or migratory birds in Jammu and Kashmir.
He said Jammu and Kashmir have unique protection from any such
disease carried by migratory birds.
"The state has natural filtration in the form of [the] mighty
Himalayas against diseases which are carried by migratory birds. Any
vector (affected bird) with compromised immunity gets killed on the
way," Dr. Kaloo added.

Toxic Yamuna water killed 47 birds
---------------------------------------
A day after 47 carcasses of migratory birds were found in the Indian
capital, experts said they believed the birds had died due to toxic
elements in the waters of the Yamuna river and not because of bird flu.
"We conducted post mortem examination on 3 birds at the Okhla Bird
Sanctuary, and we found the deaths were due to toxic water and not
flu," said Pragya Paromita Baruah, program officer with Wildlife
Trust of India (WTI).
"But we don't want to take any chances and have therefore sent the
carcasses for further tests," said Pragya.
WTI has sent one bird carcass to the animal disease laboratory at
Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and 2 to the Indian Veterinary Research
Institute for tests.
WTI officials had found 47 dead birds, all of them migratory species,
at Okhla Bird Sanctuary Saturday [4 Feb 2006]. They also found at
least 6 dead fish, which too have been sent for tests.
The fact that all the dead birds were migratory species and not local
ones has led experts to believe they died after drinking the highly
polluted waters of the Yamuna.
"It seems that the birds in the Okhla Bird Sanctuary have become
accustomed to drinking poor quality water, and the migratory birds
died because of that," Pragya said.
Sanjeev Baruah, assistant program officer with WTI, said the dead
fish seemed to have died because of the toxic water, and we have also
sent the fish for tests."
During the post mortem of the 3 birds, small fish were found within
their stomachs, he said.
Pragya said the dead birds were found floating in the water by some
people who were taking a walk in the area Saturday [4 Feb 2006]. They
informed the authorities of the bird sanctuary.
"We found the carcasses of birds like the shoveller duck, little
egret, little cormorant, common teal, brown headed gull and black
headed gull in the area," Sanjeev said.
Pragya noted that WTI officials had found dead fish in the area
several times in the past. Information about the dead fish was given
to the authorities who had taken no action on it, she claimed.

Nigeria testing birds found dead in north
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities are testing birds that mysteriously died in northern
Nigeria and called on poultry farmers to report cases of sickened
fowl, officials said on Sunday [5 Feb 2006].

Samples from birds that died in northern Kano State "in an outbreak
of a strange poultry disease" were sent for testing to 2 Nigerian
veterinary institutes, Agriculture Ministry official Salihu Jibrin
said, but did not say when results were expected.
He refused to speculate on whether the birds might have been infected
with bird flu, of which there have been no known cases in West
Africa. Health officials fear, however, the virus could enter
impoverished regions where many households raise chickens for
personal consumption.
"I lost 15 adult birds in one day," poultry farmer Abubakar Ibrahim
said in Kurnan Asabe, a village in Kano. "I initially noticed
restiveness among the birds before they started dying off one after the other."
Authorities urged farmers to monitor their flocks and report strange
ailments to authorities. "They are also advised to properly dispose
of dead birds in a hygienic manner to avoid further spread of the
disease," he said.
Kano state set up a committee of veterinary surgeons to visit farms
and watch out for evidence of a bird flu outbreak.

[Though the odds that the above 3 events are related to AI are rather
remote, they are posted for 2 main reasons: to commend the relevant
authorities for their justified alertness and to request the outcome
of the investigations.
It would also help if general statements on death in "birds" include
species names. The same need for specificity is applicable to
statements on "toxic water" or "toxic elements." - Mod.AS]
