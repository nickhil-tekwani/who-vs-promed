Del Monte Foods Inc. issued a recall of some of its canned corn this week [week of Mon 10 Dec 2018]. Del Monte's fiesta corn seasoned with red and green peppers is underprocessed and could result in, "contamination by spoilage organisms or pathogens, which could lead to life-threatening illness if consumed," the company said.

Although it is more of a concern in home-canned food, the bacterium that causes botulism can be found in store-bought canned food that has not been properly preserved, canned, or fermented, according to the CDC.

Consuming food that is contaminated with botulinum toxin can cause botulism, which can be fatal. Symptoms of botulism can begin 6 hours to 10 days after consuming the toxin, which causes muscle weakness and paralysis. The paralysis can lead to blurred vision, double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble breathing and swallowing, and feelings of dry mouth and thick tongue. According to the CDC, there were 29 cases of foodborne botulism in the USA in 2016.

No illnesses associated with the recalled corn have been reported, according to Del Monte.

The recall is for 64 242 cases that were distributed to 25 US states and in 12 countries: Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, El Salvador, Haiti, Guyana, Uruguay, Aruba, Panama, Saint Lucia, and Suriname. All of the recalled corn was sold in 15.25 oz [432 g] cans with the UPC number 24000 02770. The cans are marked with any of the following "best buy" dates: 14 Aug 2021, 15 Aug 2021, 16 Aug 2021, 3 Sep 2021, 4 Sep 2021, 5 Sep 2021, 6 Sep 2021, 22 Sep 2021, 23 Sep 2021.

Consumers can return the recalled corn to the place of purchase or contact Del Monte for a refund but should not consume the corn.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
