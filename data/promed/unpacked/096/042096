Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 3 new cases of wild poliovirus (WPV1) and 4 WPV1 positive environmental samples.
- Pakistan: no new case of wild poliovirus (WPV1) and 7 WPV1 positive environmental samples.
- Papua New Guinea: 3 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) and 3 cVDPV1 positive environmental samples.
- Democratic Republic of Congo: 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).
- Nigeria: 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).
- Somalia: 4 new cVDPV2 positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- 3 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported from Maywand district, Kandahar province, from Pornus district, Nuristan province, and from Nawzad district, Hilmand province with onset of paralysis on [24, 26 Sep 2018, and 2 Oct 2018] respectively. This brings the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country to 19.
- 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported, one from Hilmand province, collected on [25 Sep 2018] and 3 from Kandahar province, all collected on [3 Oct 2018].
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly-reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps which must be filled, to achieve eradication.
- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.
- The 3 remaining endemic countries continue to intensify their eradication efforts, through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis, to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (that is, due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc.), and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritise technical assistance to those areas.
- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible, if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled, and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.
- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralysed by any poliovirus -- be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Pakistan
- No new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country remains 6.
- 7 positive WPV1 environmental samples have been reported across Pakistan: 2 in Rawalpindi district, Punjab province; 2 in Lahore district, Punjab province; 1 in Peshawar district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; 1 in Gadap Town, Karachi district, Sindh province, and in Islamabad, Federal Capital Territory, collected from [10 to 11 Oct 2018].
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year [2018] from only 4 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except 1 from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. 20 years ago, the entirely country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralysed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week: 1 from Daura LGA [local government area], Katsina state with onset of paralysis on [18 Sep 2018] and 1 from Monguno LGA, Borno state, with onset of paralysis on [25 Sep 2018]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Nigeria in 2018 is 19.
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The 36th Expert Review Committee for Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization (ERC), the independent technical advisory group in the country, met in Abuja on [29-30 Oct 2018] to review the evolving epidemiology and programmatic implications. The group concluded: Nigeria must maintain momentum by focusing on the remaining inaccessible areas through high quality (above 90% coverage) Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) to prevent cVDPV2 outbreaks and reach the last remaining 70 000 children in Borno. A complete updated risk assessment of Kano state -- it is likely to be infected -- in the next mOPV2 rounds. Properly document the use of intradermal fractional dose of IPV (fIPV) in November [2018] since it is the 1st experience of fIPV use in AFRO.
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.
- Nigeria has enlisted the help of religious leaders and clerics to support the polio eradication efforts and encourage the community's men to allow accessibility of immunization and basic healthcare for their wives and children.

Lake Chad Basin
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in the past week. There are 6 total number of cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 case in Jigawa and Katsina states, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [7 Sep 2018].
- 2 mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns will reach 3.2 million children under 5 years of age in 4 provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi, and Zinder). The 1st round took place from [24 through 27 Oct 2018] and the 2nd is scheduled for [7 through 11 Nov 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.
- WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health are working together to finalize the deployment of the human resources needed at national and provincial levels.

Central Africa
- 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from Yamaluka district, Mongala province, with onset of paralysis on [9 Aug 2018]. The total number of cases detected in the country in 2018 is 16.
- DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the 'Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication'. The high-level meeting was convened by HE the Minister of Health, as well as the WHO Director-General and the Regional Director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was first confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- 4 new positive cVDPV2 environmental samples were reported this week from Somalia -- all in Banadir region -- collected from [30 Aug 2018 to 20 Sep 2018].
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- 3 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week from Jiwaka province, Gulf province, and Southern Highlands province, with dates of onset of paralysis on [20 Aug 2018, 29 Aug 2018, and 8 Sep 2018], respectively.
- The total number of cases in the country in 2018 is now 21.
- 3 new cVDPV1 positive environmental samples were reported from the Capital city, Port Moresby, all collected on [1 Oct 2018].
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nation-wide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- Recent Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) mission to Syria has recommended to close the Syrian outbreak.

It is very disturbing to me as a moderator to prepare a report that would not contain the names of involved areas (in this case, countries), in the title and subject lines, as we have decided that more than 3 or 4 locations would classify a report as global/worldwide if multiple countries are involved, or country-wide if provinces/states/regions are involved. I use the word disturbing not as a criticism of our policy, but rather as a reaction to the information in the report above, which shows WPV1 activity in 2 countries (Afghanistan with both active newly identified cases as well as positive environmental samples, and Pakistan with positive environmental samples in multiple areas in the country), and cVDPV activity in 4 countries (Nigeria - 2 new cases, DR Congo - 1 new case, Somalia - positive environmental samples and Papua New Guinea - 3 new cases).

That being said, note the GPEI comment "- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly-reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps which must be filled, to achieve eradication."

I think the question raised by Prof Shulman in item [2] below is an important one that will need to be revisited as time goes on: At what point in time will we need to completely eliminate any use of OPV in order to achieve the goal of eradication of all polioviruses - both WPVs as well as cVDPVs?

[2] Request for information on genetic diversion of cVDPV2 in Nigeria
Date: Thu 1 Nov 2018
From: Lester M Shulman <lester.shulman@bezeqint.net> [edited]


Re: ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis update (52): Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Niger, WHO 20181031.6122468
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Request for information.
Poliomyelitis Update (52) indicated that there are currently 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Nigeria.

1. "From July through September 2018, 6 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 case in Jigawa and Katsina states, Nigeria.... This outbreak has also affected Jigawa, Katsina, Yobe, Gombe, and Borno states in Nigeria, with 17 cases reported since April 2018.

2. "Nigeria has also reported a separate cVDPV2 outbreak in Sokoto state that dates back to January 2018. Nigeria is one of only 3 countries in the world classified as endemic for wild poliovirus, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan."

What is the percent nucleotide divergence of the VP1 capsid protein of the isolates from both outbreaks? Type 2 poliovirus is considered to be vaccine-derived when VP1 divergence reaches greater than 0.6% and circulating polioviruses diverge at approximately 1% per year. Is it possible to estimate when each of the outbreaks started in relation to the global withdrawal of the use of live OPV type 2 that was mandated to occur between [17 Apr 2016] and 1 May 2016? Specifically did the VDPV2s emerge before or after cessation of use of trivalent OPV. The answer is important for risk analysis for use of monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2) for outbreak control. [ProMED's posting referenced above] indicated that "the last monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) round was implemented in Niger in January 2017."

[Professor Shulman raises a very good point and it would be interesting to know whether the cVDPV2 outbreaks in Nigeria are related to the use of the trivalent OPV or the monovalent OPV. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources.

I would also add that the cVDPV cases identified during 2018 include all 3 polio types -- cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea, cVDPV2 in Nigeria, Niger, DR Congo, cVDPV2, and cVDPV3 in Somalia. So another question might well relate to a risk assessment on the use of bivalent OPV and the development of cVDPVs. - Mod.MPP]
