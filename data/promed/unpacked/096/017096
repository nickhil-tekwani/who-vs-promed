The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says an outbreak of hepatitis A linked to a frozen berry mix sold at Costco has grown to 87 people with illnesses in 8 states. CDC said on Tuesday [11 Jun 2013] that illnesses have been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington.

Townsend Farms of Fairview, Oregon last week [4 Jun 2013] recalled its frozen Organic Antioxidant Blend, packaged under the Townsend Farms label at Costco and under the Harris Teeter brand at those stores. So far the illnesses have only been linked to the berries sold at Costco. Craig Wilson, director of food safety at Costco, said the store is providing vaccinations for people who ate the berries within the past 2 weeks and is reimbursing others who have gotten the vaccine outside the store. The store has contacted about 240 000 people who purchased the berries at one of their stores, Wilson said. The company knows who bought the berries because purchases are linked to a membership card that customers present when they check out.

The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the cause of the outbreak. CDC said the strain of hepatitis [A virus] is rarely seen in North or South America but is found in the North Africa and Middle East regions. Townsend Farms has said the frozen organic blend bag includes pomegranate seeds from Turkey.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that can last from a few weeks to a several months. People often contract it when an infected food handler prepares food without appropriate hand hygiene. CDC said that food already contaminated with the virus can also cause outbreaks, as is suspected in this case. Illnesses occur within 15 to 50 days of time of exposure to the hepatitis A virus, CDC said. Symptoms include fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, abnormal liver tests, dark urine, and pale stool. Vaccination can prevent illness if given within 2 weeks of exposure, and those who have already been vaccinated are unlikely to become ill.

CDC said the illnesses date back to mid-March [2013]. The same genotype of hepatitis A was identified in an outbreak in Europe linked to frozen berries this year and a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia related to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt.

[The recall (by the supplier) of the contaminated frozen berry fruit product from approximately 240 000 identified recipients, and the offer of free hepatitis A vaccination, must be something of a record. The hepatitis A virus contamination of the frozen berry fruit product is being attributed to pomegranate seeds sourced from the Middle East. CDC said all of the victims are older than 18, ranging from 25 to 71 years old. The 1st illnesses were reported at the end of April 2013.

The same genotype of hepatitis A was identified in an outbreak in Europe linked to frozen berries earlier this year (2013), the CDC said, as well as a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia related to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt. In addition to the United States and Turkey, the agency said the Townsend Farms berries also included products from Argentina and Chile. It is not known if the frozen berry fruit products sold in Europe contained pomegranate seeds.

According to an Associated Press (AP) report the CDC stated all of the victims are older than 18, ranging from 25 to 71 years old, and the 1st illnesses were reported at the end of April 2013. The government has not announced a recall, but CDC recommended that retailers and other food service operators should not sell or serve Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend. - Mod.CP
