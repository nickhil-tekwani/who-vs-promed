[Classical swine fever is a disease of great concern to intensive
swine raising facilities wherever they are located -- in Canada,
United States, Mexico, or other parts of the Western Hemisphere
especially including Brazil. The disease can be devastating to
intensive swine operations because of rapid spread and high
mortality. It is for this reason that consistent OIE reporting is
important, especially in light of the periodic outbreaks reported in
Central America. In this case, the outbreak looks circumscribed and
it is followed up with intensive eradication and surveillance
activities, for which the Nicaraguan animal health authorities should
be congratulated. For a map, see complete OIE report at
