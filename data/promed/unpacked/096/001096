Despite the fact that Egypt is more than 4 months into the worst H5N1 outbreak since the virus emerged in the mid-1990s -- with at last count 115 human cases since 1 Nov 2014 -- we get very little day-to-day information about the crisis.

The Egyptian Ministry of Health stopped reporting publicly on a regular basis in late January 2015, and the media's coverage has been both sparse and confused.

The last `official' number we received was from the World Health Organization's 3 Mar 2015 update, which showed 88 cases and 26 deaths for the year [see ProMED mail Avian influenza, human (68): WHO case count, H5N1 20150311.3222415 and Monthly Risk Assessment Summary 03 Mar 2015 http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en], based on reports provided to them by the Egyptian MOH].

Exactly how current Egypt's last notification to the WHO was, and how many cases have been detected since this update, are open questions. Based on media reports, new cases continue to emerge, but details are often absent and the YTD totals remain murky at best.

Sharon Sanders [editor FluTracker;
https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/egypt/h5n1-tracking-egypt/720309-egypt-2015-who-moh-provincial-health-depts-h5n1-confirmed-case-list.],
whose conservatively curated 2015 Egypt H5N1 Case List had 94 cases and 26 deaths as of this morning [15 Mar 2015], also has several `probables' in waiting.

Today [16 Mar 2015], however, the FAO published notifications of 17 recent human H5N1 cases from Egypt that appear to be recent enough not to have been included in the last WHO update. Some of these, Sanders believes she's already captured on her list, but others appear to be `new'.

As these FAO updates lack identifying details, like age and gender, accurately matching them up to the FluTracker's list isn't possible at this time, but it is a pretty good indication that Egypt's bird flu outbreak continues to steamroll along.

Sanders estimates that perhaps 9 of these cases will end up added to her list, once the WHO publishes a usable line listing.

All of which puts Egypt's probable YTD case count approximately 100, and growing, shattering Vietnam's record year (2005) which saw 61 cases and 19 deaths, and Indonesia's 2006 total of 55 cases and 45 deaths.

The `good news', as far as we can tell from FAO, WHO, and Egyptian statements is that these human infections appear to be caused by direct contact with infected birds.

A couple of small `family clusters' have been mentioned in recent months, but there's been nothing at this point to indicate the virus is transmitting easily, or efficiently, from person-to-person.

Below is a listing of today's FAO notifications [of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)]:

[Since the report used World Health Organization's 3 Mar 2015 update figures of 88 cases and 26 deaths for the year, I have kept them here, although note comment in ProMED mail Avian influenza, human (71): Egypt, ECDC update, H5N1 20150314.3230812 regarding a possible error in accounting of cases. Flutrackers now has a tally of 103 cases, since 8 of the 17 new cases listed above were already included in their list
