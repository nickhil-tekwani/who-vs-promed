Avian influenza in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the People's
Republic of China, in a wild bird
See also: 5 Nov 2004, 30 Jan 2004
Emergency report
Information received on 13 Dec 2004 from the Director of the Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong:
Date of the report: 13 Dec 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 3 Dec 2004.
Estimated date of primary infection: between 27 Nov and 1 Dec 2004.
Outbreaks:
Location New Territories, ecological mitigation area of the Lok Ma Chau
Spur Line Project
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: a grey heron (_Ardea cinerea_)
(migratory bird).
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
fau / ... / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis: on 3 Dec 2004, the bird was observed to be sick. It was found
dead the following day. Follow-up submission for post-mortem and
virological examination was undertaken on 8 Dec; sampling was carried out
on 9 Dec.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, AFCD.
B. Diagnostic tests used:
- viral culture: chick embryo inoculation with haemagglutination inhibition
testing using specific reference sera from CVL(1) Weybridge, United Kingdom
(OIE Reference Laboratory for avian influenza);
- for H5 genome: viral genome detection by real-time RT-PCR(2) tests using
H5 specific primer sets from the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory,
Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America;
- for N1 genome: conventional RT-PCR(2) following procedures from the
Department of Microbiology, Hong Kong University (HKU);
Immunoperoxidase tests using monoclonal antibody for influenza A
nucleoprotein and H5 haemagglutinin were positive on cryostat sections of
lung and brain tissue.
Chicken embryos were killed within 48 hours and genetic sequencing of the
haemagglutinin cleavage site will be conducted at HKU.
C. Causal agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Epidemiological details:
- The grey heron is an abundant winter visitor to Hong Kong but not a
resident species. About 1200 grey herons were recorded in the Deep Bay area
of Hong Kong in a survey conducted in the winter of 2003-04.
- Grey herons are found in a range of habitats such as marshes, tidal
mudflats, estuaries, rice fields and flood plains. They feed mainly on fish
but also eat amphibians, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, snakes and
small rodents.
- No spread has been detected. All poultry farms within 5 km of where the
heron was found have been checked and no unusual mortality or illness detected.
- Local poultry farms are routinely under a constant monitoring and
surveillance programme involving serological and virological testing and
have individual farm biosecurity plans which include bird proofing of all
sheds. All chicken farms are routinely vaccinated with inactivated H5N2
vaccine, and each batch of chickens has 60 unvaccinated individually
identified sentinels monitored throughout the production life of the batch.
- Extensive virus culture and surveillance is conducted in wholesale and
retail poultry markets and in bird parks and wild bird populations
throughout Hong Kong. Since January 2004, 1325 dead birds and 14 200
environmental swabs from wholesale and retail bird markets have been tested
and no evidence of H5N1 has been detected. In addition, more than 6900
samples from wild birds, 4500 captive birds in parks and 5100 pet birds
have been tested by AFCD [Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation
Department] and HKU [Hong Kong University] as part of the avian influenza
surveillance programme. The only cases of H5N1 infection detected in 2004
were the peregrine falcon reported on 19 Jan (see Disease Information, 17
[5], 18, dated 30 Jan 2004), the grey heron reported on 3 Nov (see Disease
Information, 17 [45], 332, dated 5 Nov 2004) and this grey heron, all
migratory wild birds.

[The negative surveillance data collected by AFCD and HKU are very useful
in this particular cases, as a wide range of samples remain negative
despite the 3 incursions of avian influenza in migratory birds this year in
Hong Kong. As mentioned by Mod.AS in the reference below, the genetic
information on the recent grey heron isolate will be valuable. - Mod.PC]
