[The UK Department of Health web-site has been
revised, and the monthly new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics are now
appended to the table "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
in the UK by Calendar Year (since 1990)," which
can be accessed at
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/94/42/04109442.pdf>.
The definition of the designations deaths,
definite cases, probable vCJD cases, and, the
case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health web-site, or, by reference
to a previous ProMED-mail post in this thread
(for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar
2002 20020305.3693).
The incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, abbreviated CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail, in the UK appears to have reached a
plateau, or perhaps to be in decline. Therefore,
since many of the reports appearing in the update
are only peripherally related to the situation in
the UK, the opportunity is being taken to drop
the designation UK from the title of this thread.
Also, data on other forms of CJD (sporadic,
iatrogenic, familial and GSS) are now included
when they have some relevance to the incidence
and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of 1 Aug 2005
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 1 Aug
2005] issuing the latest information about the
numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant
Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The
position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 107
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 42
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 150
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 7
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 157
(The next table will be published on Mon 1 Sep 2005.)

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[Since the previous monthly statistics were
released on Mon 4 Jul 2005, the total number of
deaths from definite or probable vCJD remains
unchanged at 150, but the number of probable vCJD
cases still alive has increased by one and is now
7. Therefore, the overall total number of
definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive)
has increased by one and becomes 157.
These data are still consistent with the view
that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is now in
decline. The number of deaths due to definite or
probable vCJD in the UK during the 1st 7 months
of 2005 is 2. The peak number of deaths was 28 in
the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in
2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004.
As of 29 Jul 2005, so far in the UK for the year
2005, there have been 74 referrals of suspected
CJD, and there have been 24 deaths from sporadic
CJC, one from GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
syndrome), one from familial CJD, one from
iatrogenic CJD and 2 from vCJD. Data for years
since 1990 can be accessed at

[2] UK - warning to blood donors

100 Blood Donors Warned of vCJD Risk
-------------------------------------------
All gave blood to 3 people in 1993/4 who have
since died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD), the human form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease.
Precautions were brought in during 1999, when it
became apparent that there was a potential for
the prion disease to be transmitted through donor
blood. The Department of Health has asked the 100
donors to notify their doctors so that extra
precautions can be taken if they have surgery or
other invasive care. They are also being asked
not to donate any more blood, tissue or organs.
The department said the move was a precautionary
measure.
It is not known whether the source of vCJD in the
3 patients who died was related to the blood that
they received or to BSE-infected meat that they
ate. Back in September, the government identified
17 people who received blood transfusions from
people who went on to develop vCJD and sent out
6000 letters to others informing them of the
potential risk. Since 1997, all cases of vCJD
that are reported to the National CJD
Surveillance Unit and diagnosed as having
"probable" vCJD are passed on to the National
Blood Service which searches its blood donor
records. If the patient has given blood,
subsequently any stocks of that blood are
immediately destroyed.
White blood cells, which it is thought may carry
the greatest risk of transmitting the disease,
have been removed from all blood used for
transfusion since 1999. And blood products have
been prepared from plasma imported from the US
since 1998. There is no test for the brain
wasting disease, so those at risk have no way of
knowing whether they have vCJD.
Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson said:
"When a recipient of a blood transfusion goes on
to develop vCJD, we have to consider the
possibility that the infection could have been
passed on through the transfusion. "Until a
reliable blood screening test becomes available,
it is sensible to proceed with highly
precautionary measures such as this to rule out
any possibility of onward transmission of the
disease." Dr. Angela Robinson from the National
Blood Service said: "This notification exercise
will affect in the order of 100 donors. If you
have donated blood in the last 5 years and are
not contacted shortly, you can be assured that
you are not involved in this new safety measure
and need to take no further action. For those
people who are involved, this information may be
difficult to absorb. That is why we have set up
the National Blood Service helpline and are
working with their doctors and other clinicians
to ensure that they have the information and
support they need." She urged the public to
continue donating blood, saying that the NHS
depended on this continued commitment in order to
be able to save lives.

[3] UK - warning to blood donors

UK Blood Donors Identified As At Increased Risk
of vCJD Are To Be Notified of Their Status
-----------------------------------------------
England's Department of Health has announced the
beginning of notification of a group of
individuals who are newly identified as at
increased risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD) in the United Kingdom (UK) (1,2).
These are people who have donated blood that was
transfused to patients who subsequently developed
vCJD. This currently concerns around 100 donors
to 3 vCJD cases.
vCJD infection has been observed in 2 recipients
of blood transfusions from donors who later
developed vCJD (3,4). One of these recipients did
not develop vCJD and died of causes unrelated to
the disease. Although other exposures, including,
most notably, dietary exposure to BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy), cannot be excluded as
the source of these patients' infections, it is
considered highly probable that these 2 patients
were infected by blood transfusion. These reports
added to previous evidence of vCJD infectivity in
blood obtained from experiments in animals and
led to the conclusion that transfusion should be
considered a possible route of vCJD transmission
in humans.
Over 2 million blood donations are collected each
year in the UK by the blood services, and over
half a million patients receive transfusions
annually. Of the 150 people who have died from
vCJD in the UK to 1 July 2005 (5), only 4 have
been confirmed as having received blood
transfusions that may be associated with their
subsequent development of vCJD. (For 2 other
cases, symptoms developed before or very shortly
after transfusion, and therefore transfusion is
not considered a possible source of their
infections.) For one of these cases, the probable
source of infection has already been identified,
as one of the donors went on to develop vCJD. For
the remaining 3 cases, transfusion remains a
possible source of the recipients' infection.
A risk assessment by the Department of Health
looked at the probability of donors to vCJD cases
being the source of a recipient's infection and,
therefore, the probability that the donors
themselves are infected (6). The United Kingdom
CJD Incidents Panel (7) considered this risk
assessment and recommended that such donors
should be considered as potentially at-risk of
vCJD for public health purposes� unless the
probability of being infected with vCJD (as
implied by donation to a vCJD case and estimated
with precautionary or worst case assumptions)
falls clearly below one percent.
Unless there is evidence to the contrary, the
assumptions for this calculation are: that an
infected donation would certainly infect the
recipient (the worst case assumption); that there
is no way of distinguishing between the
contributing donors (and recipient) in terms of
risk of primary vCJD infection (e.g., that all
had been resident in the UK during the BSE
outbreak), and that there is no other significant
alternative infection route for the recipient,
such as having been operated on with instruments
previously used for healthcare interventions on a
patient with vCJD.
These individuals are being informed that they
are "potentially at-risk of vCJD for public
health purposes" so that special public health
precautions can be taken to reduce the risk of
person-to-person transmission of vCJD during
their healthcare. Specifically, these are: not to
donate blood, organs or other tissues, and to
inform their healthcare providers of their
"at-risk" status in order that infection control
guidance (8) can be implemented for the
instruments used in certain invasive healthcare
procedures (and so that certain invasive
healthcare procedures that have already been
carried out on them can be considered by the CJD
Incidents Panel).
The 100 or so individuals involved are being
informed by the UK Blood Services. Their general
medical practitioners are being briefed by the
Health Protection Agency and Health Protection
Scotland so that they can provide further
information and support to their patients, and
assist with implementation of the recommended
public health precautions, as required. Where
past invasive healthcare procedures have been
conducted on these individuals, and potentially
contaminated instruments may be a risk for other
patients, local health protection staff are asked
to consult the CJD Incidents Panel for advice
about whether any actions should be taken.
Since its establishment in 2000, the CJD
Incidents Panel has issued advice relating to
several groups of patients identified as at
increased risk of CJD. Other groups of patients
who are considered to be potentially at-risk of
vCJD for public health purposes include: certain
patients who have been operated on with
instruments previously used for healthcare
interventions on a patient with vCJD; recipients
of blood from donors who later developed vCJD,
and patients who have been treated with plasma
products that may have been contaminated with
vCJD infection. This new notification of donors
to vCJD cases is a further precautionary measure
to reduce the possible risk of secondary
transmission of vCJD in the UK. Further
information about this notification can be found

Spain: 1st [Probable] Case of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Reported
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health confirmed today [Fri 29
Jul 2005] the 1st death in Spain of a person by
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. According to
the Ministry, the deceased patient was a young
woman 26 years of age, who could have been
infected between 1994 and 1995. The young woman
passed away on 10 Jul 2005 in the Foundation
Alcorcon, Hospital of Madrid. Forensic samples
will be sent for diagnosis confirmation to the
vCJD Reference Centre in Edinburgh, Scotland, and
results are expected in the next 10 days.
The Minister of Health, Elena Salgado, sent a
message of condolence and affirmed that there is
no risk derived from meat consumption in Spain,
since this is considered to be an isolated case.

Spain: 1st Probable Death from Mad Cow Disease (vCJD)
-----------------------------------------------
Spain reported the 1st probable death from the
human variant of mad cow disease [variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] on Friday [29 Jul
2005], a 26-year-old woman who was probably
infected before the mad cow disease scare of 2000
led to strict controls. Spain's Health Ministry
said it believed the death was caused by
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), based on tests
carried out at a Madrid hospital, and that it had
sent samples to experts in Edinburgh for
confirmation.
The victim most likely had eaten animal products
rich in nerve tissue, while the animal itself had
consumed contaminated feed. The incubation period
in this case was between 5 and 10 years, the
Ministry added. "That means that infection
probably occurred before the exhaustive control
measures established by the government were put
into place," the statement said.
The ministry said controls aimed at stamping out
mad cow disease were established in accordance
with European Union guidelines and guaranteed
that meat consumed in Spain was safe. Spain has
reported 567 cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), the animal variant of the
disease, from 2000.
Europe's outbreaks of BSE caused panic in the
1980s and 1990s, with 184 000 cases registered in
Britain by 2004. More than 100 people have died,
mostly in Britain, from vCJD after eating tainted
meat. BSE is caused by feeding cattle with
infected parts of other cattle. The EU banned
animal parts from animal feed and also tightened
food safety laws to limit what parts of cattle
can enter the food chain.

[The number of definite or probable vCJD cases in
the UK (see above) is now 157, followed by France
with 13, Ireland 2, and Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain with single cases. Single
cases have been confirmed also in Canada,
Ireland, Japan and the USA involving patients
with periods of residence in the UK and who are
presumed to have contracted infection in the UK.
The Japanese case is exceptional in that the
patient may have spent less than one month in the
UK.
In addition, the US National Prion Disease
Pathology Surveillance Center confirmed a vCJD
diagnosis by analyzing a brain biopsy sample from
a 33-year-old Saudi man admitted to a hospital in
Saudi Arabia. Although detailed information on
this patient was not available, he may have
visited the United Kingdom, if at all, only for
several days. Thus, the patient may have
contracted the disease in Saudi Arabia after
eating BSE-contaminated cattle products imported
from the United Kingdom (see: Belay et al., in
Emerging Infectious Diseases, Vol. 11, No. 9,
September 2005
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no09/05-0371.htm>.
The occurrence of the 1st suspected human case of
vCJD in Spain is not unexpected, since the risk
of contracting vCJD appears to be linked to the
amount of bovine meat consumed or extent of
exposure to bovine products. According to the
latest figure compiled by the European Union and
the OIE, Spain ranks 5th in the world in terms of
the number of BSE-affected cattle (532), after
France with 946, Portugal with 949, Ireland with
1470 and the UK with 184 138. However, by
contrast, in the current year [2005], Spain, with
42 cases, ranks 2nd after the UK with 126 cases,
followed by Ireland with 29, Portugal with 17 and
France with 2 cases of BSE. - Mod.CP]
