25 children infected by parvovirus
----------------------------------
A total of 25 children at a kindergarten-cum-child care center in Yuen Long have been infected with a parvovirus, the Centre for Health Protection said today. The disease is also known as the 'fifth disease.'

A total of 11 boys and 10 girls, aged between 3 and 6, along with 4 staff members, have shown symptoms including fever as well as rashes on the face, limbs or body, since 27 May 2012. All of them remained in stable condition and none required hospital treatment. The virus is transmitted primarily through direct contact with infected respiratory secretions.

[Fifth disease (also known as slapped cheek syndrome) is an illness of childhood caused by a single-stranded DNA virus that leads to a rash on the cheeks, arms, and legs. Originally the exanthematous illness of childhood comprised 6 diseases, the other 5 being: measles, rubella, scarlet fever, exanthem subitum, and Duke's disease. Parvoviruses can replicate only in the presence of a helper DNA virus or in rapidly-divided cells -- hence their occasional association with aplastic crises in chronic anaemia.

Fifth disease often affects preschoolers or school-age children during the spring. The disease is spread by contact with respiratory secretions. The rash associated with fifth disease may return for several weeks and may be associated with exposure to sunlight, heat, exercise, fever, or emotional stress.

The 1st sign of the disease is usually bright red cheeks, which look as though the child has been recently slapped on both sides of the face. Following this, a rash appears on the arms and legs and middle of the body. The rash fades from the center outwards, giving it a lacy appearance. Over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, the rash recedes completely. Fifth disease is also sometimes associated with fever.

The illness in childhood is usually benign, but If a pregnant woman becomes infected with parvovirus B19, it can cause significant harm to her unborn baby. Parvovirus B19 is also thought to cause other diseases, including an infectious form of arthritis. The majority of adults appear to have antibodies to parvovirus B19. This indicates that most people have been exposed to the virus, and also suggests that many infections go unnoticed.

No treatment is usually required for fifth disease in children. If fever or joint discomfort is present, then oral acetaminophen may be given (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001972/).

Since fifth disease in childhood is a mild and generally benign viral infection, complete recovery can be expected. However in the incident described in this report adults had been infected and if pregnant may be at risk.
