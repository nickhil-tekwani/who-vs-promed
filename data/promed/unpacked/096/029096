A young man tested positive for the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) on Tuesday [11 Aug 2020] and is undergoing treatment in an isolation ward of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).

JPMC Executive Director Dr. Seemin Jamali said [WA] works as a rider for a motor company and is a resident of the Lines Area neighbourhood. She said that this is the 4th case of the CCHF.

"The patient had interaction with sacrificial animals and was brought in with a fever and bleeding from the mouth and other parts of the body." Dr. Seemin said that a person infected with the highly contagious tick-borne disease had succumbed to complications arising from the CCHF at the JPMC this January [2020].

CCHF is a lethal viral infection that is transmitted to humans from animals, especially cattle and livestock. Patients are kept in isolation wards to prevent other patients, doctors, nurses and paramedics from contracting the disease.

National Institute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the 1st fatality from [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)] in Rawalpindi following which the district administration has gone on an alert. The NIH and the Rawalpindi Livestock Department had already issued an advisory regarding the virus before Eidul Azha and advised the people to take special precautions while visiting the cattle markets.

As per details, the 29-year-old victim, [GA], was brought to the Holy Family Hospital (HFH) on 6 Aug 2020 with complaints of fever and headache. Later on 10 Aug 2020, the victim died at the healthcare facility.

On suspicion of death from minor symptoms, his blood samples were sent to the NIH. The report coming back on Wednesday [12 Aug 2020] confirmed that the deceased was infected with the virus that causes CCHF. Following this, the health department has become active, and it has allocated beds for the CCHF virus patients at the HFH.

[There is an increase in CCHF since Eid ul Azha, with cases reported from both Sindh and Punjab provinces as per the above reports. The CCHF cases in Pakistan show biannual peaks, between the months of March-May and August-October. Many factors, including poor sanitation, unhygienic transportation, and numerous animal slaughter sites, inefficient tick-control programs, post-slaughter piles of animal remains, nomadic lifestyle, and lack of general awareness, contribute to the spread of CCHF.

Pakistan has confirmed cases of CCHF in almost every province: Sindh (Karachi), Punjab (Faisalabad, Multan, and Rawalpindi), Balochistan (Quetta) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar). There is a need to educate the general public, farmers, and healthcare workers about the causes, transmission, and risks of CCHF and advise on practical preventive measures.

Generally, a higher number of CCHF cases are reported around this time of the year, and there have been anecdotal reports of additional cases in some districts. Any further information in this regard from the personnel on the ground would be helpful to understand the current burden of CCHF in the country. - Mod.UBA
