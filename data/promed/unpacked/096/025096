and community burden after a Chikungunya outbreak: the TELECHIK survey, a
population-based cohort study. BMC Medicine 9:5.]

The present study aimed at describing the burden of CHIKV prolonged or
late-onset symptoms on the self-perceived health of La Reunion islanders.

Methods: At 18 months after an outbreak of Chikungunya [CHIK] virus, we
implemented the TELECHIK survey; a retrospective cohort study conducted on
a random sample of the representative SEROCHIK population-based survey. A
total of 1094 subjects sampled for CHIKV-specific IgG antibodies in the
setting of La Reunion island in the Indian Ocean, between August 2006 and
October 2006, were interviewed about current symptoms divided into
musculoskeletal/rheumatic, fatigue, cerebral, sensorineural, digestive and
dermatological categories.

Results: At the time of interview, 43 per cent of seropositive (CHIK+)
subjects reported musculoskeletal pain (vs 17 per cent of seronegative
(CHIK-) subjects, P <0.001), 54 per cent fatigue (vs 46 per cent, P =
0.04), 75 per cent cerebral disorders (vs 57 per cent, P <0.001), 49 per
cent sensorineural impairments (vs 37 per cent, P = 0.001), 18 per cent
digestive complaints (vs 15 per cent, P = 0.21), and 36 per cent skin
involvement (vs 34 per cent, P = 0.20) on average 2 years after infection
(range: 15-34 months).

After controlling for confounders such as age, gender, body mass index or
major comorbidities in different Poisson regression models, 33 per cent of
joint pains were attributable to CHIKV, 10 per cent of cerebral disorders
and 7.5 per cent of sensorineural impairments, while Chikungunya did not
enhance fatigue states, digestive and skin disorders.

Conclusions: On average, 2 years after infection 43 per cent to 75 per cent
of infected people reported prolonged or late-onset symptoms highly
attributable to CHIKV. These manifestations carry a significant burden in
the community in the fields of rheumatology, neurology and sensorineural
health.

[It has been frequently reported that individuals convalescent from CHIK
virus infections may suffer arthralgia for months. This retrospective study
has quantified that symptom, along with a lesser percentage of cerebral and
sensory disorders. It would be of interest to know the direct costs of
medical treatment and loss of work or school days for these convalescent
cases. Although the mortality rates from CHIK virus infections is very low,
when thousands of CHIK virus infections occur as happened on La Reunion
Island, it is a significant public health problem.
