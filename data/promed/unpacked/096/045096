Penang put on malaria alert
-----------------------------------
Penang has been put on malaria alert following an outbreak of the
disease in Bukit Gambier after 9 cases, including 2
deaths, were reported in the area last month.
Dr Azmi Ahmad, who heads the state health department's
vector control unit, said yesterday the situation could be
categorised as a malaria outbreak if 2 or more cases were
reported in a certain locality. He said, however, there was no
cause for worry as the situation was under control.
"We advise the people in the affected area to take precautions
such as using mosquito repellent, wearing long-sleeve shirts and
long pants and sleeping under mosquito nets," he said in an
interview.
Dr Azmi was commenting on The Star report on Monday that a
total of 25 imported malaria cases were recorded here last year,
including 2 fatal cases on 5 & 6 Dec 1999.
The report quoted state deputy health director Dr Azmi
Shapie as saying the two Myanmar immigrants died when they
were late in seeking treatment after their infection worsened.
The department had then taken immediate action, including
active case detection and mass blood survey tests on 835
residents, including 265 foreign workers, in the affected area.
Malaria is caused by a parasite transmitted from person to
person by an infected _Anopheles_ mosquito which bites from
dusk to dawn. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, headache,
muscle ache and malaise. Early stages of malaria may resemble
the onset of the flu.
State deputy immigration director Wan Md Marzuki Wan Md Akib
said the department would weed out illegal immigrants hiding in the
Bukit Gambier jungle fringes. "This is a serious matter as they pose
a threat to locals staying nearby, especially if the illegal immigrants
are transmitting diseases such as malaria," he added.
Universiti Sains Malaysia's Drug Research Centre director
Prof Dr Chan Kit Lam, who came up with the improved drug formula
called artemisinin to combat malaria, said malaria parasites found
in Malaysia were non-resistant to quinine.
"This means we can still use quinine for malaria
treatment," he said, adding that some of the parasites in
underdeveloped nations had been found to be multi-drug resistant.
