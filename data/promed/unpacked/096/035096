Citrus canker samples sent to US for DNA testing
-----------------------------------------------
Samples of the citrus canker found in a Central Queensland orchard have
been sent to the United States for DNA testing. Budwood samples from the
site of the outbreak, Evergreen Farms at Emerald, will also be tested.
Chief plant officer, Chris Adriaansen, says the canker belongs to an
Asiatic strain, but, it will be difficult to determine the source of the
budwood. Samples taken from the infested property are being held in secure
store, not just for overseas analysis of the actual disease, but for other
information that may be of use in dealing with this particular issue.
Meanwhile, 8000 trees in the affected orchard will be felled by the end of
the day [Thu 15 Jul 2004], with the debris expected to be burnt by the end
of the week. No other evidence of canker has been found on other properties.
The Burnett region was also quarantined because some orchardists in the
area brought budwood in from nurseries at Emerald, where an orchard was
found to have citrus canker. Queensland Citrus Growers president Nick Ulcoq
says the orchards have been inspected and cleared, but they still don't
know when, or if, their fruit will be allowed into southern markets.
The Queensland Department of Primary Industries says it is having
difficulty in establishing protocols to allow fruit from the
Gayndah-Mundubbera region to enter interstate markets.

[The decision to send samples of citrus canker-infected material for
analysis outside Australia is the right move. Typing the strain of the
bacterial pathogen (_Xanothomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_[Xac]), if
successful, will be useful in determining whether or not the strain at
Emerald is unique. If it is found to be a unique strain, or one that has
never been recorded in Australia, it suggests that the bacterium was
introduced onto the farm at Emerald.
3 distinct Xac strains are known, based on serology and DNA analysis.
Strain "A" affects members of the plant family _Rutaceae_, including most
citrus species and hybrids, especially, grapefruit, lime, sweet lime, and
trifoliate orange. Strain "B" infects lemons in Argentina, Uruguay, and
Paraguay. The more cosmopolitan strain "C" infects a wider range (Mexican
or key lime, sour orange, Rangpur lime, sweet lime, citron, and
occasionally, sweet orange, and mandarin orange) and infects only Mexican
lime in Brazil. All known U.S. infestations have been associated with the
"A" strain.
