New outbreak of Chagas disease: 20 confirmed cases
-----------------------------------------------
As happened in 2005 in Santa Catarina, the disease was transmitted
orally and not by insect bite. In Santarem township, in western Para
state, 780 km from Belem [near the mouth of the Amazon river], 20
cases of Chagas' disease were confirmed by the Division of Health
Surveillance (DVS) of the municipal health secretariat. DVS believes
the appearance of the new cases is due to drinking bacaba wine, made
from the fruit of a palm [_Oenocarpus bacaba_ - Mod.JW] similar to
that of the acai palm. The vector insect [hemipteran bug] was found
in bunches of the [berry-like] fruit and could have been ground up
with the fruit.
The outbreak is similar to the one reported from Santa Catarina state
in 2005, with 26 cases and 3 deaths due to infected bugs being ground
up with the cane in making sugar cane juice. There, in more than 1000
samples tested, there were a few more than 20 cases. In Santarem, 20
cases have already been confirmed out of 70 tested. According to the
Institute Evandro Chagas, reference center for tropical diseases [in
Belem, Para], the last outbreak of Chagas disease in Amazonia was of
11 cases in 1999, in Pau d'Arco, near Santarem. According to the
Ministry of Health, 2 decades ago, there were 20 000 cases a year of
Chagas disease in Brazil, but now there are only a few dozen cases
per year, due to the control of the domestic vector bug. In June this
year [2006], PAHO certified Brazil as free of domestically
transmitted Chagas' disease. The problem now is the jungle vector,
identified for the 1st time in Santa Catarina in 2005.

[The 2 outbreaks in Amapa and Santa Catarina in 2005 clearly
demonstrated that foodborne transmission of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ is a
real risk. The outbreak in Santa Catarina was thoroughly
investigated, and contamination of sugar cane by feces from Triatomid
bugs left on the sugar cane was the most probable cause. The present
outbreak indicate that foodborne infection may be more common than
previously thought, and improved food hygiene is needed when
ingredients that may be contaminated with or by Triatomids are used. - Mod.EP]
