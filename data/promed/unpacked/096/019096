Investigators are closer to understanding a mysterious illness reported by
pork plant workers in Minnesota (MN) and Indiana (IN) and now have pinned a
name on it, officials said. CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) issued a report on Thursday [31 Jan 2008] summarizing the
investigation so far that gives the condition a name, progressive
inflammatory neuropathy.

Minnesota officials said they were broadening their investigation to
thousands of former employees at the Quality Pork Processors Inc plant in
Austin, MN, going back a decade to when a powerful compressed air system
was installed to remove brain tissue from pig heads.

Investigators have been trying to determine whether pig brain tissue,
sprayed into the air as droplets during removal by the compressed air
system, was inhaled by workers and made them sick. If further investigation
proves their theories true, they will have identified a rare, new condition
that could shed light on a whole family of poorly understood disorders in
which the body's immune system attacks the nerves or the sheath that
surrounds them, the Star Tribune reported.

This "could have far reaching applications in terms of our understanding of
the mechanism of disease," said Ruth Lynfield, Minnesota's state
epidemiologist, who is heading the investigation [in Minneapolis].
Since December 2007, 12 meatpackers in Austin and 2 at a plant in Indiana
have reported fatigue, numbness, and tingling in their arms and legs. A few
are severely disabled; others have returned to work. Indiana health
officials have declined to discuss the conditions of the affected workers
there or say where they were employed, citing patient privacy laws.

All 14 employees worked near powerful compressed air systems that blow
brains out of pig heads at what is known as the head table. Both plants
have stopped using the process.

Lynfield said investigators are now looking for anyone who has worked near
Quality Pork's head table since 1997. That's difficult because the plant
employs about 1200 workers, many of them immigrants, and turnover is high.
"But we feel it's important to look for prior cases," she said.

Investigators say they've ruled out toxins as a cause, and viruses or
bacteria are unlikely because none of the affected workers reported
infectious disease symptoms, such as fever, before the onset of their
neurological symptoms. That would leave the brain tissue itself. Experts
said the foreign pig tissue may have triggered the workers' immune system,
which then attacked their own neural tissue.

Experts at the Mayo Clinic and New York's Columbia University are now
trying to devise ways to test pig brain tissue against the immune cells of
the sick workers, Lynfield said. It could be months before results are in,
she said.

Investigation of progressive inflammatory neuropathy [PIN] among swine
slaughterhouse workers -- Minnesota, 2007-2008
----------------------------------------------------------
On 29 Oct 2007, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified by a
tertiary care provider of unexplained neurologic illnesses among workers in
a swine slaughterhouse (plant A) in south east Minnesota. As a result, MDH
initiated a detailed investigation at plant A to characterize the outbreak.
This report describes the ongoing investigation and outbreak-control
measures undertaken by state public health officials and CDC.

Plant A, located in south eastern Minnesota, employs about 1200 workers and
processes 18 000 pigs per day. After being notified of the illnesses, MDH
investigators initiated active case finding, interviewed workers at plant
A, and reviewed the plant's occupational health and employment records. As
of 28 Jan 2008, a total of 12 workers at plant A had been identified with
confirmed (8 workers), probable (2), or possible (2) progressive
inflammatory neuropathy (PIN) [see 'Box' below.] Illness onset ranged from
November 2006 through November 2007. Median age of the 12 patients was 31
years (range: 21-51); 6 patients were female. All 12 patients reported
being healthy before the onset of neurologic symptoms.

Symptoms ranged from acute paralysis to gradually progressive symmetric
weakness over periods ranging from 8 to 213 days. Severity ranged from
minor weakness and numbness to paralysis predominantly in the lower
extremities affecting mobility. 11 patients had evidence of axonal or
demyelinating peripheral neuropathy by electrodiagnostic testing.
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from 7 patients. All 7 had elevated
protein levels (median: 125 mg/dL; range: 75-231 mg/dL [normal: 14-45
mg/dL]) with no or minimal pleocytosis (median: 1 cell/dL; range: 1-73
cells/dL in a nontraumatic tap); 5 patients had evidence of inflammation on
spinal magnetic resonance imaging (4 patients in peripheral nerves or roots
and one patient in the anterior spinal cord).

All 12 patients reported either working at or having regular contact with
an area where swine heads were processed (known as the head table), which
was located within a larger processing area in plant A known as the warm
room. A case-control study was conducted among plant A workers to identify
specific risk factors associated with illness. The 10 patients with
confirmed or probable cases were included in the study, along with 2
stratified control groups: 1) a random selection of 48 healthy warm-room
workers and 2) all 65 healthy head-table workers. Statistically significant
(p less than 0.05) differences were calculated by chi-square test. Blood
samples and throat swabs were collected from all consenting case-patients
and controls. As of 30 Jan 2008, laboratory investigations had not
identified any infectious agent from the blood and throat-swab specimens
that would explain the occurrence of PIN.

Results of the case-control study indicated that case-patients (7 of 10, 70
per cent) were significantly more likely to have worked at the head table
than the warm-room controls (12 of 48, 25 per cent) (odds ratio [OR]: 7.0;
95 per cent confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-42.2; p = 0.009). Case-patients
also were more likely to have removed brains or remaining skeletal muscle
from the pig head (a process known as backing heads) (4 of 10, 40 per cent)
than controls (2 of 46, 4 per cent) (OR: 15.3; CI = 1.8-163.4; p = 0.006).
Among head-table workers, case-patients were significantly more likely to
have removed brains or skeletal muscle from the head (4 of 7, 57 per cent)
than head-table controls (8 of 65, 12 per cent) (OR: 9.50; CI = 1.40-70.2;
p = 0.01). Illness was not determined to be associated with previous travel
outside or within the USA; exposure to chemicals, fertilizers, or
insecticides; use of medications; or receipt of previous vaccinations.

An environmental assessment of the plant was conducted on 28 Nov 2007.
Standard personal protective equipment (PPE) used by workers at plant A
included hard hats, laboratory coats (including some that were
short-sleeved), boots, hearing protection, eye protection, and specialized
gloves that varied with the particular task of the worker. A compressed air
device was used in the plant to harvest brain tissue from pig heads at the
head table. The device was placed into the skull of the pig through the
foramen magnum, and the force of the air disrupted the brain material into
a liquefied form that made it easier to remove (a technique known as
"blowing brains"). This technique caused generation of small droplets and
splatter, possibly including aerosolized brain material, to which workers
operating the device and others nearby might have been exposed. In response
to the investigation, plant A voluntarily suspended harvesting of brains
and instituted additional mandatory PPE on 28 Nov 2007, including face
shields and long sleeves, for workers stationed at the head table and other
workers who chose to use additional PPE.

Results of case-finding survey
------------------------------
A survey of the 25 federally inspected swine slaughterhouses with greater
than 500 employees in the USA indicated that only 3 plants (plant A in
Minnesota and plants in Nebraska and Indiana) reported recent use of
compressed air to extract pig brains. To date, no cases of PIN have been
identified in association with workers at the Nebraska plant. However,
several workers at the Indiana plant have been preliminarily identified
with neurologic illnesses and similar histories of exposure to
head-processing activities at that slaughterhouse. Further assessments of
these patients, and additional measures to identify other workers with
illness, are being conducted in Indiana. As a result of this investigation,
all three plants have stopped using compressed air to extract brain material.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
This report summarizes an ongoing investigation of PIN, a syndrome that
appears to be associated with swine slaughterhouse workers who process pig
heads. Several clinical and laboratory features of this illness and the
distinctive epidemiology associated with patients appear unique. Pigs
slaughtered at plant A have passed inspection by the USA Department of
Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service [USDA-FSIS], and the
investigation has not identified any foodborne risk to the general population.

The investigation in Minnesota indicates that PIN appears associated with
having worked at the head table, where a compressed-air device was used to
extract pig brains. In the process of blowing compressed air into the pig
skull, brain material might have been splattered or even aerosolized, and
workers might have been exposed through inhalation or contact with mucous
membranes. One hypothesis for development of PIN is that worker exposure to
aerosolized pig neural protein might have induced an autoimmune-mediated
peripheral neuropathy (1,2). Additional investigation of the
characteristics and causes of PIN is under way.

Whether compressed-air devices are being used for pig-brain extraction in
other slaughterhouses or processing facilities, in the USA or
internationally, is unknown. Clinicians should provide CDC with information
regarding swine slaughterhouse workers who might have illnesses similar to
PIN, including patients with peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, or features
of both. Clinicians who identify such patients should report the cases to
their state health department and contact CDC at 770-488-7100.

[The AP piece states that the compressed air system has been used for 10
years but previous posts have stated that the system was recently installed.

The CDC report, which gives a name to the process, clearly states that
respiratory personal protective equipment was not used and also provides a
working case definition and more specific information regarding the
clinical cases and the case-control study.

No additional information is given regarding etiology, but it remains
likely that this is not directly infectious in etiology. - Mod.LL]
