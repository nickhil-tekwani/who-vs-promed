Jordan's Directorate of Agriculture has confirmed that olive knot disease has been spreading for several years in Bani Kenanah district, but is confined to a number of farms. Farmers in the area fear an outbreak that may be difficult to combat. A farmer said that the disease appeared in his orchard about a year ago, but has since started to spread over large areas. Farmers said that cutting infected branches and burning them did not prevent the infection of other healthy trees. They are asking the relevant authorities to quickly combat the disease before it invades all olive groves in the area.

The disease has already affected large areas of olive groves in other parts of Irbid governorate. So far, no solutions have been found to eradicate it. The directorate said that their teams found that many trees were infected with the disease. They said that instructions were provided to farmers on how to deal with infected trees. At the end of the olive harvest, they will spray pesticides on the affected farms, in cooperation with farmers.

[Olive knot is a potentially serious disease caused by the bacterium _Pseudomonas savastanoi_. Symptoms include rough galls of variable size on any organ of the plant. These grow rapidly and are most common on young branches but will also form around wounds on the main trunk and on damaged leaves. The disease reduces yield by girdling branches and causing dieback; young trees may be killed if trunks are girdled.

The bacteria enter the host through wounds and live in the galls; they ooze out in wet weather. Infection occurs at low temperatures, but the time from infection to galling can vary from a week to several months, depending on environmental conditions. The disease is spread with infected plants and other materials (including contaminated cutting tools), by water and mechanical means. All commercial olive cultivars are susceptible.

Disease management mostly includes pathogen exclusion, reducing inoculum levels by removal of galls, phytosanitation (for example disinfection of pruning equipment), and preventative copper treatment of all types of wounds. Spraying 'pesticides', as mentioned above, will not be sufficient to prevent the spread of the disease.
