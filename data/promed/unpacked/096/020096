Officials at Barrie's Royal Victoria Hospital are investigating
whether any recent patient deaths can be linked to a virulent strain
of _Clostridium difficile_ infection. Since January 2007, 43 people
at the facility have been diagnosed with the bacterium. "We're
cross-referencing ... and we have to review to see what role _C.
difficile_ may have played in (the deaths)," Kirsten Krull-Naraj,
chief nursing officer, told CTV's Janice Golding.
The hospital says the bug is aggressive, and the large spike in cases
has led them to believe it may be the dangerous "Quebec" strain that
killed 2000 people in that province since 2003. Samples have been
sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.
Meanwhile, 3 new cases of _C. difficile_ infection have been
identified at Mississauga's Trillium Health Network, bringing their
total number of current cases to 17. "We're taking the same
precautions that we've always taken," said hospital spokesperson
Roula Giannidis on Fri 2 Mar 2007. These precautions include keeping
patients in private rooms, having anyone entering the room wear
gloves and gowns as well as having people wash their hands as they
enter or leave the room.
Similar efforts are reportedly in place at Scarborough Hospital's
General Division where it was reported on Wed 28 Feb 2007, that a
small group of patients have been diagnosed with _C. difficile_.
Their situation remains unchanged and officials there say the
bacterium did not spread there from Mississauga and no one in
Scarborough has died.
Five new cases had also been reported at Honore-Mercier Hospital near
Montreal as of Wed 28 Feb 2007. According to reports, none of the
patients at Honore-Mercier are currently being treated in the
hospital's intensive care unit and one has even been released.
Of the 4 people at Trillium who tested positive for the bacterium
after death, one was carrying the tough-to-beat strain, which wreaked
havoc in Quebec. Officials at Mississauga's Trillium Health Network
have not been able to determine if _C. difficile_ was responsible for
the 4 recent deaths.

[The ribotype 027 strain is the more virulent strain that has caused
more severe disease in North America and Europe (as discussed in the
'see also' section below). The strain has an 18-bp deletion in the
_tcdC_ reading frame which is felt to be a negative regulator of the
production of toxins A and B and may be responsible for the
recognized enhanced toxin production of the strain.
_C. difficile_ control in the health care setting involves not only
aggressive infection control measures but also prudent control of the
overuse of antimicrobial agents. The disease has also been called
"antibiotic-associated colitis" and "pseudomembranous enterocolitis".

St-Hyacinthe, the location of Honore-Mercier Hospital is about 58 km
