Leptospirosis is a sometimes deadly disease caused by spiral-shaped
bacteria of the genus Leptospira and is spread by contact with the urine of
an infected animal. This could occur if an animal with leptospirosis
urinates in standing water, and another comes along and drinks from the
source. It can be treated with antibiotics such as doxycycline or
penicillin if caught early.
Theoretically, the disease can be transmitted from dogs to humans, but it
is a rare occurrence and, according to Dr. Bela Matyas of the state
Department of Public Health, there have been no recorded cases of the
disease in humans in Massachusetts for at least a decade. Some experts
believe the frosty New England winters kill off much of the bacteria.
But, for some unknown reason, there appears to be an increase in cases in
dogs in the state. Veterinarians don't know if this is because more cases
are simply being detected or if the disease is on the rise. In 1995 and
1996, the vets at Tufts' Foster Hospital for Small Animals saw no cases of
dogs with leptospirosis.
But in 1997, there were 13 cases; that rose to 16 in 1998, and 17 last
year. Dr. Linda Ross of the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine
explained that you cannot pick up leptospirosis just from patting or
playing with your dog, or even having the dog lick your face. You have to
come into contact with an infected dog's urine, and this is unlikely.
Any mammal can contract the disease (cats get it more rarely than dogs). In
addition to being picked up through tainted water or food, it can be
transmitted through mucous membranes or a cut in the skin. While relatively
uncommon in the United States, leptospirosis thrives in some tropical
countries, where it does kill humans. It is generally carried in the rodent
population, and is transmitted to people who drink, bathe or wash clothing
in infected waterways.
Generally, the largest outbreaks of leptospirosis occur in places where
there is a breakdown in sanitation and water sources are fouled. In the
aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, for example, at least 68 people were
diagnosed with leptospirosis in Honduras, and the disease caused at least
four deaths. Those who have been infected in the United States are
generally people who work on farms, or are veterinarians or sewer workers.
It can take two days to four weeks, but usually one to two weeks, between
exposure to the bacteria and the development of disease. Symptoms in people
include high fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting and perhaps
jaundice. And for dogs, symptoms may include fever (normal body temperature
for a dog is 100.5 to 102.5 F), loss of appetite, lameness, and lethargy.
Once suspected, the bacteria can be detected through blood and urine tests.
With some people and dogs, there are no symptoms at all and the infection
resolves on its own. Others develop respiratory distress, kidney damage,
meningitis, or liver failure. This serious phase of the illness is known as
Weil's disease.
With early detection, dogs are given fluid therapy and a minimum of four
weeks of antibiotics. Even in cases of renal failure, therapy can reverse
the situation. But Tufts' Ross said the results simply are not predictable:
Some animals get better, others die, and still others survive, but with
residual kidney problems.
So, how do you prevent your dog from contracting leptospirosis? That turns
out to be a rather cloudy issue. Simple measures include keeping the areas
around your home rodent free, since rodents can carry the bacteria. You
could also try to prevent your dog from splashing around in and drinking
standing water (easier said than done), such as puddles in the woods that
might be contaminated with wild animal urine. And you can help keep
wildlife away from your house by making sure your trash
cans are covered, and not leave pet food outdoors.
There are vaccines for leptospirosis, but their efficacy is debatable.
Vaccines do not exist for all strains. Worldwide, there may be as many as
200 strains, each adapted to a particular environment. It's best to discuss
the issue of vaccination with your own vet, who will have a good idea about
whether other dogs in your area have been infected.
Five strains have been found in New England. Ross of Tufts explained
_Leptospira interrogans canicola_ and _Leptospira interrogans
icterohemorrhagiae_ were traditionally considered to be the agents causing
leptospirosis in dogs. Now vets are finding 3e new strains - _L. pomona_,
_L.grippotyphosa_ and _L.bratislava_.This makes Dr. Robert Cook, chief
veterinarian with the Wildlife Conservation Society, wonder whether
leptospirosis should come under the umbrella of suspicion for emerging
diseases. The society played a critical role in identifying the outbreak of
the West Nile encephalitis virus in New York last summer, which killed 7
people.

[Leptospirosis has not been available in dog vaccines for a year or more,
depending upon the company the veterinarian purchased from and in what
quantity. If there is an increase, perhaps it is because we are no longer
vaccinating dogs for this very communicable disease.
Unfortunately, some animals such as cows, are less than sanitary, urinating
into and drinking from the same body of water. Dogs like to lay, splash and
drink from such bodies of water and may acquire the infection from whatever
domestic/wild animal may have had the disease and deposited into the water.
When areas are drought stricken, as much of the US has been, then organisms
can become concentrated into these ponds. The animals visit the water
depositing the organisms, the sun evaporates some of the water, and the
organisms are forced into a smaller volume of water.
In some states, a dog with leptospirosis is a reportable disease,
reportable to the health department. Although dogs rarely transmit the
disease to humans, it is an indication of an increase in the disease,
potentially causing concern for humans. - Mod.TG
