[An] alert was issued [to] potato growers following the detection of a new bacterium. Department Irrigated Agriculture's John Ruprecht said the bacteria _Dickeya dianthicola_ had been confirmed in a commercial potato crop north of Perth. "The department has measures in place to contain the bacteria and is carrying out tracing and surveillance to determine its spread," he said. [The] property where the bacteria have been found is under quarantine. A suspect property and 2 trace properties in the south-west have also been quarantined.

Blackleg of potatoes caused by [other] bacteria species already occurs in Australia. _Dickeya dianthicola_ is more aggressive and causes disease at lower infection levels. Other host plants include globe artichoke, chicory, dahlia. _Dickeya dianthicola_ is found on potatoes in Europe and the USA, and in ornamental crops in the USA, Japan, New Zealand.

Growers are also reminded to follow good farm biosecurity procedures to prevent the entry, establishment and spread of pests and diseases.

[Blackleg of potato can be caused by several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_. Symptoms may include stem rot leading to leaf yellowing, wilting and stunting of plants, as well as tuber rot, which usually starts at the stem end of the tuber. The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including seed tubers, farm machinery), by mechanical means, and with water. Disease management may include seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting material and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and certification schemes are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

Population shifts of the blackleg pathogens are being observed in many areas. For example, _P. atrosepticum_ was considered to be the main blackleg pathogen in Europe, until the emergence of the more virulent new species _D. solani_ (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162). _P. wasabiae_ and _D. dianthicola_ are also known to cause the disease in Europe. In the US, _D. dianthicola_ has been known to be present on ornamentals but has only recently been observed on potato (ProMED-mail post 20160509.4211696). _D. solani_ has not yet been detected in the Americas. _P. carotovorum_ subsp. _brasiliensis_ (Pcb) has been reported as a causal agent from a number of countries in different parts of the world, and in the Netherlands it has replaced a predominant _D. solani_ within just a few years (ProMED-mail post 20160128.3974722). Possible reasons for these population shifts are thought to be climate changes and selection pressure due to intensified agriculture.

_Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_ species or subspecies also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.
