I would suggest consulting the latest WHO/TB Programme's report on
Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World (WHO/TB/97.229) for
recommendations and references regarding population-based surveillance. An
alternative is to contact WHO/TB directly (41-22-791-2663) to determine who
is the consultant/technical advisor and/or supranational reference
laboratory for surveys occurring in Dr. Tjandra Y. Aditama's geographical
area.

Drug susceptibility testing (DST) of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (MTB) is
a vast and complex issue. There are however, some basic issues that are
relevant to the question raised by Dr Aditama.
Briefly, traditional methods for DST of MTB require growth of the patient
strain on culture, followed by re-growth on medium containing either a
single critical concentration, or a range of concentrations, of anti-TB
compound. (The test concentrations have been determined from study of
susceptible wild strains; there is general agreement on the values.)
Comparison of the response of the test strain with that expected for a wild
strain allows the laboratory to issue a report of susceptible or resistant
for the compound in question. Development of broth-based semi-automated
culture systems (e.g. Bactec, Becton Dickinson) has offered alternatives to
earlier protocols using solid medium (e.g. Lowenstein-Jensen, Middlebrook
7H10 agar). Such systems are usually faster (around 7 days) and highly
reproducible, and are used widely in developed countries. A further advance
in DST has followed the recognition of the genetic mutations responsible
for resistance to the key anti-TB compounds. In theory, DST can be
performed directly on patient samples: DNA from MTB can be extracted and
amplified, and then probed for the various mutations that are known to
confer drug resistance. The suitability of such tests for routine testing
remains to be confirmed.
Irrespective of the method employed, DST for MTB should be performed only
in labs with proven capability in TB bacteriology. The need for continuous
monitoring of performance through internal and external quality control
exercises cannot be over-emphasised. One of the aims of the WHO/IUATLD
Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance has been to develop a
network of supranational laboratories with expertise in DST. These
laboratories are responsible for developing better DST services at national
and regional level. An expected outcome will be is that in the near
future, many developing countries will have laboratories performing DST by
reliable methods.
Surveillance of drug resistance in countries with large populations and
high rates of TB (e.g. Indonesia) are understandably a complicated and
difficult exercise. It would seem desirable, perhaps imperative, to
centralise testing on one, or perhaps a few laboratories. Obviously,
inexpensive and relatively simple methods are required. A method that is
worthy of consideration is that known as E test (AB BIODISK, Solna,
Sweden). A commercially-supplied plastic strip carrying an immobilised
gradient of anti-TB compound is placed on the surface of an agar plate
inoculated with the test organism. Incubation for around 8 days will
result in an ellipse-shaped zone of inhibition. The minimal inhibitory
concentration is read where the zone intersects the drug gradient (printed
on the E test strip), thus providing a quantitative measurement of
susceptibility. Two parallel strips can be added to a standard agar plate,
thereby allowing tests for isoniazid and rifampicin - the key agents
against TB - to be done on a single plate. Material costs should be around
US$10 per test. The method has yet to be validated, although results from
Wanger A, Mills K (Journal of Clinical Microbiology, July 1996, 34,
1672-1676) indicate that it holds promise as an alternative to the more
complex procedures. I suggest that E test be considered for laboratories
with significant workloads but whose options are limited due to financial
and technical constraints.

For up to date information on surveillance and management of drug resistant
tuberculosis, I would suggest the following WHO/IUATLD documents and articles:
1. Cohn DL, Bustreo F, Raviglione MC. Drug resistant tuberculosis: review
of the worldwide situation and the WHO/IUATLD Global Surveillance Project.
Clin Infect Dis 1997; 24 (Suppl 1): S121-130.
2. WHO. Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World. 1997.
3. WHO. Guidelines for the Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis. 1997.
4. WHO/IUATLD. Guidelines for surveillance of drug resistance in
tuberculosis. 1996.
Numbers 2-4 should be available from your local WHO country office,
regional office, or from the WHO Global Tuberculosis Programme in Geneva.
Numbers 2 and 3 can be downloaded from the WHO GTB website:
