The coordinating office of Health Surveillance (CVS) of [Amapa] state this Sat 28 Mar 2015 corrected information issued the previous day by the Amapa government about the diagnosis of a 7-year-old boy, supposedly infected by urban yellow fever [YF] in Macapa [the state capital]. The disease [urban cycle YF] was eradicated from the country in 1942, when the last case was documented. The CVS head, Clovis Miranda, stated that the tests indicated [that the patient had] another type of yellow fever that is more common, the sylvan [cycle], [that is] contracted in rural regions.

The only difference between the 2 types of yellow fever, according to the CVS, is the vector that transmits the disease [virus], _Haemagogus_ for the sylvan [cycle] or _Aedes aegypti_ for the urban cycle. The symptoms and treatment are the same [for both].

"Sylvan yellow fever occurs frequently in the Amazon region, however, we have vaccine available for the disease. It must be administered during the 1st year of life and later every 10 years. The immunization is very effective, so much so that we have not documented recent cases of yellow fever. This case was somewhat unusual because the child was not vaccinated," said Miranda.

Without specifying the time period, CVS stated that Amapa has not registered cases of the disease for a long time. At the national level, the last diagnosis [of YF] occurred in February 2014 [sic. 2015, this year] in Alto Paraiso in Goias [state], some 400 km [248 mi] from Goiania, where 2 people contracted the disease and one died.

The patient diagnosed with sylvan yellow fever in Macapa is hospitalized in the Hospital for Children and Adolescents (HCA) and has a good medical prognosis, according to CVS. He came from Gurupa in Para [state], seeking [medical] attention for supposed hepatitis, but the results were negative. New tests indicated yellow fever. Treatment consists of hydration and care for kidneys and liver.

"It [YF] is a disease that has a degree of fatality, being infinitely more serious than dengue, for example. But the child is responding very well to treatment, so much that we were surprised when we learned of the yellow fever diagnosis," commented the CVS Chief, Clovis Miranda.

Yellow fever [virus] transmission does not occur as a contagion. The virus can be contracted when a mosquito is infected by a person with the disease [viremic]. An epidemiological barrier was set up by the State Secretariat of Health in Macapa because of the possibility that the patient has been in vulnerable places outside of the hospitals in the Amapa capital [Macapa]. The CVS, however, confirmed that the patient was hospitalized soon after arriving in the city.

[The 2 types of yellow fever mentioned in the report above relate to the 2 cycles of virus transmission -- urban and rural -- not to 2 types of virus per se. The concern is that a person infected in the forest (sylvan cycle) could come to a locality where _Aedes aegypti_ vectors are abundant enough to feed on the viremic individual and initiate ongoing urban transmission. This is a real concern, and explains why the epidemiological barrier was set up in Macapa. This mosquito vector is abundant enough across Brazil to transmit dengue viruses to thousands of people annually. Fortunately, a large proportion of the population in Brazil is vaccinated against YF.

WHO now says that from June 2016 a yellow fever vaccination and certificate will be valid life-long, not for only 10 years (see http://who.int/ith/updates/20140605/en/). - Mod.JW]
