In 2002, the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on
Children set a goal to reduce global measles deaths by half (compared
with 1999) by 2005 (1). Nepal, a southeast Asian country with an
estimated population of 27 million, adopted the measles mortality
reduction strategies of the World Health Organization (WHO) (2) in
2003, with a goal of reducing measles deaths by half (compared with
2003) by 2005. The strategies consisted of strengthening routine
childhood immunization programs, providing a 2nd opportunity for
measles vaccination through supplementary immunization activities
(SIAs), improving surveillance, and improving measles case
management. This report describes routine immunization activities in
Nepal, the implementation of measles SIAs, and measles surveillance
data for the period 2000-2006. The findings demonstrate a substantial
decrease in reported measles incidence. Assuming a reduction in
measles deaths that paralleled the decrease in incidence, the
findings also suggest progress toward the goal of measles mortality reduction.
Background and Routine Vaccination
------------------------------------------
Nepal is divided into 75 districts in 5 regions. The Expanded
Programme on Immunization (EPI) was initiated in 1979 in Nepal in 3
districts; by 1988, the program had been expanded to all 75 districts
(3). The program aims to achieve and maintain coverage of >90 percent
fully immunized children nationwide by 2010 (4) and targets children
aged >9 months with measles vaccine. According to WHO/UNICEF
estimates, measles vaccination coverage among children aged <1 year
increased from 58 percent in 1988 to 71 percent in 2000; coverage
further increased from 75 percent in 2003 to 85 percent in 2006 (5).
Despite high national coverage in 2006, 6 of 75 districts
(representing 4 percent of the population aged <5 years) were unable
to reach >70 percent coverage because of lack of security resulting
from civil unrest, limited access to certain areas, or lack of human resources.
Surveillance
-------------
Measles in Nepal is reported as part of the Health Management
Information System (HMIS), which covers all 4102 government health
facilities in Nepal. However, HMIS does not provide detailed
geographic and age group data, and reports often are incomplete and
not timely; moreover, HMIS reports only clinically suspected measles
and does not report laboratory testing. Information on
measles-related deaths is not reported systematically. In March 2003,
the government of Nepal and WHO initiated a more comprehensive
measles surveillance system to supplement HMIS with more detailed
information on cases in clusters of suspected measles. The new
measles surveillance system, which includes field investigations and
laboratory testing of blood specimens, is supported by surveillance
medical officers (SMOs), who have conducted health facility visits
for active acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance since 1998.
This integrated surveillance network provides timely and detailed
data on AFP, Japanese encephalitis, and measles cases though weekly
reports from 413 major health-care centers and hospitals throughout
all 75 districts of the country (i.e., approximately 10 percent of
all government health facilities), including all inpatient
facilities. In addition, SMOs conduct weekly visits to 84 active
surveillance sites within this network.
If 5 or more cases of suspected measles are detected during a 2-week
period from one geographic area, an outbreak investigation is
undertaken in which epidemiologic information is collected on all
suspected measles cases in the area, and blood samples are drawn for
at least 5 cases for laboratory confirmation of measles (i.e., via
identification of immunoglobulin M [IgM] measles antibodies). An
outbreak is considered a confirmed measles outbreak if at least one
case is laboratory confirmed in a person who had not received measles
vaccination one month before. All untested suspected cases in a
laboratory-confirmed outbreak are considered epidemiologically
confirmed. Since January 2004, all samples that test negative for
measles IgM have been tested for rubella IgM. With rubella IgM
testing, similar criteria allow an outbreak to be considered a
confirmed rubella outbreak or a confirmed mixed measles and rubella
outbreak. Approximately 90 percent of cases associated with confirmed
measles outbreaks in 2003 were in children aged <15 years; this
finding supported the decision to conduct a "catch-up" SIA targeting
children aged 9 months-15 years.
Measles Vaccination Campaign, 2004-2005
-----------------------------------------------
Nepal public health authorities conducted a nationwide measles SIA in
3 phases during September 2004-April 2005, targeting an estimated 9.4
million children aged 9 months-15 years. Oral poliovirus vaccine also
was administered to all children aged <5 years. The overall reported
measles vaccination coverage was 105 percent of the population
target; in one district, the coverage was as low as 64 percent. The
population targets were obtained from administrative lists.
Measles Incidence
--------------------
In 2003, a total of 67 suspected measles outbreaks were investigated
using the integrated system; in 2004, a total of 196 outbreaks were
investigated. Nearly 70 percent of these outbreaks were confirmed
measles outbreaks (data presented in a table in the original text).
After the start of the SIAs, the number of suspected measles
outbreaks detected decreased to 46 in 2005 and to 31 in 2006. In
2005, only one (2 percent) of the 46 investigated outbreaks was a
laboratory-confirmed measles outbreak, whereas 36 (78 percent) were
laboratory-confirmed rubella outbreaks. Similarly, in 2006, 2 (6
percent) of 31 outbreaks were laboratory-confirmed measles outbreaks,
and 24 (77 percent) were laboratory-confirmed rubella outbreaks.
During 2005 and 2006, 3 mixed measles and rubella outbreaks were
detected: 2 (4 percent) in 2005 and one (3 percent) in 2006. The
number of measles cases associated with outbreaks decreased from
approximately 1000 in 2003 to approximately 50 in 2006. During 2005
and 2006, a total of 1119 suspected measles cases that were not part
of any recognized outbreak were reported to SMOs. Serum specimens
were collected for 84 of these cases; 3 (4 percent) were laboratory
confirmed as measles cases.
The average annual number of measles cases reported through HMIS
during the 4 years (2000-2003) before the start of the SIA was 10
425. After the SIA, the number of reported cases decreased to 3931 in
2005 and to 1935 in 2006, decreases of 62 percent and 81 percent,
respectively, from the 2000-2003 average (data presented in a table
and a figure in the original text).

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------------
Because information on measles-related deaths is not routinely
collected in Nepal, no direct measurement of reduction in deaths
associated with improved measles control is possible. However,
reports from other countries have assumed that a reduction in measles
deaths occurred in the same proportion as a reduction in reported
measles cases (6,7). A concomitant decrease in suspected cases and
measles deaths has been observed in other countries that monitored
measles deaths before and after SIAs (8,9). By making this same
assumption for Nepal, the findings in this report suggest that, by
the end of 2005, Nepal had achieved its goal of reducing measles
mortality by at least 50 percent from 2003 levels. The reduction in
measles incidence in Nepal during 2003-2006 indicated by HMIS data
might underestimate the actual relative reduction in measles deaths
because, compared with pre-SIA years, a more pronounced decrease
occurred in the number of confirmed outbreaks and in the proportion
of confirmed measles cases in outbreaks during post-SIA years. In
addition, treatment of measles patients** has been emphasized since 2003.
On the basis of progress to date, the government of Nepal has decided
to set its measles program objective toward elimination. In the
Ministry of Health and Population's Multi-Year Plan of Action for
immunization, the measles elimination phase will begin in 2010 (4).
Major components of the elimination strategy include high routine
immunization coverage (>90 percent in >80 percent of districts),
provision of a 2nd opportunity for measles vaccination through
routine vaccination or SIAs, and case-based surveillance with
laboratory confirmation.
The integration of measles surveillance and AFP surveillance since
2003 has made use of the extensive surveillance infrastructure in
Nepal, which was developed for AFP surveillance and, since 2004, has
included investigation and laboratory testing of suspected
encephalitis cases for Japanese B encephalitis. WHO formally
accredited the Nepal national measles reference laboratory in 2006.
The 1st steps toward further strengthening surveillance began in
January 2007; a case-based measles surveillance system, in which all
suspected measles cases are investigated and laboratory tested for
IgM, was started in 12 active surveillance sites in the Kathmandu
Valley and in 2 active surveillance sites in the Far West Development
Region. In addition to continuing outbreak investigations, this
case-based surveillance system will expand to include the entire
country by 2010 and will use measles virus genotyping to determine
the origin of virus isolates; however, data on measles-related
mortality are not available through this system.
Additional measures to increase routine vaccination coverage,
particularly in remote areas and those with low coverage, will be
critical for preventing outbreaks and moving toward the goal of
measles elimination. Despite advances in delivering routine
vaccination, the proportion of children susceptible to measles
started to increase after the 2004-2005 SIA, increasing the
likelihood of measles outbreaks. A nationwide follow-up measles
vaccination campaign targeting children aged 9 months to 4 years 11
months is planned for 2008. Given the difficulties with access to
certain areas of Nepal, providing a 2nd measles vaccination
opportunity through routine vaccination is not likely to reach high
coverage levels with both doses. Because SIAs have been effective
throughout Nepal, including in areas that are difficult to access,
repeated SIAs likely will be the long-term strategy for regularly
providing a 2nd measles vaccination opportunity.
Nepal has achieved a substantial reduction in reported measles
incidence and in the number of confirmed measles outbreaks. This
experience provides useful lessons for other countries in southeast
Asia as they progress toward measles mortality reduction.

[Striking progress has been made in reduction of measles virus
infection in Nepal in the years from 2004 to the present. (The figure
in the original text illustrates this vividly). The revised aim of
achieving complete elimination of measles by a program commencing in
2010 will be an ambitious task in such a challenging geographical situation.

[ProMED-mail tries to limit postings to emerging and re-emerging
diseases with a focus on current outbreaks. The above summary of
measles activities in Nepal is being posted as an exception. At the
present time, there is an international initiative to reduce the
morbidity and mortality due to measles (see
<http://www.measlesinitiative.org/index3.asp>). The goal of the
initiative is: "To reduce measles deaths globally by 90 percent by
2010 compared to 2000 estimates". There is a strong likelihood that
following the achievement of the goal of eradication of polio, and
the demonstrated successes of the measles initiative (as demonstrated
in the above report from Nepal), that the activities of the measles
initiative will be transformed into a worldwide initiative to
eliminate (and perhaps eradicate) measles. The above report on the
measles situation in Nepal is an excellent analysis of the
challenges, and how they can be overcome, making a goal of measles
elimination a viable target. - Mod.MPP]
