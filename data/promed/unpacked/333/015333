Man treated for rabies after bite from rabid raccoon
----------------------------------------------------
A Hertford man is receiving anti-rabies treatments after being bitten
by a rabid raccoon earlier this month. Perquimans Sheriff Eric Tilley
said yje 29-year-old man was bitten on the right leg while working on
a porch at a private residence on Harvey Point Road, on Mon 6 Jun
2009. The victim, Tilley said, was busy working and never saw the
animal approaching until the raccoon lunged at him and bit his leg.
The man fought off the raccoon and killed it, Tilley said. The
raccoon's head was sent to a state public health laboratory for
testing, he said.

According to Jill C. Jordan, health education director and public
information officer for Albemarle Regional Health Services (ARHS),
the testing confirmed the raccoon had rabies. Jordan indicated that
the state public health laboratory has confirmed 8 cases of rabies in
the Albemarle since January 2008.

According to a press release from ARHS, rabies is most commonly found
in raccoons, skunks, and foxes, although dogs, cats, horses, cattle,
bats, and bobcats can also be infected. The disease is extremely rare
in small rodents, (rats, mice) squirrels, opossums, and in lagomorphs
(rabbits and hares).

Rabies is caused by a virus that infects the brain of an animal
causing a change in behavioral patterns. It is almost invariably
fatal to animals. Humans acquire rabies through contact with infected
animals. However, human exposure to the virus does not always mean
that the disease will result. Since rabies is a viral disease,
antibiotics are not useful in arresting the disease once it begins.

"A rabid animal may exhibit signs of the disease including a change
in temperament, many times losing its fear of humans," added Jerry
Parks, health director. "The animals may be easily agitated, biting
whether provoked or not." Other indicators include decreased
appetite, aggression -- even toward inanimate objects -- repeated and
unusual vocalization, and stumbling or a lack of coordination.

There are preventive measures to control rabies. The best method is
to keep animals away from potentially infected animals. Domestic
animals should not be allowed to roam unrestricted. Vaccination
against rabies is essential after domestic animals encounter infected animals.

[It is presumed that the victim received post-exposure prophylaxis.
As a protection against the spread of rabies and to reduce risk of
human exposure all susceptible domestic animals should be vaccinated.
