The National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa reports multiple outbreaks of typhoid fever in the Western Cape and North West. There are currently 64 cases of enteric fever in the Western Cape in 3 separate outbreaks, 18 in North West, 45 in Gauteng, 12 in Mpumalanga, 9 in KwaZulu-Natal, 7 in the Eastern Cape, 4 in the Free State and 4 in Limpopo. _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi, the bacterium that causes typhoid fever, is endemic in South Africa; in general the country sees fewer than 150 cases a year.

Typhoid fever can be a life-threatening bacterial infection. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21 million people annually. _Salmonella_ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacteria. Both ill persons and carriers shed _S._ Typhi in their feces.

You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding _S._ Typhi or if sewage contaminated with the bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where hand washing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City, Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). - Mod.LL
