Health authorities in the northern mountainous province of Lao Cai on Tue 19 Mar 2013 reported an outbreak of mumps in Bao Ha Commune of Bao Yen District, with 50 people infected so far.

37 students of Bao Ha Primary School have been infected. Health authorities have vaccinated more than 300 children in the affected district and disinfected villages, educational facilities, as well as given necessary medicines to local residents.

Schools scrubbed tables, equipment, and disinfected all corners of the school to ensure clean environmental hygiene.

[Mumps is a common childhood infection. The hallmark of infection is swelling of the parotid gland. Aseptic meningitis and encephalitis are common complications of mumps together with orchitis and oophoritis, which can arise in adult men and women, respectively. Other complications include deafness and pancreatitis.

Mumps is vaccine-preventable, and one dose of mumps vaccine is about 80 percent effective against the disease. Routine vaccination has proven very effective in reducing the incidence of mumps and is presently used by most countries.

This outbreak appears to centred on a particular primary school in one local district. It may be that the remoteness of Lao Cai province has limited comprehensive coverage of the population, and the continued presence of susceptible individuals has enabled the infection to spread. Information on the extent of vaccine coverage in Lao Cai and adjacent provinces in Viet Nam would be welcomed.

Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Items used by an infected person can also be contaminated with the virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared. In addition, the virus may spread when someone with mumps touches items or surfaces without washing their hands and someone else then touches the same surface and rubs their mouth or nose. Most mumps transmission likely occurs before the salivary glands begin to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling begins.
