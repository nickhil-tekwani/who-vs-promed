SEPTEMBER 25, 1997, THURSDAY
German health authorities today corrected their earlier suspicion that
the death of a Ghanaian man last weekend in a German hospital could be
traced back to an infection with Lassa virus. The 37-year-old man
died on Saturday in the western German city of Mainz after admitting himself
to a local hospital.
The health ministry of the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate
said today that two blood tests at a Hamburg institute had confirmed that
the man had not died of Lassa fever, or any other highly infectious disease
like Ebola.
As a result, the ministry also stopped the the medical supervision
of about 120 people who had come into contact with the Ghanaian. The actual
reason for the man's death will be announced after the autopsy results come
out on Friday.
