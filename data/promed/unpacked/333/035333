Fascioliasis, human - Cape Verde: RFI 981121001941
Date: Sat, 21 Nov 1998 11:11:33 -0800
From: Stephen A. Berger, M.D. <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The GIDEON software program notes that five cases of fascioliasis were
published from Cape Verde as of 1997; and that a single case (1984) was
published for the United States during 1969 to 1989. _Lymnaea columella_,
_L. (Fossaria) bulimoides_ and _L. (Fossaria) cubensis_ are potential
reservoirs for the continental U.S.; while _Fo. columella_ carries
_Fasciola gigantica_ in Hawaii.
