Scientists play down avian flu
---------------------------------
Almost 5000 birds in Greece were checked for bird flu between last
September 2005 and last month [May 2006], but none tested positive for the
disease, which can be fatal for humans, scientists at a conference in
Thessaloniki said on Saturday [3 Jun 2006]. The animals included wild birds
and poultry bred for food. The samples tested at the Institute for
Infectious Diseases in Thessaloniki were taken from live as well as dead birds.
Three dead swans from northern Greece had tested positive for the deadly
H5N1 strain disease in February 2006, the 1st discovery of the virus in
Greece. This was followed by tens of other positive tests, but no humans
have been affected in Greece so far. The outbreak of the disease, however,
had a damaging effect on the country's poultry industry. The head of the
Greek Veterinary Society, Spyridon Kyriakis, accused the media of engaging
in a "strange terrorism" and overstating the danger of the virus. "All the
positive tests were in migrating wetland fowl," he said.
(This "tens of other positive tests" refers to the additional records of
swans and red-breasted geese reported from various areas in Greece
subsequent to initial detection of 3 swans in Thermaikos. OIE reports on
other confirmations are at these links:

My latest theory on the inexorable spread of avian influenza to Borneo and
Sumatra is that movement of poultry from the Malaysia peninsula had been
suppressed by fear of piracy in the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca.
After the Boxing Day Tsunami, the South China Sea was awash, so to speak,
with military vessels bringing aid from foreign nations, which had the
effect of reducing the fear that a smuggler of poultry might be massacred
by pirates as he carried his chickens by small boat across to the islands.
Apparently, piracy is once again on the increase in the South China Sea, so
we can expect the current outbreak of H5N1 to dwindle in proportion to the
hazard to small-craft traffic.

[I have always claimed that, given 3 facts, I can come up with 4
speculative epidemiologic hypotheses to explain them. It is clear that the
epidemiology of H5N1 HAI is both multifactorial and multicausational, and
each region will be different. Hugh's suggestion may carry some weight.
Only those in the region with special knowledge can tell us whether it has
any validity or not. I would not be surprised if it is correct for the
above piracy-affected areas. Piracy is a major hazard to shipping in the
South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca. - Mod.MHJ]
