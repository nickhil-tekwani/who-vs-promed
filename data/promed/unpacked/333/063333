California: Inyo County has First Hantavirus Case of the Year
-------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials stated on Fri 8 Aug 2003 that they are investigating the
state's first reported case in 2003 of hantavirus infection, a rare and
sometimes fatal disease spread by rodents. An unidentified Inyo County man
recovered from the disease, state Department of Health Services spokeswoman
Lea Brooks said. It was not immediately clear how or where he had
contracted the illness. He was released this month. The man was diagnosed
in late July after being hospitalized, said Steve Frederickson of the Inyo
County Environmental Health Department.
Since hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was first identified in 1993, there
have been 36 cases in California -- about 10 percent of the total reported
nationwide. There were 2 cases reported in 2002 in the state. Neither was
fatal, Brooks said.
Hantavirus is usually contracted by breathing dust contaminated by the
saliva, urine, or feces of infected rodents, typically deer mice. It cannot
be spread by person-to-person contact. The illness is marked by fever,
headache, and muscle ache, and progresses rapidly to severe difficulty in
breathing and, in some cases, death. To prevent the disease, health
officials recommend avoiding areas where rodents are likely to have been
present, especially indoors.
