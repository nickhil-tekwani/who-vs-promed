In a bid to stop the spread of Japanese encephalitis disease in Jalpaiguri, the district health department is all set to start an anti-encephalitis vaccination drive across the region from 30 Nov [2015]. The department aims to vaccinate 13 lakh [1 300 000] people across the district during the month-long campaign. The vaccination will be given to people within the ages of 15-65 years.

Notably, acute encephalitis or Japanese encephalitis disease have taken 30 lives in 2014 in Jalpaiguri District, while more than 300 people were diagnosed with the disease. This year [2015], the district has recorded 20 deaths so far, with 100 registered cases. Last year [2014], the department had provided anti-encephalitis vaccine to children below the age of 15 years and elderly above 65 years in Mal Subdivision and Nagarkatta. This year [2015], the department will set up camps in Raiganj, Jalpaiguri Sadar, Mainagudi, Mateli Block, Jalpaiguri, Dhoopgudi Municipality and Siliguri Municipality areas.

District chief medical officer Dr. Prakash Mrigha said that the anti-encephalitis vaccination campaign will be started from Jalpaiguri DM's office this coming Monday [30 Nov 2015]. "It will take an entire month to reach the target of vaccinating 13 lakh [1 300 000] people in the district. The vaccines cost anywhere between Rs. 1500-2200 [USD 23-33] in the market, but we are providing it free of cost," he explained.

Dr. Mrigha further stated that the department would send each house a vaccination card with information including the date and place of vaccination. People will have to carry the card along with them to the venue.

[The above report does not indicate how many of the 20 deaths and 100 registered encephalitis cases are due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infection or how many are classified as non-JE acute encephalitis.

JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, including West Bengal. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. Vaccination is likely to be more effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
