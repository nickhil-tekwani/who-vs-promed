Text of a fax received on 24 September 1997 from Dr N. Voetz, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry, Bonn:
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 22 September 1997.
Location No. of outbreaks
Bavaria Land 1

Description of affected population: one 6-year old Simmental cow imported
from Switzerland in 1995.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
67 1 0 18 0

Diagnosis: the 18 Swiss animals in the herd were investigated for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) with negative results except for 1 animal
which was positive.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Federal Research Center for Virus
Diseases of Animals, TÃ¼bingen.
B. Diagnostic tests used: histopathology and western blot.
History of the diagnosis:
As a preventive measure against animal diseases, legal provisions were
adopted under which the responsible authority ordered the slaughter of all
cattle which had been imported into Germany from the United Kingdom and
Switzerland. All animals slaughtered
would be examined for BSE in the process. On 16 September 1997, within the
framework of this cull, BSE-typical changes were detected through the
histological examination of the brain of a 6-year old Simmental cow that
had been imported from
Switzerland into Germany on 1 February 1995.
The diagnosis was confirmed by the immunochemical detection of BSE-typical
prion protein on 22 September 1997.
The cow in question had given birth to two male calves in Germany on 27
March 1996. One of these calves has been slaughtered in the meantime, while
the other animal is currently under official observation for scientific
purposes at the Federal Research Center for Virus Diseases of Animals.
Control measures during reporting period: the 18 Swiss animals were destroyed.
As the diseased animal had been imported, Germany is still deemed to be
free from BSE under the regulations of Article 3.2.13.2 of the
International Animal Health Code.
