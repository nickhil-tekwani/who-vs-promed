Pertussis is spreading in 4 provinces, infecting as many as 2000 people with a sometimes violent, uncontrollable cough and killing an infant in Alberta, as public-health authorities scramble to boost their vaccination programs.

British Columbia's Fraser Valley, southern Alberta, parts of southwestern Ontario and New Brunswick are dealing with severe outbreaks of a disease that was once on the wane, pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, which can be especially deadly if contracted by infants. The USA, meanwhile, appears headed for its worst year for whooping cough in more than 5 decades, with more than 18 000 cases reported so far.

As health authorities on both sides of the border urge parents to get their children vaccinated, and start offering free vaccine clinics for adults, the outbreaks have fueled debate about the vaccine's effectiveness over time. The latest spread of the disease can be partially explained by parents who shun vaccinating their children. But health officials say a larger issue is at play: Children under 6 years need 5 doses of the whooping cough vaccine, with a booster in their teenage years. Routine vaccination efforts, however, have stopped by the time they reach adulthood.

"We've got waned immunity," said Doug Sider, Ontario's acting associate medical officer of health. "We're great at emphasizing childhood vaccinations. We need to do a much better job at emphasizing adult vaccinations."

Almost 300 cases of pertussis have been reported among Fraser Valley residents in the past 9 months. The recent outbreak, part of the upward trend in pertussis infections in Canada and the USA in the past year, is slowing now but remains a concern for Fraser Health officials.

Of the 295 probable and reported cases, 247 were confirmed as pertussis in laboratory tests since the outbreak's start in November 2011 through 7 Jul 2012, according to Fraser Health spokesman Roy Thorpe-Dorward.

"The number is above the historical average," he said on Tuesday [24 Jul 2012]. "There is nothing that is alarming at the moment, but we are going to keep our eye on it."

B.C. is not the only region dealing with an outbreak this year [2012]. Pertussis has also been a problem in Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick. The maritime province has seen 1024 reported cases so far in 2012, but no deaths. In Ontario, there have been 260 confirmed cases in 2012. One baby has died in Alberta, where there were 42 cases.

Fraser Health statistics show the spike in new cases hitting a high in February 2012 and tapering off significantly since then. In mid-June 2012, the health authority announced the outbreak was now "decreasing but ongoing," and noted reported cases "have significantly tailed off over the past 6 weeks."

Pertussis is most serious in infants under a year old. "We've had a total of 8 cases in children under age one, which are the ones that are most serious and the ones we worry about the most, but we haven't had any fatalities," Thorpe-Dorward said.

Vancouver Coastal Health has seen 156 confirmed cases in 2012 as of 4 Jul 2012, with 3 requiring hospitalization, but no deaths. There, the outbreak peaked in March 2012, with just 2 to 4 new cases reported per week now.

According to Health Canada: "Pertussis is the most frequently reported, vaccine-preventable disease in Canada."

The Fraser Valley outbreak is clustered in Agassiz, Chilliwack, and Hope, where the outbreak began, and over half of all cases have been reported there. Others appeared in Langley, Surrey, Maple Ridge, White Rock, Abbotsford, Burnaby and Coquitlam. The disease has been most widespread among preschool children and their caregivers, according to Fraser Health statistics.

To date, there have been 52 probable reported cases among children aged one to 4, 43 cases among children aged 5 to 9, 3 cases among children aged 10 to 13, 22 cases among teens aged 14 to 18, 18 cases among youths aged 19 to 24, 62 cases among adults aged 25 to 44, 46 cases among older adults aged 45 to 64, and 11 cases among seniors aged 65 and over.

There are an estimated 30 to 50 million cases of pertussis globally each year and 300 000 deaths.

[In this posting, the breakdown of age range does show some cases of pertussis in individuals over 65 years old. These are either people who were not immunized as children or who are waning in immunity for the old whole-cell killed vaccine. It would be interesting to know whether any of the cases in infants were spread from those who had received the old vaccine. - Mod.LL
