Dengue fever cases increase and another victim dies
---------------------------------------------------
A 9 year old girl died in the Tarakan Hospital in West Jakarta on Thursday
[17 Nov 2005], 2 hours after she was admitted with dengue fever. Hospital
spokesman Hendry Manik said that the girl, who lived with her family in
Pademangan Utara, North Jakarta, died at 12:30 am after being placed in the
hospital's intensive care unit at 10:30 pm on Wednesday. "The girl came
here in a critical condition. She died before we could do anything to help
her," Hendry said.
He said that 2 people have died of dengue in the hospital so far in
November [2005] alone. Another victim, identified as aged 4, died on 9 Nov
2005 after being treated in the hospital for one day. [Another person], who
lived with his parents in Kali Anyar, Tambora, West Jakarta also arrived at
the hospital in critical condition.
Hendry said the hospital admitted 5 patients on Thursday [17 Nov 2005],
bringing the number of dengue patients to 49, including 15 children.
Jakarta Health Agency spokesman Evy Zelvino said the number of dengue cases
had continued to increase over the last few months as the rainy season
approached. "More rain means more pools of water, which are ideal breeding
places for mosquitoes," she said. Dengue fever is transmitted by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which is most active during daylight hours and can be
identified by the black and white stripes on its legs. The mosquito breeds
in still, clean water.
She said that the only way to stop the spread of the disease was to drain
open tanks and receptacles, cover bathing tanks and bury used cans, as no
vaccine for dengue had been found.
According to figures from the Jakarta Health Agency, the capital has
recorded 16 840 cases of dengue from January to October 2005, with 74
deaths [a CFR of 439 per 100 000]. Meanwhile, the city's hospitals are
continuing to receive dengue patients.
In the city-owned Pasar Rebo hospital in East Jakarta, a total of 53
patients are being treated for dengue, with 12 patients admitted in the
last 3 days. The hospital said that it had added another 26 beds and a
number of rooms to prepare for an increase in the number of patients.
Another city-owned hospital, the Budi Asih, also in East Jakarta, received
more patients this week [3rd week Nov 2005] than last week. The hospital is
now treating 49 patients, including 12 in the corridors. At least 20 dengue
patients were also being treated in the Persahabatan hospital in
Rawamangun, East Jakarta, as of Thursday [17 Nov 2005]. The Jakarta Health
Agency recorded 18 000 cases of dengue fever last year [2004], which led to
about 82 deaths [a CFR of 456 per 100 000], mostly of children. The highest
number of cases occurred in February and March, in which months over 5000
people fell sick with the disease.
Over the last few years, the agency's figures show that the number of cases
of dengue fever in greater Jakarta stood at 15 360 in 1998, 3998 in 1999,
8729 in 2000, 8820 in 2001, 5750 in 2002, and 14 071 in 2003.

Dengue fever claims 80 lives in Semarang
----------------------------------------
The spread of dengue in Central Java province has reached alarming
proportions, with 80 fatalities having been reported since January this
year [2005], a senior health official said on Tuesday [15 Nov 2005].
The 80 fatalities [a case fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3 per cent or 2265 per
100 000] were out of a total of 3531 dengue cases reported to health
officials during the same period, said Central Java provincial health
office director Budihardja.
The dengue cases were spread among all regencies and municipalities in
Central Java province, with Semarang being the city with the greatest
number of dengue cases: 1340 with 16 fatalities [a CFR of 1.2 per cent].
Budihardja blamed poor sanitation as the chief cause of dengue in the city.
Sanitation in the urban area was worse than in the countryside, according
to Budihardja, pointing to piles of uncollected garbage in the city.
"Cans and plastic waste are found all over the city, and they provided
breeding places for [the] _Aedes aegepti_ mosquito, the carrier of the
dengue virus," said Budihardja.
The number of fatalities caused by dengue this year [2005] was, however,
much less than last year [2004]. While dengue claimed 80 lives up to
November this year [2005], last year [2004] the disease claimed 163 lives
in the whole year. Similarly, the number of dengue cases reportedly fell
3-fold this year. While last year [2004] the number of dengue cases
numbered 9050, as of November this year [2005], only 3531 had been recorded.
The decrease in the number of dengue cases was attributed to the government
campaign against the disease, including a government call to improve
sanitation in the city. But, besides the government effort, credit also
needed to be given to the people, whose awareness of dengue had increased
over the past year. Previously, people were often too late in sending ill
relatives to hospital due to a lack of knowledge about dengue fever, thus
leading to many fatalities. But now, people were more aware of dengue
symptoms, and they quickly brought ill relatives to the hospital once they
detected the symptoms of the disease. This honed awareness had saved many
lives.
Meanwhile, Budihardja said the government had allocated IDR 1.7 billion
[USD 168 843] this year [2005] to combat dengue in 9000 subdistricts across
the province. Dengue regularly affects some 800 of the 9000 subdistricts in
the province, and it was in these 800 subdistricts that the government
would focus its efforts.

The Center for Health Protection has confirmed an imported case of dengue
fever in a 24 year old woman, bringing the year's [2005] total to 25, all
imported. The patient traveled to Indonesia from 24 Oct to 7 Nov 2005. She
came down with a fever, cough and sore throat on 8 Nov 2005. She has been
receiving treatment in the United Christian Hospital since 9 Nov 2005 and
is now in stable condition. Her home contacts do not have any symptoms.
People should stay alert to the threat of dengue fever and take measures
against mosquito breeding. Travelers should wear long-sleeved tops and
trousers and use insect repellent and mosquito screens or nets when rooms
are not air-conditioned.
Travelers who feel unwell after returning from abroad should consult a
doctor as soon as possible and provide details of their travel to the doctor.

The number of dengue cases shows a 62 per cent rise [since 2004?]. The
deadly dengue fever has claimed some lives in the district already. Malaria
cases have also been on the higher side, with about 53 per cent more cases
this year [2005]. The Health Department has, however, failed to confirm any
deaths due to dengue or malaria so far.
According to the official figures compiled by the authorities concerned, a
total of 34 positive cases of dengue and 242 cases of malaria have been
detected in 2005, while only 21 cases of dengue and 158 cases of malaria
were registered by the department last year [2004]. Though in the past 5
years the highest number of dengue cases had been reported in 2001, the
largest number of malaria cases were recorded in 2003, when the dengue
cases had been around 32. The year 2002 was the only year when not even a
single case of dengue was registered in the official books. But with over a
month to go for this year [2005], the figure could rise sharply, given the
prevailing conditions, which suggest that the occurrence of the disease has
been more common this year [2005].
No official figure or statement has come out on the deaths caused by dengue
in the city and the district. It is reported that some persons have already
fallen victim to it, though there has been no official confirmation.
According to unofficial figures, the number of positive cases of dengue and
malaria could be much higher, as a large number of patients reported to
private hospitals and clinics. Such figures normally go unnoticed, though
the Health Department has recently appealed to private practitioners to
report such cases to the office of the CMO here.
Incidentally, several cases of dengue have been reported from areas which
had rather clean surroundings and no accumulation of water in open pits. A
resident of Sector 8 here, who had recently undergone treatment for dengue
at a private hospital, said that he had no knowledge of how he had gotten
infected with it and had to be hospitalized for about 6 days. The Health
Department claims that a campaign had been ongoing. This included fogging
in the slums and densely populated areas, larvicide measures in fresh and
polluted water, checking and surveillance by the health workers in risk
areas and the creation of mass awareness on the issue.
Since about 200 000 people travel daily to Delhi and back, infection is
highly possible, and a large number of cases of dengue have been reported
in the national capital so far. Moreover, Faridabad has at least 67 slum
colonies with no civic amenities, and the scarcity of water forces people
to store water, which has been a major breeding source of the mosquito
causing dengue or malaria. Over 600 000 people reside in such areas.

As many as 18 dengue cases were reported in the capital [New Delhi] today
[15 Nov 2005], taking the total number of people affected by the disease to
868, with 9 deaths.
However, 4 of the patients belonged to other states, 2 from Haryana and 2
from Uttar Pradesh, Municipal Corporation of Delhi sources said. Of the
total number of dengue patients, 592 were residents of the city, while 116
were from Uttar Pradesh, 59 from Haryana, one from Rajasthan, and 100 from
other states. The maximum number of patients in Delhi were from Najafgarh
zone in south west Delhi (121), followed by 109 from West Zone. 4 of those
who died were from the capital, with 5 from other places. While 3 people
died, and 484 cases were reported last year [2004], 33 people lost their
lives and 2720 cases were reported in 2003.

2 strains of dengue discovered in Pangasinan
--------------------------------------------
A government doctor has confirmed that 2 strains of dengue have been found
in Pangasinan patients, based on the blood cultures analyzed so far.
Dr Jesus Canto, chief of the Region 1 Medical Center (R1MC), said the [2]
strains were a non-virulent type found mostly among patients from western
Pangasinan and a virulent type that appeared to afflict those from western
Pangasinan.
Canto said the virulent type of dengue was what attacked 2 patients who
died, one of them from western Pangasinan. These, he said, were the 1st
casualties from dengue, Canto said.
He added that the boy died a few minutes after arrival, because, when he
was admitted at R1MC, his platelet count had dropped to as low as 2 to 4,
as he already had continuous bleeding. The normal platelet count of a
person is from 150 to 300, he said.
Dengue patients need fresh platelets to replace those destroyed by the
virus that causes the disease. Canto said that from 1 - 27 Aug 2005, a
total of 65 dengue patients had already been admitted to R1MC, compared to
60 patients admitted for the whole month of July 2005. Dengue cases are
expected to rise some more this September 2005 because the rainy season is
not yet over. The R1MC is the usual destination of dengue patients in
Pangasinan, because it is the only hospital in the Ilocos Region that has a
blood separator machine, thus assuring them of a ready supply of blood
platelets. Acquired by R1MC 2 years ago [2003], the blood separator machine
separates all ingredients of the blood, like the Packed RBC, frozen plasma,
and platelet concentrates. In the past, Canto said the hospital placed the
blood on standby for many hours until the serum separated.
With the blood separator, platelet concentrates are now available any time
the patient needs them. If not for this machine, the hospital would be
still buying its supply of blood platelets from Manilla for use by its
dengue patients, he said.

11 year old boy from Pahang latest victim of dengue
---------------------------------------------------
An 11 year old boy from Kuala Medang in Kuala Lipis, Pahang died of dengue
on Saturday [12 Nov 2005]. [This] was the only death caused by the deadly
disease last week.
Health Ministry's director of disease control, Dr Ramlee Rahmat, said
suspected dengue cases also rose last week [2nd week November 2005], from
542 cases the week before to 751 cases, a rise of 208 cases. Of the total,
712 were normal dengue cases, while 39 were of the hemorrhagic type, which
can lead to death, he told a press conference held weekly to provide
updates on the dengue outbreak at the ministry here on Tuesday [15 Nov
2005]. Dr Ramlee said the increase was expected, as many cases were not
reported during the festive holiday break, as many people had been on
leave. Until Saturday, cumulative dengue cases for the year were 34 485,
with 86 deaths [a CFR of 249 per 100 000]. For the same period last year
[2004], dengue totaled 26 870 cases with 84 [a CFR of 313 per 100 000]
fatalities.
Dr Ramlee said Selangor recorded the most cases [11 367 and 24 deaths, with
a CFR of 211 per 100 000], followed by the Federal Territory [5027 cases,
14 fatal, CFR 279/100 000] and Penang [3129, 7 deaths, CFR 224/100 000].
Meanwhile, he said 2 factories in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan had been
charged in court for failing to pay compound fines after their premises had
been found to be breeding grounds for the _Aedes_ mosquito, the vector of
the disease.

The figure is 42 per cent higher than the 9459 cases recorded for the whole
of last year [2004]. The weekly number of cases dropped further to 175 in
the week ending 12 Nov 2005, as compared with the 222 cases reported in the
previous week. In September this year [2005], the city state saw a surge in
the number of dengue cases, and the weekly number reached a record high of
713 from 18 to 24 Sep 2005. 19 Singaporeans [CFR 142/100 000] have died of
the disease so far this year [2005].
