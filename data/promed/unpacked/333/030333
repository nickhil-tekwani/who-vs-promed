Anthrax: Agency approaches to validation and statistical analyses could be improved
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Why GAO did this study
In 2001, the FBI investigated an intentional release of _Bacillus anthracis_, a bacterium that causes anthrax, which was identified as the Ames strain. Subsequently, FBI contractors developed and validated several genetic tests to analyze _B. anthracis_ samples for the presence of certain genetic mutations. The FBI had previously collected and maintained these samples in a repository. GAO was asked to review the FBI's genetic test development process and statistical analyses. This report addresses (1) the extent to which these genetic tests were scientifically verified and validated; (2) the characteristics of an adequate statistical approach for analyzing samples, whether the approach used was adequate, and how it could be improved for future efforts; and (3) whether any remaining scientific concerns regarding the validation of genetic tests and statistical approaches need to be addressed for future analyses. GAO reviewed agency and contractor documentation, conducted literature reviews, and conducted statistical analyses of the repository data. GAO's review focused solely on 2 aspects of the FBI's scientific evidence: the validation of the genetic tests and the statistical approach for the analyses of the results. GAO did not review and is not taking a position on the conclusions the FBI reached when it closed its investigation in 2010.

What GAO found
After the 2001 anthrax attacks, the genetic tests that were conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) 4 contractors were generally scientifically verified and validated, and met the FBI's criteria. However, GAO found that the FBI lacked a comprehensive approach -- or framework -- that could have ensured standardization of the testing process. As a result, each of the contractors developed their tests differently, and one contractor did not conduct verification testing, a key step in determining whether a test will meet a user's requirements, such as for sensitivity or accuracy. Also, GAO found that the contractors did not develop the level of statistical confidence for interpreting the testing results for the validation tests they performed. Responses to future incidents could be improved by using a standardized framework for achieving minimum performance standards during verification and validation, and by incorporating statistical analyses when interpreting validation testing results.

GAO identified 6 characteristics of a statistical framework that can be applied for analyzing scientific evidence. When GAO compared the approach the FBI used to this framework, it found that that the FBI's approach could have been improved in 3 of 6 areas. First, the FBI's research did not provide a full understanding of the methods and conditions that give rise to genetic mutations used to differentiate between samples of _B. anthracis_ . Second, the FBI did not institute rigorous controls over the sampling procedures it used to build the repository of _B. anthracis_ samples. Third, the FBI did not include measures of uncertainty to strengthen the interpretation of the scientific evidence. GAO found that since 2001 the FBI has taken some steps to build formal forensic statistical expertise. The FBI's approach to future incidents could benefit from including such expertise early in an investigation.

The lack of an understanding of how bacteria change (mutate) in their natural environment and in a laboratory is a key scientific gap that remains and could affect testing conducted in future incidents. Specifically, the significance of using such mutations as genetic markers for analyzing evidentiary samples to determine their origins is not clear. This gap affects both the development of genetic tests targeting such mutations and statistical analyses of the results of their use on evidentiary samples. The Department of Homeland Security is currently funding some research on genetic changes in bacteria and genome sequencing methods, among others. Such research is a step in the right direction since the FBI is planning to use genome sequencing methods in future investigations. However, because this research may not be complete for several more years, the extent to which it will close this gap is not known

What GAO recommends
GAO recommends that the FBI develop a framework for validation and statistical approaches for future investigations. The FBI agreed with our recommendations.

Inquiry in anthrax mailings had gaps, report says
-------------------------------------------------
A congressional inquiry into the FBI's scientific work on the anthrax mailings of 2001 has identified major gaps in genetic evidence that purportedly links the germs to Bruce E Ivins, the Army microbiologist blamed for attacks that killed 5 people, sickened 17 others, and shook the nation.

The Government Accountability Office [GAO] study, requested in 2010 and made public on [Fri 19 Dec 2014], echoes earlier criticism from the National Academy of Sciences. In 2011, its expert panel found that the bureau's analysis of the genetic evidence "did not definitively demonstrate" a firm link between the mailed anthrax spores and a sample taken from Dr Ivins's laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and more generally was "not as conclusive" as the bureau had asserted.

The GAO had better access to FBI records and deepened the genetic critique, finding that the bureau's investigation "lacked several important characteristics" that could have strengthened its case. "A key scientific gap," the 77-page report said, was the bureau's failure to investigate whether samples of anthrax spores could naturally mutate enough to obscure their putative links to Dr Ivins.

In 2008, shortly after he killed himself, the bureau laid out a sweeping but circumstantial case against Dr Ivins, an Army microbiologist, saying he had acted alone in conducting the nation's 1st major bioterrorist attack. It called the case Amerithrax and said that unique mutations in the anthrax spores had helped put Dr Ivins under the spotlight.

In an interview, Timothy M Persons, the GAO's chief scientist, credited the bureau with working hard to correct some of its science deficiencies but said its evidence fell short in the anthrax case, which was officially closed in 2010. "They needed better science and measurement in order to be more conclusive," he said. "It sounds nitpicky, but that's important in building up the scientific evidence for an important case."

The bureau said it agreed with the GAO's advice on improving its forensic science.

On [Fri 19 Dec 2014], representative Rush D Holt, a New Jersey Democrat and physicist who requested the study, said the report "confirms what I have often said -- that the FBI's definitive conclusions about the accuracy of their scientific findings in the Amerithrax case are not, in fact, definitive. The United States needs a comprehensive, independent review of the Amerithrax investigation to ensure we have learned the lessons from this bio attack." Mr Holt has repeatedly called for a national commission on the anthrax mailings that would serve as a kind of scaled-down version of the panel that studied the terrorist attacks of [11 Sep 2001]. The anthrax letters were sent from a mailbox in Princeton, New Jersey, which is in his district. [Unfortunately representative Holt is retiring at the end 2014. - Mod.MHJ]

The deadly wisps of anthrax, coming just after the September [2001] attacks, set off new waves of panic. Over the years, a growing number of outside experts have asked whether federal investigators got the right man and whether the FBI's long inquiry brushed aside important clues. To the regret of independent scientists, the report made no mention of an issue beyond genetics: whether the spores displayed signs of advanced manufacturing. They have pointed to distinctive chemicals found in the dried anthrax spores that they say contradict FBI claims that the germs were unsophisticated. Evidence of special coatings, they say, suggests that Dr Ivins had help in obtaining his germ weapons or was innocent.

Martin E Hugh-Jones, an authority on anthrax at Louisiana State University, said the report was disappointing.

The bureau clearly does not intend to revisit the questions raised about the letter spores having been microencapsulated. [See ProMED-mail posts 20130125.1514939 and 20111017.3112]. This suggests that either they are satisfied with the quality of the original investigation or concerned about any significant new findings resulting from a revisitation. Either is worrying. - Mod.MHJ
