TUBERCULOSIS, WILDLIFE - BOTSWANA (03)

I am a final-year veterinary student (and a citizen of Botswana) at
Sydney University, Australia. The presence of human TB in meerkats
is indeed a surprise.
First, if the meerkats contracted TB from the rubbish dumps, are
other animals scavenging at those dumps? Are those animals with
behavioral characteristics that would allow its spread , such as
vervet monkeys and baboons, not infected? Has there been any work
done to find this out?
Secondly, the government of Botswana already has a program in place
to treat people for HIV (anti-retroviral drugs) for FREE, refer to
the ministry of education - Botswana government.
Lastly, although transmission of human disease to wildlife is a
potential risk, it should be noted that it is; that will always
exist. Ecotourism, it seems, is the only real solution for land use
in the Chobe region of Botswana. The next alternative is pastoral
agriculture -- which would mean the end of wildlife in the area --
literally.

[The item in New Scientist to which the reader refers is based upon
the article "Mycobacterium tuberculosis: An Emerging Disease of
Free-Ranging Wildlife" by Kathleen Alexander et al., just published
in Emerging Infectious Diseases, vol 8, No 6, June 2002, 598 - 601.
The authors claim to describe the first documented outbreak of _M.
tuberculosis_ in free-ranging wildlife. They were able to do so after
examining populations of 2 species in the Chobe National Park, namely
banded mongooses (_Mungos mungo_) and suricates (_Suricata
suricatta_). There is, at present, nothing to say about (the
infectivity of) other species, such as vervet monkeys and baboons.
I assume the reader will agree with the concluding remark in the
article: "... A better understanding of the dynamics of disease
transmission between humans and wildlife is critical, and mechanisms
must be identified that limit wildlife exposure to human pathogens."
Although the Botswana government has a plan in place for treating
HIV-infected individuals (which is commendable), we do not know about
treatment of those with TB. Also, as TB can be insidious and chronic,
it is not impossible for tourists infected with this agent to be
passing TB to the wildlife. As pointed out in the first of these
postings, it is a difficult balancing act to have tourism to support
the animals, and animals to support the tourism. Education before
entering a wildlife zone would be advisable. - Mods.AS/TG]
