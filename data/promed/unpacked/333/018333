A meat supplier has greatly expanded a ground beef recall, which now
includes about 5.7 million pounds [about 2585 tons] of fresh and
frozen meat that may be contaminated with _E. coli_ [O157:H7].
David Goldman, acting administrator of the USDA (US Department of
Agriculture) Food Safety and Inspection Service, announced on Sat 9
Jun 2007, that the recall would be expanded to include products with
sell-by dates from 6-20 Apr 2007. The beef, sold in 11 western
states, was distributed by California-based United Food Group LLC.
Goldman said that none of the latest batch of suspect beef is in
stores now because the product would be well past its expiration
date, but consumers may still have some of the meat at home. "It is
important for consumers to look in their freezers," Goldman said.
The meat has been blamed for an _E. coli_ outbreak in the western
states that resulted in 14 illnesses, spanning 25 Apr through 18 May
2007. All the patients have recovered.
On Wed 6 Jun 2007, United Food Group expanded an initial recall of 75
000 (about 34 020 kg) pounds of ground beef, adding another 370 000
pounds (167 829 kg) based on "unspecified concerns" raised by the
California State Department of Health Services. This meat had sell-by
dates between 29 Apr and 6 May 2007.
The recalled products were shipped to stores in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,
Washington, and Wyoming. They were sold under the brand names Moran's
All Natural, Miller Meat Company, Stater Bros., Trader Joe's Butcher
Shop, Inter-American Products Inc., and Basha's. The affected grocery
stores included Albertson's, Basha's, Grocery Outlet, Fry's, "R"
Ranch Markets, Save-A-Lot, Save-Mart, Scolari's Wholesale Markets,
Smart and Final, Smith's, Stater Bros., and Superior Warehouse.

[5.7 million pounds of ground beef is equal to 2588 tons or nearly
2.6 million kilograms. If the average cow weighs say 400 kg (about
900 pounds), about a third of the weight is edible meat (about 290
pounds or 131 kg) (source:
<http://en.allexperts.com/q/Food-Science-1425/cow-weight-cow-meat.htm>).
If all the meat were turned into ground beef, which it is not, the
recall represents about 20 000 cows. - Mod.LL]
