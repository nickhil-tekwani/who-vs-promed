["Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and often severe disease found worldwide that affects birds including domestic poultry. It is caused by a virus in the family of paramyxoviruses.

"The disease appears in three forms: lentogenic or mild, mesogenic or moderate and velogenic or very virulent, also called exotic Newcastle disease. The lentogenic strains are very widespread but cause few disease outbreaks.

"It usually presents as a respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form."

"ND is transmitted most often by direct contact with diseased or carrier birds. Infected birds may shed the virus in their feces, contaminating the environment. Transmission can then occur by direct contact with feces and respiratory discharges or by contaminated food, water, equipment, and human clothing. Newcastle disease viruses can survive for several weeks in the environment, especially in cool weather.

"Generally, virus is shed during the incubation period and for a short time during recovery. Birds in the pigeon family can shed the virus intermittently for a year or more. Other wild birds such as cormorants have also been shown to have caused outbreaks in domestic poultry.

"The virus is present in all parts of the carcass of an infected bird.

"The disease is very contagious. When the virus is introduced into a susceptible flock, virtually all the birds will be infected within 2 to 6 days.

Newcastle disease is a minor zoonosis (disease of animals that can also infect humans) and can cause conjunctivitis in humans, but the condition is generally very mild and self-limiting"
