- A commercial tom turkey flock exhibited coughing with a slight increase in mortality. Samples were submitted for laboratory testing and were confirmed positive for influenza A virus (IAV) H7N3 LPAI.
- North American H7N3 LPAI based upon partial HA and NA sequence obtained directly from swab specimen; virus isolation pending.
- The infected premises was placed under quarantine following preliminary findings and an epidemiological investigation was initiated.
- Follow-up surveillance and testing on 10 epidemiologically associated farms was negative for IAV. The epidemiological investigation and response to the event are continuing.

Control measures

[The following background commentary by Mod.CRD (archived 20150124.3114605) should be helpful to subscribers - Mod.AS:

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.

The OIE Terrestrial Code Chapter 10.4 on Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses, Article 10.4.1 defines "poultry" as "all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose. Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, racing, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/2010/chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.pdf. - Mod.CRD
