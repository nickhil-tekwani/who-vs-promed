2000/161 Relations among sorghum ergot isolates from the Americas, Africa,
India and Australia [edited]
Sorghum ergot (or sugary disease of sorghum), initially restricted to Asia
and Africa, [has] recently spread to the Americas and Australia. Associated
with the disease are the following 3 species: _Claviceps sorghi_ in India,
_C. sorghicola_ in Japan and _C. africana_ (EPPO Alert List) in all
countries where the disease is observed.
_C. africana_ is the species that is currently spreading. The relations
existing among sorghum ergot isolates from the Americas, Africa, India and
Australia were studied to determine the possible origin of the _C.
africana_ clones introduced into the Americas and Australia. Comparison of
nucleotide sequences (internal transcribed spacer 1 and 5.8S rDNA regions)
confirmed that [the 3 pathogens] are 3 distinct species.
Intraspecific variation within _C. africana_ was studied (RAPD patterns) on
28 isolates from USA, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Bolivia, Australia, India and
South Africa. It was further confirmed that _C. africana_ occurs in India
(see EPPO RS 99/097). All American isolates were identical, and because 3
isolates of the same type came from South Africa, Africa was suggested as a
possible origin for the invasive clones in the Americas. RAPD patterns of
Australian and Indian isolates were distinguished only by a single band,
suggesting an Asian origin for the clones introduced into Australia.

[Taking into account the spreading pattern of _C. africana_ over the last
40 years, the authors suggest that the highlands of eastern Africa, a
region close to the center of origin of sorghum and where ergot continues
to be endemic, is the most likely geographic area for the center of
diversity for the pathogen. - Mod.DH]
