hemorrhagic fever this year had been reported.
The patient, a 47-year-old woman from Taipei, checked into a hospital in
late July after returning from a trip to Thailand, DOH officials said. Hsu
Hsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control, said the patient's symptoms included small hemorrhagic spots on
her skin, accumulation of liquid in the thorax, and platelet count

Hsu said.
Since 1994, 21 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in
Taiwan, of those cases, one patient has died, Hsu said.
