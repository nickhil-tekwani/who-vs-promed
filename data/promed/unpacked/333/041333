In response to the ProMED report of 23 Mar 2002 concerning a dolphin
die-off in California [see ref. above, I would add the following:
FSL Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, California received a
stranded, 270 pound, adult, male Common Dolphin from the Los
Angeles area, late evening on 17 Mar 2002 . Moderate seizure activity
was noted during transport to the center. Physical examination revealed
obvious, moderate to severe central nervous system (CNS) pathology
with visual and locomotor deficits. Blood work revealed moderately to
severely deranged electrolytes (very low potassium). Since the animal's
condition failed to respond to standard therapies for stranded animals
and continued to deteriorate, euthanasia was elected.
A thorough and complete gross postmortem examination failed to
reveal any significant lesions. The gastrointestinal tract was completely
empty. A clean spinal tap was perform 2 minutes after euthanasia and
about 3ml of very flocculent fluid was obtained. Analysis of the sample
failed to reveal any cellular or biochemical abnormalities but
cytologically did show large amount of proteinaceous-like material
present (myelin?).
Histopathologic examination of a wide survey of tissues including the
brain is underway at present.
Urine was submitted to Marine Biotoxin Laboratory in Charleston,
South Carolina (SC) and found to contain high levels of domoic acid
(1 microgram/ml). We were informed by the lab that samples taken
from at least one of the other dolphins mentioned in the ProMED
report had the same level of domoic acid in the urine.
I should also note that in January of this year [2002 we received 2
adult female California sea lions with severe neurological disease
whose urine was also positive for domoic acid (0.01 and 1.0
microgram/ml). Histopathologic examination is presently being
conducted on these samples.
