Health officials warned against a dengue-like disease that has affected several persons in Cagayan de Oro City, Pangasinan, and Metro Manila this year.

The Department of Health (DOH) said there were more than 1000 cases of the mosquito-borne disease, called chikungunya, last year [2011]. At present, there are over 150 suspected cases of the disease.

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.

WHO experts warned that chikungunya might be mistaken for dengue as it shares some clinical symptoms with the latter. There is no cure for the disease and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

DOH spokesperson Dr. Eric Tayag said that dengue mostly affects children while chikungunya [virus] affects adults, although both present rashes and fever. In chikungunya [virus infections], arthritis is also present. Experts have recorded cases of chikungunya in the Philippines since the 1990s.

"Some people suffer long-term arthritis for years and even after they have recovered from their initial infection," Tayag said, adding that chikungunya is not fatal.

[Given the symptoms of severe arthralgia, and the history of many cases last year (2011), the diagnosis of suspected chikungunya virus CHIKV) infection is likely correct. CHIKV is an alphavirus transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. It produces a dengue-like illness in humans, but with painful arthalgia that may persist for weeks or even months after the acute infection.

Although a vaccine has been developed (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20060219.0544) it is not commercially available, so avoidance of mosquito bites and control of _Aedes_ vector mosquito populations are the only preventive measures currently available. - Mod.TY
