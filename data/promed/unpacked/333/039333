administration stated that 639 people had suffered tick bites during
the course of the year [2007]. The public health services committee
of the Volgograd Oblast Administration was informed that, from the
time of the 1st tick bites [11 May 2007], a total of 78 people had
been admitted to hospital. At present, 49 persons are in hospitals in
