Several cases of diseased wildlife are showing up in Orangeburg
County. Officials there say they are dealing with a distemper virus
outbreak and it could pose a threat to your pets.

So far, officials have caught 7 raccoons and 6 foxes all with the
distemper virus. Authorities have caught the animals within city
limits and say the outbreak may be caused by people feeding stray dogs
and cats. That leads to wildlife coming into neighborhoods looking for
that food. "You may be feeding, lets say stray cats, but your also
feeding raccoons and any other wildlife that come across this food at
night," said Department of Natural Resources official Jay Butfiloski.

Distemper is a viral disease that mimics some of the signs of rabies.
Crusting of the eyes and nose and loss of appetite are common. The
virus can't be passed onto humans, but it can pose a danger to pets.

If you come across an animal with distemper virus, you are asked to
call the Orangeburg Department of Public Safety at 533-5516.

[Canine distemper is a highly contagious, systemic, viral disease of
dogs seen worldwide. Clinically, it is characterized by a diphasic
fever, leukopenia, GI and respiratory catarrh, and frequently
pneumonic and neurologic complications. The disease is seen in Canidae
(dogs, foxes, wolves), Mustelidae (such as, ferret, mink, skunk), most
Procyonidae (such as, raccoon, coatimundi), and some Viverridae
(binturong).

Canine distemper virus infection is probably the commonest viral
disease in raccoons. The clinical signs, and gross and histopathologic
lesions in raccoons are similar to distemper in dogs. Neurologic signs
due to distemper virus infection in raccoons are virtually
indistinguishable from rabies-induced neurologic disease. Diagnosis is
based upon histopathologic lesions in brain, lung, spleen and small
intestine. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be
visualized in many cells including epithelial cells in the respiratory
epithelium, gastric mucosa, and transitional epithelium lining the
renal pelvis and urinary bladder. The best tissues for fluorescent
antibody testing and virus isolation of canine distemper virus are
lung, brain, stomach, small intestine, kidney and urinary bladder.

Canine distemper in canines, including the fox, exhibits a transient
fever usually occurring 3-6 days after infection, and there may be a
leukopenia (especially lymphopenia) at this time; these signs may go
unnoticed or be accompanied by anorexia. The fever subsides for
several days before a 2nd fever occurs, which lasts less than one
week. This may be accompanied by serous nasal discharge, mucopurulent
ocular discharge and anorexia. GI and respiratory signs may follow and
are usually complicated by secondary bacterial infections. An acute
encephalomyelitis may occur in association with or following the
systemic disease, or in the absence of systemic manifestations.
Hyperkeratosis of the footpads ("hardpad" disease) and epithelium of
the nasal plane may be seen. Neurologic signs are frequently seen in
those dogs with hyperkeratosis. CNS signs include localized
involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles (myoclonus,
chorea, flexor spasm, hyperkinesia), such as in the leg or facial
muscles; paresis or paralysis, often most noticeable in the hind limbs
as ataxia, followed by tetraparesis and tetraparalysis; and
convulsions characterized by salivation and often chewing movements of
the jaw ("chewing-gum fits"). The seizures become more frequent and
severe, and the dog may fall on its side and paddle its legs;
involuntary urination and defecation (grand mal seizure, epileptiform
convulsion) often occur. A dog may exhibit any or all of these
neurologic signs in addition to others in the course of the disease.
Infection may be mild and inapparent or lead to severe disease
manifest by most of the signs above. The course of the systemic
disease may be as short as 10 days, but the onset of neurologic signs
may be delayed for several weeks or months.
