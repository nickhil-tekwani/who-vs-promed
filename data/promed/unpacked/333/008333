Abstract
--------
Paratuberculosis (PTB) has been reported in the Sudan in cattle and goats for more than 50 years but has never been reported in sheep. However, suspicion of the disease in a breeding flock of sheep in Khartoum North locality was made due to a history of unknown cause of loss of weight. Blood and faecal samples were collected from all animals (N = 59): harvested sera were tested for anti-_Mycobacterium avium_ subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); faeces were screened for acid-fast bacilli by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, tested for MAP DNA by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and some faecal samples were cultured for MAP isolation. Typical MAP acid-fast bacilli were seen in 10.2% (6/59) of the faecal smears; 37.5% of the tested faecal samples (12/32) were positive for MAP DNA, and only 3 (5.1%) animals were seropositive for MAP. MAP-positive cultures were obtained from 2 out of the 6 samples showing typical MAP acid-fast bacilli; the isolates were confirmed by real-time PCR and sequencing. As sheep are animals of utmost economic importance as the main export animals for the country, this 1st report of ovine PTB warrants special considerations and more investigations for planning control programmes of the disease.

[Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease, ParaTB), a WOAH-listed disease, is a chronic enteritis of ruminants caused by _Mycobacterium avium_ subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Infection mostly occurs at a young age, eventually expressed clinically months/years later. Clinical signs in cattle include slowly progressive wasting and diarrhoea, which is intermittent at first, becoming progressively more severe until it is constantly present. In sheep, the principal symptom is a progressive loss of weight, which results in extreme emaciation after a course of several weeks. Diarrhoea is less common in sheep than in cattle, though may be severe in certain breeds. Appetite remains good. Finally, weakness increases, and the animals go down some days before death.

The citation and (abridged) abstract of a 2019 review paper addressing the control of ParaTB in livestock in 48 countries follows:

Paratuberculosis was found to be very common in cattle and sheep. "In about half the countries, more than 20% of herds and flocks were infected with MAP. Most countries had large ruminant populations (millions), several types of farmed ruminants, multiple husbandry systems, and tens of thousands of individual farms, creating challenges for disease control. In addition, numerous species of free-living wildlife were infected. Paratuberculosis was notifiable in most countries."

Formal control programs were present in 22/48 countries. "Generally, these were the more highly developed countries with advanced veterinary services. Of the countries without a formal control program for paratuberculosis, 76% were in South and Central America, Asia, and Africa while 20% were in Europe."

Systematic vaccination together with biosecurity measures have been found to be effective in controlling ParaTB in sheep in several countries.

According to the reviewed paper, the disease was investigated in a small sheep breeding flock. The breed is not specified. Genetic susceptibility to _M. avium_ subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) has been attributed to several breeds of sheep globally. Information about the breed in the affected sheep flock will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
