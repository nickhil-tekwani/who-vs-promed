2014-2015 Influenza Season Week 33 ending 22 Aug 2015
--------------------------------------------

Novel Influenza A Viruses
---------------------
One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by the state of Iowa (USA). The person was infected with an influenza A (H1N1) variant (H1N1v) virus and was hospitalized as a result of their illness. No human-to-human transmission has been identified, and the case reported close contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that risk of infection can be more fully appreciated and appropriate public health measures can be taken.

Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.

[Influenza viruses of swine origin are found frequently in live animal markets in the USA. Multiple influenza A virus (IAV) strains and subtypes co-circulate; new viral reassortants can be identified, and there is evidence of interspecies transmission of IAV from swine to persons.

Infection of swine may occur by reverse zoonosis, where humans infect swine, or alternatively, swine may infect humans. In both cases, the pigs are effective mixing vessels for influenza viruses.

There have been a total of 376 swine variant infections reported in the United States. Prior to 2015, almost all have been H3N2v (H3N2 variant), however 3 of the 4 cases detected this year [2015] in humans have been the less common H1N1v.

The cases are mostly mild with nearly all associated with exposure to pigs at state and local agricultural fairs. Nonetheless, because of the danger of adaptation to humans, CDC issued guidance: CDC Interim Guidance for Workers who are Employed at Commercial Swine Farms: Preventing the Spread of Influenza A Viruses (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/guidance-commercial-pigs.htm) with the goal of preventing the spread of influenza viruses from people to pigs and from pigs to people.

Iowa is located in the midwest of the United States.
