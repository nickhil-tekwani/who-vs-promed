German manufacturer Humana Milchunion Everswinkel has dismissed 4
executive employees following mistakes in the production of infant
food formula sold in Israel. Among those losing their jobs are the
head of product development and the directors of the quality control
unit and chemical laboratory. Although the economic consequences of
the mix-up are thought to have been minimal, the company risks losing
a great deal of consumer trust.
"At this point in time, it can not be ruled out that the soy-based
infant formula produced by us might possibly have led to the death
and illness of babies in Israel," said Humana's CEO Albert Grosse.
"We are all gravely shaken and concerned by that. We feel deep and
sincere sympathy for the families concerned."
The dismissals come after in-house investigation carried out by the
company. Grosse claims that measures have now been implemented that
make it impossible for the same type of error to occur again. "Even
in case of such co-incidence of errors and personal negligence, it
will be impossible to release a faulty product for shipment," he said.
From now on, all new formulations and recipe changes of Humana
products will be subjected to a full laboratory test of the
ingredients before release for initial production. Only if the
external laboratory confirms that the declarations of the ingredients
are correct may the production procedure be initiated. This, says the
company, is not currently required by law.
In addition, for every new formulation and recipe change in future,
the responsible managers of the product development and the quality
assurance departments must give written confirmation that the quality
control procedure was adhered to. The products will not be cleared
for shipment if this confirmation is not given. Should the
responsible authorities consider it necessary to make the
corresponding tests and registrations a binding requirement for new
formulations and recipe changes, Humana would expressly welcome it.
In an attempt to allay any doubt among the general public, Humana has
also commissioned 2 accredited scientific institutes with a test for
vitamin B1 on a total of 53 baby food products. "Some results have
already been submitted to us," said Grosse. "They confirm that the
vitamin B1 content of the products is absolutely safe. The remaining
test results are expected in the next few days."
The 1st mistake was made during the product development of the new
soy-based formula. A team of product developers at Humana wrongly
interpreted analysis data with the result that vitamin B1 was not
added as it should have been. This meant that the ersatz milk
contained only 1/10 of the vital vitamin as stated on the packet.
The 2nd error occurred in the quality control sector. Although German
law does not require it, the new product was sent to the highly
respected LUFA-ITL laboratory in Kiel. When the analysis came back in
May, data concerning the vitamin content was missing. Nonetheless,
the scientific staff of Humana accepted the product analysis as
complete.
The 3rd mistake occurred in September, when it was noticed by chance
that the data on vitamins were missing. A follow-up inquiry was
communicated to LUFA on 22 Sep 2003. There it was confirmed that
there was no test done on vitamins at all. The necessary intervention
was not initiated. Humana says that it will cooperate with the
Israeli authorities in order to investigate appropriate measures in
support of the families affected by the mistakes.

[It would be interesting to know the Vitamin B1 (thiamine) content of
the soy ingredient incorporated in the infant formula, and whether
soy from different origins was used for the production of different
batches. Another issue the investigators might consider is the
Vitamin B1 (thiamine) content of genetically modified soy. - Mod.AS]
