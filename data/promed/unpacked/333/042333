The Ministry of Health in Quito maintains that this epidemic began in
September 1995. There were fewer cases in December and then more in
January, February and March. So far all cases have had the history of
dog bites. There is endemic bovine rabies caused by vampire bats in
the eastern rain forest, but the current epidemic is exclusively urban
canine rabies. (The last case that was in our hospital had been bit
first by his cat, three months before illness, and then by his dog, one
month before illness. Both pets "disappeared".) As of last Thursday,
there were 16 human cases with 14 deaths.

Information published by the Pan American Institute for Food
Protection and Zoonoses,PAHO/WHO, Rabies surveillance report
1994:
In 1994 there were 11 human cases of rabies, 7 male, in 9
cases dogs was the cause, and two others in unidentified
animals.
December reported 3 cases, March and June 2 cases each,
April, Aug,Sept and Oct one each.
652 dogs were found positive by lab. January was the month
with highest number of positive dogs (83 )and July the lowest
37, all month have cases of rabid dogs; also 99 cats were
found positive to rabies by lab. diagnostic.
I do not have a figure for Ecuador's dog population or number of
vaccinated dogs by official vaccination and private vets.
But evidently the country is in a serious problem of rabies,
and I hope there are some measures in place, with the
available information it is not easy to say if there is and
epidemic or endemic situation.
I hope this information will be useful.
