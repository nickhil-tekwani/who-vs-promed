All 400,000 residents of Spokane County [State of Washington] are being
advised to get hepatitis A vaccinations because of an outbreak traced to
poor food handling. The Health Officer for the regional health district
said that Spokane County is at significant risk for further cases of
hepatitis A.
Apparently, the outbreak began late last fall. At least 120 cases have
been reported since 1 January, compared with 190 for all of 1997.

[This is an expensive vaccine. Let's see ...400,000 (people) x (about) $75
(per dose) x 2 (doses) = $60,000,000. Just about what Michael Jordan is
paid. - Mod.CHC]
