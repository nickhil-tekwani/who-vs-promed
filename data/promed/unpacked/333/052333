Prion immunoreactivity in brain, tonsil, gastrointestinal epithelial cells,
and blood and lymph vessels in lemurian zoo primates with spongiform
encephalopathy. Bons N, Mestre-Frances N, Guiraud I, Charnay Y, Ecole
pratique des hautes etudes, universite Montpellier-II, France.
We report on two animals of a non-human primate species _Eulemur fulvus
mayottensis_, housed in the local zoo and fed over a number of years with a
food containing cattle meat, that developed serious neurological symptoms
associated with prion immunoreactivity in brain and various viscera.
Microscopy of the brains showed neuronal vacuolation with
patchy/perivacuolar immunolabelling with an abnormal isoform of prion
protein (IR-PrP), an important characteristic of spongiform encephalopathy.
For the first time, we report the presence in the same severely ill animals
of IR-PrP in the gastrointestinal tract, detected by immunocytochemistry
with mono- and polyclonal antibodies directed against various parts of the
PrP. Strong PrP labelling was observed in the epithelial cells lining the
pharyngeal and gastrointestinal lumen. The tonsils and the walls of the
lymph and blood vessels below the intestinal epithelium were also labelled.
There were no such immunoreactions in healthy lemurians killed as controls,
i.e. a younger congener of the same species housed under the same
conditions, and others belonging to the smaller species _Microcebus
murinus_, reared in the laboratory and never fed on commercial food
products containing cattle meat.
These results demonstrate a strong PrP accumulation in the brain, the
gastrointestinal tract and underlying lymphoreticular structures in these
primates living in a zoological park and suffering from a spongiform
encephalopathy.
