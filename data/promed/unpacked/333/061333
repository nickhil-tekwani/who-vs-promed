Is the doggie flu epidemic overblown? Despite recent research and reports
about the canine illness, a Virginia Tech expert thinks so.
Virginia Tech researcher Dr. Brad Fenwick has spent years battling the
various ailments that occasionally sweep through racing-dog populations.
Lately, though, the internationally recognized greyhound expert has found
himself working to prevent the spread of what he deems undue panic among
dog owners about canine flu.
For the 2nd time in 4 months, newspapers and other media outlets worldwide
have carried alarming stories about a new, potentially deadly strain of
influenza that has sickened thousands of dogs. And for the 2nd time,
Fenwick is strongly and publicly disputing what he sees as media "overhype"
of a doggie flu that, while fatal on rare occasions, likely comes and goes
without most dog owners even noticing. He is urging the dog-owning public
to remain calm. "This is a lot like a winter cold for humans," said
Fenwick, who is also the vice president for research at Virginia Tech. "We
sneeze. We cough a little bit. We go to work. We don't take antibiotics and
we're fine. We get over it."
News outlets 1st caught wind of the story in the spring, when more than a
dozen greyhounds at a Massachusetts racetrack died suddenly of a flu-like
illness. The sickness resembled "kennel cough," a relatively common and
rarely deadly syndrome that causes coughing, runny nose and other
respiratory problems in dogs. But the flu was more contagious. Tracks in
other states reported similar outbreaks, although with fewer or no deaths.
The virus, as well as media attention, waned until this week [final week
September 2005], when Science magazine published a report on the flu by a
team of researchers. The group wrote that the flu virus, which they believe
began in horses and made the rare leap to dogs, appears to have spread
beyond greyhounds into the domestic dog population in Florida and other
states. The true scope is yet unknown. "The canine influenza virus is
really the new kid on the block for veterinarians to consider in their
differential diagnoses for kennel cough," said Dr. Cynda Crawford, a
University of Florida professor and lead researcher, during a Centers for
Disease Control press conference this week.
Crawford and her colleagues estimated that the new canine flu had a
mortality rate of 5 percent to 8 percent. Alluding to alarmist media
reports and rumors, Crawford said the flu is "not the deadly virus that
certain sources have played it up to be" and recommended that dog owners
maintain their habits regarding kennels, groomers and dog parks.
Fenwick does not dispute most of the group's scientific findings, but he
believes the 5 percent to 8 percent mortality figures are "outrageously
high." Fenwick, whose research team is developing a vaccine for the flu,
said his studies have found that less than one percent of all infected dogs
even need treatment with antibiotics to prevent secondary infection, which
is what often causes flu-related deaths. Among those one percent, a small
number died from the illness. Fenwick attributed the high mortality seen at
isolated tracks to delayed or inappropriate treatment. "We deal with
outbreaks that are much more serious all of the time," Fenwick said.
Crawford could not be reached on Friday [30 Sep 2005].
Fenwick, who sent a letter to track and kennel owners nationwide at the
urging of the American Greyhound Council, also called any suggestion that
the dog flu could transfer to humans "irresponsible to the extreme."
Fenwick recommended that dog owners keep a watch over dogs that begin
coughing, sneezing or exhibiting other signs. Most will heal by themselves.
Dogs that become depressed or stop eating and playing, however, should be
brought to a veterinarian immediately, he said.
Canine flu does not appear to be causing problems in the Roanoke and New
River valleys. "I'm having some owners ask about it, but I really haven't
seen any cases here," said Dr. Randall Young with Christiansburg Veterinary
Clinic.
Dr. Steve Karras from Cave Spring Veterinary Clinic said his office has
also received numerous calls from dog owners concerned about their dogs or
the possibility of pets passing it to humans. Karras, who has not seen any
flu cases, said he is urging owners to keep their dogs' vaccinations for
kennel cough and other illnesses current to prevent secondary infection
should the flu spread locally.

[There are multiple reports of canine influenza on the news wires. Most of
them are reporting an epidemic of this disease in dogs. However, it is
prudent to realize that only approximately 10 percent of dogs are affected,
and those are primarily greyhounds. This situation also illustrates how
awareness by both veterinarians and the dog-owning public causes the
appearance of an epidemic of diagnosis.
The public is much more aware of the disease and is more attuned to
clinical signs in their dogs. Veterinarians are more aware of an influenza
in dogs and are likely to be more attuned to those signs in dogs.
Consequently, the stories of where the disease has appeared make it seem
the disease is spreading.
There is indication that this particular influenza has jumped species, from
horses to dogs. But given that influenza viruses are survivors in the
environment, it is not surprising the virus would find another way to
survive. Most of these articles also point out canine influenza virus may
have come from horses.
The following websites and headlines all illustrate essentially the same
news story, with different locales and different veterinarians:
Dog flu arrives in Oregon, Associated Press, Kgw.com, Oregon and SW Washington
