Joint analysis by the Nordic countries of a hepatitis A outbreak, October 2012 to June 2013: frozen strawberries suspected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
The Nordic countries faced a food-borne outbreak of hepatitis A that started in October 2012 and was ongoing with 103 reported cases as of 27 Jun 2013. A case-control study in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, combined with trace-back investigations, has identified frozen strawberries as the likely cause of the outbreak. The origin of the berries is still being investigated.

Hepatitis A virus seroprevalence is under 10 percent in Nordic countries [1] where endemicity is very low [2]. In February 2013, Denmark noticed an increase in the number of notified hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections among individuals with no travel history. On 1 Mar 2013, following an urgent enquiry posted through the European Epidemic Intelligence Information System for food- and waterborne diseases (EPIS-FWD), Finland, Norway and Sweden reported a similar increase and identified cases that were infected with the same IB genotype and sequence (KC876797) as the Danish cases, as well as cases with closely related sequences [3]. In March 2013, a case-control study conducted in Denmark identified frozen berries, particularly frozen strawberries, as the likely vehicle of the outbreak, but could not exclude other frozen berries [3]. As a result of this finding, the 4 Nordic countries recommended boiling all frozen berries before consumption [3].

While public health institutes in the 4 countries coordinated their data collection methods to pool the analysis of the country-specific case-control studies to identify the vehicle of the outbreak more precisely, investigators compared the outbreak strains with the HAV network (HAVNET) database [4] to gain information on the probable phylogenetic origin of the outbreak strains, and food agencies analysed product distribution and tested fruit specimens.

Discussion
----------
After pooling data from the 4 affected countries, consumption of frozen strawberries, frozen raspberries and mixed frozen berries (which can contain both strawberries and raspberries) were significantly associated with being a confirmed case. Although the pooled analysis was restricted to earlier confirmed cases, this is unlikely to have introduced bias since there was no reason to believe later cases were different from earlier ones. Hepatitis A outbreaks have been previously linked to both strawberries [10,11] and raspberries [12,13], and frozen mixed berries are suspected in 2 hepatitis A outbreaks that were ongoing as of 27 Jun 2013 in Italy and the United States (US) [14,15]. Frozen strawberries were most strongly associated with being a confirmed case and were the product most commonly eaten by cases. Additional elements pointed to the strawberries as the vehicle of the outbreak: Firstly, strawberries were most strongly associated with being a case in the Swedish national case-control study as well as national case-control studies in Denmark and Norway [3]. Secondly, strawberries were the only exposure significantly associated with being a confirmed case in the multicountry multivariable analysis. Thirdly, the preliminary food trace-back investigations pointed towards strawberries. Finally, when restricting the analysis to individuals who did not consume raspberries, the association between being a confirmed case and frozen strawberries remained significant.

The strength of association between raspberries and being a confirmed case in the multicountry analysis was weaker than for strawberries. In addition, raspberries were not associated with illness in the Swedish study. Restricting the analysis to people who had not eaten strawberries was difficult because only 4 cases did not eat strawberries. Trace-back analysis found no evidence to implicate raspberries, but based on the epidemiological analyses, we cannot completely exclude that raspberries or frozen mixed berries may have played a role in the outbreak.

The outbreak included 2 distinct (less than 2 percent different) HAV sequences that were found in the 4 countries during the outbreak period. There was no evidence that one outbreak strain was more strongly associated with one vehicle than the other. The HAV mutation rate is low [16], suggesting the 2 sequences identified in the outbreak represented distinct strains rather than a sporadic mutation. Such multi-strain food-borne hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported previously [17,18]. At this stage we do not know where in the production chain or in which country the contamination occurred. While the comparison of strains in the HAVNET database indicated an association with strains from travellers infected in Egypt, we cannot exclude that these strains also circulate in other countries. As HAV is not genotyped routinely, the known genetic diversity is biased towards more densely sampled regions. Finally, the trace-back investigation has not yet pointed to a single country. The origin of the contaminated strawberries or the point of contamination can therefore not be identified at this moment.

This outbreak occurred in the context of several hepatitis A outbreaks affecting Europe and EU residents [4,14,19] as well as another genotype 1B outbreak in the US related to frozen mixed berries [15]. The US and Nordic HAV strains are both genotype 1B and originate from the same geographic region, but there is no evidence so far that they are related [15].

HAV has as yet not been detected in the tested berries. Possible reasons could be that the HAV concentration in the samples collected may have been below the detection limit, or that other berries from the same batch contained HAV.

Conclusion
----------
During this outbreak, combined evidence from case-control studies and the food trace-back contributed to implicate frozen strawberries as the source of the outbreak, leading one supermarket chain to voluntarily recall this product. Investigations of the source will continue in order to identify the producer and batch and to test berries in the laboratory. In view of the long incubation period of hepatitis A [20] and of notification delay, more cases can be expected to occur for at least another few months, and possibly even later, despite interventions, as frozen berries can be stored in freezers for up to 2 years.

[The hepatitis A outbreaks in 4 Nordic countries of Europe and the USA show similarities, but also some differences. The US and Nordic countries hepatitis A viruses strains are both genotype 1B viruses and originate from the same geographic region, but there is no evidence so far that they are related. The European strain(s) may have originated in Egypt and the US strain may have originated in Turkey. The European outbreak involves frozen strawberries and raspberries, whereas the US outbreak involved frozen soft fruits supplemented with pomegranate seeds. The common feature is that frozen berries can be vehicles for transmission of hepatitis A virus infection. Pomegranate seeds are the suspected carrier of hepatitis A virus in the US outbreak, and strawberries in the case of the outbreaks in the Nordic countries. However, it appears that in neither case has the virus been isolated directly from the contaminated produce, only subsequently from patients. The common message is that frozen soft fruit should not be consumed uncooked, unless its precise source of production can be established. - Mod.CP
