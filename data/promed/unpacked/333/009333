Residents in Tuktoyaktuk should be on the lookout for aggressive foxes. According to public health, 2 foxes recently tested positive for rabies in the community. There have also been reports of foxes attacking dogs.

"If you have been bitten, scratched or in contact with a fox or bitten by a dog, please contact the health centre and report the incident immediately," reads the advisory. It adds residents should report attacks to Environment and Natural Resources.

Public health officials are reminding residents rabies in humans can be fatal and vaccines prevent the illness. "Any individual working closely with wildlife should review the option of receiving a rabies vaccine series or booster with the health centre," says the advisory.

["Tuktoyaktuk/Tuk-tu-yaaq-tuuq or short version 'Tuk' (Inuvialuktun: resembling a caribou) is an Inuvialuit hamlet of about 965 people which is located on the shores of the Arctic Ocean at the tip of the Northwest Territories. Formerly known as Port Brabant, the community was renamed in 1950 and was the 1st place in Canada to revert to the traditional native name" (https://www.tuktoyaktuk.ca/). - Mod.TG]

Less than a week after a fox in the Iglulik area tested positive for rabies, another fox attacked a resident on Monday [20 Dec 2021], according to the Department of Health. The Department of Health provided no detail regarding the extent of the individual's injuries. On 14 Dec 2021, a fox in the Iglulik area tested positive for rabies, the Department of Health revealed last week.

"The significant number of sightings and recent confirmed case of rabies in foxes in Iglulik has greatly increased the risk of human exposure to rabies," the department stated in a news release. "Due to the danger of rabies, we advise all residents to be on the lookout for foxes in your area."

Anyone who has been bitten or scratched by a fox or a dog is encouraged to go to the health centre and report the incident immediately. Treatment must be started quickly to be most effective.

Residents who see an animal behaving strangely, staggering, frothing at the mouth, choking or making strange noises, are urged to avoid the animal and report it to a conservation officer.

Rabies is commonly found in foxes and wolves in Nunavut and can spread to dogs when they are bitten by a rabid fox or wolf. Therefore, dogs should be tied up and monitored. [Please vaccinate your pets against rabies. Please take your pet to a veterinarian for the vaccine. - Mod.TG]

People can contract rabies when an infected animal bites, scratches or licks them. The disease can also enter through cuts in human skin when handling the carcasses of infected animals.

Foxes or wolves wandering around the community can be reported to the wildlife guardian at or the regional environmental health officer.

https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article256310502.html


A raccoon tested positive for rabies after it bit someone in a west Boca Raton neighborhood, the Florida Department of Health in Palm Beach announced Friday [3 Dec 2021]. The department did not release any information about the bite other than it happened Thursday [2 Dec 2021] in the 10 000 block of Marina Way.

The raccoon was taken by Animal Care and Control and sent for rabies testing. "Residents in the area are cautioned to avoid contact with any wildlife including feral/community cats and report suspicious animals to Animal Care and Control," the department said in a news release.

Rabies -- which is a disease of the nervous system that can be fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans -- can only be treated by a rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunization. This case is the 1st to be reported in Palm Beach this year [2021], according to the Florida Department of Health's Rabies Surveillance Data.

There were 2 animals in Broward -- a fox and a raccoon -- having tested positive this year [2021]. There were no animals with rabies in Miami-Dade this year, data show.

Here's some advice from the health department:
- All pets should have their rabies vaccinations up to date.
- Keep your pets away from wildlife.
- If you see a stray animal, call your local animal control.
- Pets should be spayed or neutered to help with animal control.
- Keep garbage cans closed and other discarded items covered.

At least one person was bitten and 3 dogs attacked by a possibly rabid fox in 3 separate encounters in Cumberland County last Friday [10 Dec 2021], according to the Pennsylvania Game Commission.

The incidents occurred within a half-mile radius of one another in Hampden Township, near Mechanicsburg, the Game Commission said. All 3 attacks occurred within a 24-hour period, according to the Game Commission.

The news shook some community members. "We're being careful when outside, just keeping an eye on the kids," said [AR] as she watched her 2 children at a Hampden Township playground.

Game Commission officials are urging the public to call the Southcentral Regional Office if they see a fox on their property behaving abnormally. "It is not necessarily concerning to see a fox during the day, or even uncommon for foxes to be curious and possibly observe humans or animals from a distance when healthy," the Game Commission said. "But when one is sick, it does behave differently and poses a health concern to the public."

Though diseases such as rabies [affect] individual animals differently, there are some abnormal behaviors an infected animal commonly might exhibit, the Game Commission said. Some animals act aggressively for no apparent reason, whereas others may act lethargic and very tame. An animal may stagger or circle in one area, or they may have partial paralysis or salivate uncontrollably.

In wildlife, rabies is an always fatal disease and once clinical signs occur, an infected animal typically dies within 7 days, according to the Game Commission. "If you observe any of these behaviors in a wild animal, never approach the animal or attempt to intervene," the Game Commission said. "The safest course of action is to contact Game Commission officials and continue to keep an eye on the animal as best you can until a warden arrives on scene."

The Game Commission also recommends people in the area of the encounters keep their dogs leashed or inside a fenced-in area, and to make sure to check the area before allowing pets to go outside. [And be sure your pet is up to date on rabies vaccination. Check with your veterinarian. - Mod.TG]

[5] Texas (Denton County): puppy, possible human exposure
Date: Thu 16 Dec 2021

https://dentonrc.com/news/public-alerted-after-krum-puppy-tests-positive-for-rabies/article_9fc4e925-4100-5222-8098-719fbffe2291.html


You might have been exposed to rabies if you played with a litter of puppies near Krum between 19 Nov and 7 Dec 2021. The litter was near the intersection of Plainview and Knox roads west of Krum.

Contact Denton County Public Health (DCPH) if you think you might have been exposed. This will allow public health officials to provide treatment before symptoms develop.

DCPH, in a press release sent Thursday afternoon [16 Dec 2021], said it did not believe there is an ongoing risk due to the puppy with rabies. Two DCPH officials contacted by phone Thursday said they did not know the puppy's name or breed.

DCPH Director Matt Richardson said he did not think the dog owner was conducting a formal breeding business, but he did not have other information. Richardson said it might take weeks, months or even more than a year before humans who contract rabies show symptoms. The disease is fatal in humans by the time symptoms start to show.

"This is really one of these instances where it's a low likelihood [of infection] but a high consequence [for inaction]," Richardson said Thursday afternoon. Rabies can be passed along by saliva, and it's not necessary for a rabid dog to bite a person to pass along the infection.

DCPH worked with the Denton County Sheriff's Office and Texas Department of State Health Services to investigate the rabies infection, and Richardson said he believes his department already interviewed everybody who would have come into contact with the infected puppy.

Richardson said animals suspected of having rabies must be euthanized in order to be tested for the disease because a brain tissue test is required. The entire litter of puppies had to be euthanized once the 1st puppy was determined to have had rabies because the entire litter was presumed to be infected, Richardson said.

"We are very, very concerned about any exposures," he explained. "And it's because rabies, if contracted, is almost always fatal in humans."

[6] Virginia (Suffolk County): fox, human exposure
Date: Sat 18 Dec 2021

https://www.wtkr.com/news/4-people-including-child-bitten-by-rabid-fox-in-suffolk


Four people, including a child, were bitten by a rabid fox in 2 separate incidents this week. These incidents occurred in the Cathedral Drive and Green Chapel Road area of Suffolk.

The Suffolk Health Department was notified on 18 Dec 2021 that a fox tested positive for the disease. Health officials say one adult and a child were bitten by a fox on 15 Dec 2021 and 2 adults were bitten by a fox on 16 Dec 2021.

The health department believes it was by the same fox both days. The 3 adults and the child have started on treatment to prevent rabies.

Since the rabid fox was roaming the neighborhood for a few days before it was captured, people in the area are advised to check their pets to see if they show signs they have been in a fight. If so, you are asked to contact the health department so they can give you advice regarding possible rabies exposure. [It would seem more prudent for individuals having pets with signs of a fight to contact their veterinarian regarding up-to-date rabies vaccinations of their pets. - Mod.TG]

Always report any human contact with a wild animal, and always avoid and report strange-acting wildlife to your local animal control department.

Exposure of humans to rabies occurs when the saliva of an infected animal enters the body through an open wound or mucous membrane [such as the eye or mouth - Mod.TG], such as with an animal bite or scratch. An animal exposure can be a serious medical event, for which prompt evaluation and complete treatment is critical.

Rabies is highly preventable if a vaccine is given early and as recommended. Unfortunately, without preventive treatment, by the time someone develops symptoms of rabies, there is no cure, and the disease is fatal in almost 100% of cases. The disease is also fatal in infected domestic dogs and cats that have not been vaccinated. [Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for humans must be given soon after a bite. Pets may be re-boostered on their rabies vaccination. - Mod.TG]

Dr. Billie Blair-Taylor, MD, acting health director for the Western Tidewater Health District, strongly emphasizes the following recommendations for Suffolk residents to take in protecting their families and their pets from rabies:

- If your pet has been in contact with an animal possibly being rabid, contact Suffolk Animal Control or the Suffolk Health Department.
- Seek medical treatment promptly for any animal bite to ensure appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment. All animal exposures must be taken seriously.
- Do not approach wild or stray animals, especially raccoons, bats, foxes, skunks, cats and dogs.
- Ensure all pet dogs, cats and ferrets have current rabies vaccinations.
- Please consult your veterinarian, Suffolk Animal Control or the Suffolk Health Department if you have any questions about pet vaccinations.
- Confine your pets to your property.
- Securely seal garbage containers with lids.

State law requires all dogs and cats over the age of 4 months to be vaccinated against rabies. For more information on rabies, contact the Suffolk Health Department, Suffolk Animal Control at http://www.suffolkva.us/153/Animal-Control or visit the Virginia Department of Health's website https://www.vdh.virginia.gov or https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/epidemiology-fact-sheets/rabies/ or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/.

https://www.wccbcharlotte.com/2021/12/18/gaston-county-reports-8th-confirmed-rabies-case-of-2021/


Gaston County is reporting its 8th confirmed rabies case of 2021 after a dog in Bessemer City was attacked by an infected raccoon on Wednesday [15 Dec 2021]. Around 11:22 am, Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement answered the call for service on Jim Clark in response to a dog getting attacked by a raccoon in a yard nearby.

The raccoon was then tested for rabies at a lab in North Carolina, and officials say a positive test result came back on Friday [17 Dec 2021]. Officials say the dog that was exposed to rabies was vaccinated and received a rabies booster shot following the incident.

Animal Care and Enforcement also canvassed the neighborhood, near the area of Jim Clark Road, to notify the community of the positive rabies result and to verify rabies vaccinations for family animals in the area. Gaston County Animal Care and Enforcement also notified the Gaston County Department Health and Human Services so they could complete a follow up investigation.

[Your pet should receive a rabies prevention vaccination. It is appropriate for owners to protect their pets from this fatal disease. Furthermore, vaccinations help to build a barrier against this disease to yourself and to your pet. Please check with your veterinarian regarding the regulations in your area, county, state or province.

Rabies virus can be deadly to you, and to your pet. If your pet is in a fight, or is scratched or bitten by an unknown animal, your pet could be at risk. It is so critical to protect your pets and yourself by vaccinating your animal. If you have received an animal bite, even it is not suspected of rabies, immediately wash the wound, regardless of size of the wound, with soap and water and seek medical attention.

Individuals being exposed to a rabid animal or an animal suspected of having rabies, either through a bite or a scratch, should wash the wound immediately with soap and water and seek medical attention and likely be treated with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). More about this in a moment.

My plea to you is to make sure your pets' vaccinations are current, and accurate, regardless of the size or species of your mammalian pet. Protect your pet, yourself and your neighbors and friends. Be kind -- vaccinate.

More about rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):
"Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can spread to people and pets if they are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal. In the United States, rabies is mostly found in wild animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes [and other unvaccinated animals, feral dogs and cats]. However, in many other countries dogs still carry rabies, and most rabies deaths in people around the world are caused by dog bites.

"The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html).

If you have been a bite victim of an animal possibly having rabies, you should consult your physician right away. You may need wound care but also advice on PEP. If you have had a bite or scratch from an animal having tested positive for rabies, work with your physician for PEP.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your healthcare provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like a flu or tetanus vaccine; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html).

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).
