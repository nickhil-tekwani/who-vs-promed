Safety reassurances have been offered to people who enjoy water
sports on the River Witham following the death on Sunday [24 Oct
2010] of a [51-year-old] Olympic rowing champion, from a suspected
waterborne bacterial infection. He became unwell after rowing 31
miles [50 km] from Lincoln to Boston [UK] on 19 Sep 2010 in the
annual Boston Rowing Marathon.

It was thought [the rower], who has 5 children, contracted Weil's
disease [leptospirosis] after being exposed to water contaminated
with urine from infected animals, such as rats and cattle. The
athlete recently returned to the water after a 17-year break from the
sport and clinched 4th place in the single scull for the 50 to 55 age
group class in the Boston Rowing Marathon, which begins at Stamp End
in Lincoln.

In the days after the race, [the rower] was said to be feeling unwell
and had a fever. He was admitted to hospital near his London home
and, a week before his death, was transferred to the liver intensive
care unit and was on life support.

Jeff Elms, events officer for Boston Rowing Club, which organises the
race, said there was no way of knowing whether [the rower] contracted
the infection from the River Witham. He said: "Like running a
marathon, you do not do a 31-mile rowing race without many miles of
training and this was one of many sources of contact with water that
he had. You're incredibly unlucky if you're the individual who
contracts it. It's very sad he died, but I hope people will be
sensible about it and carry on water activities, which are good for
everybody's health."

Welfare officer for Boston Rowing Club, Mark Housam, said: "Part of
any rower's training is being warned about water safety. If you fall
into water you must wash thoroughly and if you think you have
ingested any water seek medical advice."

Children's coach at Lincoln Canoe Club, Gary Quittenton, 42, said
youngsters were always briefed on the dangers of water including
Weil's disease. "We always tell them to cover cuts and sores up with
waterproof plasters and wash their hands, especially before eating,"
said Mr Quittenton, of Saxilby. And if they develop flu-like symptoms
make sure they tell the doctor they have been canoeing on mucky
water. I met [the victim and his rowing partner] when they were in
training and they were both proper role models for the sport."

[Although more common in tropical areas of the world, leptospirosis
is also found in temperate areas such the United Kingdom (UK) with
around 40-50 cases reported each year. (See ProMED-mail post
Leptospirosis, fatal - UK (02) 20081010.3210 and
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Leptospirosis/GeneralInformation/lepto005GeneralInformation/>).

Most patients recover completely. However, 2 to 3 people in England
and Wales die every year from leptospirosis
(<http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Leptospirosis-(Weil's-Disease).htm>).
The term Weil's disease is usually given to the more severe form of
leptospirosis, in which there is multiorgan (such as, liver, lung,
and kidney) failure and meningitis.

Leptospirosis is caused by the spirochetal bacterium _Leptospira
interrogans_. There are over 200 known pathogenic serovars, which
infect a variety of wild and domestic animals. Chronically infected
animals can then spread the leptospires in their urine. Common animal
reservoirs include rodents, cattle, and pigs. Leptospires are found
in fresh water, damp soil, vegetation, and mud, especially with
flooding after heavy rainfall. Infection may be acquired by contact
with infected animal urine, tissues, or secretions, or water
contaminated with infected animal urine.

British Rowing has warned of the risk of leptospirosis for those
taking part in water sports, as a consequence of this case in a rower
(<http://www.britishrowing.org/news/weils-disease-leptospirosis>).

The River Witham runs from the town of Lincoln to the town of Boston
in Lincolnshire, UK. Boston is a small port on the east coast of
England and Lincoln is located inland 19 miles (31 km) to the north
west. Both towns can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of the UK at
