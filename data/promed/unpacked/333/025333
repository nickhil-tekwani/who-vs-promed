3500 to get meningitis vaccinations
-----------------------------------
Since October 2002, 3 cases of meningococcal disease have occurred in
Cleveland, Texas, one fatal. This is why Texas health officials are
launching a meningococcal vaccination campaign targeting 3500 children
between 2 and 19 year of age. Texas Department of Health spokesperson Doug
McBride said the area has a history of the disease, noting that there was
an outbreak in Conroe, New Caney, and Humble 2 years ago. For the current
vaccination campaign, a $20 donation for each dose will be suggested;
however, the Department of Health said that no one will be refused the
shots because they cannot pay for them.

Northern Italy starts meningitis vaccine campaign
--------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in northern Italy announced on Wednesday, 8 Jan 2003,
the start of a mass vaccination program against meningitis, after an
upsurge of the disease in Lombardy.
The program, due to begin 20 Jan 2003, is the first mass vaccination
against meningitis ever carried out in Italy and will cost EUR 250 000 [USD
266 750]. The meningitis C vaccination is recommended for about 10 000
children and teenagers who live in the area around Magenta, a village 6
kilometers from Milan.
Despite the launch of a meningitis vaccination campaign in September 2002
in Lombardy, 6 cases of bacterial meningitis have been recorded in Magenta
and the surrounding area in 45 days. Local health authorities will monitor
the efficacy of the treatment by following the vaccinated individuals until
2007.
"This trial combines prevention with study, as it centres on an area where
more cases of meningitis are recorded compared to the national average,"
said Lombardy's regional health councillor, Carlo Borsani. According to
data from the National Health Institute, starting in 1994 most bacterial
meningitis cases in Italy were caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_. The
next most common pathogen was _Neisseria meningitidis_. Last year Lombardy
recorded 187 cases of meningitis.

Tassie's killer-bug toll falls
------------------------------
The death toll from meningococcal disease in Tasmania in 2002 declined to 2
out of 26 confirmed cases, from 5 deaths out of 24 cases in 2002. Dr Roscoe
Taylor, the state director of public health, noted that while "we are
seeing a newer type of C strain infection that the community hasn't been
exposed to ... there is increased vigilance in the community and health
care system, and earlier diagnosis means life-giving medicines can be given
earlier." The Tasmanian government's health care subsidy programs offer
free meningococcal vaccines for 13 to 18 year olds and discounted rates for
those aged 19 to 30.

Somalia: government to issue free vaccine for pilgrims
------------------------------------------------------
Somalia is offering free meningitis shots for all pilgrims to the haj in
Saudi Arabia this year. Individuals who do not get vaccinated against the

risk, the Ministry of Health of the Transitional National Government of
Somalia warned.

Health services on alert for meningitis in Accra
------------------------------------------------
Professor Agyeman Badu Akosa, director general of Ghana Health Service,
says the outbreak of meningitis serogroup W135 epidemic in neighboring
Burkina Faso, which claimed many lives recently, should be of serious
health concern to Ghanaian health authorities.
He said since Ghana and Burkina Faso share a border, and there is constant
movement of people to transact business, there is a probability of disease
entering the country. Professor Akosa said this when he opened the "Data
Management Workshop for Enhanced Meningitis Surveillance In The Meningitis
Belt Countries" on 15 Jan 2003 in Accra.
Epidemics in the meningitis belt are traditionally associated with
_Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to serogroup A, but _N. meningitidis_ of
serogroup W135 also causes epidemics. It was first found in Saudi Arabia,
and it spread to other countries and now Burkina Faso.
Prof Akosa said that, although meningitis serogroup W135 cases have not
been recorded in the country, it is still prudent for people moving from
Burkina Faso into Ghana to be effectively monitored and quarantined to
ensure that the epidemic does not enter the country. He said the meeting is
timely since it coincides with the meningitis season (dry season) and urged
participants to take the meeting seriously to enhance control of the
disease through proper data management.
Dr Melville George, World Health Organization representative for Ghana,
said the severity of the epidemic in Burkina Faso and the number of deaths
it caused called for great concern. He said that containing the epidemic
and managing the cases of meningitis depended on the timely and accurate
identification of cases and laboratory confirmation of the causal organism.
"Enhanced epidemiological and laboratory surveillance will contribute to an
adequate response and management of any epidemic so as to prevent further
spread of the population from further suffering and deaths."
Dr George said data management for enhanced meningitis surveillance was not
only crucial in the light of rising number of W135 cases, but it would also
assist countries to identify different causative organisms and plan
responses within scarce resources.
