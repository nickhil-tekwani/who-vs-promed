Climbing Lyme disease rates in our area are nearing the 20 percent benchmark set by the local board of health [Hastings and Prince Edward Counties, Ontario] officials, new numbers show. [The article is referring to the prevalence rate of infection with _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the bacterium that causes of Lyme disease, in ticks.] "It's a growing problem in this part of the province," Dr Richard Schabas told the Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Board of Health Wednesday [7 May 2014]. "Our numbers are increasing. That's been a pattern and we fully expect that pattern to continue. We didn't have this problem a few years ago."

The number of infected blacklegged ticks is climbing each year; Lyme disease infection rates hit 15 percent in 2013, just shy of the 20 percent threshold. "When the number gets above 20 percent doctors are advised to become a little more aggressive in treating people who had sustained tick bites with a dose of antibiotics," he said.

Schabas, the region's chief medical officer of health, said the bacterial infection brought on by a tick bite was first identified 25 years ago in Lyme, Connecticut [USA].

The hardest hit in the unit's coverage area is Prince Edward County, located along the northern shores of Lake Ontario, a key camping ground for the disease carrying tick. "We only see significant numbers in Prince Edward and Bay of Quinte area," he said. "It's a real issue. We see far fewer ticks when you get up into the northern parts of the region. Ticks have to be attached to the body for about 48 hours for infection to be transferred, providing a window to ward off health risk. Signs of illness become more evident anywhere after 10 days to 4 weeks after exposure. If you remove the tick within 48 hours, it's not going to give you Lyme disease," he said

Health risks include nerve damage and juvenile arthritis, which was among the cases found in Connecticut. "Not located early, it could go on to cause arthritis," he said. "If you do get an engorged tick bite, go see your doctor so it can be removed safely."

Health unit inspectors perform ongoing surveillance and postings will be distributed to conservation areas across the region, [to] bring attention to the threat. The public has to take a proactive approach to combating a tick attack. "You have to particularly careful when you and your children and pets are in wooded and grass areas," he said. While visiting wooded areas, the public is encouraged to wear long clothing covering exposed skin, use tick repellants and inspecting children and pets after leaving conservations areas.

[Prince Edward County, with a population 25 258 in 2011, is located in Southern Ontario on a large irregular headland at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario, just west of the head of the St Lawrence River (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_County,_Ontario). Because the Murray Canal transects the only land connection, the county is technically an island. The county's relatively mild climate due to the influence of Lake Ontario has led to the establishment of many vineyards and wineries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_County,_Ontario). For a map of prince Edward County, see https://www.google.com/maps/@44.0065784,-77.2052547,8z.

Chances of acquiring Lyme disease in Canada are quite low, except in areas where the eastern and western blacklegged tick populations are firmly established. The eastern blacklegged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_) are well established in Canada in some locations in Ontario along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, in southeastern Manitoba, and in Bedford and the Lunenburg area of Nova Scotia (http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/ID/LymeDisease.htm).

In the USA, the prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infection in _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 percent and 40 percent in New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, and Minnesota and Wisconsin, where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED, et al: The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. (2006) 43 (9): 1089-1134. doi: 10.1086/508667. Available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full).

In regions where the local rate of _B. burgdorferi_ infection of _Ixodes_ ticks is at least 20 percent, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite, if (a) the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached for 36 hours or longer on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick, (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the tick was removed, and (c) there is not contraindication for the antibiotic. A single dose of doxycycline is recommended for adults (200 mg dose) and children at least 8 years of age (4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg).

The time limit of 72 hours is suggested because of the absence of data on the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis for tick bites following tick removal after longer time intervals. Whether use of antibiotic prophylaxis after a tick bite will reduce the incidence of human granulocytic anaplasmosis or babesiosis, diseases also transmitted by _Ixodes_, is unknown. Doxycycline is relatively contraindicated in pregnant women and children under 8 years of age, but the IDSA panel did not believe that amoxicillin should be substituted for doxycycline in these people because of "the absence of data on an effective short-course regimen for prophylaxis, the likely need for a multiday regimen (and its associated adverse effects), the excellent efficacy of antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease if infection were to develop, and the extremely low risk that a person with a recognized bite will develop a serious complication of Lyme disease" (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full). - Mod.ML
