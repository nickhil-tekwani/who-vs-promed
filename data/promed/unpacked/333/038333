Greece said it found bird flu in a wild duck shot by a hunter, adding that
more tests were underway to establish whether the virus was the strain that
can kill humans.
The H5 virus, most of whose sub-types are only lethal to birds, was
confirmed in the migratory duck killed in a coastal area of the central
prefecture of Fthiotida [Map at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fthiotida>],
the agriculture ministry said in a statement.
Samples from the bird will be sent to the EU Reference Laboratory for avian
influenza in England to determine whether the virus is in fact H5N1, the
highly pathogenic strain that has killed 152 people in the Far East, the
Middle East and China since 2003.
The relevant European Union authorities have also been informed, the
ministry said.
This is the first H5 case reported in Greece since the summer. Earlier in
2006, the Greek authorities confirmed 33 cases of H5N1 between February and
March, all in wild birds.
Yet even though no domestic poultry cases turned up, demand for chicken in
the country took a serious blow for weeks.
Local authorities in Fthiotida have been advised to ban the transport of
live poultry near the area where the duck was hunted.
Poultry owners have been warned to keep their flocks indoors, and the
public advised to alert the authorities to all bird carcass finds, the
ministry said.

[The most recent detection of H5N1 in Greece took place in January-February
2006; the affected birds were wild swans in the Thessaloniki area. A recent
H5 isolate from semi-wild ducks in Italy was found to be of low
pathogenicity. It remains to be seen if the Greek isolate is H5N1 and to
note its pathogenicity.
The HPAI H5N1 epizootic began in southeast Asia in mid-2003 and has since
spread within 3 continents, the largest and most severe on record. Though
its spread seems to have taken place by more than one route, including
trade (legal and illegal) in animals and their products, the spread of the
virus along the pathways of migratory wild waterfowl is thought to have
played a significant role. Bird migration is a recurring event. Countries
that lie along the routes of birds migrating from central Asia may face a
persistent risk of introduction or re-introduction of the virus to domestic
poultry flocks. A seasonal upsurge might be expected during the coming
month or two.
In late July 2005, the virus, which seems to have become endemic in central
and southeast Asia, spread geographically beyond its original focus to
affect poultry and wild birds in the Russian Federation and adjacent parts
of Kazakhstan; this was followed by its spread into Balkan countries, the
Middle East, central Europe and African countries. In 10 of those countries
(8 in Asia, 2 in Africa) human infections have been recorded as well:
according to current WHO figures, so far a total of 258 humans have been
clinically affected, of whom 153 died.
Since 2003, the HPAI H5N1 virus has been identified in avians (domestic
and/or wild) and reported to the OIE from 56 countries in Asia, Europe and
Africa (in 2 of the countries, the virus was, reportedly, identified as
H5). They are:
Asia (25): Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China (PRC), Georgia, Hong
Kong (SARPRC), India, Indonesia, Iraq (H5), Iran, Israel, Japan, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Korea (Rep of), Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Palestinian
autonomy territories, Pakistan, Philippines (H5), Thailand, Turkey, and
Vietnam.
Europe (23): Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland,
Romania, Russia, Serbia & Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Ukraine, UK.
Africa (8): Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Niger,
Nigeria, Sudan.
