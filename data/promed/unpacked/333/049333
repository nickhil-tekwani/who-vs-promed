The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced 2 new confirmed cases of

Riau Province developed symptoms on 7 Nov 2008 and was hospitalized on 12
Nov 2008. She recovered and was discharged from hospital on 27 Nov 2008.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
Investigations into the source of her infection indicate poultry deaths at
her home on 2 Nov 2008.

The 2nd case, a 2 year old girl from East Jakarta, developed symptoms on 18
Nov 2008, was hospitalized on 26 Nov 2008, and died on 29 Nov 2008.
Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
