A quarantine notice on horses has been issued by the Northern Cape Department of Agriculture after a suspected case of African Horse Sickness [AHS] was reported at Kuruman [Kalahary region].

The quarantine restricts movement of horses and donkeys within a 30 kilometer radius around the town.

Department spokesperson Thebe says unvaccinated animals could cause an outbreak of the disease. Thebe says: "We need to advise them that they need to keep their horses indoors until the sun comes out clearly. During the springtime the sunlight is very intense, and that's when the horses and the donkeys are affected."

[AHS, a severe arbovirus infection of horses and other equids, causing up to 95 percent case fatality rates in susceptible horses, is endemic in South Africa. The disease is caused by one or more of the 9 known serotypes; it has a strong seasonality with most occurring from late spring (October) through to autumn (April), associated with the period of greatest vector activity and abundance. Cases are also distributed geographically and temporally such that outbreaks start 1st in the north-east of the country each year and progress to the south and west as the Culicoides vector season progresses. The area around Cape Town and the Cape of Good Hope has historically had few outbreaks, usually in late summer or autumn and mostly thought to be associated with introduction of infected horses into the area at a time of high vector activity.

Confirmation of the above suspected case and information about the serotype involved are anticipated.

AHS is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with all 9 serotypes occurring in many countries. Periodic outbreaks have occurred elsewhere, including northern Africa, the Middle East, the Asian sub-continent, Spain and Portugal. It is an OIE-listed disease. The OIE maintains a list of countries officially known as AHS-free, available at
http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/african-horse-sickness/list-ahs-free-members/; a corresponding map is available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/african-horse-sickness/en-ahs-carte/.

For export purposes, South Africa has established a self-declared AHS-control areas and a free zone, applicable with importing countries on the basis of bilateral agreements. See maps at
