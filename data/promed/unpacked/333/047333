[1] Evolution of influenza A viruses in wild birds
----------------------------------------------
Influenza virus surveillance studies in wild bird populations in the
Americas, Europe, and Asia confirmed that wild aquatic birds are the
reservoir for all known influenza A viruses. Phylogenetic analysis
groups the influenza viruses in wild aquatic birds into 2 distinct
superfamilies -- one in the Americas and one in Eurasia. The
separation of viruses into American and Eurasian clades implies that
transmission of HP [highly pathogenic] H5 into the Americas by wild
birds is likely to be a rare event. The rapid evolution of the
Eurasian H5N1 viruses makes them a continued threat to poultry and
humans worldwide.

[2] Virology of avian influenza in relation to wild birds
--------------------------------------------------
The ecology, epidemiology, genetics, and evolution of influenza
viruses cannot be fully understood without taking into account the
ecology of their hosts. Here, we review current knowledge on global
patterns of low pathogenic influenza virus infections in wild birds,
discuss these patterns in the context of host ecology and behavior,
and identify gaps in the current knowledge. Potentially important
differences between low pathogenic influenza viruses and highly
pathogenic H5N1 viruses in wild birds are discussed, in particular
with respect to pathogenesis, virus secretion, and host range.

[3] Wild birds and the epidemiology of avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Although wild birds are the recognized source and reservoir for all
subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIV), the complex interaction
among these diverse host and virus populations has not received
adequate attention. A general concept of AIV epidemiology in wild
birds exists; however, the presence of highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in wild birds has reinforced the need
for a much more detailed understanding of AIV natural history.
Worldwide, the wild avian reservoirs for AIV are incompletely
defined, even within well-studied groups such as the Anseriformes and
Charadriiformes. This lack of clarity applies not only to avian host
species, but also to the various subtypes of AIV present within these
populations. Even with the extensive number of AIV isolations
previously reported from wild birds, the reservoir species and global
distribution for many of these AIV subtypes are not completely
understood. To date, studies related to AIV epidemiology in wild
birds primarily focused on the agent. To move forward, we need to
apply this same level of scrutiny and detailed understanding to the
natural host populations and the environments they utilize. Research
to date clearly demonstrates that species and population structure
are important in AIV maintenance, transmission, and possibly
long-distance movement. Species-related differences related to
general behavior, spatial and temporal distribution, habitat
utilization, migration behavior, population age structure, and
individual species susceptibility, all potentially influence a
species' role in AIV epidemiology. The unprecedented mortality
associated with HPAI H5N1 infection in wild birds provides a new
window from which to view the potential for exchange of AIV between
wild and domestic birds, and further demonstrates and expands the
varied roles that wild birds may play in AIV epidemiology. These
roles must be clearly defined if we are going understand the full
implications of current HPAI H5N1 virus introduction into the wild
bird populations and most importantly prevent the next one.

[4] H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in wild birds in western China
------------------------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses (HPAI H5N1) are widely
distributed among poultry in Asia, but until recently only a limited
number of wild birds were affected. During late April-June 2005, an
outbreak of HPAI H5N1 infection occurred among wild birds at Qinghai
Lake in China. 1st identified in bar-headed geese (_Anser indicus_),
the disease soon spread to other avian species populating the lake.
Sequence analysis of 15 viruses from 6 avian species and collected at
different times during the outbreak revealed 4 different H5N1
genotypes. Most of the isolates possessed lysine at position 627 in
the PB2 protein, a residue known to be associated with virulence in
mice and adaptation to humans. However, neither of the 2 index
viruses possessed this residue. Importantly, H5N1 viruses isolated in
Mongolia, Russia, and Inner Mongolia were genetically closely related
to one of the genotypes isolated during the Qinghai outbreak. This
genotype virus also spread to some countries in Europe and Africa,
suggesting its dominant nature and underscoring the need for
worldwide intensive surveillance to minimize its devastating consequences.

[5] Influenza surveillance in wild birds in Eastern Europe, the
Middle East, and Africa: preliminary results from an ongoing FAO-led survey
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From mid-January to mid-May 2006, field campaigns were conducted in
14 countries, including recently infected countries. In total, 5256
samples were collected in large wetland areas where Eurasian and
Afro-tropical waterbirds congregate. The overall prevalence of avian
influenza viruses detected by RT-PCR was 3.3 percent, with no
positivity for HPAI H5N1 virus. From the RT-PCR-positive samples, 5
distinct virus isolates were obtained. Low pathogenic avian influenza
(LPAI) viruses were detected and isolated in both Eurasian and
Afro-tropical bird species, indicating that low pathogenic viruses
were circulating in Africa during the northern winter. These findings
reveal that LPAI virus persists in wild birds in subtropical
environments and support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses
could be perpetuated in wild birds throughout the year, including in
Palearctic waterbirds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa before their
northward spring migration.

[11] Implications of wildlife trade on the movement of avian
influenza and other infectious diseases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The global trade in wildlife provides disease transmission mechanisms
that not only result in human disease outbreaks, but also threaten
livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife
populations, and the health of ecosystems. Global movement of animals
for the pet trade is estimated at some 350 million live animals,
worth approximately USD 20 billion per year. Approximately
one-quarter of this trade is thought to be illegal, hence not
inspected or tested. Disease outbreaks resulting from trade in
wildlife have caused hundreds of billions of dollars of economic
damage globally. Rather than attempting to eradicate pathogens or the
wild species that may harbor them, a practical approach would include
decreasing the contact rate among species, including humans, at the
interface created by wildlife trade. Wild animals are captured,
transported, and sold either live or dead and commingled throughout
the process in a system of scale-free networks with major hubs rather
than random or evenly distributed supply systems. As focal points for
distribution and sales, the hubs provide control opportunities to
maximize the effects of regulatory efforts as demonstrated with
domestic animal trading systems (processing plants and wholesale and
retail markets, for example). Focusing efforts at markets to
regulate, reduce, or in some cases, eliminate the commercial trade in
wildlife could provide a cost-effective approach to decrease the
risks for disease in humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and ecosystems.
