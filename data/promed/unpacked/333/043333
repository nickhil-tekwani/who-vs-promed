Today [19 Feb 2008], a technician with Epidemiological Surveillance,
Aparecido Alberto, will be in the Municipality of Campos de Julio,
where 3 suspected cases of hantavirus infection were reported in
2008. One of those cases was fatal, and the other 2 patients are in
hospital in Cuiaba. The technician will carry out investigations of
the cases in the city and deliver information to health professionals
and rural farmers about hantaviral diseases.

In the beginning of 2008 in Marcelandia 3 asymptomatic hantavirus
infections were reported, with no development of disease, and are
being monitored. A serological survey of people in the municipality
is being carried out.

Mato Grosso ended 2007 with 25 confirmed cases of hantavirus
[infection]. Of this number, 16 cases recovered, bringing the
percentage of recuperation to 64 percent, and 9 were fatal, with a
fatality rate of 36 percent, which is below the national average of 38 percent.

In 2006 there were 49 confirmed cases, of which 29 cases recovered,
with a percentage of 59 percent, and 20 cases led to death,with a
fatality rate of 41 percent.

The Epidemiological Surveillance technician in the area of
hantaviruses, Aparecido Rodrigues Alberto Marques, reported
preliminary results of research. He cited the discovery of 2
[hanta]viruses circulating in Mato Grosso: Laguna Negra, which has
the _Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castlio dos Sonhos which had
previously been found in Para, but without a known host. The research
found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_ was the
host of the Castlio dos Sonhos virus.

The state of Mato Grosso ccupies a place of prominence on the
national scene, as it is in 4th place in the ranking of states with
highest occurrence of hantavirus [infecions]. Among the [highest] are
Parana, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.
