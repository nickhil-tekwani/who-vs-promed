While Nigeria is upbeat about the sharp decline in the cases of coronavirus infection, the country's center for disease control (NCDC) has said a total of 289 Nigerians have died from cholera disease between January and June 2021. NCDC, which disclosed this in a statement on Monday [21 Jun 2021], a copy of which PREMIUM TIMES obtained, noted that the disease is currently ravaging [7] states of the federation. The disease center listed the affected states as Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Zamfara, Bayelsa, and Kaduna.

Cholera -- a diarrheal disease that can kill within hours if not promptly treated, is endemic in Nigeria, with outbreaks reported as far back as the 1970s.

According to NCDC, in the last one month, an increasing number of cholera cases has been reported in most of the aforementioned states, with 441 suspected cases and 6 deaths recorded in Plateau alone, last week [week of 14 Jun 2021].

The cholera outbreak in Bauchi last month [May 2021] has spread across 9 districts in the state with the state capital, Bauchi, being the worst hit, Mohammed Maigoro, the state health commissioner said, in a report by African News in late May [2021]. "So far, we have recorded 20 deaths and 322 cases from the cholera outbreak in 9 local government areas of Bauchi in the past 2 weeks," Mr Maigoro was quoted as saying, in the publication. "The Bauchi metropolis has been worst affected, accounting for half of the fatalities and 147 out of the 322 reported cases," he added.

The NCDC said between January and [22 Jun 2021], a total of 10 833 suspected cholera cases have been reported including 112 laboratory-confirmed cases.

[As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes -- Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima -- each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba contains antigens A and C; and Hikojima contains antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare. - Mod.LL
