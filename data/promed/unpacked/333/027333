----------------------------------------------------------------------
Your update on the Ebola crisis this morning leads with an article entitled 'Liberia: Ebola crisis - Confusion as patients vanish'

This article is from 17 Aug *2014* when the government operated holding centre in the West Point slum area of Monrovia was stormed by angry community members who were in denial about Ebola. This was a year ago at the height of the epidemic, when there was widespread fear and misunderstanding about the disease. While there is still some community denial regarding the nature of Ebola, the situation is under control and there have not been any attacks on treatment facilities in this current year [2015]. There are also no suspect Ebola cases that have 'vanished' or absconded from treatment facilities in Liberia recently. The last known Ebola cases in Liberia tested negative and were discharged from treatment facilities on 23 Jul 2015. If there are no further cases in Liberia it should be declared Ebola free by the WHO for the 2nd time on [2 Sep 2015], after clearing 42 days since the last known case tested negative.

[ProMED-mail thanks all the alert readers who picked up this error. ProMED regrets the error, due to a coincidence in the month and day. It is good to hear that attacks on quarantine stations are now a thing of the past in Liberia.
