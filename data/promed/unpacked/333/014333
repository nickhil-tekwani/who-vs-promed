Manitoba horses may have been exposed to a potentially lethal equine
virus during a horse show held at Brandon's Keystone Centre earlier
this month [October 2011], warn provincial animal health officials.

Two animals have recently died from an outbreak of herpesvirus
myeloencephalopathy (ETM) -- otherwise known as "horse herpes" -- in
an out-of-province facility.

[Usually the disease is abbreviated as EHV for equine herpes virus or
EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory
and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death.
The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes
myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high
morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between
2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10
days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the
isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21
days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge,
incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine
dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive
horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency.
Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids,
anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-viral drugs, and other supportive
measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for
EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection
against the neurological strain of the virus.
