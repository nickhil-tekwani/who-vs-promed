An outbreak of viral haemorrhagic fever has been reported in Sudan's Sennar state, according to an anonymous medical source speaking to Radio Tamazuj from the area.

Two cases of the disease have been reported so far in the state although conditions and facilities in the hospital are said to provide an inadequate response to the outbreak.

"There are a lot of cases, for instance if the patient is admitted and got discharged or died then somebody is immediately replaced in that place in which that bed is supposed to be disinfected or exposed to sunlight, but these things we don't have here," the source claimed.

The same source also reported an outbreak of tuberculosis, stressing that the hospital compound is one source of disease transmission. They called upon competent authorities to rehabilitate the hospital and improve its sanitation with infrastructural development including toilets.

"The throat tuberculosis is rampant and it's transmitted from the hospital it is not coming from outside. I saw two cases of hemorrhagic fever. I am recommending to Sennar hospital that at least the authorities should provide good toilets. You always find toilets closed for 24 hours," the source added.
