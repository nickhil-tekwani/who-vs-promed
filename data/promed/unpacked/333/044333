A warning has been issued for people who have recently returned from
holidays in Bali after a 2nd person was diagnosed with Legionnaires'
disease within a week.

The Department of Health issued the warning this afternoon [10 Jun
2011] after a WA [Australian state of Western Australia] woman was
found to have developed the disease. The department's communicable
disease control director, Paul Armstrong, says the latest diagnosis
brings the state's total to 10 since August last year [2010]. 5 other
people from around the nation are also found to have contracted
Legionnaires' disease after travel in Bali.

Dr Armstrong said the source of the disease remained unknown, but all
infected Western Australians had stayed in the central Kuta area. "The
early symptoms of Legionnaires' disease are similar to a severe
flu-like illness," he said. People most susceptible to Legionnaires'
disease include middle-aged and elderly people, particularly those who
smoke or have a lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or a weakened
immune system. "People with these risk factors who visit Bali should
avoid the central area of Kuta in the vicinity of the intersection of
Jalan Signosari and Jalan Kartika Plasa," he said.

In February [2011], the health department narrowed down the cause of
a Legionnaires' outbreak to a Kuta hotel, linked to the infection of
at least 2 Western Australians.

The disease is [caused by] a type of bacteria commonly transmitted by
the inhalation of water droplets from contaminated warm water
environments such as air conditioning cooling towers, evaporative air
conditioners, showers and warm water systems, fountains, spa pools,
and misting or droplet sprays. It cannot be caught from other people
or animal contact. Anyone who develops flu-like symptoms within 10
days of their return from Bali should seek medical advice.

[From prior ProMED-mail posts on this outbreak (Australia (02): ex
Indonesia (Bali) alert 20110119.0226 and Legionellosis - Australia:
(WA, VI) ex Indonesia (Bali) 20110115.0173), there had been a total of
10 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease due to _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 among Australians who had vacationed in Kuta,
Bali. 9 of the 10 confirmed cases linked to the same hotel while
vacationing in Bali stayed apparently at the Ramayana Resort and Spa
and most also had visited the same local shopping center. Both sites
are located in the central area of Kuta, Bali. In fact the Ramayana
Resort and Spa is located near the intersection of Jalan Singosari and
Jalan Kartika Plasa
(http://www.hotels.com/ho215912/ramayana-resort-and-spa-kuta-indonesia/#maps),
which the news release above says people at risk of Legionnaires'
disease should avoid.

According to the news release above, there are now a total of 15
cases of Legionnaires' disease after travel in Bali, but it is not
stated if the additional cases stayed at this hotel or visited the
same shopping center as the others.

For a discussion of legionellosis see the prior ProMED-mail post

Kuta is a coastal town in southern Bali, Indonesia, with a long broad
Indian Ocean beachfront and is one of Indonesia's major tourist
destinations (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuta). Kuta was the site
of 2 bombings, one in 2002 and another in 2005. A map of the island of
Bali can be accessed at http://www.baliguide.com/bali_map.html.
Kuta on the island of Bali and the Australian state of Western
Australia can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive maps at
