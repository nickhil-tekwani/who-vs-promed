A man in east China's Jiangsu province died of bird flu on Sunday [2
Dec 2007], the provincial health department reported. The 24-year-old
man developed fever, chills and other symptoms on 24 Nov 2007 and was
hospitalized on 27 Nov 2007 after being diagnosed with "lower left
pneumonia." His illness worsened in the hospital, and he died on
Sunday [2 Dec 2007].

A respiratory tract sample examination by Jiangsu Provincial Disease
Control and Prevention Center on Saturday [1 Dec 2007] showed the
man's avian flu virus nucleic acid was H5 positive and N1 positive.
However, the man had no contact with dead poultry, the health
department said. A test done by the China Disease Control and
Prevention Center on Sunday [2 Dec 2007] also indicated that the man
was H5N1 positive, and the Chinese Ministry of Health has confirmed
he was infected with bird flu. The local government has adopted
relative prevention and control measures. All of the 69 people who
had close contact with the patient have been put under strict medical
observation. So far, they have shown no signs of symptoms.

The Ministry of Health has reported the case to the World Health
Organization and some countries and regions. The Jiangsu Animal
Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau said no bird flu epidemic has been
found in the province so far.
