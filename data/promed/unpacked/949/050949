The World Health Organisation declared Nepal a leprosy-free country about 5 years ago, but according to statistics provided by the Leprosy Division under the Department of Health Services, around 3223 leprosy patients were found in the country in the last fiscal year. In the previous fiscal year, around 3253 new patients were found. Leprosy is a chronic infection caused by the bacteria _Mycobacterium leprae_ and _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_.

Dr Chudamani Bhandari, Director of the Leprosy Division, said that every year new leprosy cases are surfacing.

The government has been providing free medicine to people suffering from leprosy. Dr Bhandari informed that the government has been providing financial aid and other facilities as well to the people who are quite often also ostracized when they suffer from leprosy. Study shows that districts like Sarlahi, Jhapa, Dhanusha, Rautahat, Mahottari, Bardiya, Parsa, Kailali, Bara, and Rupandehi see the highest number of leprosy patients.

[Although Nepal achieved what WHO refers to as "the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem" (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in 2010, after achieving a prevalence rate of 0.89 per 10,000 people nationally, leprosy has obviously not been completely eradicated in Nepal (http://www.irinnews.org/report/88165/nepal-leprosy-eradication-could-be-years-away-aid-workers).

Nepal was among 16 countries reporting at least 1000 new cases during 2012, and Nepal was among 8 of these 16 countries that reported more new cases (3492 new cases) in 2012 than in the previous year (3184 cases) (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). However, the number had fallen from the 6150 cases reported in 2005 (1). In 2012, 1806 new cases 50 percent of new cases in Nepal had multibacillary leprosy, which is an indication of the proportion of new cases with contagious disease in the community; 231 new cases 10 percent of new cases occurred in children, which is an indication of ongoing disease transmission; and 111 new cases 0.5 percent of new cases of leprosy had chronic deformities and disability, which reflects problems in case finding (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf).

The districts of Nepal mentioned in the news report above as having the highest number of leprosy patients are located along Nepal's southern border with India. For a map showing the location of Nepal's districts, see http://www.nepalvista.com/travel/map-districts.php.

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_. This disease is still a major health problem in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Western Pacific region. Transmission is thought to occur following close, prolonged contact with a case of lepromatous leprosy, usually within a household setting. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease.

A newly described leprosy agent, named _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, was discovered in 2008 in patients who died of diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL) (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19019760 and ProMED-mail post Leprosy, new species - USA, Mexico, Singapore 20081126.3723). DLL is a unique severe form of leprosy that has been endemic in Mexico and Costa Rica for more than a century.

Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, the mode of spread is likely respiratory or nasal discharge. As the organism is also present in skin lesions of patients with lepromatous leprosy, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Fomites are an additional potential source of infection. _M. leprae_ can persist on surfaces in the environment (2), and _M. leprae_ from the environment and the patients have been found to exhibit the same genotype (3).

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months, and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months. Once on therapy, patients are no longer infectious. - Mod.ML
