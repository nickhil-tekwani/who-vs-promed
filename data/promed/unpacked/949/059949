A 2nd horse near Ocala has tested positive for the mosquitoborne virus eastern equine encephalitis, according to the Florida Department of Health in Marion County. "This is the time of year when mosquito borne diseases are on the rise," environmental administrator of the Florida Department of Health in Marion County Dan Dooley said in a news release. "Residents and visitors should take precautions to protect themselves from being bitten by mosquitoes."

Health officials want to remind people to "drain and cover". Drain standing water, like house gutters, pool covers, and buckets, to prevent mosquitoes from multiplying. Empty and clean birdbaths and pets' water bowls twice a week, too. Cover yourself with clothes and repellent to avoid getting bit.

The department continues to conduct state-wide searches for all mosquito borne viruses and diseases, including West Nile virus, St Louis encephalitis, malaria, and dengue.

Marion County health officials are warning horse owners to vaccinate their horses. The 2nd case of eastern equine encephalitis this year [2014] in Marion County was found in a horse about 4 mi [6.4 km] east of Citra. It's a deadly mosquitoborne virus that attacks the nervous system in horses. Officials say the virus, and other mosquitoborne illnesses, can be prevented by vaccinating the horses. The 2 horses that were infected did die and were not vaccinated.

The [virus] is known to infect humans as well but it's not known to be deadly. Only 2 cases were reported in humans in Florida last year [2013]. Officials from the Marion County Health Department urge residents to use repellent with DEET, picaridin, or lemon eucalyptus oil -- these can be bought at any drug store or outdoor store. Also, officials urge residents to "drain and cover".

"Drain all sources of standing water, whether it's a bird bath, or a dog dish, or a boat, or a tarp, just keep the area clean," said Craig Ackerman, spokesperson with the Marion County Health Department. Ackerman also says this is the time of year mosquitoborne illnesses increase.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquitoborne viral disease of all equine species such as horses, asses, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders.

Clinical signs in EEE-infected equines may include one or more of the following signs: fever; depression; anorexia (loss of appetite, not eating); weakness; central nervous system disorders (lack of coordination, chewing movements, head pressing, "sawhorse" stance, circling, paddling motion of the limbs, and convulsions); irritability and aggressiveness towards handlers; blindness; excitability; abnormal sensitivity to light and sound; in some cases, horses infected with EEE may show no clinical signs before dying.

The virus that causes EEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal [or bird] and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the density of mosquito populations.

There are fly and mosquito sprays for horses that are helpful in repelling the mosquitoes. However, the most effective prevention is vaccination. Vaccination usually comes in a combination vaccine for other viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Vaccination is usually required to be repeated in 2-4 weeks for effective immunity. EEE immunity wanes rapidly, and animals should be revaccinated approximately every 4-6 months depending upon location.

It should be emphasized that humans may contract this disease but only from mosquitoes. Equine owners cannot get the disease from their equine companions.
