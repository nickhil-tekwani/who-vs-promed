A Comment on "Undiagnosed Illness - Saudi Arabia"
------------------------------------------------
The preceding post from Dr. P. Badrinath MD stated that: "A strange disease
outbreak among students of a school in the Asyer area has alarmed the
citizens of Surat Obeid, as the cases have risen to 55 since last Thursday
[3 May 2001. Cough and tonsil inflammation are the main symptoms, but
there was no alarming situation, as students were responding to medical
treatment within 2 days."
This type of outbreak of illness is very common in this part of the world
whenever there is a change in weather conditions. Now it is turning more
hot and humid and disease, mainly upper respiratory infection, spreads very
rapidly among any group of individuals who gather in a congregation. We
call this "Hajj Flu" as it is common among people returning from Hajj
pilgrimage and among the medical team that goes to Makkah from our hospital
to give medical care during the Hajj season.
Bacteriological examination invariably reveals: "Normal respiratory flora."
The upper respiratory infection starts probably due to a virus and soon the
respiratory bacteria flare up as a secondary infection. This responds very
well to common antibiotics like Augmentin and Azithromycin.
Routine throat swabs have sometimes (under 2%) shown during the Hajj season
the presence of meningococci in individuals who are asymptomatic and who
have received vaccination against meningitis. They are considered healthy
carriers of meningococci. They and their immediate contacts are treated
with a stat dose of Ciprofloxacine 500 mg. The rest of the people who have
this upper respiratory infection are treated with common antibiotics.
