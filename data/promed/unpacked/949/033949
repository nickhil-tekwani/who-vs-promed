Two Cases of West Nile Fever in Massachusetts, One Fatal
--------------------------------------------------------
One man died and another became seriously ill after contracting West Nile
virus, the Massachusetts Department of Health confirmed on Wed 14 Nov 2001.
A 70-year-old man from the northeastern Boston suburb of Woburn died in
mid-October from the virus and became the disease's first fatality in the
state, health officials said.
A second man from Acushnet, Massachusetts, who is 89, remains hospitalized
in stable condition, officials said.
Since it first appeared in the Western Hemisphere in New York City in the
summer of 1999, West Nile virus has been found in about 25 U.S. states and
the Canadian province of Ontario [and the Cayman Islands. - Mod.CP.
West Nile virus, first identified in Uganda in 1937, causes no symptoms in
most people, but can cause a flu-like infection in the elderly or those
with weakened immune systems. It can develop into a crippling or deadly
brain inflammation [in a minority of cases.
Frost killed off mosquitoes in Massachusetts earlier this year, but state
health commissioner Paul Jacobsen said: "What appears to have happened is
that they became infected at the end of the season, probably
mid-September." Many Massachusetts communities sprayed insecticide through
the summer to kill mosquitoes. "This gives us plenty of warning for next
summer," Jacobsen said. "The best thing people can do is prevent mosquito
bites. According to the CDC, people can reduce their risk of becoming
infected with the virus by wearing insect repellent and covering up when
going outdoors, and by staying indoors around dusk and dawn."
