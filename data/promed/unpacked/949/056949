On [22 Aug 2018], the State Direction of Epidemiology received a notification of suspicious cases of human trichinellosis. An investigation was instituted for a possible outbreak of the disease in the small town of Cuchillo, located in the south of La Pampa province, Argentina.

The obtained information indicates that the night of [19 Jul 2018] several people were having lunch where they ate homemade cold meat. The 1st symptoms emerged on [2 Aug 2018] with fever, conjunctivitis, eyelid oedema, myalgia. So far, 12 individual cases have been identified in a total of 50 dinner guests.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Guillermo Meglia for the report. Trichinellosis has been reported repeatedly from Argentina and the key problem is that home slaughtered pigs are not subjected to veterinary control. The fact that the so called "back yard" pigs are fed kitchen waste and offal, is also a problem. - Mod.EP
