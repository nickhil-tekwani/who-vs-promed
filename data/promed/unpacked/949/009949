Influenza update - 319 (based on data up to 24 Jun 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
Influenza detections continued to increase in southern Africa and in recent weeks started to increase in South America. However, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in Australia and New Zealand. In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal levels. Increased influenza activity was reported in some countries of tropical America. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtype A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 82 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 11 to 24 Jun 2018 (data as of 6 Jul 2018 04:10:13 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 52621 specimens during that time period. 1376 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1047 (76.1 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 329 (23.9 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 760 (84.9 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 135 (15.1 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 116 (77.3 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 34 (22.7 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The Ministry of Health and Social Services has urged Namibians to take the necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with swine flu [influenza A(H1N1) virus] as cases of the virus continue to rise.

A statement issued here [Windhoek] on [Tue 17 Jul 2018] by the Ministry's acting permanent secretary, Petronella Masabane, said since the 1st cases of the H1N1 virus were reported by private health facilities in Windhoek in June [2018], there has been an increase in cases reported countrywide.

The statement said so far, 70 cases have been laboratory-confirmed, 35 of which are from Windhoek; 24 from Okahandja; 6 from Rehoboth; 2 from Gobabis, and one each from Aranos, Ondangwa, and Katima Mulilo.

Of the 70 cases, 28 are children aged 5 years and younger; 10 are children aged between 5 and 9 years, and 32 cases range between the ages of 10 and 80.

"The virus has been circulating in the last decade, all year round. However, cases peak during (the southern hemisphere) winter, meaning people will get ill from this particular strain," the statement said.

The virus is primarily transmitted through coughing and sneezing or direct contact with surfaces contaminated with infected droplets. People most at risk are children under the age of 5 years, elderly people aged above 65 years, pregnant women, and people with weak immune systems.

The ministry said the best protection against H1N1 is the seasonal flu vaccination. The influenza H1N1 strain is included in the seasonal flu vaccine, which is available in Namibia.
