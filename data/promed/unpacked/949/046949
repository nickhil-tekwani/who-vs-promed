27 hippos die of suspected anthrax
----------------------------------
At least 27 hippos have died of suspected anthrax in Queen Elizabeth
National Park, the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) boss revealed yesterday.
"They died on Friday [11 Jun 2010] and we buried 27 carcasses on Saturday
and Sunday. But we are still waiting for experts to confirm whether the
animals died of anthrax," Moses Mapesa said.

He clarified that the deaths were not a threat to tourism, however, because
they occurred 5 kilometres [3.1 miles] east of the Katunguru bridge toward
Lake George, which is far away from the Kazinga Channel, a tourist attraction.

Tom Okello, the Queen Elizabeth Conservation Area manager, said UWA had set
up a surveillance team to monitor the waters. This comes 6 years after the
park lost about 300 hippos, several vultures, hyenas, and other
grass-eating animals in the park to anthrax. Several people died then in
Bushenyi district and one in Kinyamaseke, Kasese district after eating meat
of the infected hippos.

"But the situation is under control. After the 2004 anthrax attack, we are
now more prepared to handle it," [Okello] said. He described to the
incident as "part and parcel of nature, a normal phenomenon."

Mapesa warned the public against eating wildlife meat and livestock keepers
to avoid grazing in the park. Mapesa also urged poachers to avoid the park.
"Anyone who sees a carcass should immediately report to UWA authorities or
other nearest authorities," he said.

Prevention
----------
Livestock, particularly cattle, goats, and sheep around the outbreak areas
should be vaccinated. Animals that die in water bodies should be removed
immediately to avoid further contamination of the water. The carcasses
should be buried immediately and should not be opened as this encourages
the spread of bacteria. Preferably, animals that die of the disease should
be burned to ashes with firewood and paraffin. Quarantines should be set up
in the affected areas to stop the movement of livestock and livestock
products like meat, milk, hides, and skins. Slaughter of animals for public
sale should be temporarily halted in the affected areas. Communities in the
affected areas should be sensitised about anthrax.
The people handling the cases should wear protective gear such as nose
masks, hand gloves, gumboots, and overalls.

[In the original report there is a striking picture of some 12 dead hippo,
adults and calves, piled up blocking a water way on Lake George. While 2008
and 2009 were drought years, the present rainfall is good.

"Latest satellite-derived rainfall estimates indicate above-normal
performance in main cropping and pastoral areas in eastern equatorial
sector of region, where March-May season contributes more than 50 per cent
of the annual rainfall. These rains continue to support crop performance as
well as increase water recharge and pasture regeneration for pastoral
areas. However, the rains also increase the occurrence of localized
flooding and the risk of mudslides as the soils are saturated with
moisture." See "East Africa Regional Food Security Outlook", April to
September 2010
<http://www.fews.net/docs/Publications/EAST_Outlook_May_2010_final.pdf>.

So it would appear that they had enough grazing and were not starving as
they were in 2004-2005. On the other hand this same publication shows
nearby areas with severe food insecurities and thus the potential for
illegal harvesting of these and other dead animals to meet that demand.

During the 2004 hippo epizootic Entebbe had problems diagnosing the
condition and there were therefore delays in taking action. Let us hope
that the claims of better preparation now cover diagnosis.

Culturing field samples for _Bacillus anthracis_ can be more difficult than
many realize as the vegetative cell is fragile and on the plate
contaminants can hide the spores that germinate. With long dead carcasses
we have found that it is well worthwhile snipping out parts of the nasal
turbinates and transporting these pieces back to the laboratory in a small
plastic bag. These are much better and more reliable than the traditional ear.

In 2004 much of the spread was eventually put down to cannibalism and water
contamination; see ProMED-mail 20091021.3624. This posting is being copied
to colleagues in Uganda in the hope that they can shed light on what
initiated this new epizootic. - Mod.MHJ
