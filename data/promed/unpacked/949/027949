Mexico has announced that onchocerciasis (river blindness) has been eliminated within its borders. The claim has been verified by the WHO.

In eliminating river blindness, Mexico becomes the 3rd country in the world (that had the disease) to have officially eliminated it. Mexico's Secretary of Health, Dr Mercedes Juan Lopez, made the official announcement on [Tue 29 Sep 2015], during a press conference held in Washington, DC [USA]. Other countries that have eliminated the disease include Colombia (which was the first to do so in 2013) and Ecuador (2014).

River blindness or Robles disease (onchocerciasis) is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial worm _Onchocerca volvulus_. Symptoms include severe itching, bumps under the skin, and blindness. The parasite worm is spread by the bites of a species of black fly (genus _Simulium_.)

The flies live close to rivers; hence the name for the disease. The disease incubates in the body, manifesting as nodules and skin pigmentation in later years and eventually causing blindness when larvae produced by worms in the nodules migrate.

The Carter Center supported the campaign to eliminate the disease in Mexico. On receiving the news from Mexico, former US President Jimmy Carter, founder of The Carter Center, issued a statement saying: "Together with The Carter Center, Rosalynn and I recognize Mexico's dedicated river blindness health workers for improving the lives of so many for generations to come. I am personally committed to wiping out this scourge in the Americas as soon as possible."

Extensive distribution of a safe and effective oral medication called ivermectin was key to eliminating the disease. Considerable quantities were donated by drugs giant Merck under the trade name Mectizan.

[Mexico is to be congratulated with this important achievement. Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin stopped 3 years ago, and continued monitoring of the local _Simulium_ (black flies) population for _Onchocerca_ larvae has failed to find any. A recent study (Rodriguez-Perez MA, Fernandez-Santos NA, Orozco-Algarra ME, et al: Elimination of onchocerciasis from Mexico. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9(7): e0003922; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4498594/) concluded that the _Simulium_ surveillance data did not indicate that onchocerciasis was returning in the 3 last remaining foci in Mexico.

The announcement comes at the same time as the Nobel Prize was awarded for the development of Ivermectin and illustrates how this discovery affects the health and wellbeing of people living in areas previously endemic for filariasis, including onchocerciasis.

The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA) is a regional partnership under the Pan American Health Organization, PAHO. Its strategy is the provision of MDA with ivermectin 2 or more times each year to all communities in endemic foci.

WHO declared Colombia and Ecuador free of onchocerciasis in 2013 and 2014, respectively (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs374/en/). The last remaining foci in The Americas are the indigenous Yanomami people, deep in the Amazon rainforest, in a cross-border transmission zone in Venezuela and Brazil (WHO Weekly epidemiological record 2014; 89(37): 401-8. http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8937.pdf). - Mod.EP
