The current expansion of yellow fever in South America (see
ProMED-mail 20080115.0194; ProMED-mail 20080205.0461; and ProMED-mail
20080208.0511) raises concern about potential conservation problems
for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent. Of the
New World primates (Ceboidea), howler (_Alouatta_ spp.) and spider
(_Ateles_ spp.) monkeys are the most susceptible species. It has long
been known that for these species, infection with yellow fever virus
is almost always fatal [1].

On this basis, in some South American countries non-human primates
serve as sentinels, and yellow fever surveillance is enhanced by
monitoring for primate mortalities in the forests (see ProMED-mail
20071224.4126, [2]). However, recent notifications of yellow
fever-infected dead monkeys (see ProMED-mail 20080205.0461;
ProMED-mail 20080205.0459) could represent the "tip of the iceberg,"
the only visible portion of a significant die-off that could threaten
the conservation of some primate species regionally. The finding of
dead monkeys in Misiones (Argentina), for example, was only possible
because 4 groups of _Alouatta caraya_ and _A. guariba_ [howler
monkeys] were being intensively studied since 2005. In January 2008,
all 39 individuals being followed by researchers disappeared, and
after intensive search, the researchers could only find 12 carcasses,
one of which was fresh enough to be sampled (tissues tested positive
to yellow fever virus by direct immunofluorescence at the Instituto
Nacional de Enfermedades Virales Humanas, Argentina).

If we want to protect biodiversity for the myriad of benefits
commonly discussed, including its role as an indicator of health and
disease processes, it is crucial to assess the real impact of yellow
fever on non-human primate populations in South America, especially
for species or populations with conservation problems. Actions to
monitor the status of wild primate populations should be encouraged
in relevant countries.

[ProMED-mail thanks the contributors of this piece for pointing out
that yellow fever is more than a significant human health problem: it
poses risks to wild primate populations as well. As neotropical
forest primate habitat shrinks from human impacts, a fatal disease
such as yellow fever can further exacerbate pressures on already
declining primate populations. - Mod.TY]
