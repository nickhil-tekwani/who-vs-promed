re: Undiagnosed deaths, porcine - China (02): (ZJ,JS) circovirus
----------------------------------------------------------------
You alluded to this in your editorial comment, but just to reinforce it: finding 1 of 5 animals to be PCR-positive for circovirus is in no way conclusive of a causal relationship between circovirus infection and these mass mortalities. Circovirus is endemic in many swine populations, and in such populations most animals are healthy carriers.

In order to accurately diagnose clinically significant circovirus infection, one should observe clinical signs of wasting in young pigs, in association with microscopic demonstration of the typical tissue lesions (lymphoid depletion with botryoid inclusion bodies).
