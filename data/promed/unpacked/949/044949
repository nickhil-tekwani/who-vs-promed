Since January 1997, 5 cases of yellow fever have been diagnosed in Colombia
using histopatological tools. 3 of them are located in the Department of
the Meta, an extensive and semirural area in the east of the country. The
last case has occurred in Mapiripan, Meta (10,000 inhabitants), a
settlement located on the south side of the department, on the border with
the Guaviare river. [If this town in infested with _Aedes aegypti_, the
yellow fever mosquito, they were lucky an urban epidemic did not break out
- Mod.JW]
At the request of the MOH, the Colombian National Institute of Health sent
two epidemiologists with the Field Epidemiology Training Program to join a
local response team to assess the current situation.
The index case, a 18 year old pregnant woman, suddenly started on June 6
with fever, headache, chills, myalgia, postration, nausea and vomiting.
Three days later she developed jaundice, hematemesis ("coffee ground"
vomit) [indicating bleeding into the stomach] and coma for approximately 2
days, when the patient was taken out to the Villavicencio hospital and
died. It was not possible to stablish with accuracy [any history] of yellow
fever vaccination.
No more cases have occurred in the area despite an increase in epidemiological
surveillance activities in local health centers from Meta and Guaviare
States, particularly in those of the Guaviare river basin.
A tremendous increase in civil unrest and military activities in the area
accounts for a massive exodus of farm workers, some of them involved in
coca growing and processing and exposed to the sylvatic cycle of yellow
fever.
Our field investigation found the coverage of yellow fever vaccination
[was] below 50%. Based on our findings a statewide vaccination campaign was
launched in Meta and Guaviare.
