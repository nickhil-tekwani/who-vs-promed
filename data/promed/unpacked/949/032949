The 24 gaurs found dead in Prachuap Khiri Khan's Kui Buri wildlife reserve were not necessarily killed by deliberate poisoning or poaching, but possibly by an [unusual] disease, a joint investigation led by the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation showed yesterday [31 Jan 2014].

Strains of the so-called black disease involving the bacterium _Clostridium novyi_, which is potentially fatal to animals, were found in the tissue of 15 gaurs and one clay sample. Though "black disease" has never been reported in Thailand, further investigation has been recommended to determine whether the 15 gaurs really died from it.

In addition, the _Clostridium perfringens_ bacterium was found in the tissue of 6 carcasses and food sources, but it is not fatal and was not likely to be the cause of death. Another report said no excessive amounts of heavy metals, insecticide, or cyanide were found in food and water resources for animals.

The department has recommended that the carcasses be immediately buried, the area where they were found be disinfected, a buffer zone be created to minimise future infections among animals, cattle farmed near the reserve be vaccinated, and access to the area be limited to authorised personnel and police.

_Clostridium novyi_ is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram positive rod that varies in size. The organism produces highly potent exotoxins (A to D). The toxin A causes necrosis, increases permeability of the cell barrier, and disrupts intercellular junctions.

_Clostridium novyi_ is the causative agent responsible for gas gangrene in humans and infectious necrotic hepatitis (black disease) in sheep, cattle, swine, goats, and horses.

The gaur (_Bos gaurus_) is the tallest species of wild cattle. It is native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. The species is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List since 1986, as the population decline in parts of the species' range is likely to be well over 70 percent during the last years. Population trends are stable in well-protected areas, and are rebuilding in a few areas which had been neglected. A picture of a gaur can be accessed at http://tinyurl.com/oberu9p. - Mod.PMB]
