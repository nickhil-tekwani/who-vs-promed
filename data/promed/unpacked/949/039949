H5N1 bird flu [avian A/H5N1 influenza virus] can kill humans but has
not gone pandemic because it cannot spread easily among us. That might
change: 5 mutations in just 2 genes have allowed the virus to spread
between mammals [ferrets] in the lab. What's more, the virus is just
as lethal [to ferrets] despite the mutations.

"The virus is transmitted as efficiently as seasonal flu," says Ron
Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
who reported the work at a scientific meeting on flu last week in
Malta. "This shows clearly that [the H5N1 virus] can change in a way
that allows transmission and still cause severe disease in humans.
It's scary," says Peter Doherty, a 1996 Nobel prizewinner for work in
viral immunology.

H5N1 evolved in poultry in east Asia and has spread across Eurasia
since 2004. In that time, 565 people are known to have caught it; 331
died. No strain [of the avian H5N1 virus] that spreads readily among
mammals has emerged in that time, despite millions of infected birds
and infections in people, cats and pigs. Efforts to create such a
virus in the lab have failed, and some virologists think H5N1 simply
cannot do it.

The work by Fouchier's team suggests otherwise. They 1st gave H5N1 3
mutations known to adapt bird flu to mammals. This version of the
virus killed ferrets, which react to flu viruses in a similar way to
humans. The virus did not transmit between them, though.

Then the researchers gave the virus from the sick ferrets to more
ferrets, a standard technique for making pathogens adapt to an animal.
They repeated this 10 times, using stringent containment. The 10th
round of ferrets shed an H5N1 strain that spread to ferrets in
separate cages and killed them. The process yielded viruses with many
new mutations, but 2 were in all of them. Those plus the 3 added
deliberately "suggest that as few as 5 are required to make the virus
airborne," says Fouchier. He will now test H5N1 made with only those
5.

All the mutations have been seen separately in H5N1 from birds. "If
they occur separately, they can occur together," says Fouchier. Malik
Peiris of the University of Hong Kong, a flu virologist, says this
means H5N1 transmissible between humans can evolve in birds, where it
is circulating already, without needing to spend time in mammals such
as pigs.

Peter Palese, a flu specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New
York City who has expressed doubts that H5N1 can adapt to mammals, is
not convinced. "Ferrets are not humans," he says. "H5N1 has been
around for a long time" and failed to mutate into a form that can jump
between people.

"That it has not adapted doesn't mean it cannot," replies Jeffery
Taubenberger of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland, who studies how a bird flu became the deadly pandemic of
1918. "It simply means that so far, it has not, luckily for us."

[Unfortunately, this account provides too little detail to assess the
validity of these claims, and proper evaluation of these experiments
must await publication of the data.

It seems certain that only a few mutations are required to produce a
virus that will be transmissible between humans. However, for such an
outcome to occur in nature, there needs to be an appropriate selection
pressure. From the information provided in this account, it is not
possible to infer what this might be precisely. Publication of the
data is awaited with much interest. - Mod.CP]
