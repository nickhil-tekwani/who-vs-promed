The chief physician at Dhaka's International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases
and Research (ICDDRB) said on Thursday flood-stricken Bangladesh was facing
an epidemic of water-borne diseases, especially diarrhoea. "In the case of
Dhaka we can say there is an epidemic in diarrhoeal disease. The many
(flood) shelters that hold many people in one area certainly increase the
risk of spread of disease," Dr. M.A. Salam told Reuters in an interview.
He said the number of patients coming to the centre now ranged between 640
to just over 700 a day, compared to over 800 in the previous month. He
added that the situation was helped by NGOs (non-governmental
organisations), government and other agencies which opened treatment
centres in the capital to deal with diarrhoeal cases. "This has helped to
take some pressure off this centre by reducing the number of people coming
here by up to about 100 a day," Salam said. Health officials said over
180,000 people contracted diarrhoea, caused by drinking polluted water or
eating rotten food, of whom over 140 have died.
