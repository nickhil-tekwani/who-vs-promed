From my time in Kenya 20 years ago, we saw many cases in the emergency
room of intentional poisoning/suicide due to "sheep dip" (organophosphate)
ingestion. The symptoms mentioned with regards to the incident in Namibia
below seem consistent with organophosphate poisoning.
Some of the expected symptoms are (from the Kentucky Regional Poison Centre
website <http://www.krpc.com/proffed/op%5Cop.cfm>, authors Bret Riegel;
reviewed by: George M Bosse, George C Rodgers, Jr, Henry A Spiller):
"All signs and symptoms of acute organophosphate poisoning are cholinergic
in nature and effect nicotinic, muscarinic, and central nervous system
receptors. These effects develop within minutes to hours, depending on the
type of exposure. The quickest symptoms occur with inhalation, followed by
GI absorption and dermal exposure, with respiratory symptoms being the most
critical.
The nicotinic (sympathomimetic) effects from Ach [acetylcholine] excess at
motor end plates cause persistent depolarization of skeletal muscles,
resulting in fasciculations, muscle weakness, hypertension, and
tachycardia. Also, mydriasis can be present.
Muscarinic effects from postganglionic parasympathetic activity of smooth
muscles may cause smooth muscle contractions in all organs (such as lung,
gastrointestinal, eye, bladder, secretory glands). These include
bronchospasm, GI upset, miosis and urination. Effects also include
reduction of sinus node and AV conduction, causing brady- or ventricular
dysrhythmias. CNS effects may cause excessive stimulation (seizures), CNS
depression and/or coma. Patients may present in a coma with or without
seizure activity, or the patient may rapidly progress to a severely
depressed mental status. Actual signs/symptoms depend on the balance of
muscarinic and nicotinic receptor stimulation.
The patient can have wheezing, chest tightness, and productive cough. The
bronchorrhea can be significant with frothy and/or bloody sputum and severe
pulmonary edema. The primary cause of death in acute poisoning is usually
respiratory failure with a contributing cardiovascular component.
Toxic myocardiopathy has been noted in some severe poisonings. Bradycardia
is the usual cardiac sign, but there can be tachycardia and hypertension
from nicotinic, sympathetic stimulation. Headache, dizziness, and the
SLUDGE syndrome of salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, GI
upset, and emesis are some of the common early symptoms reported. Sweating
and rhinorrhea also frequently are present. Weakness, fasciculations,
incoordination, and GI distress all are markers of a worsening poisoned
condition. Blurry or darkened vision can be present with miosis. Confusion,
anxiety, restlessness and toxic psychosis can occur and there have been
reports of memory loss and depression.
Signs and symptoms in children are often different than in adults. Less
common are sweating, lacrimation, bradycardia and fasciculations. Mental
status changes including lethargy and coma and seizures are more common.
Seizures are an infrequent presentation in adults.
Other miscellaneous effects include torsade de pointes, pancreatitis,
hyperglycemia, garlic odor and hypothermia."

[It would be helpful to get a copy of the toxicology reports from the
patients in Namibia. If anyone could send us an authoritative follow up, it
would be appreciated. - Mod.TG]
