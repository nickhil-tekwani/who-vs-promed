Report of Suspected Case of vCJD in Hong Kong
---------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: A Hong Kong man is suspected of having contracted variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the fatal brain-wasting illness linked to
"mad cow" disease, a news report stated on Sat 9 Jun 2001. The man is in a
critical condition in hospital and was reported to have contracted [a new
strain of ?] vCJD by the Oriental Daily News. Scientists believe vCJD is
caused by eating meat infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
Only an autopsy can confirm if a patient was stricken with the classical or
variant version of the disease.
Hong Kong health officials believe the case could mark the first time vCJD
has been detected outside Europe, the newspaper said. The man, aged in his
30s or 40s and who has lived overseas, was admitted to hospital 2 months
ago suffering from depression and memory loss.
Hong Kong has recorded some 18 cases of vCJD [sic] between 1996 and 2000,
and most of the sufferers have died, the report said. Local officials are
worried news of the new strain [i.e., the variant form of CJD - Mod.] could
spark concerns over the safety of eating beef and other health fears, as
well as affect the import of beef from the mainland. In 1996, Hong Kong
banned British beef over fears of the illness.

[This report is confusing. The variant form of CJD (initially called the
new variant form of CJD) is described as a new strain of vCJD, and the
sporadic form of CJD is here erroneously designated vCJD. The basis for the
diagnosis of vCJD, rather than classical CJD, is not stated. The accuracy
of this report can be questioned on the basis of its lack of concordance
with the following AP Report. - Mod.CP]

Suspected Case of vCJD in Hong Kong
-----------------------------------
HONG KONG: Health authorities were cited as saying on Sat 9 Jun 2001 that
they have found the first suspected case of the human form of mad cow
disease in Hong Kong. The Hospital Authority was cited as saying that after
performing brain scans and tests, doctors believed a 34-year-old Chinese
woman has variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).
Her symptoms include a progressive neurological disorder, involuntary limb
movements and dementia, the hospital authority said. She was admitted to a
hospital last month and is in serious condition. Director of Health
Margaret Chan was cited as saying that the government is seeking the views
of British experts, adding, "I must stress that it is still a suspected
case at this stage and the experts are still investigating." Chan stressed
that the patient never donated blood, a possible [but so far unproven -
Mod.] means of spreading the disease, during her stay in Hong Kong, and
noted that Hong Kong banned beef imports from Britain in 1996.

[The diagnosis of vCJD in the case of this patient is clearly provisional.
It is not clear whether this report refers to the case described in the
preceding AFP report that contains a number of misstatements. The patients
differ in sex and age. It is possible that 2 cases of sporadic CJD would
occur simultaneously in Hong Kong, but it unlikely that 2 patients would
have contracted the variant form of CJD, since there have been no confirmed
cases outside Europe.
N.B. The older abbreviation CJD (new var.) is used in ProMED-mail headings
to aid archive searches.- Mod.CP]

Suspected Case of vCJD in Hong Kong: Alternate AP Report
--------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Health authorities announced on Sat 9 Jun 2001 that they have
found the first suspected [human] case of mad cow disease in Hong Kong,
sparking fears that the deadly illness had finally spread here. Director of
Health Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chan confirmed a media report that a man
believed to have shown symptoms of the brain-wasting illness has been
hospitalized, but did not identify him. The patient has lived abroad for
many years and sought medical treatment when he returned to Hong Kong at
the beginning of this year, Dr Chan said. However, Dr Chan said the patient
had never donated blood, a possible [but unproven - Mod.] means of
spreading the disease, during his stay in Hong Kong and urged the public
not to grow prematurely fearful of contagion as the territory has banned
beef imports from Britain since 1996. "I must stress that it is still a
suspected case at this stage and the experts are still investigating," she
said.
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.)]
has killed more than 80 Europeans since the mid-1990s, mostly in Britain.
Humans are believed to contract the illness by eating meat products from
cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. It
usually manifests itself in people in the form of depression, memory loss
and dementia, with spongiform changes in the brain. In the past years, mad
cow disease and the unrelated livestock disease, foot-and-mouth disease,
have prompted many Asian countries to ban meat imports from European
countries including Britain, France and Germany, devastating the farming
industry there.

[This Associated Press report is virtually identical to that preceding it,
with the single exception that the patient has changed sex from female to
male. It can be assumed now that there is in fact only one case (a male
patient) of suspected vCJD in Hong Kong. - Mod.CP]
