[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on
other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases has
increased to 170. A total of 4 definite/probable patients are still
alive so that the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases
becomes 174. A 3rd death from vCJD has occurred during the past month.

Although 3 new deaths due to vCJD were recorded in 2009 and now 3
deaths in 2010 so far, the overall picture is still consistent with
the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now
with a pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, and now 3 so far in 2010.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK so far in the year 2010
-------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 1st 9 months of 2010, there have been 111 referrals, 36
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 3 fatal cases of vCJD, 2 cases of
iatrogenic CJD, and single cases of familial CJD and GSS.

During the 1st 9 months of 2010, there were 1206 referrals, 64
confirmed cases of sporadic CJD, 2 cases of familial CJD, and no
cases of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD have now been
recorded in France since records began in 1992. There was 1 case in
1996, 1 in 2000, 1 in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in
2006, 3 in 2007, 2 in 2009, and none so far in 2010.

The 25 confirmed cases comprise 13 females and 12 males. All 25 are
now deceased. Their median age is 37 (between 19 and 58). 7 were
resident in the Ile-de-France and 18 in the provinces. All the
identified cases have been Met-Met homozygotes. No risk factor has
been identified. One of the 25 had made frequent visits to the United
Kingdom, during about 10 years from 1987.

Prospective 10-year surveillance of human prion diseases in Japan
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
We analysed the epidemiological data and clinical features of
patients with prion diseases that had been registered by the
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Committee, Japan, over the
past 10 years, since 1999. We obtained information on 1685 Japanese
patients suspected as having prion diseases and judged that 1222
patients had prion diseases, consisting of definite (n=180, 14.7
percent) and probable (n=1029, 84.2 percent) cases, except for dura
mater graft-associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which also included
possible cases (n=13, 1.1 percent). They were classified into 922
(75.5 percent) with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 216 (17.7
percent) with genetic [familial] prion diseases, 81 (6.6 percent)
with acquired [iatrogenic] prion diseases, including 80 cases of dura
mater graft-associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, one case of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and 3 cases of unclassified
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (0.2 percent). The annual incidence rate of
prion disease ranged from 0.65 in 1999 to 1.10 in 2006, with an
average of 0.85, similar to European countries. Although methionine
homozygosity at codon 129 polymorphism of the prion protein gene was
reported to be very common (93 percent) in the general Japanese
population, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Japan was
significantly associated with codon 129 homozygosity (97.5 percent)
and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as reported in western
countries. In sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, MM1 type (Parchi's
classification) is the most common, as in western countries. Among
atypical sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases, the MM2 type
appeared most common, probably related to the very high proportion of
methionine allele in the Japanese population. As for iatrogenic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, only dura mater graft-associated
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases were reported in Japan and, combined
with the data from previous surveillance systems, the total number of
dura mater graft-associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was 138,
comprising the majority of worldwide dura mater graft-associated
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients. Regarding genetic prion diseases,
the most common mutation of prion protein gene was V180I (41.2
percent), followed by P102L (18.1 percent), E200K (17.1 percent), and
M232R (15.3 percent), and this distribution was quite different from
that in Europe. In particular, V180I, and M232R were quite rare
mutations worldwide. Patients with V180I or M232R mutations rarely
had a family history of prion diseases, indicating that a genetic
test for sporadic cases is necessary to distinguish these from
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In conclusion, our prospective
10-year surveillance revealed a frequent occurrence of dura mater
graft-associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and unique phenotypes of
sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and genetic prion diseases related
to the characteristic distribution of prion protein gene mutations
and polymorphisms in Japan, compared with those in western countries.

[The annual incidence of prion disease in Japan ranged from 0.65 in
1999 to 1.10 in 2006, with an average of 0.85, which is similar to
the average annual incidence in European countries. Although
methionine homozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein gene is
very common (93 percent) in the general Japanese population, it was
still possible to demonstrate a specific association between
methionine homozygosity at codon 129 (97.5 percent) in Japan, as
observed in all western countries.

On the other hand unique phenotypes of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) and genetic CJD were observed in relation to the
characteristic distribution of prion protein gene mutations and
polymorphisms in Japan, in comparison with those in western
countries. The Japanese data are also distinctive in respect of the
large number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which were
associated with dura mater grafts. - Mod.CP]

[5] UK: tonsil tissue survey

HPA-Study results are consistent with earlier estimates of vCJD prion
prevalence in Britain
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the UCL (University College
London) Institute of Neurology have conducted a sensitive examination
of tonsil specimens to detect the presence of the variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) related prion protein, and found
results that are consistent with earlier estimates of vCJD prion
prevalence in Britain. The findings are published today [5 Oct 2010]
in The Journal of Pathology [see abstract below].

This study involved using immunohistochemistry to examine 9160
anonymised tonsils for the presence of abnormal prions and found one
sample showing evidence of prions associated with vCJD. Study author
Dr Jonathan Clewley, a HPA expert on vCJD, said: "We have used a
sensitive test and the result is consistent with findings of earlier
studies. The HPA will continue its research alongside the UCL
Institute of Neurology and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, to
look at appendices by immunohistochemistry, in order to give greater
confidence and accuracy to prevalence estimates of vCJD prions."

The anonymised tonsils used in this study were obtained from earlier
studies -- they had been removed from patients for clinical reasons
and would otherwise have been discarded. Tonsils are one of a number
of body tissues known to harbour abnormal prions in people who carry
vCJD -- other tissues where these prions can be found include the appendix.

Lead author Professor Sebastian Brandner, from the UCL Institute of
Neurology, said: "Prevalence studies such as this are vitally
important as they enable us to estimate the prevalence of vCJD in the
population. However, it is important to understand that we do not
know how good these tests are at picking up infected individuals and
so the results may be an underestimate. "They also give an indication
as to the number of cases to expect in the future and the potential
impact for the health service. Prion diseases can have long
incubation periods, and an understanding of prevalence can help
researchers devise measures to prevent further transmission of the disease."

There have been 220 clinically confirmed cases of vCJD worldwide,
with the UK being most affected with 173 [now increased to 174, see
[1] above] people having developed the disease, as a result of the
epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle in the 1980s.
Large scale vCJD prion prevalence studies are challenging at present
as there is no valid test available to screen for the vCJD prion in blood.

Large-scale immunohistochemical examination for lymphoreticular prion
protein in tonsil specimens collected in Britain
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Fernandez de Marco M, Linehan J, Gill ON, Clewley JP, and
Brandner S.]

Abstract
--------
There have been 173 cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)
in the UK, as of 5 Jul 2010, as a result of the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy epidemic. The number of individuals subclinically
infected with vCJD, and thus the eventual number of cases, remains,
however, uncertain. In an attempt to address this problem, 63 007
tonsil tissue specimens were previously tested by enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) for the presence of disease-related prion protein (PrPres) and
found to be negative. To confirm the reliability of this result, all
those in the birth cohort most at risk (1961-1985) and a few others,
including controls, have now been tested by immunohistochemistry
(IHC). Histological slides were prepared from 10 075 anonymized
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and examined for PrPres
with 2 anti-prion protein antibodies, ICMS35 and KG9. One specimen
showed a single strongly positive follicle with both antibodies, on 2
slides from adjacent sections. As this specimen was negative when it
was further investigated by EIA, IHC, and immunoblotting, it is
unclear whether the patient from whom the tonsil came will go on to
develop vCJD. If, however, this is the case, then a finding of 1 out
of 9160 gives a prevalence of disease-related prion protein in the
British population of 109 per million, with a 95 percent confidence
interval (CI) of 3-608 per million, which is not statistically
different (exact p=0.63) from population prevalence estimates based
on finding 3 positives out of 10 278 in a previous IHC study of
appendix tissue. If this is not the case, a finding of 0 out of 9160
gives a prevalence of 0-403 per million (95 percent CI) for the
1961-1985 cohort, which is also not different (exact p=0.25) from
previous population prevalence estimates. Therefore, the results of
this work could be summarized as finding, by IHC, no or one
vCJD-positive individual."

The following extracts from the discussion section of this paper are
relevant for the interpretation of these findings:

"Our finding of one PrPres-positive follicle by IHC can be
interpreted as showing that there is one individual in the 9160
samples from the 1961-1985 birth cohort who will go on to develop
vCJD. Alternatively, if a single positive follicle is indicative of
an insufficient amount of PrPres to spread and cause disease, the
interpretation is that there is no one in the 9160 samples from the
1961-1985 birth cohort who will go on to develop vCJD. The decision
between these 2 interpretations needs to be considered in the context
of the relative sensitivities of the different tests that were used,
and also in the context of the pathological significance of a small
quantity of PrPres in a tonsil. Although all 3 methods (EIA, IB, and
IHC) are based on the recognition of PrPres by specific anti-PrP
antibodies, they are qualitatively and quantitatively different. As
just a few stained cells can be seen by IHC, it could be argued that
it is the more sensitive technique."

"Therefore, while we cannot say whether the patient from whom this
tissue came will go on to develop vCJD, we can be reasonably certain,
however, that the patient has not yet developed disease as the codon
129 PRNP genotype is MV, and all probable and definite vCJD cases to
date have been MM at this loci. There have been 4 'possible' cases of
clinical vCJD, one of which was MV, but this was not biochemically
confirmed and it was in a different birth cohort from the person from
whom the tonsil in our study came."

"The prevalence in the British population of underlying
disease-related prion protein calculated from these findings is, if
[the positive] specimen came from a vCJD-positive person, 109 per
million for the 1961-1985 birth cohort, with a 95 percent confidence
interval (CI) of 3-608 per million, which is not different (exact
p=0.63) to the finding of 3 positives from 10 278 samples for the
appendix survey. If tonsil 38 660 did not come from a vCJD-positive
person, then the prevalence is 0 per million with an upper 95 percent
CI of 403 for the 1961-1985 cohort and 0 per million for the
1961-1995 cohort with an upper 95 percent CI of 394, which is not
different (exact p=0.25) from the previous study."

"Although, statistically, the vCJD prevalence estimates in this work
do not differ significantly from those obtained by calculating from
the previous study, qualitatively they suggest that prevalence
estimates may be cautiously lowered. However, in an attempt to
provide statistically significant evidence to demonstrate this, a
large-scale IHC survey of recently collected appendix tissue
specimens for the presence of PrPres is underway."

Overall the message is encouraging in that these data support the
inference that the vCJD prion incidence in the UK population is low
and not increasing. - Mod.CP]
