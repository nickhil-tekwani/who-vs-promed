[Q (query) fever is caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, the only common
rickettsia to be usually transmitted by aerosol rather than through an
arthropod vector. Worldwide, this zoonosis is primarily found in cattle,
sheep, and goats, but many mammals and birds may also be infected. The
diagnosis is usually serological, and the illness is most commonly either a
self-limited febrile illness lasting up to 2 weeks or pneumonia with or
without hepatitis. - Mod.LL]
