A case of bluetongue seems to have turned up at a sheep breeder in
Oelegen [sic, should read Oelegem], a submunicipality of Ranst [see
map at

The results of the most recent tests will give a definite answer this
afternoon [18 Jul 2007], but the Federal Food Agency says that all
indications are pointing to the virus at the moment.
Bluetongue is not dangerous to humans. Consumption of meat or milk
from infected animals does not pose any risks.
All ruminants can be infected by the insect-borne disease. The
disease is generally not fatal, but some susceptible breeds of sheep
can be hard hit.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[The Belgian authorities notified this case to the OIE (World
Organization for Animal Health) on 17 Jul 2007; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_imm_0000005744_20070717_170418.pdf>.
According to the report, there was one clinically affected sheep in a
flock including 30 heads. The affected sheep died; the diagnosis was
based upon clinical investigation, necropsy and laboratory ELISA
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test.
Oelegem is situated in the municipality of Ranst, Antwerp province, 30
km (18.6 mi) from the Dutch border.
Belgium is the 2nd country in northern Europe where bluetongue has
recurred during 2007; the 1st one was Germany, where one focus was
recorded in cattle in June and 3 foci -- one in cattle, 2 in sheep --
in July (see ProMED-mail 20070713.2250). All 4 recent outbreaks in
Germany were found to be caused by BTV-8, the same serotype that
caused the epizootic during the summer and fall of 2006 in Belgium,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The culicoides-borne
virus may continue its circulation during the rest of the summer and
fall [2007].
Information on vaccination plans and about the availability of
vaccines to be applied will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
