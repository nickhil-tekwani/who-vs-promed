2 children - one on the island of Funen and another in the Copenhagen area - died due to a rare complication related to EHEC, a strain of the _E. coli_ bacteria. Both children died of kidney failure, but the 2 tragic cases are not connected. A 3rd child also contracted kidney failure but survived, DPSA said.

A consultant doctor and head of department at Copenhagen infectious disease research institute SSI stressed that the cases were not evidence of an outbreak and that the number of cases was not improbable. "At this time, we have knowledge of 3 cases of kidney failure from August to September 2019. That is not more than we would expect at this time of year. Fortunately there is nothing to suggest they are connected," Tyra Grove Krause said.

"They were not infected with the same bacteria, so there is no common source of infection. So it is not an outbreak, but a chance coincidence," Krause added.

DPSA has confirmed it has consulted parents of children who attend relevant schools or daycare facilities, and that authorities are working to gain a clearer understanding of the circumstances surrounding the cases.

A daycare and private school on Funen, Bornehuset Solstralen and Gislev Friskole, chose to remain closed on [Wed 4 Sep and Thu 5 Sep 2019], local media reported.

Krause reiterated that there was no evidence of an epidemic. General advice for guarding against the specific complications seen in the cases is to thoroughly cook beef and to keep unprepared meat and vegetables separated. "The type of bacteria that--in rare cases--cause kidney failure are often found in beef," she said. "Additionally, there are sometimes cases amongst children who have visited farms and petted cows and goats and not washed their hands afterwards," she added.

[It appears that the serotypes of the enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ may be different. With cases of HUS, which generally occurs in less than 10% of EHEC cases, it is likely that more cases have occurred. In hemolytic uremic syndrome, most of the fatalities occur when central nervous system complications also develop. - Mod.LL
