Arctic mouse alert in northern outpost
------------------------------------
The Svalbard field mouse, _Microtus epiroticus_, has been found to harbor a
parasite that can cause fatal liver cysts [due to infection with
_Echinococcus multilocularis_. The Svalbard administration is to offer
blood tests to the islands' children, and says it needs to do more to
minimize the risk.
Two scientists are already known to have tested positive for the parasite
[It is not known what type of testing was used based upon this report -Man.
Ed. DS. One of them had worked in the area most at risk for only one day.
It [the area has only 4 mammal species: the mouse, the Arctic fox, the
Svalbard reindeer (a distinct sub-species), and a population of polar bears.
The mouse is believed to have arrived on Svalbard in the 1920s from eastern
Europe, where it is common today. The mouse was found in 1999 to be
[intermediate host to a parasite, a tiny tapeworm [_E. multilocularis_,
which in its adult phase lives in the small intestines of dogs, foxes and
other canine species [which serve as definitive hosts -Man. Ed. DS.
Animals [definitive hosts acquire the parasite by eating the mice. The
dogs excrete the tapeworm's eggs, and people who then ingest them - for
instance after stroking a dog - are at risk [of infection. The eggs travel
to the liver, hatch out, and can then cause cysts which are often fatal if
not detected and removed.
Health warning
One of the 2 scientists on Svalbard found to be infected [probably only
tested positive in an antibody assay which do not prove infection had been
working with Arctic foxes. It can take up to 15 years for the disease to
manifest itself.
The director of the Norwegian universities' study centre on Svalbard, Lasse
Loennum, has written to about 100 former students who had worked in the
Grumant area since 1996, warning them of the risk and urging them to be
tested.
The head of environmental protection for the governor of Svalbard is Carl
Erik Kilander. He told BBC News Online: "We are concerned at the situation,
but not terrified. It's a small minority of people here who could be at risk."
The resident population of Svalbard is probably under 3 000, but about 14
000 tourists visit the islands every year. Residents have been warned to
wash their hands after touching dogs or foxes, and to boil water taken from
streams and rivers, something they have not done before because the Arctic
environment is regarded as pristine. Scientists have been told to wear
rubber gloves when working with foxes. Dogs in the main settlement,
Longyearbyen, have all been tested: most are huskies or Greenland dogs used
for hauling sledges. But no formal warning has been issued to tourists. Mr
Kilander said: "We could do more to inform tourists in a systematic way. I
don't know of anything like that being done."
The parasite can also survive in cats [but cats most probably are not
infective. They are forbidden on Svalbard, though the Russians are known
to keep some in Barentsburg.

[_E. multilocularis_ has just been described in Svalbard, so even though
_E. multilocularis_ is not mentioned in the broadcast this must be the
case. _E. multilocularis_ is known from foci in Alaska and Hakkaido, and is
also prevalent in central Europe where human cases are seen in 0.1 to 1.5
cases per 100,000 population per year in areas of France and Switzerland.
In these areas up to 50% of foxes are infected which indicates that the
infectivity for humans is very low (For further reading see: Eckert &
Deplazes Parasitol Today 1999,15:315-19).
The plan for serological testing of asymptomatic humans, as suggested in
the broadcast, is likely to lead to substantial confusion. There has only
been one large study of population screening for _E. multilocularis_
infection in humans (Suzuki et al. IN: Alveolar echinococcosis. Strategy
for eradication of Alveolar Echinococcosis of the liver. Echino, J. & Sato,
N. (Eds.) pp. 213-17. Fuji Shoin, Sapporo 1996). This paper describe a
study in highly endemic Hakkaido (Japan) where 5 159 people were found
seropositive of whom only 60 were found to have clinical disease. This
gives a positive predictive value of the test of about 1%.
What to tell the remaining 99%? Are they asymptomatic, but infected? Have
they been exposed to the eggs in the intestine, but are not infected?
Should they receive treatment with potential side effects, and if so in
which doses and for how long? -Mod.EP
[The parasite has also been found in animals in the northern central states
of the United States and in parts of Canada. -Man. Ed. DS
