The risk of an outbreak of leishmaniasis in Arcos, in the mid-west of the state, has the population worried. Dogs are the main hosts of the parasite [_Leishmania chagasi_], which is dangerous to humans, and the disease is transmitted by a vector. Leishmaniasis is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the 6 largest parasitic epidemics in the world. In Minas Gerais last year [2011], there were 19 677 cases of the disease.

To prevent further contamination, agents of the Control Center for Zoonoses (CCZ) will test all residences for leishmaniasis by withdrawing a drop of blood from the animal's ear, and the result of the test will be available in about 10 minutes. With the test, housewife Lucia Narciso Silva found that one of her 3 dogs is contaminated. "I did not know he had this problem. So I think it's good, this work," she said.

When the test result is positive, the veterinarian removes a blood sample and sends it to the Ezequiel Dias Foundation, Belo Horizonte, responsible for testing in the state. "The agents collect blood, and I return to the homes and harvest the blood from the vein of the animals that tested positive," explained veterinarian Ana Luiza Teixeira.

In Arcos, 5000 dogs will be examined, including homeless animals. So far, 51 cases have been confirmed, but agents believe that the number is higher, because 10 percent of residents will not allow examination of their animals. Despite this refusal, infected dogs were found throughout the city.

A survey by the Regional Health Management (GRS) found that the sandfly [_Lutzomyia longipalpis_], better known as the "straw mosquito," responsible for transmitting the disease to humans is present in all city neighborhoods.

[An image of the sandfly (_Lutzomyia longipalpis_) may be seen at: http://www.diptera.info/photogallery.php?photo_id=2069. This sandfly (Diptera: Psychodidae) is also known as a phlebotomine sand fly.

Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with _Leishmania_ parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. The most common forms are cutaneous leishmaniasis, which causes skin sores, and visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually the spleen, liver, and bone marrow).

The main route is through the bite of infected female phlebotomine sand fly. Sand flies become infected by sucking blood from an infected animal or person. People might not realize that sand flies are present because:
- They do not make a noise when they fly;
- They are small: they are only about 1/3rd the size of typical mosquitoes or even smaller;
- Their bites might not be noticed (the bites may be painless or painful).

Sand flies usually are most active at twilight, evening, and night-time hours (from dusk to dawn). Although sand flies are less active during the hottest time of the day, they may bite if they are disturbed (for example, if a person brushes up against the trunk of a tree or other site where sand flies are resting).

Some types (species) of _Leishmania_ parasites may also be spread by blood transfusions or contaminated needles (needle sharing). Congenital transmission (spread from a pregnant woman to her baby) has been reported.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic, severe, protozoal disease of humans, dogs, and certain rodents characterized by cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, anemia, lameness, renal failure, and occasionally epistaxis (nosebleeds) or ocular lesions.

Infection in dogs is prevalent in Central and South America, the Middle East, Asia, and in the Mediterranean region. The disease is endemic in foxhounds in North America. Isolated cases are diagnosed around the world in animals that have visited endemic areas. Cats and other domestic animals are rarely infected and usually only develop cutaneous ulcers without showing signs of visceral disease. Canine leishmaniasis is a zoonosis, and dogs act as a reservoir of the parasite for humans where there is a competent vector.

The incubation period in dogs is quite variable, ranging from 3 months to several years. The clinical features vary widely; main clinical presentations are skin lesions, loss of weight or poor appetite, local or generalized lymphadenopathy, ocular lesions, renal failure, epistaxis, lameness, and anemia. Occasionally, some dogs have chronic diarrhea or liver failure. The most common cutaneous lesions are alopecia (hair loss) with severe dry desquamation (skin peeling), usually beginning on the head and extending to the rest of the body. Other animals develop chronic ulceration, located particularly on the head and limbs. The signs invariably show a slow, progressive evolution.

The results of blood and urine tests also vary greatly. Most animals have a polyclonal hyperproteinemia [abnormally high blood protein level]. Nonregenerative anemia is present in 50 percent of dogs. Some animals show leukopenia [abnormally low blood white cell count], whereas others have leukocytosis [abnormally high blood white cell count]. In animals with renal lesions, it is also usual to find increased plasma urea and creatinine, proteinuria and hematuria [protein & blood in the urine].

The most reliable diagnostic test for canine leishmaniasis is direct observation of the parasite in bone marrow or lymph node smears. The amastigotes appear as oval basophilic bodies (4 um) in the cytoplasm of macrophages. However, it is sometimes impossible to detect the parasite in infected animals, especially in lymph node smears. Serologic methods are useful in diagnosis; indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA are widely used. The results of a serologic test should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical picture. Although these tests are reliable, a few infected dogs remain seronegative, and there are also seropositive dogs that never develop the disease.

For treatment, the drugs of choice are the pentavalent antimony derivatives, particularly N-methylglucamine antimoniate (80-100 mg/kg/day, IM or SC [not approved for use in dogs in the USA]) and sodium stibogluconate (75 mg/kg, SC, bid [available only from the CDC in the USA]). During the 1st month, the dog is treated with either drug and allopurinol (20 mg/kg, PO, sid; during the next 5 mo, the dog is treated with only allopurinol, which is less expensive and less toxic. Amphotericin B given IV (0.5-0.8 mg/kg, diluted in 10-60 mL of 5 percent dextrose given over 45 sec every 48 hr for a total cumulative dose of 8-15 mg/kg is reached) or SC 2-3 times/wk (0.5-0.8 mg/kg added to 500 mL of 0.45 percent saline and 2.5 percent dextrose for a total cumulative dosage of 8-26 mg/kg) has also been effective. Relapses after treatment are common with either protocol. In endemic areas, rapid treatment of infected dogs, control of stray and homeless dogs, and action against the insect vectors are recommended methods of control. Treatment of dogs in nonendemic areas is questionable and probably unwise if a competent vector is present. At present, there is no effective vaccine against canine leishmaniasis.

People who have cutaneous leishmaniasis have one or more sores on their skin. The sores can change in size and appearance over time. The sores may start out as bumps or nodules, and may end up as ulcers (like a volcano, with a raised edge and central crater). Some leishmaniasis ulcers are covered by a scab. They can be painless or painful. Some people have swollen glands near the sores (for example, under the arm if the sores are on the arm or hand).

People who have visceral leishmaniasis usually have fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen and liver, and abnormal blood tests. People may have low blood counts, including a low red blood cell count (anemia), low white blood cell count, and low platelet count.
