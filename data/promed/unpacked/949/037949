A comment on bird die-off in Greece
---------------------------------
The mass deaths of waterfowl described in ProMED's posting of Fri, 10
Sep 2004, "Waterfowl die-off - Greece (Lake Koronia)" is most
probably an outbreak of avian botulism. Favorable conditions for bird
botulism are the hot summer months combined with low precipitation
and presence of sarcophagous flies (_Lucilia_ etc.). The disease is
caused by the toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ type C, less
often type E (in fish-eating birds like gulls), and it presents no
risk to humans.

[Dr Hubalek's hypothesis is sound but needs laboratory confirmation.
Since lake Koronia is a European Union-sponsored bird sanctuary, also
protected by the Ramsar treaty, hopefully all relevant lab
investigations are being carried out, including the testing of
carcasses of the dead waterfowl for the toxin(s) -- and final
diagnosis will be forthcoming.
Botulism in waterfowl occurs in all parts of the globe, though most
cases reported by ProMED-mail in recent years originated in the
western hemisphere. For a review describing outbreaks in Europe
(especially the Netherlands) see "Botulism in waterfowl" by Bongers
and Tetenburg in Vet Quarterly, 1996, 18 Suppl 3:S156-7. - Mod.AS]
