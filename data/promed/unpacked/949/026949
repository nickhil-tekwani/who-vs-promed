Mississippi: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mississippi State Department of Health today announced confirmation of the
state's first human case of West Nile virus (WNV). State Health Officer Dr.
Ed Thompson said the individual, a resident of Hinds County in central
Mississippi,is hospitalized with encephalitis and recovering. The report of
the middle-aged man came on 12 Jul 2002 from his physician as a Class 1
Reportable Disease. The Mississippi Public Health Laboratory tested the
specimen "positive" for West Nile virus and sent the cerebral spinal fluid
sample to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory for
confirmation. CDC alerted Mississippi health officials on Fri 19 Jul 2002 in
the afternoon that their lab confirmed the presence of WNV.
Thompson urged all Mississippians to avoid mosquito bites whenever possible.
He said the risk of a healthy person's getting WNV from a mosquito bite is
"very low," but all people still should protect themselves. People older
than 50 years of age have the highest risk of severe disease. Most WNV
encephalitis infections are mild. Symptoms include fever, headache, and body
aches,occasionally with skin rash and swollen lymph glands. More severe
infection might be marked by headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor,
disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis, and,
rarely, death. The incubation period in humans is usually 3 to 15 days.
Supportive therapy often involves hospitalization, intravenous fluids,
airway management, and prevention of secondary infections.
Public health and animal health officials earlier this week announced the
year's first identification in Mississippi of West Nile virus (WNV) in birds
and horses. Birds from Panola and Hinds Counties have tested positive for
WNV through Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) routine
surveillance. On Fri 19 2002 the State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
increased the number of horses infected with WNV from 4 to 5 -- from Scott,
Wilkinson, Hancock, Harrison, and Pearl River Counties. Additionally, horses
from Rankin, Jackson, and Franklin Counties are suspected of having a
mosquito-borne infection; tests are pending.
"West Nile virus is neither new nor unique to us," emphasized State Health
Officer Dr. Ed Thompson. "We identified West Nile virus in animals in
Mississippi in the summer of 2001, and we're quite familiar with 3 other
mosquito-borne viral diseases seen in Mississippi, including St Louis
encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and LaCrosse encephalitis. These
arboviruses are about equally dangerous to humans. In 2001, Mississippi
confirmed WNV in 25 horses and 3 dead blue jays from 4 Northeastern Counties
and Coahoma County. Most arboviruses will not kill birds, but, WN virus does
kill some of the birds that become infected, thus the reporting and testing
of dead birds provide a timely surveillance method. Birds that appear to be
most severely affected are crows and blue-jays (members of the family
_Corvidae_).
