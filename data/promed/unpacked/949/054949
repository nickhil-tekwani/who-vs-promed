Miami Valley Hospital [MVH] has discovered bacteria in its water
system, according to hospital officials. The hospital, part of Premier
Health Partners, is currently working on the issue with the Ohio
Department of Health, Public Health Dayton and Montgomery County, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to hospital officials, 4 patients have been reported sick
with legionnaires' disease. _Legionella_ are common water-borne
bacteria that may cause pneumonia. Hospital officials think the
outbreak was contained to its southeast addition, which opened to
patients 28 Dec 2010. They began water restrictions in the addition on
Tuesday [22 Feb 2011]. The CDC has deemed the addition safe for those
who are currently there, so no evacuations were necessary.

Hospital officials said they have contacted all of those who may have
been affected. Since the opening of the addition, 127 patients have
stayed there. [Legionellosis] is contracted by breathing in mist from
water that contains high concentrations of the bacteria -- such as
during a shower. Infection also can occur if a person chokes on water
with the _Legionella_ bacteria and it is inhaled into the lungs.

Hospital officials said it is unlikely hospital visitors during this
time period were affected. Hospital officials would not comment on the
condition of the sick patients. The affected patients are all in their
late 60s, had stayed in cardiac units, and had other illnesses. The
elderly and those with an immune system weakened by another illness
are more susceptible to _Legionella_ pneumonia, said Dr Howard
Wunderlich, Miami Valley Hospital's chair of infection control
committee.

The patients were diagnosed 3, 17, 19, and 20 Feb 2011 after urine
tests showed the presence of _Legionella [_pneumophila_ serogroup 1]
antigens.

Symptoms of _Legionella_ pneumonia include high fever, chills, cough,
shortness of breath, and sometimes muscle aches and headaches. Most
cases of the disease can be successfully treated with antibiotics.
Patients who stayed in the new patient tower from 28 Dec 2010 to 22
Feb 2011 and have these symptoms are encouraged to see their family
care physicians, said Dr. Gary Collier, Miami Valley's chief medical
officer. The illness cannot be spread by person-to-person contact.

Water restrictions implemented Tuesday [22 Feb 2011] continue as the
issue is under further investigation. Precautions include bottled
water use for drinking, bathing, and other personal hygiene. In
addition, the hot water temperature in the southeast addition was
increased Tuesday night and all lines were flushed.

The source of the _Legionella_ bacteria continues to be investigated
with testing and evaluation of the water system in the southeast
addition. The bacteria likely began to grow during construction of the
new southeast addition, when there was no flow of water in the pipes,
hospital officials said. Before the tower was opened to patients, the
pipes underwent normal protocol and were flushed, according to the
hospital.

In addition to public health agencies, MVH is working with a
representative from a hospital in Rochester, New York, which also
dealt with _Legionella_ bacteria in its water system.

Two new cases of _Legionella_ pneumonia were admitted to Miami Valley
Hospital, bringing the total affected patients to 6.

After 4 Miami Valley Hospital patients were diagnosed with
legionnaires' disease in February, the facility implemented water
restrictions 22 Feb 2011 in its new 12-story patient tower, also known
as the southeast addition. The restrictions were lifted Friday [25 Feb
2011] after state and national health agencies deemed the tower's
water safe for use.

Of the original cases diagnosed, one patient remains in the hospital,
and the 2 patients with the latest reported cases also have been
hospitalized since last weekend [26-27 Feb 2011], according to Nancy
Thickel, Miami Valley Hospital's public relations manager.

Of the 127 potentially affected patients, about 81 have been tested
for the _Legionella_ bacteria, Thickel said. Hospital officials said
any persons who received care or visited Miami Valley Hospital's new
patient tower between 8 Feb and 24 Feb 2011 and feel they are showing
symptoms should call the hospital's phone line at (937) 208-2666. Due
to a diminishing call volume, the hotline hours have been reduced to
between 8 a.m. and midnight.

[The following has been extracted from ProMED moderator ML's comments
in a prior ProMED post, Legionellosis, neonatal, nosocomial, fatal -
Cyprus: susp. 20090102.0011:

"Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_ bacteria, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About
80-90 percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immunosuppression.
Pediatric cases of Legionnaires' disease are uncommon.

"Usually a building's water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are embedded in a biofilm
that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and
containers. Concentrations of the organism in the water can be
increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols can
be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems, shower
heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

"Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

"Genotyping bacteria has become a helpful tool in hospital
epidemiology to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of
one genotype in patient specimens suggests transmission from a common
source. [If the diagnoses of legionnaires' disease were made only on
the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing,
rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory
tract specimens, genotyping of clinical isolates will, of course, not
be possible.] Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies
without history of any cases, the actual causative, infectious
reservoir should be demonstrated by [matching the genotype of the
environmental isolates with that of the clinical isolates] to assure
frequently costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual
source (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/>; and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>)."

Miami Valley Hospital is a large, urban, 848-bed hospital located in
the city of Dayton, Ohio, USA. It has the Dayton region's only level I
trauma center and also has a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Valley_Hospital>).

The Miami Valley refers to the area surrounding the Great Miami River
in southwest Ohio, and includes Dayton and the Greater Dayton area,
the latter with a population of 848 153 in the 2000 census
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Valley> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio>).
