Nasopharyngeal _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ diphtheria in the Netherlands
------------------------------------------------
A 59-year old woman was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history of a
sore throat and increasing dysphagia during treatment with oral penicillin
for 1 day . On admission, the patient was afebrile, the soft palate and
uvula were swollen and a membraneous exudate was seen on the soft palate
and nasopharynx. There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy or soft
tissue swelling. The patient had not recently travelled abroad and had no
contact with people who had recently travelled. The patient was not
vaccinated against diphtheria. Diphtheria was included in the differential
diagnosis.
The patient was barrier nursed and treated with intravenous penicillin. She
recovered fully within 4 days. A throat smear grew no _Corynebacterium
diphtheriae_, but _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ was cultured from this
specimen. The strain contained the gene encoding diphtheria toxin, as shown
by PCR performed at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health.
Although person-to-person transmission has not been documented, a contact
investigation was initiated, but no _C. ulcerans_ was grown from the 2
household contacts of the patient. The patient had not recently been in
contact with horses, cattle or other animals except her domestic cat.
Therefore, the source of the infection is unclear. [Farm animals are
potential reservoirs of _C. ulcerans_ infection. - Mod.ES]
The most recent case of diphtheria caused by _C. diphtheriae_ was reported
in the Netherlands in 1991. We conclude that in countries where _C.
diphtheriae_ is no longer endemic, one should also be aware of the
possibility of diphtheria caused by _C. ulcerans_.

[It has been known for some time that the diphtheria toxin genes can be
harbored by corynebacteria other than _C. diphtheriae_, and cases like the
one reported here have been reported elsewhere. Nonetheless this
interesting case report serves as a reminder that _C. diphtheriae_ is not
the only _Corynebacterium_ sp. of consequence when diphtheria is included
in a differential diagnosis. It is also noteworthy that PCR evidence for
the presence of toxin genes does not by itself provide conclusive evidence
that a functional toxin has been produced. Of course, the clinical
presentation described here taken together with the PCR data support the
conclusion of clinical diphtheria, even in the absence of direct
demonstration of toxin production. - Mod.ES]
