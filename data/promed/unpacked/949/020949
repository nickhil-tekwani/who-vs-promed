Re: old and new classification of Aedini mosquitoes
---------------------------------------------------
Reference the discussion on taxonomic changes within the genus
_Aedes_and tribe Aedinii. In general, I certainly agree with John
Edman's position that we return to the use of _Aedes_prior to
Reinert's (2001) introduction of _Ochlerotatus_as a genus. An
additional reference that readers might like to see is Savage, H.M.,
and D. Strickman (2004). The genus and subgenus categories within
Culicidae and placement of _Ochlerotatus_ as a subgenus of _Aedes_.
J. Am. Mosquito Control Assoc. 20: 208-214. Another very interesting
discussion is available to the public at the Walter Reed
Biosystematics Unit website:

[In my ProMED mail post of 2 May 2005, I tried to keep the problems
regarding the old and new classifications of mosquito and name
changes relatively simple, as I believed that most readers would not
be too interested in having fuller literature citations, especially
as a more detailed "policy statement" has been prepared by John D.
Edman and will be published in the Journal Medical Entomology.
However, I am happy to see the above additional reference of Savage
and Strickman (2004), but I think I should perhaps mention another
reference published alongside the Savage and Strickman paper, namely
Black,W.C. (2004) Learning to use _Ochlerotatus_ is just the
beginning. J. Am. Mosquito Control Assoc. 20: 215-216. - Mod.MS]
