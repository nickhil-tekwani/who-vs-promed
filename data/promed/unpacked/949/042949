Patient with Ebola-like symptoms quarantined in Mapel

A patient with Ebola-like symptoms has been quarantined at the Mapel hospital in Wau State as health officials await laboratory test results.
The director general of the state ministry of health, James Ambrose, told Radio Tamazuj on Friday [10 Jan 2020] that samples of the patient had been taken for analysis.

"The patient is a soldier undergoing military training in Mapel. The said patient is bleeding from his ears, so he had been quarantined, and doctors are taking care of him," Ambrose explained.

The health official further said 2 others had fallen ill with body aches, fever and vomiting, which can also be symptoms of Ebola. He pointed out that further examination found both of them did not have the disease.

The health official said that all necessary precautionary measures had been taken in Mapel area. "We want to assure the public that the cases are stable. We are still waiting for the result, and it will be made public," he said.

"Only one patient has Ebola-like symptoms, but the other 2 patients are responding to treatment," he added.

The health minister noted that the symptoms that have been exhibited by the patients could be indicative of any other medical condition.

South Sudan has a porous border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where many people move across the 2 countries for business and other activities.

South Sudan suffered an Ebola outbreak in 2004 after WHO reported 20 cases including 5 deaths from Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Yambio.

[It is most likely a false alarm, since only 1 of 3 individuals is demonstrating Ebola-like symptoms and the other 2 have been tested and demonstrated not to be infected. However, it is safest not to take chances and to follow standard operating protocol in such situations where Ebola is a possible etiologic agent. Other diseases demonstrating similar early symptoms include Marburg, Lassa, severe malaria, and other diseases. Thus, laboratory testing is essential to confirm etiology.

[2] Summary
Thu 9 Jan 2020. Diseases Outbreak Report, WHO. Disease Outbreak Report [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/09-january-2020-ebola-drc/en/

Twelve new confirmed cases were reported from 1 to 7 Jan 2020 in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from 9 health areas in 4 health zones: Butembo (42%, n=5), Mambasa (33%, n=4), Mangina (17%, n=2), and Beni (8%, n=1). The new case reported in Beni is linked to a transmission chain that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone.

In the past 21 days (18 Dec 2019 to 7 Jan 2020), 41 confirmed cases were reported from 13 health areas within 6 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (49%, n=20), Butembo (22%, n=9), Kalunguta (12%, n=5), Mambasa (10%, n=4), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Beni (2%, n=1). Mabalako Health Zone remains the main hotspot of the outbreak having reported 49% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Although the majority of the cases (76%, n=31) are linked to known chains of transmission, there are concerns around the reintroduction of the disease into health zones with dense populations which have previously been cleared, such as Butembo, Katwa, and Beni Health Zones. The sources of exposure for 5 new cases reported in Kalunguta Health Zone and 4 new cases reported in Mambasa Health Zone in the past 21 days are currently under investigation.

As of 7 Jan 2020, a total of 3392 EVD cases were reported, including 3274 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2235 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1903) were female, 28% (n=956) were children aged less than 18 years, and 169 (5% of all reported cases) were healthcare workers.

- Wed 8 Jan 2020. Repatriation
[Der Spiegel (abridged, edited)]
https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/germany-plans-to-repatriate-ebola-patients-a-eed0d0ec-26d9-4ddb-823b-59c592918959?s

As Heiko Maas disembarks from the German military plane at the Goma Airport in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he is greeted by 2 men in white. One of the men sprays the German foreign minister's hands with a disinfectant, while the other holds a thermometer to his temple.

Every air traveler must undergo the infrared fever test. It's part of an effort by the Congolese authorities to assert control over a virus that has been threatening the region for more than a year: Ebola.

The 1st epidemic of the fatal fever between late 2013 and 2016 cost more than 11 000 people in West Africa their lives. In Congo, around 2200 people have died since summer 2018. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern."

Unlike in West Africa, the epidemic hasn't spread regionally so far. But the danger has not yet been averted. And since many Germans are helping out in the areas of infection, protecting them -- and, should they themselves become infected, treating them -- has become a matter of great urgency for the German government. Thanks to the initiative of the German Foreign Ministry, German citizens who have contracted the dangerous disease could soon be flown home for treatment for the 1st time.

There are now 2 Ebola vaccines, but comprehensive immunization in Congo still remains elusive. One reason is that some infected areas are under rebel control. One WHO representative in Goma told Foreign Minister Maas that hygiene standards in many Congolese hospitals were catastrophic. "You go in with malaria and come out with Ebola," he said.

To this day, 2/3rds of sick people still die from the disease there. The danger of the disease spreading on both a national and regional level is "very high," according to the situation reports published every week by the Foreign Ministry's health service.

In order to guarantee German doctors and other aid workers the best possible treatment in an emergency, the government in Berlin would like to fly them back to Germany. But there's one problem: "The federal government currently has no means of evacuating German citizens suffering from Ebola to Germany while maintaining German treatment and occupational safety standards," says Gerhard Boecken, 60, a tropical medicine specialist who has headed the Foreign Ministry's health service since 2015.

Prior to his current job, Boecken spent 8 years working in Africa. Even as a medical officer for the German navy, he pushed for a transport solution for infected soldiers.

During the 1st major Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, the government hastily commissioned Germany's flagship airline, Lufthansa, to convert an Airbus A340 for this purpose. The plane was named after the late German physician and Nobel laureate Robert Koch. In about 3 months, the eponymous German medical research institute, Berlin's Charite hospital and Lufthansa, along with the German Foreign Ministry, transformed the large-capacity Airbus aircraft into a flying, isolated intensive care unit.

But the plane got decommissioned almost a year later because it proved to be too expensive. Maintenance alone amounted to around 1 million euros [USD 1.1 million] a month, partly because a Lufthansa crew had to be on standby around the clock for emergencies.

Since then, the Foreign Ministry has been working on a plan for how to provide German aid workers with maximum protection at a reasonable cost. One idea is a mobile, modular evacuation unit.

Frank Hartmann is the Foreign Ministry's crisis management officer. The 54-year-old and his staff offer around-the-clock support to German citizens all over the world, whether they're affected by natural disasters or political earthquakes or kidnappings.
