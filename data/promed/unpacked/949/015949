Officials investigate tiger's death in Bhopal
---------------------------------
The officials investigating the death of a tiger in Bhopal's Van
Vihar national park 3 days ago have said blood samples are being sent
to laboratories to establish the exact cause of death. Gautam, the
5-year-old tiger had died Thursday [6 Dec 2007] in the park following
an illness.

According to the post-mortem report, the animal had been suffering
from various diseases like babesiosis -- a parasitic disease, severe
gastritis, liver and blood infection.

"Blood samples of the tiger are being sent to different laboratories
including those in Bhopal and Jabalpur to determine the exact cause
of death. Only after a detailed investigation we would be able to
tell more," said veterinarian A.B. Shrivastava who treated the
animal. "Blood samples of other carnivorous animals in the park are
also being sent for testing," he said.

Gautam was born in Ratapani sanctuary in Raisen district of Madhya
Pradesh and brought to Van Vihar national park 3 years ago. He was
kept in a new facility inside the park where 5 other tigers were also housed.

"He had not been well since Nov 26 and had stopped eating.
Preliminary investigations revealed he was suffering from babesiosis
-- an uncommon parasitic disease," Park Director Jasbeer Singh
Chauhan said. He said there was no negligence on the part of the
management in the treatment of the animal.

Officials said they been concerned over the frequent deaths of tigers
in the park. Now they have decided to conduct tests on other tigers
to find out whether they are also suffering from similar diseases.

Chauhan said an advanced animal disease testing centre and better
infrastructure is needed for better care of the animals.

Tiger dies of disease in Bhopal's Van Vihar National Park
------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities of Bhopal's Van Vihar National Park cremated the body of
a tiger that died due to a parasitic disease. Park authorities said
every effort was taken to save the 5-year old cub Gautam, who
succumbed to a malaria-like parasitic diseases commonly transmitted
through ticks known as babesiosis.

"Despite making our best efforts through the last week, he's been in
constant supervision. We have not been able to save him. And we have
been in constant touch with some of the best veterinarians from
across the country and have tried every treatment. But we could not
save him," said J. S. Chauhan, Park Director. Gautam was brought to
the park 3 years ago from a sanctuary in Raisen district of the State.

At least 6 tigers have died in the park in the last 18 months,
including a white tiger that died recently in October this year
[2007]. A. B. Srivasatava, a veterinarian said there was an urgent
need for the set up of an organisation that would primarily deal with
the health of the animals.

"We should have some kind of an organisation where we can deliberate
on the health of wild animals and discuss various aspects of
precautions against diseases and also their cures. Till date, we do
not have any such organisations in the country," he said.

India has half the world's surviving tigers. But the demand for tiger
skin and bone in China for making traditional medicines has severely
affected the tiger population.

There were about 40 000 tigers in India a century ago, but decades of
poaching and depletion of their natural habitat have cut their
numbers to 3700. According to some wildlife experts, the total could
actually be as low as 1,200. In September [2006], India passed new
legislation aimed at tackling the tiger crisis, providing for a
National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCS) and a Wildlife Crime
Bureau to investigate poaching and curbing the illegal trade in
wildlife parts. (ANI)

[Even though the information contained here is sketchy, this disease
may be indeed be babesiosis as the diagnosis can be made relatively
easily with a blood smear. This can be done even under the limited
laboratory conditions describe at Van Vihar national park. However,
determining the species is much harder.

Moreover, a Bengal tiger and a leopard succumbed to babesiosis in 2006: See
<http://bigcatnews.blogspot.com/2006/07/parasitic-disease-kills-tiger-leopard.html>.
The disease occurs rarely in domestic and zoo populations in the
United States. It has been reported previously in India in domestic
cats, a jagarundi and a leopard. Feline babesiosis most frequently
occurs on a regular basis in South Africa, in both domestic and wild
felids. See Barend L. Penzhorn, Anne M. Kjemtrup, Laura M.
Lopez-Rebollar, Patricia A. Conrad Babesia leo n. sp. from Lions in
the Kruger National Park, South Africa, and Its Relation to Other
Small Piroplasms The Journal of Parasitology, Vol. 87, No. 3 (Jun.,
2001), pp. 681-685

An Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology editorial makes clear the
increasing pressure that tigers are experiencing worldwide and in
India in particular. See Parija SC, Bhattacharya S. Guest editorial
the tragedy of tigers: Lessons to learn from nandankanan episode.

We hope that the definitive diagnosis of this outbreak of disease in
tigers at Van Vihar National Park can be established because it
appears that more than one tiger in this population may be infected.
Furthermore, new occurrences of disease outbreaks in threatened or
endangered populations can have intensely negative effects on small
populations of zoo species whose purpose is, ironically, to sequester
a dimishing wild gene pool.

Outbreaks of new or recurring diseases can sometimes be an
unintended consequence of trying to preserve gene pools for species,
like the tiger, which are under constant pressure. It is important to
have a forum for the rapid evolution of response and disease control
tactics when outbreaks in protected populations occur, as the guest
editorial cited above points out. We certainly hope the veterinarian
at the zoo gets support in controlling this particular outbreak. Any
updated information would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.PC]

visitors can drive through -- see

its laboratory capacity. Visitors are unlikely to come into contasct
with infexted ticks unless they leave their vehicles. - Mod.JW]
