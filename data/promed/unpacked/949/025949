Fear of anthrax outbreak gripped the district after a 6-year-old tusker died of the deadly [bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_] at Eriyapuram area in Thalawadi forest range in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) here on [Sat 28 Apr 2018].

Following this, forest officials have launched a vaccination drive in all the hamlets and villages surrounding the Thalawadi forest range.

It was local villagers who spotted the carcass of the elephant first. When alerted, forest officials examined the carcass in detail and found that the cause of was anthrax.

"We have sent the samples of vital organs such as liver, kidney and lungs to the state government's diagnostic centre in Chennai for detailed results," said a senior forest official. After the postmortem, the carcass was burned in the forest.

[The local veterinary officers in the Sathyamangalam Division are to be commended for recognising the need to vaccinate the cattle in the surrounding area to where this dead elephant was found. While elephants can graze, they are primarily browsers and therefore this elephant became infected either through haemophagic flies that had previously fed on a moribund/dead anthrax case or from necrophagic flies vomiting blood from an anthrax carcass onto nearby browse.

The history of anthrax in this area suggests that there is a background of enzootic anthrax. A proactive programme of livestock vaccination would be well worth considering.

The authorities were very wise to burn this elephant carcass -- no mean feat of its own -- as burying elephants is not without significant equipment demands.
