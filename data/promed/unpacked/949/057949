Three more horse deaths have put the toll of the equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) outbreak in Europe at 9, with all but 2 occurring in Spain. Two horses have died in Germany, 2 in Barcelona, and 5 in Valencia, the centre of the outbreak. There are now 6 countries with confirmed cases: Spain, Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Qatar. There is a case in the US, but it is not linked with the outbreak in Europe.

Late on Friday [5 Mar 2021], the FEI, horse sport's world governing body, suspended the Sunshine Tour in Vejer de la Frontera in Spain after a 2nd horse at the venue had been put into isolation after developing mild neurological signs and a slightly elevated temperature.

The 1st horse to show symptoms arrived directly from her home stables in Belgium and was fit and healthy with no symptoms. She competed for the 1st 2 weeks as normal and on the 1st day of competition in the 3rd week, Mon 22 Feb 2021.

On 26 Feb 2021, the personal veterinarian for the horse's stables notified the organising committee that one of their horses had a fever. The horse was immediately isolated at a stable complex more than 2 km from the competition venue.

"At first, the symptoms that the horse was expressing appeared to be those of piroplasmosis, and the horse was given a blood test for both piroplasmosis and for rhinopneumonitis; both results were negative," Sunshine Tour organisers said.

"Over subsequent days, both the competition vets and the FEI vets monitored the horse's fever and condition twice a day. After a few days, the fever had subsided."

The mare first showed neurological symptoms on 4 Mar 2021. The 2nd horse, who entered isolation with mild neurological symptoms late on Fri 5 Mar 2021, prompted the suspension of the remainder of the Sunshire Tour.

Both horses are in the isolation stables 2 km from the venue.

Spanish Veterinary Authorities are on site to prepare health certificates for horses departing from the show venue, and the FEI is encouraging European Federations to set up stopover or transit stabling for the estimated 1500 horses leaving competition venues from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. "Given the long distances, horses will need to rest. It is vital that the stopover/transit stabling for horses have the proper biosecurity requirements in place to minimise the risk of further transmission of EHV-1."

The French Equestrian Federation had taken the initiative to arrange stopover stabling for horses travelling through France, with the necessary biosecurity conditions with disinfection procedures and onsite veterinary support. "We urge all affected NFs to inform their athletes accordingly and to stress the importance of ensuring appropriate biosecurity measures throughout their journey and continuing on arrival home," the FEI said.

[The 1st report on the Valencia event (20210224.8211580) included a request for information about the diagnosis and about the source of infection. This has become a serious event with international ramifications. As indicated on the FEI (International Federation for Equestrian Sports) website: "This strain of EHV-1 is particularly aggressive and has already caused equine fatalities and a very large number of severe clinical cases. The science provided by the epidemiologists is clear: Stopping competition for 4 weeks is the only way to prevent the further spread of this terrible disease."

According to the said website, updated 5 Mar 2021, the following 10 European nations cancelled international events during the period 1-28 Mar 2021 due to the EHV-1 event in Valencia: France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Poland, Netherlands, Germany, and Slovakia. Other European nations have also proactively cancelled national events during this period. A detailed FEI timeline of the event, from its start on 20 Feb 2021 and as of 7 Mar 2021, please refer to https://inside.fei.org/fei/ehv-1/timeline. - Mod.AS
