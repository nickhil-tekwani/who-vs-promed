http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4225-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-18-july-2014.html


The current epidemic trend of the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia remains serious, with 67 new cases and 19 deaths reported from 15-17 Jul 2014.

Between 15-17 Jul 2014, 67 new cases of EVD, including 19 new deaths, were reported from the 3 countries as follows:
- Guinea, 0 new cases and 0 deaths;
- Liberia, 22 new cases with 10 deaths;
- Sierra Leone 45 new cases and 9 deaths.

These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspected cases and deaths of EVD. The EVD outbreak in Guinea continues to show a declining trend, with no new cases reported during this 3 day-period.

As of 17 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 3 countries stands at 1048, including 632 deaths.

The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea.

The World Health Organization has been working with national authorities and partners in the affected countries to analyse and review the current outbreak response. An assessment of the outbreak response conducted in Liberia identified several gaps and challenges. Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub-national levels.

Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistical, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Following the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone. While this team will contribute the critical human resource needs, the mission will be crucial for enhancing capacity for epidemic preparedness and response in Gambia. This mission is being supported by UNDP, Gambia, and WHO Sierra Leone.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:

- Guinea, 410 cases (301 confirmed, 95 probable, and 14 suspected) and 310 deaths (203 confirmed, 95 probable, and 12 suspected);
- Liberia, 196 cases (76 confirmed, 56 probable, and 64 suspected) and 116 deaths (54 confirmed, 40 probable, and 22 suspected);
- Sierra Leone, 442 cases (368 confirmed, 48 probable, and 26 suspected) and 206 deaths (165 confirmed, 35 probable, and 6 suspected).

Confirmed, probable, and suspected cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of 17 Jul 2014
-------------------------------------------

[2] Sierra Leone: EVD treatable
Date: 17 Jul 2014

http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/69158


The Co-founder of the West African Medical Mission (an international organization in Sierra Leone), Gabriel Pratt, has categorically condemned the manner in which the on-going Ebola virus disease sensitization is carried out in the country. Making the condemnation in an interview with this writer in his office at Macauley Street in Murray Town, Freetown, Gabriel Pratt noted that the death threat attached to the Ebola sensitization prompts people to stigmatize and ostracize patients, adding that the stigma kills faster than the disease itself. He warned health experts and the media to stop spreading the wrong message that Ebola is a death sentence, giving assurances that the disease is treatable.

Gabriel Pratt observed that since the outbreak of the dreaded disease in Guinea, and subsequently in Sierra Leone, its killing potential has been exaggerated.

[3] Sierra Leone: denial
Date: 18 Jul 2014
Source: Awareness Times, Sierra Leone [edited]
http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200525811.shtml


One of the major reasons behind the unprecedented scale of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) crisis in Sierra Leone has been the aspect of denial. The denial is visible from top to bottom. Yesterday, 17 Jul 2014, even as an ambulance raced through streets of Freetown with a dead EVD patient to be hastily buried, it was interesting to see top government cadre still in denial as to the extent of the catastrophe. Minister of Tourism Peter Bayuku Conteh yesterday asked journalists to tell potential tourists that EVD was only found "in one region" of Sierra Leone. He passionately urged journalists to report such false information as a means of making tourists comfortable to come and visit Sierra Leone. We wonder whether he knows the implication of just one tourist catching EVD here? Is it not better for tourists to stay away until we stop active viral transmission in the country?

[4] Drug development
Date: 17 Jul 2014

http://blogs.einstein.yu.edu/why-are-there-no-drugs-for-ebola-virus


The geographical complexity of the current crisis highlights one of the most crucial obstacles to successfully containing it, the reluctance of those infected to come forward. Because ebolavirus spreads through direct physical contact between infected and uninfected individuals, successful containment relies on the isolation of Ebola virus disease (EVD) patients and preventive quarantine of anyone with whom they may have come into contact. Unfortunately, in the current outbreak, many people with possible symptoms have chosen instead to shelter with their families or local communities, where they risk setting off new cycles of virus transmission.

Why are people unwilling to come forward? One of us (John Dye) interviewed over 100 survivors of previous EVD outbreaks in Uganda and asked them exactly this question. Some thought they may just have malaria or dengue, which are hard to differentiate from Ebola in the early stages, and they were afraid of contracting EVD from other infected patients when quarantined in the hospital. Others worried about the stigma that could attach to them and their families, that they might lose their jobs, or return from the hospital to find their home burnt down and belongings destroyed. Many feared they were going to the hospital to die, and to die alone, away from their families. Hanging over all of these conversations was the unspoken understanding that there was no treatment for EVD available to them. Sadly, the situation today remains the same.

While careful supportive care does indeed improve a patient's chance of survival, case fatality rates for Ebola virus disease remain extremely high, at 50-90 percent. We believe that the availability of an effective drug for EVD would save lives, not least because it would encourage infected individuals and their families to seek treatment, thus curtailing the spread of the virus.

The 1st outbreak of EVD was in 1976 -- nearly 40 years ago -- so why is there no cure yet?

Paradoxically, the last decade has seen tremendous advances in ebolavirus research. We have learned much about its behavior in nature, how the virus exploits its hosts and subverts their immune systems to multiply, and how it causes disease as a result.

In the USA, with funding from both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DoD), scientists are applying these basic discoveries to come up with new approaches to prevent and treat ebolavirus infections. For example, we are part of an NIH-funded research consortium whose goal is to develop a cocktail of antibodies -- virus-fighting immune proteins -- that could be infused into patients to block Ebola virus infection. We and others are also receiving support from the DoD to discover drugs that shut down the ability of ebolaviruses to infect human cells.

To understand why our EVD drug cupboard is still empty despite recent progress, it is important to consider how pharmaceutical drugs are typically developed. Research scientists, often in academic institutions or small biotech companies, make a discovery that suggests a possible clinical application. After laying the groundwork, they pass the baton to a company with the expertise and deep pockets necessary to carry a potential drug through the protracted, complex, and expensive process of optimization, animal testing, manufacture, and clinical trials that will (with lots of luck) culminate in regulatory approval of the drug for human use.

This is where the process stalls for "orphan" diseases like EVD. Pharmaceutical companies are understandably unwilling to invest the considerable resources needed to develop drugs against a disease that currently infects only a few thousand people every few years in resource-poor countries, especially when there is little chance they will recoup their investment, let alone turn a profit.

Our experience with HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C teaches us that once we have acquired the basic scientific knowledge, it is possible to develop antiviral drugs that save lives. Diseases like EVD should be no exception. In this case, the hurdles we face are not scientific, but rather economic and political. To bridge the gap in the drug development process, we will need new, creative models that engage governments, academia, pharmaceutical companies, private philanthropic organizations, and even individual citizens. The essence of emerging viral threats like Ebola is their transnational and unpredictable nature, and we need to be ready.

[5] Airline direct flights
Date: 18 Jul 2014
Source: All Africa [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201407181275.html


The Liberian airline industry has been hard hit in recent times with the departure of 2 world class leading airlines; 1st Air France pulled out of the country, citing low profits, and Delta Airlines is also on the verge of departing after confirming that it is pulling out of the country [at the end of August 2014] citing weak passenger demand.

According to some Liberians who have travelled with the newcomer Gambia Bird, including market women who commute between Monrovia-Accra and other African countries, the airline, commonly call G-Bird, has the newest fleet and has come at the right time on the west coast. "There will be no difference, as G-Bird makes 6 flights per week to Liberia. It has become a source of convenience for us market women between Robertsfield [Liberia] and Accra [Ghana] and other places," said one market woman. Accordingly, Gambia Bird connects passengers to dozens of West African capitals offering affordable prices, thereby making it convenient for market women and other travelers. Gambia Bird operates flights from Banjul International Airport to African ECOWAS cities with an Airbus A319 fleet. In addition, the airline operates from Banjul (Gambia) and Freetown (Sierra Leone) to London (UK) and Barcelona (Spain).

Besides Gambia Bird, Kenya Airways (KQ) makes 3 weekly flights to Robertsfield with a newly acquired fleet of aircraft and offers several links to Asia, Europe and Latin America. British Airways, which can get passengers to North America the same day by Airbus 777, is still operating flights to Liberia. Other airlines, including Royal Air Maroc and Asky Airlines, continue to provide up to the minute valuable service to Liberia.

[6] ECDC update
Date: Thu 17 Jul 2014
Source: Avian Flu Diary [edited]
http://afludiary.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/ecdc-epidemiological-update-on-ebola.html


While stressing that the risk to travelers visiting Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia remains very low and that their previously published Risk Assessment for the EU remains unchanged, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) today [17 Jul 2014] has published their latest epidemiological assessment of the ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa.

In the most recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on EVD (9 Jun 2014), experts worked out several scenarios whereby the ebolavirus might travel to the European Union:

Scenario 1: Suspicion of exposure to Ebola virus.
Scenario 2: Person presenting with symptoms compatible with EVD.
Scenario 3: Passenger with symptoms compatible with EVD on board an airplane.
Scenario 4: Patients and healthcare workers having been exposed to an unrecognised EVD patient.

However, they gave reassurances that the capacity to detect and confirm cases of EVD in the EU is considered to be sufficient and that the risk of a traveler developing the disease after returning to the EU is "extremely low."

[The emphasis in official announcements on the high death rate of EVD seems to have had the opposite effect to what was intended. Instead of prompting the public to take preventive measures, it is leading to stigmatization and ostracism of patients, which makes sick people avoid the isolation hospitals.

"To bridge the gap in the drug development process, we will need new, creative models that engage ... even individual citizens;" see [4] above. Given the high level of international concern about EVD, now might be a good time to raise funds for ebolavirus drug testing through crowd-sourcing; see: http://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2013/05/08/top-10-crowdfunding-sites-for-fundraising.

The number of airlines providing fast services to other West African countries, Europe, Asia and the Americas points to the potential risk of exporting EVD in a symptomless passenger (passengers with symptoms are unlikely to be allowed to board).

Regarding yesterday's [17 Jul 2014] story of a fake ebolavirus vaccine being distributed in and around Monrovia (the capital of Liberia) -- see ProMED archive 20140717.2618525 -- the Liberian Red Cross has denied rumours that it is involved in any way, considering that no such vaccine exists http://allafrica.com/stories/201407181227.html. - Mod.JW
