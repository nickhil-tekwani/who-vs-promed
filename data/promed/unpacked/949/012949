The anthrax outbreak in Kisumu County has been contained, county director of health Dickens Onyango said on Sunday [14 Jul 2019]. The disease has left one person dead and others hospitalised. [OO] died last Thursday [11 Jul 2019], a few hours after being admitted at Kisumu County Referral Hospital. Dr Onyango also reported that 4 people who were admitted with the disease had been discharged.

He announced that mass livestock vaccination will kick off Tuesday [16 Jul 2019] and that authorities will ensure uninspected meat is not sold to prevent another outbreak. "We have managed to contain the disease and are working closely with the veterinary department so that uninspected meat does not end up in butcheries," he told the Nation.

The 4 people fell sick after eating the meat of a cow believed to have been infected. Over the weekend, the county's disease surveillance team was dispatched to Nyamasaria and Mowlem to pick residents who consumed the meat. About 40 people were treated and discharged. Kisumu has also embarked on educating the public on the dangers of eating contaminated meat.

County director of veterinary services, Dr Evan Odhiambo, said they were discouraging residents from using illegal slaughterhouses and eating uninspected meat. "Animals must be slaughtered in ideal [locations] and the meat must be inspected before it is taken to butcheries for sale," said Dr Odhiambo.

[The blackened ulcer on the young man's finger is indicative of cutaneous anthrax, so I am presuming that this was an anthrax outbreak in the absence of any laboratory confirmation. Human cutaneous cases can be difficult to confirm in the laboratory. According to my expert colleague, Benyamin Cherkasskyi, the one-time Soviet anthrax epidemiologist, now sadly departed, one might confirm about 30% of human cutaneous cases. The chances of pulling it off increase if, using a hypodermic needle, you can extract some bloody fluid from underneath the lesion, as it pools there. Livestock cases are much easier because one can collect bloody soil from blood extravasated from the mouth or anus, or cotton swab the nasal turbinates or with forceps extract some turbinates themselves.

The 40 people treated and released presumably told the investigators that they had handled the suspect beef and were given an oral antibiotic as a precaution. And this is a group of folk who may in future remember not to purchase meat from an uninspected carcass. But people forget, which is why it is better to have at-risk cattle routinely vaccinated. And the vaccination process gives the veterinary officers the opportunity to remind the onlookers why the animals are being vaccinated against this lethal disease. - Mod.MHJ
