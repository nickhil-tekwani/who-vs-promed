B. Update 86 - Hong Kong removed from list of areas with local
transmission 23 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_23/en/>
WHO has today removed Hong Kong from its list of areas with recent
local transmission of SARS. 20 days, which is twice the maximum
incubation period, have passed since the last case was isolated on 2
Jun 2003.
When 20 days have passed since removal of the last case from the
community at large, the chain of human-to-human transmission is
considered broken, thus eliminating the risk of infection for both
local residents and travellers.
"This is a very significant achievement," said Dr David Heymann,
Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. "Hong Kong, with
its dense population and fluid border with China, had one of the
hardest outbreaks to control. This success means that the whole world
can now feel safer from the SARS threat."
SARS was first carried out of southern China into Hong Kong, and then
on to Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore in late February. Some 16
visitors and guests to the ninth floor of a Hong Kong hotel became
infected through contact, in ways that remain mysterious, with a
symptomatic medical doctor from Guangdong Province, who stayed in the
hotel's room 911. The index case for Hong Kong's first outbreak, in
the Prince of Wales Hospital, visited an acquaintance staying on the
same floor during the critical days in February. Additional clusters
were also subsequently linked to the hotel.
SARS had not yet been identified as a dangerous new disease when the
outbreak hit Hong Kong's hospitals. Doctors and nurses, unaware of
the need to isolate patients and protect themselves, became the first
victims as they struggled to save lives. In a particularly
unfortunate incident, the index patient at Prince of Wales, admitted
on 4 Mar 2003, was treated 4 times daily with a jet nebulizer, which
probably aerosolized the virus and greatly increased opportunities
for spread.
In late March [2003], Hong Kong suffered a major setback when a
large cluster, eventually numbering more than 300, of almost
simultaneous new cases was traced to a single building in the Amoy
Gardens housing state. That event, which raised the possibility of an
environmental source of infection or even airborne spread of the
virus, was investigated by teams of local specialists. The outbreak
was attributed to an "unlucky" convergence of environmental
conditions that allowed the contamination of vertically-linked
apartments. This conclusion, subsequently confirmed by additional
studies, calmed fears that the SARS virus might be airborne.
From the day when the first cluster of cases was recognized, Hong
Kong officials have provided open, honest, and abundant information
about SARS to both the public and the media. Hong Kong also benefited
from the contribution of its outstanding scientists, epidemiologists,
and clinicians, who were at the forefront of efforts to track down
source cases in the various clusters, identify the causative agent,
develop diagnostic tests, and work out treatment protocols.
Faced with the largest outbreak outside mainland China, Hong Kong
also pioneered many of the control measures used to successfully
contain smaller outbreaks elsewhere. It is gratifying that these
measures have now brought Hong Kong to the point of victory over the
virus, although continued vigilance remains vital.
On 2 Apr 2003, WHO advised the public to consider postponing all but
essential travel to Hong Kong. That recommendation was removed more
than 7 weeks later, on 23 May 2003.
C. Update 87 - World Health Organization changes last remaining
travel recommendation -- for Beijing, China 24 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_24/en/>
Effective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its
recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel
to Beijing, China. Beijing was the last area in the world to which
this advice still applied.
The recommendation to consider postponing all but essential travel to
Beijing was issued on 23 Apr 2003 in order to minimize the
international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). WHO
is changing this recommendation as the situation in the Chinese
capital has now improved significantly. The last new case in Beijing
was isolated on 29 May 2003, since when a number of suspect cases
have been considered but ruled out as SARS. No cases have recently
been exported from Beijing and all recent cases have been traced to
known chains of transmission.
"We are changing the travel advice for Beijing effective Tuesday, 24
Jun 2003," said Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the
WHO. "Beijing is the last area to which WHO recommended that people
should postpone all but essential travel. This is very good news and
shows the great progress the world has made against SARS."
Beijing, with a cumulative total of 2521 probable cases and 191
deaths, has had the largest outbreak of SARS anywhere in the world,
followed by Hong Kong, with 1755 cumulative cases and 296 deaths, and
Guangdong Province, China, with 1511 cumulative cases and 57 deaths.
For reasons that are not yet fully understood, areas of mainland
China have experienced a lower case fatality ratio than seen in most
other outbreaks.
China began daily reporting of SARS cases in early April [2003], when
Beijing reported 29 cases and 4 deaths. At the peak of the outbreak,
towards the end of April, Beijing was reporting more than 100 new
cases each day. Containment of an outbreak of such dimensions is a
tribute to the effectiveness of centuries-old control measures,
including isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, supported by
government commitment at the highest levels.
Recommendations to postpone travel have been issued following
consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of probable
SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last
dates of export of cases.
On 27 Mar 2003, WHO recommended that all areas with recent local
transmission should screen all international departing passengers to
ensure that those who are showing symptoms of SARS or have had recent
contact with a SARS patient do not travel. Since then, a number of
recommendations have been made that people should postpone all but
essential travel to areas with large outbreaks of SARS which posed a
potential threat to travellers.
More than 20 days have now passed since the last new case was
isolated in Beijing. Therefore, Beijing has also been removed from
the list of areas with recent local transmission.

No new probable cases have been reported since 15 Jun 2003. As of 24
Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 687 probable cases and
84 deaths reported. There are an additional 1474 suspected cases
reported, and 853 previously reported suspected and probable cases
have been excluded. There are graphic representations of locations
of reported cases and deaths available at the daily SARS website
update using the above given weblink address.

[As of 23 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8459
probable cases of SARS with 805 deaths reported worldwide. In the 3
days since the last WHO update, a total of 2 new probable cases have
been reported -- one from Canada and one from the United States.
According to the Health Canada website, the most recent date of onset
of probable cases in Canada is 12 Jun 2003, so the new reports
reflect delayed identification/confirmation of cases. Detailed
information on the newly reported probable case in the United States
(geographic location of case, geographic location of probable
transmission, and date of onset of illness) was not available at the
time of preparation of this update report.
Effective this AM (24 Jun 2003) there are no longer any travel
advisories worldwide related to SARS activity. Person-to-person
transmission has been interrupted in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Viet Nam. The most recent dates of onset of probable cases in Canada
is 12 Jun 2003 (12 days ago) and in Taiwan 15 Jun 2003 (9 days ago).
The most recent reports of SARS cases in both Canada and Taiwan were
related to exposure in the health care environment and not related to
exposure in the community at large; hence the absence of travel
advisories to these locations, even though they have not had 20 days
without new case reports. Both Taiwan and Ontario Canada remain on
the SARS affected location lists and will remain so until 2
incubation periods (20 days) have passed without reports of new
probable cases occurring.
Some key unanswered questions as covered in previous updates include
whether SARS will be a seasonal disease and therefore might reappear
next October/November in the Northern Hemisphere (or possible might
appear in the Southern Hemisphere shortly); Is the SARS associated
coronavirus a zoonotic disease and therefore might reoccur in humans
again, jumping from the as yet not confirmed animal host/reservoir?
What was the "true" infection rate (were there a large number of
asymptomatic or mild illness cases?). Heightened surveillance will
be necessary to identify possible new introductions of SARS
coronavirus. - Mod.MPP]
