The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has reported that equids in Riverside and San Joaquin counties have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

In a statement on its website, the department reported 16 Jun 2015 that a 12-year-old quarter horse gelding and a 12-year-old mule, both from Riverside County, attended Mule Days in Bishop, California, which took place 17-26 May 2015.

"After returning home, the quarter horse gelding spiked a fever of 106 deg F [41.1 deg C] on 30 May 2015 and exhibited neurologic signs on 4 Jun 2015 and confirmed positive for the non-neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1," the statement said. "The 12-year-old mule never spiked a fever and began coughing on [2 Jun 2015] but showed no other clinical signs."

Both are recovering under the care of their owner's private veterinarian, the CDFA said. The statement also said that an 8-year-old quarter horse gelding who did not attend Mule Days, but was a cohort to the other quarter horse gelding, developed a high fever and severe ataxia (incoordination) in the hind limbs on [4 Jun 2015].

"His condition deteriorated, and he was euthanized on [10 Jun 2015]," the statement said. "He was affected with the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1." The Riverside County facility, which is under CDFA quarantine, is home to 19 horses and mules and, at this time, there are no other affected equids on the property. The owner has been taking temperatures twice daily on all horses and mules residing there for the past two weeks.

Meanwhile, in San Joaquin County, a 13-year-old quarter horse mare tested positive for equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of EHV-1), the CDFA reported [18 Jun 2015].

"This mare did not attend Mule Days but was exposed to 2 cohort mules after they arrived home from Mule Days," the statement said. "The mules were asymptomatic (showing no signs) for EHV-1. The quarter horse mare exhibited symptoms compatible with EHV-1 beginning on [5 Jun 2015], including lethargy, fever, stocking up of her hind limbs, and severe incoordination in her hind limbs. The mare was euthanized on [14 Jun 2015]."

The mare had not been vaccinated against EHV-1 in the past 2 years. The San Joaquin County facility, which is also under CDFA quarantine, is home to 10 horses and mules. The owner has been monitoring the remaining horses' and mules' temperatures twice daily and, at this time, there are no other affected equids on the property.

Herpesvirus is a common virus that can lie dormant for long periods of time and then reactivate during a period of stress, which can result in clinical disease. While not transmissible to people, EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy. In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia, weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. - Mod.TG]
