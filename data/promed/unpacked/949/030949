The poisoning of the fish near the river Uzh of Zhytomyr province (Korosten district) can cause an ecological disaster. The consequences can be serious because the Uzh [flows into the Pripyat River,] one of tributaries of the Dniepr, a major river that flows through Kiev and other large cities of the Ukraine.

The catastrophe took place last week [4-10 Mar 2012], when fishermen discovered a large number of dead fish as a result of the contamination of the river with unknown contaminants. According to the hypothesis of the ongoing investigation, it can be the waste from the local industries. Currently experts are testing waters using chemical analysis.
