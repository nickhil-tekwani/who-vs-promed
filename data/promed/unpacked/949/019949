California state officials yesterday continued their quarantine of
raw, unpasteurized milk products produced by Organic Pastures of
Fresno because 4 children, including 2 8-year-olds in San Diego
County, became ill after consuming them.

The quarantine began 21 Sep 2006 after stool samples from 3 of the 4
youngsters revealed 0157:H7, a type of _E. coli_ bacteria. People
affected by this bacteria can suffer severe diarrhea and other
potentially fatal complications.

Mark McAfee, the owner of Organic Pastures, last week said he was
convinced the children did not acquire 0157:H7 through his company's
products, which include raw milk and cow colostrum (a high-protein
fluid secreted by the mother after the birth of her calf). Instead,
he said, the youngsters had eaten tainted spinach and a variety of
other foods that sometimes cause illness.

McAfee said state officials told him the situation would be resolved
by next week, when Organic Pastures' products would be cleared for
renewed distribution to various supermarkets and health-food stores
in California.

In an e-mail yesterday, McAfee said he could no longer discuss the
issue because state officials had imposed a "gag order" on him.

"We did not impose a gag order," Steve Lyle, spokesman for the state
Department of Food and Agriculture, wrote in a subsequent e-mail.
"The investigation continues, as does the quarantine."

One of the affected children drank colostrum; the other 3 drank raw
milk, state officials said. Two of the patients -- a 7-year-old boy
in Riverside County and a 10-year-old girl in San Bernardino County
-- remain hospitalized at Loma Linda University Medical Center.

Organic Pastures' Web site carries a statement saying the company
"has rigorous safety and testing procedures in place to ensure the
purity of our milk. We are confident that further investigation will
prove (our) products to be safe."

State officials urge people who recently purchased Organic Pastures'
raw milk products to return them to the retailer for a full refund.

"Raw Milk and Raw Milk Products as Health Food
----------
Internet and lay publications are replete with claims that raw milk
will cure diverse ailments and prevent many more (1). The
professional position regarding this claim has not changed since The
Journal of the American Medical Association published a commentary in
1984 (2). The National Council for Reliable Health Information
discussed the controversy regarding the regulation of the production
and sale of Certified Raw Milk in California (3). They referred to a
report in the Los Angeles Times that quotes a dairyman in reference
to raw milk: "`The Lord gives us everything in its wholeness, and
that's the way He meant us to keep it'" (4, p. 3).

Conclusions
---------
Raw milk and raw milk products should be avoided, unless the consumer
believes that the improved taste of the product warrants the risk.
Warning labels should appear on all raw milk and raw milk products
that clearly spell out the possible dangers, so the consumer can make
an informed choice: caveat emptor.

A vocal constituency considers raw milk and its derivatives to be
health foods and will continue to lobby for availability to ensure
the availability of those products [1, 4]. "
