[West Nile virus surveillance reports are up-dated to 27 Oct 2000. The
number of human cases remains at 18 with one death. The patient with dual
residency in New York & New Jersey is now listed under New Jersey;
therefore the distribution of cases is Connecticut 1, New Jersey 4 and New
York 13. The USDA report has not been up-dated beyond 17 Oct 2000 and
remains as reported in West Nile surveillance - USA (44). As of 23 Oct
2000, Health Canada has not confirmed any West Nile virus-positive findings
in Canada. Note that from now onwards surveillance and reporting by
National, State and City authorities will be severely curtailed - Mod.CP

On 26 Oct 2000, the State of Connecticut announced a seventh case of West
Nile virus in a horse. The horse, from Glastonbury, is recovering, and its
stable mates have shown no signs of sickness. No spraying is planned, and
mosquito trapping will conclude on October 27, with test results available
the week of 7 Nov 2000. Bird collection and reports of dead bird
sightings will conclude on November 3, with results available mid-November.

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 54 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of West Nile virus
(WNV). To date, 4 tests were positive, 29 were negative, 20 are pending and
1 individual declined testing. These individuals either had symptoms or
signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of the
symptoms and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the
virus have been discovered. New Jersey's positive human cases include an
82-year old Little Falls man who became ill September 3, was admitted to a
hospital 3 days later, and died September 14. New Jersey's other human
cases include a 43-year old Jersey City man, a 54-year old man with dual
residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park, Bergen County, and a
72-year old Bayonne woman. All three individuals have either recovered or
are recovering.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, the Department of Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton has
accepted 2014 birds for testing. A total of 1119 birds (1116 crows, a
blue jay, a great horned owl and a cockatiel) found in 18 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Atlantic (3), Bergen (196, including a great horned owl), Burlington (15),
Camden (9), Cape May (5, including a blue jay), Essex (105), Gloucester (5),
Hudson (64), Hunterdon (6), Mercer (11), Middlesex (227), Monmouth (158,
including a cockatiel), Morris (57), Ocean (24), Passaic (84), Salem (1),
Somerset (38) and Union (111) Counties.
In addition, avian testing conducted by the New Jersey Division of Fish &
Wildlife has detected WNV in wild bird specimens in 8 counties. Positive
birds have been found in Bergen (1 merlin & 1 red-tailed hawk), Cape May (1
American kestrel), Gloucester (1 red-tailed hawk), Hudson (1 crow),
Middlesex (1 blue jay), Monmouth (1 red-tailed hawk), Passaic (1 crow), and
Union (1 crow, 1 Cooper's hawk, and 1 blue jay) Counties.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing
A total of 52 mosquito pools collected in Bergen (22), Essex (2), Hunterdon
(1), Middlesex (3), Monmouth (3), Ocean (1), Passaic (11), Sussex (6), Union
(1), and Warren (2) Counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV.
In total, 14 200 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been collected by
the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by the Department
of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
Blood samples are taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all 21
counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture for the
presence of WNV. To date, 4 chickens, stationed in Essex, Middlesex, Morris
and Sussex Counties, have tested positive for WNV. The National Veterinary
Services Lab
(NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed the test results.
Horse Testing
A total of 22 horses from Atlantic (3), Bergen (1), Burlington (2), Cape May
(1), Gloucester (1), Hunterdon (1), Monmouth (7), Ocean (2), Salem (1) and
Sussex (3) Counties have tested positive for WNV. Equine testing is
conducted by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's animal health
laboratory in Trenton and results are sent to NVSL for confirmation. Seven
horse deaths have been attributed to the virus.
Late Season Surveillance & Testing Plans
As mosquito season draws to a close and the potential for WNV infection
ends, statewide surveillance and testing activities for the year will be
discontinued. Active human surveillance (a weekly hospital reporting system
of suspect human cases) will end Oct. 31, and state lab testing for WNV in
humans will end Nov. 30. Crow submissions from northern and central counties
(including Mercer and Monmouth) will end Oct. 31, and submissions from
southern counties will continue through the end of November. Routine WNV
mosquito surveillance for the season will be discontinued this week. County
government agencies, however, will continue appropriate surveillance for
general mosquito control.

live wild birds, 14 bats, 13 horses, 2 cats, 2 raccoons, 3 domestic rabbits,
3 squirrels, 1 chipmunk and 13 human cases.

Possible Additional Reservoir Hosts For West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus, which is now relatively common in Europe and the Middle
East, is carried by mosquitoes that pass it among birds, humans and other
mammals, primarily through bites. Early on, scientists here suspected that
one or more unknown players were involved in the transmission cycle [in
North America. Crows, in which the virus has a 90 to 100 percent mortality
rate, are not necessarily the best host because their deaths kill the virus
and end the cycle. "The crows are sort of collateral damage," said Stephen
C. Guptill of the U.S. Geological Survey who has been tracking the virus.
"If you're the virus, you don't want to kill off your host. You're not going
to perpetuate your cause if your reason for survival is always going to be
killed off. "So who is the real culprit here?" he said. "Who is the real
carrier of the virus? It's something other than crows. If it's not the
crows, then who is it?"
The common house sparrow became one of the early suspects in part because of
its huge numbers in urban environments, where the virus seemed to thrive,
and because sparrows had played a role in West Nile outbreaks in Egypt in
the 1950s and South Africa in the 1970s. Some sparrows have been killed by
the virus, but most apparently have not. Scientists decided to investigate.
Last year, according to Nicholas Komar, vertebrate ecologist at the
Arbovirus Disease Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Fort Collins, Colo., experts studied an array of birds in New
York City to see which ones might be harboring the infection. Sparrows came
out high on the list, Komar said last week. "Given their incredible
abundance in both urban and rural areas, it made sense that they would be a
good candidate for an important vertebrate reservoir host. "Anything can be
a host," he said. "Being a host is not that important. But some hosts will
develop high levels of virus in their bodies and be able to transmit the
virus to mosquitoes that feed on them. These are reservoir hosts. "Migrating
birds may be involved in transporting the virus but are unlikely to be
involved in local amplification of the virus," Komar said. "You need a
resident population in a certain location that will serve to amplify the
virus."
He and several colleagues decided to compare what is called the reservoir
"competence" of several bird hosts compared sparrows, pigeons and some other
bird species common to the Northeast. The birds were exposed to the bites of
virus-infected mosquitoes and their blood tested every 24 hours. Most of the
birds survived and developed antibodies. Sparrows, though, developed the
highest virus levels and maintained them for the longest time, the team
found. In at least one case, a sparrow maintained an "infectious viremia"
for 5 days, whereas the longest a pigeon maintained it was one day. "The
viremia profiles in wild birds suggest that the house sparrow is an
important candidate reservoir host for the virus, the team concluded. The
problem is, sparrows don't migrate. "We think that [there is a different
culprit that we have yet to identify." But Robert McLean, director of the
USGS National Wildlife Health Center, in Madison, Wisc., said there are
probably several culprits working as a team. Some, like the sparrow, keep
the virus cooking locally. Others, dramatically so this year, have done the
short- or long-range transportation.
