A patient diagnosed as having cutaneous (skin) anthrax was admitted to Yerevan's Nork hospital (specializing in the treatment of infectious diseases) on Saturday [26 Oct 2013], the health ministry said. It said the preliminary diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory tests.

The ministry described the case as of "moderate severity," saying the patient received necessary treatment and that there is an improvement in his health.

It said specialists of the health and agriculture ministries took necessary actions to find the source of infection. It said consumption of infected meat was a possible cause of the infection.

In early October this year [2013], 15 people in the northern and northwestern regions of Lori and Shirak were hospitalized after local health authorities suspected they were infected with anthrax. Three people in the village Artagyuh, Lori region were found on 4 Oct 2013 to have cutaneous (skin) anthrax. This caused health authorities to examine the village residents, and they discovered 8 more people suspected to be infected with the disease. Lab tests confirmed that 7 of them had cutaneous anthrax. A deeper study found that the probable cause of the infection was eating the meat of dead animals.

Several cases of animals with anthrax were reported in October 2012 in Gegharkunik province.
