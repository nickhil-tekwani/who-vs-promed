Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds), Chinese Taipei
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 6 Feb 2017 from Dr Tai-Hwa Shih, Chief Veterinary Officer, Deputy Director General, Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Council of Agriculture Executive Yuan, Ministry of Agriculture, Taipei, Chinese

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 2 Feb 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 5 Feb 2017
Reason for notification: New strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic influenza A virus
Serotype: H5N6
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Yuli Township, Hualien County
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Feb 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
_Anatidae_ (unidentified): _Anatidae_ (incognita)(_Anatidae_) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Goose (2017-hl-1)

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: The animal health authority, BAPHIQ, entrusts the Wild Bird Society of Taipei (a non-governmental organization) to conduct active surveillance of wild birds for avian influenza. One dead young goose was found on a country road in Hualien County by the Wild Bird Society of Taipei and was sent to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) on [2 Feb 2017]. H5N6 subtype HPAI was detected and confirmed by the AHRI in the evening of [5 Feb 2017]. The HA and NA genomic sequences of the virus seem to share high similarity (99 percent) with those of the virus, which has caused major outbreaks in Korea and Japan according to preliminary analysis by the AHRI. The Local Disease Control Center (LDCC) disinfected the neighboring areas of the spot where the dead goose was found and has completed clinical examination and sampling of all poultry farms (2 duck farms) within a 1-km radius of the spot. All ducks in the 2 farms are clinically healthy. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3-km radius of the index spot will also be sampled as soon as possible, and they are under intensified surveillance for 3 months to detect, if any, spread of the virus. Until [21 Feb 2017], all waterfowl of Hualien County must be slaughtered locally; no dispatch to other regions of the country is allowed.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestation; quarantine; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
_Anatidae_(unidentified) / gene sequencing / 5 Feb 2017 / Positive
_Anatidae_(unidentified) / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 5 Feb 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st time that highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza has been identified in Taiwan.

The epidemiological comments in the report note that "The HA and NA genomic sequences of the virus seem to share high similarity (99 percent) with those of the virus, which has caused major outbreaks in Korea [South Korea] and Japan according to preliminary analysis by the AHRI." See reports below.

Since January 2015 to date (6 Feb 2017), HPAI subtypes H5N8 (321 outbreaks) and H5N2 (594 outbreaks) have been spreading in Taiwan. See event summaries and updated maps at:
