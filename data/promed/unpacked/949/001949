A woman who told her doctor she had a sudden, unbelievable increase in
her sex drive (hypersexuality) died 4 days later of rabies. The 28
year old, who lived in India, complained that she felt constantly
aroused, sometimes with no stimulation at all. Her confounded
physician referred her to the Sri Gokulam Hospital and Research
Institute in Salem, Tamil Nadu. They discovered that a small bite from
a puppy 2 months earlier [had] caused the disease.

Fear of water caused by paralysis of the swallowing muscles
[hydrophobia] is widely known as a symptom of rabies. But it can also
cause hypersexuality, a result of inflammation of the brain. Peter
Costa, the communications director for the Global Alliance for Rabies
Control, said that by the time the disease reaches that stage, it is
incurable. He said: "If you've been bitten or suspect you've been
licked or scratched by an infected animal, you should seek treatment
within 24 hours."

Pet vaccination programmes have been largely successful in staving off
the disease in the United States, but around the world, between 55 000
and 70 000 people die of rabies each year, Mr Costa told LiveScience.
Most of the deaths are in children under age 15 in areas where
vaccinations are lacking. Mr Costa said: "Dogs are responsible for
more than 99 per cent of human rabies cases." He said education is the
key to halting the spread of the disease,.

The Indian woman did not seek medical attention after she was bitten
by the dog, because the bite was small, and the animal was just a
puppy. Early treatment, however, could have saved her life. Mr Costa
said: "If you've been bitten, wash the wound with soap and water for
about 10 minutes, and then seek appropriate medical treatment." If
doctors think a bite will put someone at risk of rabies, they'll
inject antibodies that fight rabies right around the wound. Then
patients get 4 vaccinations in the arm over 2 weeks.

Mr Coasta said the case of the Indian woman highlights the need for
pet vaccinations. "The public health system in the United States and
Europe has done just a tremendous job, to the point where I think
people forget why we vaccinate our animals," he said. "Rabies is just
outside the front door."

[In most cases of rabies, symptoms 1st appear one to 3 months after
infection with the virus. Early symptoms are often similar to those
seen with influenza and may include fever, headache, and general
tiredness. In addition, the infected person may experience discomfort,
numbness, or pain at the site of the bite. Progressive symptoms may
include insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis,
excitability, bizarre behaviour, hallucinations, agitation,
hypersalivation, and difficulty in swallowing.

This patient's hypersexuality can be considered an example of bizarre
behaviour. However, it has been observed that in the prodromal phase
of the disease, there may be both incontinence and abnormal
stimulation of the sex organs.
