Glanders detected in donkey near Texas-Mexico border
----------------------------------------------------
A stray donkey that crossed from Mexico into Texas has tested positive for glanders, a highly contagious disease that primarily affects equines, the Southwest Farm Press reported this week.

The bacterium that causes glanders, _Burkholderia mallei_, has been classified by the US government as a category B bioterror agent, meaning it can be transmitted fairly easily but has a lower mortality rate than a category A agent.

The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) reported that a mounted US Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspector corralled 5 Mexican donkeys just north of Presidio, Texas, near the Rio Grande, according to the story. The animals were isolated in USDA holding pens in Presidio, and one of them later tested positive for glanders.

"It is imperative that we remain vigilant in protecting our borders from disease intrusions such as glanders," said Dee Ellis, DVM, state veterinarian and TAHC director, told the newspaper. "Early detection of glanders and the immediate quarantine of these donkeys was critical in preventing and protecting against the spread of this foreign disease."

The TAHC is working closely with the USDA to monitor the situation along the border, the story said. Equine glanders was eliminated from the United States in 1942, and the last human case in the country was in 1934.

[2] Brazil (Espirito Santo), horses

A disease considered rare and dangerous for horses, mules and donkeys was confirmed again in Espirito Santo [state]. Known as glanders, the disease is caused by bacteria and only in rare cases is transmitted to cats [including zoo lions and tigers -- see ProMED archive from 2011 - Mod.JW], dogs and humans. According to the Agricultural and Forest Protection Institute of Espirito Santo (IDAF), currently there are 3 outbreaks of infectious disease in the state.

IDAF confirmed an outbreak in Dr. Pedro Fontes Equine Breeding Center in Cariacica, a place that houses part of the military police squad. The other 2 glanders foci are located on private property in Viana and Guarapari. All these properties remain quarantined.

The focus is only considered closed after 2 negative results for consecutive glanders, with an interval of 45-90 days, performed in all animals of the properties. IDAF is reportedly sending guidelines that reinforce prevention and disease control methods for the agency's offices throughout the state.

On 31 Mar [2015], IDAF was notified of the occurrence of 2 possible cases of the disease in the 65 horses of the Regiment of Mounted Police in the municipality of Serra. These animals did not show any symptoms and were detected thanks to mandatory testing that is done every time the animals need to be transported within or outside the state.

In Brazil, 18 states have foci of glanders, and glanders disease incidence is notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), which recommends in such cases the sacrifice of the animals. This procedure was adopted in accordance with Regulations of the Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Supply (MAPA).

Military Police horses infected with glanders will be sacrificed in Espirito Santo
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 Military Police horses will be euthanized after being infected with glanders. All police horses are in quarantine since 31 Mar [2015]. The disease is caused by bacteria that infect horses, donkeys and mules and can be transmitted to humans.

The Agricultural Protection Institute (IDAF) awaits the outcome of examination of the 65 horses of the Sierra Breeding Center. According to the head of the Animal Health Protection and Inspection Department (IDAF), Fabiano Fiuza, the institute has 2 main suspects for how the disease infected the police horses. In 2014, 2 horses spent 6 months training with the army in Rio de Janeiro. In addition, in 2013, an outbreak of glanders in the police Cavalry of Espirito Santo contaminated 25 horses.

The past 2 years, 51 horses infected by glanders were sacrificed in the state; 25 were military police horses. The Police said mounted police will be replaced by motorcycle or car police where there were horseback patrols.

[4] Brazil: OIE reports 2014
Date: Mon 27 Apr 2015
From: Cristina Ramirez David <c.ramirezmatus@gmail.com> [edited]


The last OIE follow-up report sent by Brazil was in July 2014 (follow-up No. 8). In follow-up reports No. 7 and No. 8, no new outbreaks or cases are reported.

When one checks the WAHID Event Summary link, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=11974, the map shows only outbreaks reported in the immediate notification reports and in the follow-up reports. Based on these reports, there are 14 outbreaks, of which 2 are considered to be "continuing."

However, when one checks the semestral reports which Brazil has submitted, for the 1st semester of 2014 (which is the last available report), 57 new outbreaks were reported, yielding a total of 59 active outbreaks (57 new ones plus the 2 continuing from 2013): http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2014&semester=1&wild=0&country=BRA&this_country_code=BRA&detailed=1.

When a disease has become endemic in a zone, or to the entire country, that country has the option of reporting the events using the semester reports. I believe that this has been the case in this situation for Brazil. What does not "fit" is the fact that in its follow-up report for July 2014, no new cases are reported, even though there seem to be a number of new cases reported in their semester report. A final report would be helpful, indicating the current disease situation and mentioning that future information will be provided in semestral reports.

[The disease, one among the oldest known and prevalent worldwide, is currently eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries. Recently, the disease appears to be re-emerging, and has been reported in Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, UAE and countries of Africa -- see ProMED archive from 2014 below.

There is a comprehensive description of glanders in: http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/glanders/overview_of_glanders.html?qt=glanders&alt=sh#Diagnosis.

Some trivia:
- The disease was 1st described by Aristotle;
- In 1664, it was recognized as highly contagious;
- In the early 19th century, the zoonotic potential was described;
- After being eradicated in the USA in 1934, a human case was reported in 2000 in a researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute (USAMRIID) -- see ProMED archive from 2000 below;
- The agent was used as a biological weapon in animals during World War I in Europe and Russia. - Mod.RNA (in Portuguese, trans. Mod.JW)
