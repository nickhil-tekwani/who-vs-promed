Kyasanur Forest Disease, transmitted to humans via ticks, may have found its way to Maha

Already beleaguered by intrusive development and biodiversity issues, the Western Ghats may now be at risk of being inundated with disease-bearing ticks. Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a viral haemorrhagic fever already established in Karnataka, has shown new activity focus in Kerala, prompting fears that some areas of Maharashtra, especially near the southern border, may also be at risk.

KFD transmits to humans via tick bites and has a morbidity of 2 to 10 per cent. Symptoms include high fever with frontal headaches followed by haemorrhagic symptoms such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat and gums, as well as gastro-intestinal bleeding. The disease was 1st reported in 1957 from Kyasanur forest in Karnataka, from which it derives its name. Ticks harbouring KFD can be found on squirrels, porcupines, rats and shrews. They are also found on tips of leaves of shrubs growing in forests.

"Tribals who live in the forest, or people who frequently visit, such as forest staff or trekkers, are usually at risk of contracting disease. The disease was previously reported from 5 districts in Karnataka but now is also being observed in Kerala," said Dr Pragya Yadav, a scientist at the National Institute of Virology's (NIV) bio-safety level 4 laboratory.

Shedding light on why Maharashtra might be at risk, Dr Devendra Mourya, director of NIV, Pune, revealed that a few years ago, a case of KFD was confirmed at Gulbarga. "So far, this disease has been reported mostly in the Western Ghats areas that fall in Karnataka. However, we cannot deny the possible risk of KFD spreading to bordering states such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu," said Yadav added.

The Kerala Case
---------------
The 1st case confirmed from Mallapuram, Kerala, was reported last year [2014]. The patient was a tribal woman suffering from severe myalgia, bleeding gums and hematemesis. Following the detection of the anti-KFD IgM antibody in the referred serum sample of the patient, a proactive field investigation was undertaken in the area, which substantiated the presence of KFD [virus] activity.

At the beginning of this year [2015], there was an outbreak of KFD in Kerala with around 50 cases, some of which were fatal. During this outbreak, the virus was detected in ticks in the area as well as in 4 dead monkeys from Wyanad district.

"Whenever monkeys die due to KFD, it is an indicator that such infected ticks are present in the forests. Monkeys are highly susceptible to the virus, which is why it is locally know as monkey fever," Mourya added. He strongly advised people venturing into forested areas to take the KFD vaccine or apply tick repellant, since spraying insecticide in forested areas is impossible.

Perhaps one of the groups most at risk is trekkers. Onkar Oak, leader of a group called the Range Rovers, said, "We always instruct trekkers to wear full-length pants and full-sleeved t-shirts. Insect bites are common on treks, and protection is of utmost importance. Moreover, people should take care not to touch unknown plants."

[KFD virus is actively transmitted this year (2015) and appears to be spreading to new localities. As noted in the comments on the ProMED-mail post of 11 Mar 2015 (archive no. 20150312.3225579), Karnataka and "Kerala states are endemic for KFD virus, which is being actively transmitted this season. An 18 Feb 2015 report indicated that human cases there had reached 40 suspected and 18 confirmed infections in just 3 weeks. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case-fatality rate is from 3 to 5 percent for KFD (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html).

"In addition to Kerala state, KFD virus is endemic in several areas in India. Antibody surveys carried out by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune found antibodies against KFD virus in human blood samples collected from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150107.3077479). There have been previous reports of KFD cases in several areas in Kerala state and adjoining Karnataka state last year (2014). As noted in the ProMED-mail post of 4 Mar 2014 (archive no. 20140304.2313813), the disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state), where it is endemic. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

"Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family."
