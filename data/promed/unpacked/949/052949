JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS - BELGIUM EX CHINA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

We've recently learned about a 10-year-old Belgian girl who stayed
for 2 weeks in July 2004 with her parents in Shanghai, China (no
further details yet available). The family lived there as expatriates
for a few years, in good living accommodations in an urban area, with
no excursions to rural outskirts as far as we know. We will make
further inquiries regarding whether the family visited rural areas,
spending nights in rudimentary accommodations during the 2 weeks the
girl was visiting.
Mid-July 2004: flu-like syndrome, becoming worse, hospitalization
after a few days with a syndrome of viral encephalitis; in China no
specific diagnosis was made. Serology for Herpes (IgG and IgM) and
for JE (IgM) were negative in Shanghai, and they said JE was also
excluded. The best possible modern care was given, and the girl went
back home (to Shanghai) with some neurological sequelae.
Mid-August 2004: the neurological symptoms became dramatically worse,
and she was repatriated to Belgium.
In Belgium the serology for Herpes varicella/zoster en Herpes simplex
(IgG) positive - (resp. 3880 en 4193) - PCR LCR negative - no data on
IgM serology. Presumptive treatment for Herpes encephalitis was
begun. Serology for JE when in Belgium : 24 Aug 2004: IgG = 32 - IgM
= 256; 2 Oct 2004 IgG = 256 and IgM = 32 (serology performed in the
lab of Prof. A. Osterhaus, Rotterdam). Afterwards serologic tests
showed declining IgM and increasing IgG titers = recent
seroconversion for JE (some crossreaction with dengue-IgG-serology,
but dengue-IgM-serology remained negative)
This is a remarkable story; to become infected with JEV within 2
weeks (!!) after arriving in a modern urban area in China (!!)
We know that vaccination against JEV is routine in parts of the
country: Japanese Encephalitis at 8, 18-24 months & 6 years; only in
part of country [currently under discussion to integrate into EPI
nationwide] -- so there may be an "epidemiological silence" in the
region of Shanghai, because of good vaccination coverage.

Comments about the local JE epidemiology by the colleagues from China
or those with experience in JE and China, are welcome.
From now on, we will advise to all expatriates going to live within
the endemic areas -- even in urban areas (see CDC-map) -- to
consider vaccination and to always take personal precautions against
mosquitoes (the last part of this advice has been standard for many
years).

[Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne arboviral infection, is
endemic to most of Asia, where it is the leading cause of viral
encephalitis. 30 000 - 50 000 sporadic and epidemic cases of JE are
reported annually from this area, including from China, Korea, Japan,
Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of Oceania. The
virus is transmitted in an enzootic cycle among mosquitoes and
vertebrate- amplifying hosts, chiefly domestic pigs and Ardeid
(wading) birds (1). Culex mosquitoes, primarily _Cx,
tritaeniorhynchus_, are principal vectors. The mosquito breeds in
flooded rice fields, marshes, and standing water around planted
fields. Viral infection rates in the mosquitoes range from less than
1 to 3 percent. These species are prolific in rural areas, where
their larvae breed in ground pools and especially in flooded rice
fields. All elements of the transmission cycle are prevalent in rural
areas of Asia, and human infections occur principally in this
setting. Infection leads to overt encephalitis in only 1 of 20 to
1000 cases. Encephalitis usually is severe, resulting in a fatal
outcome in 25 percent of cases and residual neuropsychiatric sequelae
in 30 percent of cases (1,4). The incubation period is usually from 5
to 15 days. In areas where JE is endemic, annual incidence ranges
from 1 to 10 per 10 000 (6). Children less than 15 years of age are
principally affected.
The index female patient aged 10 years of Belgian origin contracted
JE (later laboratory-confirmed) within 2 weeks of arriving in
Shanghai, where the setting is typically urban and modern. Although
JE is endemic and seasonally epidemic in rural areas, JE cases
occasionally are reported from urban locations, because multiplying
hosts, such as pigs and agricultural activities may be situated
within and at the periphery of cities. The patient arrived with her
parents from Belgium in July 2004, right in the middle of the
JE-prevalent season (from May to September in the temperate
zone)(2-5).
Risk of acquiring JE among most travelers to Asia is extremely low;
however, the risk for an individual traveler is highly variable and
depends on factors such as the season (mentioned above), locations
and duration of travel, and the person's activities. According to the
CDC, a crude estimate, based on the number of outbound airline
passengers to Asia, suggests that the risk of acquiring JE among U.S.
travelers is less than 1 per million annually.
More information about JE endemicity and the related studies would
definitely be welcomed by ProMED.
