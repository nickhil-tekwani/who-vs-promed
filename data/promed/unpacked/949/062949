Another death from bird flu reported in Viet Nam
-------------------------------------------------
A man suffering from bird flu [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] is in critical condition in southern Viet Nam, health officials said on Tuesday [28 Feb 2012]. The 22-year-old from Binh Duong province is the 4th person to contract the virus this year, sparking fears that the deadly avian virus could be returning in force. The man caught the virus reportedly after eating a meal that contained duck blood.

So far, 2 others in the area have already died as a result of the virus as health authorities continue to scramble to contain the virus in South Viet Nam. The victim was 1st taken to hospital on 17 Feb 2012 with a high fever and respiratory failure. Tests showed he had contracted the H5N1 strain of the virus. He is thought to have caught the virus from a meal of duck blood pudding, a kind of noodle soup that is served with pieces of congealed blood.

On Sunday [26 Feb 2012], the Animal Health Department raided shops in the patient's hometown illegally trading in live poultry and slaughtering birds, the newspaper Viet Nam News reported. The area around his home was also disinfected. The department has prepared 1.2 million doses of vaccine against the virus which it will start using on Thursday [01 Mar 2012].

There have been 121 confirmed human H5N1 infections and 61 deaths in Viet Nam since the virus 1st appeared in the country in 2003. The virus can be passed to humans who come in contact with uncooked poultry or poultry feces.

[This case is being reported as the 4th case of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection in Viet Nam this year and the 121st case overall. However the history of this case has similarities to that of the 3rd case as described in the preceding post (Avian influenza, human (23): Viet Nam (BD) 20120226.1053320). The sex, age, date of hospitalisation and place of residence of the presumptive 3rd and 4th cases are identical. In the description of the preceding (3d) case however, there is no mention of a duck blood pudding as the source of infection.

Clarification and confirmation from a WHO-accredited laboratory are awaited.

Binh Duong is a province of Viet Nam. It is located in the southeastern part of the country, immediately to the north of Ho Chi Minh City. It can be located the map of the provinces of Viet Nam at http://www.rivervet.com/mapprovinces.htm. - Mod.CP
