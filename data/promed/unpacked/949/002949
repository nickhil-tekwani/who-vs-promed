Dutch authorities on Thursday [12 May 2011] said they would destroy
8800 chickens at an organic poultry farm in central Netherlands after
the discovery of bird flu, the 2nd such case in 2 months.

60 farms within a 3 km (2 mile) radius of the farm in Kootwijkerbroek
[map at http://healthmap.org/r/0Q7x] were to be screened, and tests
were expected to show on Friday [13 May 2011] whether the H7 strain of
bird flu detected was highly pathogenic, the government said in a
statement.

"We will only cull more animals if the strain discovered turns out to
be highly pathogenic," a spokesman for the Dutch ministry for economic
affairs, agriculture and innovation said.

The ministry has banned the transport of poultry, eggs and manure
within the 3-km zone and urged commercial farms in the area to keep
birds indoors.

In its highly pathogenic form, H7 bird flu can kill large numbers of
birds and occasionally infect people, although it is rarely fatal in
humans.

In March 2011, some 127 500 egg-laying hens were culled on a farm in
the southern Netherlands after the H7 bird flu strain was detected,
but tests later revealed it to be a low-pathogenic variant.

The Netherlands produces around 9.7 billion eggs annually, more than
7 percent of the European Union's production. Germany buys 2/3rds of
its egg exports.

An outbreak of the H7N7 avian flu strain in 2003 led the Netherlands
to destroy 30 million birds, about 1/3rd of its poultry flock.

According to OIE's Terrestrial International Animal Health Code, all
influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype that are not highly
pathogenic are regarded as Notifiable Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza;
for further details, please refer to chapter 10.4 of the Code at
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm.

For the Dutch policy regarding LPAI, see items 3 and 4 in posting 20060504.1287.

It may be assumed that the infected organic unit was a layer flock;
were the birds kept outdoors? If so, this would be a situation making
the birds prone to exposure to wild water birds (and to infection). -
