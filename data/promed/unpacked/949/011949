The Department of Health (DOH) in Cordillera advised the public to remain vigilant after 23 suspected anthrax cases were reported in Abra after people ate meat from a double dead [see Mod. comment below] dead carabao.

Reports from Abra health officials revealed that from 17-24 Jan 2013, suspected anthrax cases increased from 12 to 23, respectively. Health officials said the cases were in the barangays of Cayapa, Bacooc, and Paganao in Lagangilang, Abra. Reports gathered by the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU) revealed that a majority of the patients were males, including 3 children, with an age range of 2 to 57 years old. Two were admitted to Abra Provincial hospital but were discharged after 4 days.

The patients exhibited signs and symptoms similar to anthrax, which include skin lesions, muscle pain, itchy skin, headache, fatigue, stomach pain, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, and dry cough. Specimen samples from the suspected anthrax cases were sent to Manila for laboratory confirmation.

DOH-Cordillera Assistant Regional Director Dr. Pangilinan said the Provincial Epidemiology Surveillance Unit of Abra is coordinating with the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the concerned municipality for appropriate action and surveillance on the suspected anthrax cases. The department is still awaiting results of the specimen sent for laboratory confirmation.

Although anthrax infection in humans is treatable when detected early, Pangilinan said the public must refrain from eating contaminated meat, especially the meat of double [see below] dead animals.

In 2010, health officials declared an outbreak of anthrax in the municipality of Villaviciosa in Abra after 38 cases were confirmed positive. All patients were said to have eaten meat of butchered carabaos that died of unknown causes; however, no deaths were recorded.

[The previous report -- 20130124.1513285, see below -- came from this news report: http://www.philstar.com/nation/2013/01/24/900646/anthrax-downs-10-farmers-abra, which said that the contaminated meat came from a "double death," which I took to mean 2 dead carabao. I have since been informed by a knowledgeable colleague that a "double death" can mean a single animal that arrived dead at the slaughter house, and, to get it onto the slaughter-line, has had its throat cut to cover that it had died earlier. As anthrax is commonly experienced as acute death, this explanation has a measure of probability.
