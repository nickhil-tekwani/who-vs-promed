The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreak continues to spread across North America, dashing hopes that warmer temperatures would halt the spread. The California Department of Food and Agriculture reported a commercial poultry flock of 34 000 birds in Fresno County detected bird flu. This is the 1st commercial flock infected in the state since the outbreak started in the United States in January [2022].

The birds at the commercial broiler breeder in Fresno were immediately euthanized to protect surrounding commercial flocks.

H5N1 infections in both wild bird species and poultry are continuing around the country at a time when the virus should've peaked because of warmer weather. So far this year [2022], 40 million wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry, and backyard or hobbyist flocks have been infected by the deadly virus in 39 states.

Here are the latest reported outbreaks with multiple cases up and down the West Coast [see source URL for table listing these outbreaks].

"Whether migratory birds will cause additional introductions in the fall is 'the million-dollar question,'" Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center, told Science (https://www.science.org/content/article/we-re-nervous-deadly-bird-flu-may-be-north-america-stay). Even though infections began to decline before summer, Richards said bird flu could circulate year-round, posing a permanent threat to poultry farming.

So what does this mean for consumers? We outlined months ago US egg production plunged to a 7-year low as millions of egg-producing hens were euthanized to prevent further virus transmission, sending egg prices at the supermarket sky-high.

Bird flu has returned to the Midwest earlier than authorities expected after a lull of several months, with the highly pathogenic disease being detected in 2 commercial turkey flocks in western Minnesota and a hobby flock in Indiana, officials said Wednesday [31 Aug 2022].

The disease was detected after a farm in Meeker County reported an increase in mortality last weekend, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health said. The flock was euthanized to stop the spread. The board later reported a 2nd flock in the county tested positive Tuesday evening [30 Aug 2022].

They were the 1st detections of avian influenza in Minnesota since 31 May 2022, when a backyard flock was struck in Becker County. Indiana's case was its 1st since a backyard flock there tested positive on 8 Jun 2022, which had been the last detection in the Midwest before this week.

However, there have been several detections in western states in July and August [2022], including California, where a half-dozen commercial farms have had to kill more than 425 000 chickens and turkeys since last week. There have also been cases in Washington, Oregon and Utah, plus a few in some eastern states.

"While the timing of this detection is a bit sooner than we anticipated, we have been preparing for a resurgence of the avian influenza we dealt with this spring," said Dr. Shauna Voss, the board's senior veterinarian. "HPAI is here and biosecurity is the 1st line of defense to protect your birds."

The Indiana State Board of Animal Health reported a small hobby flock of chickens, ducks and geese in northern Indiana's Elkhart County tested presumptively positive on Tuesday [30 Aug 2022], though final confirmation from a federal lab was pending.

Across the country, according to the US Department of Agriculture, 414 flocks in 39 states have been affected since February [2022], costing producers over 40 million birds, mostly commercial turkeys and chickens. The disease has struck 81 Minnesota flocks this year [2022], requiring the killing of nearly 2.7 million birds. Minnesota produces more turkeys annually than any other state.

This year's outbreak contributed to a spike in egg and meat prices, and killed an alarming number of bald eagles and other wild birds. It also affected some zoos. It appeared to be waning in June [2022], but officials warned then that another surge could take hold this fall.

The disease is typically carried by migrating birds. It only occasionally affects humans, such as farm workers, and the USDA keeps poultry from infected flocks out of the food supply. A widespread outbreak in 2015 killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly one billion dollars.

[3] North Dakota (Cass County): backyard flock

https://www.agweek.com/news/poultry-events-suspended-in-north-dakota-after-new-avian-influenza-case-confirmed


The North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial, backyard flock in Cass County, North Dakota. The detection triggers the suspension of poultry/bird events across the state. If no new cases emerge in 30 days, the suspension will be automatically lifted.

More than 40.57 million domestic and commercial birds have died this year [2022] due to avian influenza, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS). Neither the new North Dakota case nor a case reported in Minnesota had been added to the USDA database by the afternoon of 31 Aug 2022.

The State Board of Animal Health and the North Dakota Department of Agriculture say they are working closely with USDA-APHIS and local officials in the response. The premises have been quarantined and the flock is being depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system. Owners of domestic birds in a 10-kilometer (6.2 mi) zone around the affected farm are being instructed to prevent contact between domestic poultry and wild birds and to monitor their flocks closely for illness to prevent the spread of HPAI.

"While we hoped there would not be additional cases this fall, due to the extensive involvement wild birds played in the spread of disease this year [2022], we knew it was possible," State Veterinarian Dr. Ethan Andress said. "The suspension of poultry/bird events is a precaution to reduce the risk of further spread of avian influenza to North Dakota birds."

There is no immediate public health concern due to this finding. The risk to people from HPAI is low despite the disease often being fatal for birds.

"As farmers take to the fields this fall, they should avoid contact with sick or deceased wild birds and change out of field clothes or boots when caring for their own poultry," Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said.

Avian influenza infects many species of wild birds and can be transmitted by direct contact with infected birds or contaminated food or water. Sick and dead wild birds should be reported to North Dakota Game and Fish at https://gf.nd.gov/wildlife/diseases/mortality-report.

More information about avian influenza is available at https://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/avian-influenza and from the USDA-APHIS at https://www.aphis.usda.gov. Subsequent detections of HPAI in North Dakota will be posted on https://www.nd.gov/ndda/hpai.

https://www.wkbn.com/news/ohio/highly-contagious-bird-flu-found-in-2-ohio-counties/


A highly contagious bird flu has been detected in 2 Ohio counties, according to the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA). The highly pathogenic avian influenza was found in a backyard flock in Ashland County and a commercial chicken flock in Defiance County and confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

No human cases in the United States have been detected in connection to the most recent cases, according to the release. The last US human case reported was in May 2022. The CDC says there is no immediate public health concern at this time.

The highly contagious virus spreads quickly and can be fatal to flocks and devastating to poultry owners, infecting poultry like chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. It's also carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds.

The grounds where the cases were found have been quarantined, and the "birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease," the release said.

Although the virus cannot be transmitted through properly cooked meats or eggs, products from any HPAI-affected flocks are prohibited from entering the food system, according to USDA. Just remember, as a general food safety precaution, to cook all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F.

Here are some guidelines from ODA to help curb the spread of bird flu:

- Prevent contact with wild birds and waterfowl by keeping birds indoors when possible.
- Keep visitors to only those who care for your poultry.
- Wash your hands with soap and water before and after contact with live poultry.
- Use disposable boot covers and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock.
- Establish a rodent and pest control program.
- Do not use surface water for drinking or cleaning but instead use drinking water from a contained source.
- Clean and disinfect equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility including trucks, tractors and tools.
- Look for signs of illness: monitor egg production, discoloration and/or swelling of legs, wattles and combs, labored breathing and reduced feed/water consumption.

https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-09-07/bird-flu-forces-egg-farm-to-euthanize-3-million-chickens


An outbreak of bird flu has led to the deaths of 43 million chickens and turkeys this year [2022] across the United States has been found at a giant egg-laying operation in Ohio, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday [7 Sep 2022].

The case confirmed over the weekend in Ohio's Defiance County has affected roughly 3 million chickens, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The egg-laying farm has started euthanizing all of its flock, said Dennis Summers, the state's veterinarian.

The highly pathogenic disease (HPAI) has returned to the Midwest earlier than authorities expected after a lull of several months with cases in Indiana, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin within the past week. There also have been several detections in western states over the summer.

The disease is typically carried by migrating waterfowl, such as geese and ducks, Summers said. It only occasionally affects humans, such as farm workers, and the USDA keeps poultry from infected flocks out of the food supply.

The outbreak earlier this year [2022] contributed to a spike in egg and meat prices appeared to be waning in June, but officials warned then another surge could come back this fall.

[While it is sad to see a resurgence in this disease, it was not unexpected. Our 1st wave came from the south to the north with the spring migration of birds. Now it is autumn and the migration from the north to the south is beginning. Generally the migratory birds are unaffected or very little affected, but our commercial, backyard, and hobby birds are very much at risk.

It is time to upgrade your biosecurity. The things you did in the spring to protect your flocks are again very much needed. Limit visitors, wear clean coveralls and boots in each barn, blow your nose, then wash your hands prior to entering a barn. These things apply regardless of the size of your operation. If your birds are outside, bring them in. Prohibit contact between your domestic birds and wild birds. This includes water, such as drinking water and even ponds or stream or lakes. Protect your birds. - Mod.TG
