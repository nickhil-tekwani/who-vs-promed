The number of dengue cases in November of this year [2009] has
greatly increased, and there is now an epidemic situation, according
to information from the coordinator of Health Surveillance, Ana Lucia
Lyrio de Oliveira. In November 2009, 481 dengue cases were recorded,
whereas in this same period last year [2008], the number was 110.
During the entire last year [2008], there were 1800 dengue cases,
whereas in 2009, the recorded cases reached 2500.

According to the coordinator, an epidemic situation is reached when
the number of expected cases is surpassed. The expected quantity of
expected reported cases is 250, and this number was almost doubled in
November this year [2009]. A comparison [of November] with the month
of October 2009 also shows a considerable increase in the number of
cases, with the number that month [being] 181 cases. The reason for
the increase in November 2009 cases is related to climate factors and
the return of [dengue virus] serotype 1, which came from Bolivia,
stated the coordinator.

"An epidemic is when there is a greater number of cases than
expected. What hurt [this November 2009] was the hot weather combined
with the frequent rains, leaving an environment conducive to the
spread of the disease [reproduction of the dengue virus vector
mosquito]. Furthermore, we had a return of [dengue virus] serotype 1,
which increased the cases also, showing that people are [the
population is] more susceptible," said the coordinator.

Another problem pointed out by the coordinator is the lack of public
awareness, and the public, despite [information] campaigns, continues
to act negligently on the issue [of vector control]. The region
causing the greatest concern is the eastern region, which includes
the Taruma, Coophavilla, and part of Aero Rancho neighborhoods. In
order to contain the number of cases, joint efforts are being made
with vehicles for fumigation.

"There are people who are unaware [of mosquito breeding]; this
results in a person creating [mosquito] breeding sites for an entire
neighborhood, so now we are making joint efforts to fumigate with
vehicles. But use of these vehicles shows that dengue is spreading,
because we are combating the adult insect and not the larvae," stated
the Coordinator.

In November [2009], (health) Minister Jose Gomes Temporao said in
Campo Grande that Mato Grosso do Sul will be included in a program to
combat dengue. He came to the capital to launch the campaign "Brazil
United Against Dengue." According to him, up to December [2009], R
1.02 billion [USD 586 million] will be appropriated to combat dengue
in the state.

From January-August of this year [2009], 12 441 cases of the disease
[dengue] were reported, triple the number reported for the same
period last year [2008], when 4065 cases were reported. The state is
moving in the opposite direction of the country, since the number of
cases here in the state tripled, while the in rest of the country,
the disease fell by 79.2 percent compared to the period from January
to August last year [2008].

According to the Ministry of Health, the [dengue] situation is
critical in 7 cities of Mato Grosso do Sul: Bonito, Campo Grande,
Corumba, Coxim, Dourados, Ponta Pora, and Tres Lagoas.

From the beginning of this year [2009] up to the 1st days of
December 2009, more than 1450 cases of [dengue] disease have been
reported. "We are reporting nearly 150 cases of the disease per
month, and this is worrying," said the chief of endemics in Cacoal,
Flaviano Melo Flaviano. According to Flaviano, Health is not the only
[unit] to advance the combat against the dengue mosquito; the
community also needs to play its part as well as the public and
private sectors, which must unite their actions to reduce the
incidence in the municipality.

The rate of people infected with dengue in Cacoal is daunting,
requiring an urgent solution to the problem, says the president of
the Cacoal City Council, Luiz Carlos Katatal, who believes that a
meeting with the environmental authorities, police, health, schools,
universities, society, and the media can be organized for urgent
action to raise awareness in the community.

DHF has killed 2 people in Caceres (225 km [140 mi] west of Cuiaba),
bringing to 5 the number of deaths in the city in a month.

In Mato Grosso, there are now 48 fatalities from [dengue] disease. Of
the 1912 new [dengue] cases recorded in the past week [week of 28 Nov
2009], 186 are residents of Caceres. The city has had a decline in
the [_Aedes aegypti_] household infestation rate from 3.5 to 2.4,
according to municipal Epidemiological Surveillance, but the number
of ill people has not stopped growing.

The Ministry of Health placed Caceres among the 10 municipalities in
Brazil with risk of a dengue outbreak, after a rapid survey index of
_Aedes aegypti_ this year [2009], noting that 4.7 percent of the
buildings of the city have larvae of the mosquito vector of the
disease [virus]. The number is higher than considered ideal, [which
is] less than one percent.

A 45-year-old man has died of dengue in the capital, taking the toll
due to the mosquito borne disease to 3 in the city, the health
department said on Wednesday [2 Dec 2009].

"The man, a resident of Karawal Nagar in east Delhi, was admitted to
St Stephen's Hospital on 21 Nov [2009] and was diagnosed to be
suffering from dengue. He died 30 Nov 2009. His death due to dengue
was confirmed today [Wed 2 Dec 2009]. With this, the official toll in
Delhi is 3," Debashish Bhattacharya, state nodal officer for dengue
cases, told IANS.

With 12 new dengue cases reported on Wednesday [2 Dec 2009], the
tally of those affected by the disease crossed the 1100 mark. "There
were 12 new cases reported on Wednesday. The cumulative total number
of cases is 1106 now," the official added.

Earlier, 2 people died of dengue in Delhi, a 15-year-old boy and a
9-year-old boy.

With the onset of winter, the health department is hoping that the
number of dengue cases will drop, since the breeding of the carrier
mosquito cannot occur below 15 deg C [59 deg F].

Last year [2008], the national capital reported 2 dengue deaths and a
total of 1312 cases.

Warm winters thus far in southern Taiwan have brought a dengue fever
epidemic, the Taiwan authorities of the Health Department report. An
official command center was set up for the dengue fever epidemic. So
far this year [2009] there have been 648 local cases with 2 deaths.
The epidemic will be the most severe test next year [2010].

According to a Taiwan's Central News Agency report, the Taiwan
authorities of the Department of Health, Deputy Secretary for Disease
Control, Zhou Zhihao said today [7 Dec 2009] that this year's [2009]
local [dengue] fever is concentrated in Kaohsiung City and Pingtung
County, namely, Kaohsiung City 438 cases, Kaohsiung County 81 cases
and 64 cases in Pingtung County. Because since the beginning of
winter in southern Taiwan the high temperature has not decreased, the
epidemic remains high.

Health director Chih-Liang Yaung predicted that this wave of dengue
fever will spread to the next year [2010], forming the acid test for
the eradication of the vector mosquito. Spraying alone will lead to
emergence of mosquitoes resistant to disease prevention measures so
control must be accomplished with other measures.
