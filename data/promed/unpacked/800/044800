French Agency Seeks Safeguards on Sheep Intestines to Reduce BSE Risk
-----------------------------------------------
PARIS: France's food safety agency AFSSA on Wednesday renewed its call to
toughen safeguards on sheep and goat products due to the theoretical risk
of these animals acquiring bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and
passing it to humans.
In a 50-page report on the risks of BSE, the agency asked the government to
add intestines--used for sausages--to the list of specified risk material
(SRM) that must be removed from the food chain. "The current system [in
France excludes from human consumption most of the most infectious tissues
in small ruminants and should, by that logic, include the intestines of
small ruminants whatever their age," AFSSA said.
Current rules against the sheep disease scrapie require the removal of
certain SRM--spleen, tonsils, spinal cord, and most of the head--depending
on the animal's age, because of fears they could transmit BSE.
AFSSA first proposed extending the list of SRMs for sheep and goats to
intestines more than a year ago, but its calls raised controversy in France
and abroad. French President Jacques Chirac accused the agency of "inciting
panic."
There is no scientific evidence of the transmission of BSE to sheep and
goats, and consequently to humans, but the hypothesis cannot be ruled out,
AFSSA said. The agency therefore urged the government to launch a
nationwide system to enable all small ruminants to be traced and identified
and to systematically test dead animals for transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs). It also suggested a genetic improvement plan that
would aim to increase resistance to TSEs among sheep.
The agency said that all the measures should be extended to all sheep and
goats imported into France as imports exceed domestic production.

[AFSSA -- the French Agency for Food Safety -- was established in April
1999 under 3 ministries. The 2 main responsibilities of the agency are an
assessment function covering the whole food chain, and scientific and
technical support functions. The Agency maintains strong scientific
components, which include a Scientific Council, Specialist Expert
Committees and Specialist Scientific Committees. The first proposal of
AFSSA to extend the list of sheep and goats SRMs, as mentioned in the
posting, can be seen in the Agency's web-site:

France's concern about the theoretical possibility of BSE entering the
sheep industry and "mimicking" scrapie can be understood in light of the
epizootiological situation there. France reported to the OIE 56 scrapie
outbreaks in 1999 and 53 in 2000, exceeded only by the UK -- 181 and 156
outbreaks, respectively. - Mod.AS
