Another child died of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) over the
past week in eastern China's Shandong Province, bringing the toll
from this year's [2009] outbreak to 44 in the worst-affected
province, provincial health authorities said Tuesday [7 Jul 2009].

The new death occurred in the week from [29 Jun 2009] to [5 Jul
2009], during which the province reported 6919 new HFMD cases. Of
those cases, 2944 required hospitalization, and 245 were serious. The
local health authorities said from [1 Jan 2009] to [5 Jul 2009],
Shandong reported 85 301 HFMD cases. So far, 78 831 patients have
recovered. Hospitals in the province were ordered to reserve enough
beds and other resources to prepare for a massive outbreak, and
public awareness campaigns are in progress.

HFMD is a common illness that mainly affects children under the age
of 10. It usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and
ulcers in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. It is spread
through contact with the saliva or feces of the infected. There is no
vaccine or specific treatment, but most children affected by the
disease recover quickly. May and July are peak periods for the disease.

[On 6 May 2009, ProMED-mail reported that The Ministry of Health of
Shandong Province had published HFMD statistics for the 1st 18 weeks
of the current year. As of Sun 3 May 2009, HFMD in Shandong province
had been responsible for 27 deaths, 18 of which had occurred in the
city of Heze. The above report indicates that the epidemic continues
unabated and may only decline with the onset of colder weather.

It is likely that, as in 2008, enterovirus 71 infection is
responsible for this outbreak of HFMD in children in central and
eastern China. However, official confirmation is still awaited.
