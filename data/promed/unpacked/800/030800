[There are now a total of 9 cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with The Guest House at Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, 4 of which were diagnosed on or after [Fri 14 Jul 2017]. Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period (the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms) of 2 to 10 days. Those exposed to the source for this outbreak (said to be the hotel's aquatic facility) just before remediation took place could still 1st become symptomatic up to 10 days after successful remediation.

The news report above, however, fails to say exactly when remediation took place or when the most recent cases 1st developed symptoms; nevertheless, the news report does suggest that the period of contagion extended from 15 May through 26 Jun 2017, presumably because remediation took place on [Tue 27 Jun 2017]. Cases that are 1st becoming symptomatic long after [Thu 6 Jul 2017] suggests that there may be an ongoing unremediated source, if remediation of the aquatic facility actually took place on [Mon 26 Jun 2017].

We are also not told if the species and genotypes of _Legionella_ that were isolated from the 9 patients matched isolates from environmental sources. Matching genotypes from patient and environmental isolates will confirm transmission pathways. More information on this outbreak in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Graceland is a mansion, converted into museum, devoted to Elvis Presley, its former owner, on a 13.8-acre estate, about 9 miles (14.5 km) from downtown in Memphis, Tennessee (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland).
