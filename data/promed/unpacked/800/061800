Two Scottish children are in a "stable" condition in hospital after falling
prey to a potentially lethal strain of the _E. coli_ bacteria. And another
two from the same class in the same primary school are undergoing tests for
the [organism, which killed 21 people in an outbreak in Lanarkshire in 1996.
Letters have now been sent out to parents warning them to be on the lookout
for symptoms of gastroenteritis or diarrhoea. Although [the infection
usually clears up after a few days, complications that may arise include
inflammation of the bowel, and anaemia. In some cases, kidney [failure may
ensue.
The latest outbreak of the virulent 0157 _E. coli_ bacteria centred on the
school in Aberdeenshire, and officials are trying to trace its source. A
spokesman for Grampian University Hospital Trust, where the boys are being
treated, said: "The Communicable Disease department of Grampian Health
Board is carrying out all investigations into the source of the problem.
"Two children were admitted to hospital today and a further two are
undergoing tests for _E. coli_ 0157."
A spokeswoman for Grampian Health Board said that parents had been given
information about symptoms, and all the youngsters had been asked to give
samples for testing. She said: "We are working with the school at the
moment and the investigation is in its very early stages."
[Another serious outbreak of E.coli 0157, [which occurred two years ago,
centred on meat supplied by a butcher in Wishaw, Lanarkshire. Other recent
outbreaks have happened in Cumbria, where well over 30 people were treated
for the [infection, and Preston, where eight children and one adult fell
ill.
The bacteria is normally carried in the guts of cattle, and can be passed
on to humans via infected milk or meat. The number of _E. coli_ cases has
tripled over the last decade.
