The total number of fatalities from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD) rose by 2 and amounted to 29 as of August 31st, the Department of
Health said on Monday.
The total represents definite and probable cases of new variant CJD that
have been identified since 1995. The new data shows that the total 1998
incidence up until the end of August was 6. This compares with 10 cases in
1997 and 10 cases in 1996. Three cases were reported in 1995.
Britain took steps in July to protect patients receiving blood transfusions
from the theoretical risk of exposure to new variant CJD. Although there
has been no evidence that the disease can be transmitted through blood or
blood products, the government has decided to leuco-deplete all blood
destined for transfusion.

* To 31 August 1998. Total number of definite and probable cases of
nvCJD = 29.
1. The next table will be published on Monday 2 November 1998.
Referrals: This is a simple count of all the cases that have been referred
to the National CJD Surveillance Unit for further investigation in the year
in question. CJD may be no more than suspected; about half the cases
referred in the past have turned out not to be CJD. Cases are notified to
the Unit from a variety of sources including neurologists,
neuropathologists, neurophysiologists, general physicians, psychiatrists,
electroencephalogram (EEG) departments etc. As a safety net, death
certificates coded under the specific rubrics 046.1 and 331.9 in the 9th
ICD Revisions are obtained from the Office for National Statistics in
England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland and the General
Register Office for Northern Ireland.
Deaths: These columns show the number of deaths that have occurred in
definite and probable cases of all types of CJD and GSS in the year shown.
The figure includes both cases referred to the Unit for investigation while
the patient was still alive and those where CJD was only discovered post
mortem (including a few cases picked up by the Unit from death
certificates). There is therefore no read across from these columns to the
referrals column. The figures will be subject to retrospective adjustment
as diagnoses are confirmed.
Definite and Probable: This refers to the diagnostic status of cases. In
definite cases the diagnosis will have been pathologically confirmed, in
most cases by post mortem examination of brain tissue (rarely it may be
possible to establish a definite diagnosis by brain biopsy while the
patient is still alive). Probable cases have not been confirmed
pathologically; some cases are never confirmed pathologically because a
post mortem examination does not take place (for instance where the
relatives of the patient refuse consent) and these cases remain permanently
in the probable category.
Sporadic: Classic CJD cases with typical EEG and brain pathology. Sporadic
cases appear to occur spontaneously with no identifiable cause and account
for 85% of all cases.
Probable sporadic: Cases with a history of rapidly progressive dementia,
typical EEG and at least two of the following clinical features; myoclonus,
visual or cerebellar signs, pyramidal/extrapyramidal signs or akinetic
mutism.
Iatrogenic: Where infection with CJD appears to have occurred accidentally
as the result of a medical procedure. Most of the cases shown resulted from
treatment with human growth hormone but others have occurred through
contaminated neurosurgical instruments, dural grafts etc.
Familial: Cases occurring in families associated with mutations in the PrP
gene (10 - 15% of cases).
GSS: Gertsmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome - an exceedingly rare
inherited autosomal dominant disease, typified by chronic progressive
ataxia and terminal dementia. The clinical duration is from 2 to 10 years,
much longer than for CJD.
nvCJD: New variant CJD, the hitherto unrecognised variant of CJD discovered
by the National CJD Surveillance Unit and reported in The Lancet on 6 April
1996. This is characterised clinically by a progressive neuropsychiatric
disorder leading to ataxia, dementia and myoclonus (or chorea) without the
typical EEG appearance of CJD. Neuropathology shows marked spongiform
change and extensive florid plaques throughout the brain.
Definite nvCJD cases still alive: These will be cases where the diagnosis
has been pathologically confirmed (by brain biopsy).
Probable nvCJD: Cases in which post-mortem (or brain biopsy) has not been
carried out and which fulfil preliminary criteria for the clinical
diagnosis of nvCJD. These criteria cannot yet be fully validated because of
the limited experience of nvCJD.
