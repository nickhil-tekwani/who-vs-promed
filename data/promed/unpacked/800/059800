[2] WHO global overview
Date: July 2019
Source: WHO Zika Epidemiology Update [edited]
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/zika/zika-epidemiology-update-july-2019.pdf


As of July 2019, a total of 87 countries and territories have had evidence of autochthonous mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV), distributed across 4 of the 6 WHO Regions (African Region, Region of the Americas, South-East Asia Region, and Western Pacific Region) [see ref (1) and all cited references at the source URL]. In 2018, Ethiopia was the only new country added to the list of countries with evidence of autochthonous, mosquito-borne transmission, based on a publication of a 2014 study (2).

Incidence of ZIKV infection in the Americas peaked in 2016 and declined substantially throughout 2017 and 2018 (3). ZIKV transmission has been found in all countries in the Region of the Americas except mainland Chile, Uruguay, and Canada (3). Although epidemiologic data from the African, South-East Asian, and Western Pacific Regions are more limited, new scientific evidence continues to accumulate and advance our understanding of global ZIKV transmission and its associated complications.

Recent studies have provided new information on the incidence, prevalence, and patterns of ZIKV transmission worldwide. For example, in Indonesia, a retrospective population-based serosurvey found approximately 9% of children had evidence of prior ZIKV infection by the age of 5 years (4). In Lao People's Republic, evaluation of specimens from asymptomatic adult blood donors in 2015 found nearly 10% had evidence of prior ZIKV infection (5). Thailand demonstrated seasonal patterns of ZIKV transmission that coincided with those of dengue virus, which share common mosquito vectors (6). India reported a ZIKV outbreak in Rajasthan State in 2018 (7). New evidence identified that the ZIKV strain found in the Americas had spread to Angola and was associated with a cluster of microcephaly in 2017-2018 (8-10). Cases of Zika-associated congenital malformations, microcephaly, and foetal death have been identified in countries in Asia (11-13). These and other recent epidemiologic data are summarized below according to WHO region.

Globally, 61 countries and territories in 6 WHO regions have evidence of established competent _Aedes aegypti_ vectors but have not yet documented ZIKV transmission (1). Therefore, there is still the potential risk for ZIKV to spread to additional countries. It is also possible that some of these countries have or have had transmission that has not yet been detected or reported. All areas with prior reports of ZIKV transmission have the potential for re-emergence or re-introduction.

Infection with ZIKV continues to carry the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth, foetal death and stillbirth, and congenital malformations collectively characterized as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), including microcephaly, abnormal brain development, limb contractures, eye abnormalities, brain calcifications, and other neurologic manifestations. The provision of long-term care for affected children and families remains a substantial need of healthcare systems and community-based programs.

ZIKV genetic sequence analyses have been important in elucidating patterns of global spread (14-18). The 2 major lineages of ZIKV, known as the Asian and African lineages, have been identified. The Asian lineage was 1st identified in Asia and subsequently spread to the Pacific Islands and then to the Americas. The 2015-2016 epidemic in the Americas was caused by a strain of the Asian lineage commonly referred to as the American strain. For the purpose of this report, the strain of the Asian lineage that had been and continues to circulate in Asia will be referred to as the "Asia lineage-Asian strain" or the "older" Asian strain.

The differences in the epidemic potential and pathogenicity of these viral lineages and strains are not fully understood. The 2018 ZIKV outbreak in India was due to the Asian lineage-Asian strain, demonstrating the epidemic potential of this older Asian strain (19). Cases of congenital Zika syndrome, microcephaly, and foetal death have been confirmed in women infected with Asian lineage virus, both the American and Asian strains, providing new evidence that adverse birth outcomes are not limited to the strains that caused the epidemic in the Americas (11,12). Studies have demonstrated that ZIKV has circulated in Africa for decades, but no case reports or human studies have yet investigated effects of the African lineage on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Studies of the African lineage in vitro and in animal models suggest the potential for increased pathogenesis in pregnancy compared with the Asian lineage, causing foetal loss rather than birth defects (20,21). The effects of Zika African lineage viruses on birth outcomes remains an area of needed research (22).

Accurate and up-to-date epidemiologic data on ZIKV are limited in many areas of the world. The majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, and when disease occurs, symptoms are generally mild and non-specific, and therefore may not be detected or reported. Many countries lack or have limited systems for routine surveillance, case detection and reporting. In the absence of large outbreaks, available information is often based on clinical case reports, traveller cases, and research studies. Even in settings with laboratory capacity, case detection and surveillance systems are challenging due to limitations of available diagnostic tests (23-25).

Lack of detection or reporting of ZIKV transmission, therefore, cannot necessarily be equated with evidence that transmission is not occurring, particularly in areas with low levels of transmission. Decisions to guide family planning or travel to countries with a history of ZIKV transmission, particularly for pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, and their male partners, should be based on an assessment of information provided by country public health departments and consultation with the individual's healthcare provider.

WHO remains committed to strengthening public health systems for early detection and response to emergence, re-emergence, and global spread of ZIKV infection and its complications, including monitoring for congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain-Barre syndrome. WHO continues to work with regional and national health authorities to enhance health system capacity to detect, report, and respond to the continued threat of ZIKV transmission, as well as to other mosquito-borne viruses and other emerging and re-emerging threats to public health.

[This report provides a succinct worldwide overview of current information on geographic distribution and clinical consequences of Zika virus infections. It is curious, however, that there is no explicit mention of sexual transmission of the virus, mainly male to female but with rare instances of female to male transmission. Only incidental mention is made of pregnant women, or women planning to become pregnant and their male partners. However, this does not detract from the overall usefulness of the report. Risk and avoidance of sexual transmission is mentioned in the following report below for travelers. - Mod.TY]

[3] WHO information for travelers
Date: July 2019

Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes, which bite predominantly during the day and early evening. Zika virus can also be transmitted through sex and during pregnancy from mother to foetus. _Aedes_ mosquitoes also transmit dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and other viruses. These mosquito-transmitted viruses often circulate in the same geographic areas.

Based on available evidence, WHO advises against any restriction of travel to or trade with countries, areas and territories with Zika virus transmission. However, WHO recommends that pregnant women avoid travel to areas with Zika virus transmission, particularly during outbreaks, based on the increased risk of microcephaly and other severe congenital malformations in infants born to women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy.

As a precautionary measure, some national governments may make public health and travel recommendations to their own populations, based on their assessment of the available evidence and local risk factors.

Before travelling to areas with potential Zika virus transmission: Some areas of the world continue to experience Zika virus outbreaks or ongoing transmission. Other areas have had evidence of prior Zika virus transmission but no recent evidence of transmission, and some have sporadic reported cases or low levels of transmission. Risk of infection may vary in different areas within a country, may vary seasonally, and likely changes over time. Most Zika virus infections have no symptoms or have mild, non-specific symptoms that may elude detection or reporting. In the absence of large outbreaks, accurate and up-to-date information on risk of Zika virus transmission is therefore limited in many countries and territories. Lack of detection or reporting of Zika virus transmission therefore cannot necessarily be equated with evidence that transmission is not occurring.

WHO remains committed to strengthening public health systems for early detection and response to emergence, re-emergence, and global spread of Zika virus infection and its complications. WHO will maintain periodic epidemiologic updates on Zika virus transmission and outbreaks to provide information to countries, healthcare providers and travellers.

WHO recommends that pregnant women, women who may become pregnant within 2 months of travel, and male travellers whose partner may become pregnant within 3 months of travel check with their healthcare providers and carefully consider the risks and possible consequences of Zika infection before traveling to areas where there may be Zika virus transmission.

While in areas with potential transmission of Zika virus and other diseases transmitted by _Aedes_ and other day-biting mosquitoes: All travellers should take appropriate measures to reduce the possibility of exposure to mosquito bites during the day and early evening hours and avoid risk of sexual transmission of Zika virus.

To prevent bites from mosquitoes that feed during the day and early evening hours, travellers are advised to:

- Wear clothing -- preferably light coloured -- that covers as much of the body as possible;
- Use insect repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), IR 3535 (3-[N-butyl-N-acetyl], aminopropionic acid ethyl-ester) or KBR3023 (also called Icaridin or Picaridin). Repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing and must be used in strict accordance with the label instructions. If repellents and sunscreen are used together, sunscreen should be applied 1st and the repellent thereafter;
- Use physical barriers such as regular or mesh screens or insecticide-treated netting materials on doors and windows, and keep doors and windows closed; and sleep under mosquito nets during the day when _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active; and
- To avoid risk of sexual transmission of Zika virus infection, men and women should practice safer sex, including the consistent use of condoms, or abstinence.

Upon returning home: To prevent the onward transmission of Zika virus, travellers returning from areas with potential transmission of Zika and other mosquito-borne viruses to areas with competent mosquito vectors should continue to use insect repellent for at least 3 weeks to avoid being bitten and potentially spreading the infection to other people through mosquito bites.

To prevent adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes due to Zika virus infection, all travellers returning from areas with potential Zika virus transmission should practice safer sex, including through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or consider abstaining from sex for at least 3 months after the last possible exposure for men, or 2 months for women travellers. Sexual partners of pregnant women should practice safer sex or abstain for at least the duration of the pregnancy.

Returning travellers who develop symptoms of possible Zika virus infection (e.g., rash, fever, painful joints, red eyes) should contact their healthcare provider, inform their provider of their travel history and receive laboratory testing and clinical care as indicated.

Returning travellers who are pregnant should inform their healthcare providers of their travel history when seeking care. Routine testing for Zika virus infection in returning travellers who are pregnant, who have no symptoms and no abnormal ultrasound findings is not recommended at this time.

Summary
---------
Dengue and Zika viruses are closely related mosquito-borne flaviviruses with similar transmission cycles, distribution throughout the tropics and subtropics, and disease manifestations including fever, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. For patients with suspected dengue or Zika virus disease, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred method of diagnosis. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody testing can identify additional infections and remains an important tool for the diagnosis of these diseases, but interpreting the results is complicated by cross-reactivity, and determining the specific timing of infection can be difficult. These limitations are a particular challenge for pregnant women in determining whether Zika virus infection occurred during or before the pregnancy.

This report summarizes existing and new guidance on dengue and Zika virus diagnostic testing for patients with a clinically compatible illness who live in or recently traveled to an area where there is risk for infection with both viruses. CDC recommendations for screening of asymptomatic pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure are unchanged. For symptomatic nonpregnant persons, dengue and Zika virus NAATs should be performed on serum collected [no more than 7] days after symptom onset. Dengue and Zika virus IgM antibody testing should be performed on NAAT-negative serum specimens or serum collected more than 7 days after onset of symptoms. For symptomatic pregnant women, serum and urine specimens should be collected as soon as possible within 12 weeks of symptom onset for concurrent dengue and Zika virus NAATs and IgM antibody testing. Positive IgM antibody test results with negative NAAT results should be confirmed by neutralizing antibody tests when clinically or epidemiologically indicated, including for all pregnant women. Data on the epidemiology of viruses known to be circulating at the location of exposure and clinical findings should be considered when deciding which tests to perform and for interpreting results.

Patients with clinically suspected dengue should receive appropriate management to monitor and treat shock and hemorrhage. Women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy and their infants should be evaluated and managed for possible adverse outcomes. Dengue and Zika virus disease are nationally notifiable conditions, and cases should be reported to public health authorities.

[The dilemma is that around 80% of Zika virus infections are very mild or asymptomatic, so infected individuals may not seek diagnostic testing. Detailed travel histories should be given to healthcare providers for accurate risk assessment and advisability of laboratory testing. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
We characterized natural vertical transmission of Zika virus in pools of _Aedes aegypti_ larvae hatched from eggs collected in Jojutla, Morelos, Mexico. Of the 151 pools analyzed, 17 tested positive for Zika virus RNA; infectious Zika virus was successfully isolated from one of the larvae pools (31N) in C6/36 cells. Real-time quantitative PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assays confirmed the identity of the isolate, named Zika virus isolate 31N; plaque assays in Vero cells demonstrated the isolate's infectivity in a mammalian cell line. We obtained the complete genome of Zika virus isolate 31N by next-generation sequencing and identified 3 single-nucleotide variants specific to Zika virus isolate 31N using the meta-CATS tool. These results demonstrate the occurrence of natural vertical transmission of Zika virus in wild _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes and suggest that this transmission mode could aid in the spread and maintenance of Zika virus in nature.

[This is not good news. If stabilized Zika virus infections in _Aedes aegypti_ populations can occur, that may become the main mechanism for long-term maintenance of the virus in many localities as the virus passes from one mosquito generation to the next. Control then would only occur when populations of this mosquito vector are controlled. This observation makes development of a Zika virus vaccine more urgent. - Mod.TY]
