Multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ Heidelberg infections linked to Foster Farms brand chicken
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This outbreak investigation continues. Previously, the outbreak appeared to be over, but recent findings indicate otherwise. The number of reported infections from all 7 outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg returned to baseline levels in January 2014 and the outbreak appeared to be over, as noted in the previous update on 16 Jan 2014. However, the investigation continued and ongoing surveillance in February 2014 identified that infections from 2 of the previously rare outbreak strains have again exceeded the number of infections expected to be reported to PulseNet during this time of year.

As of 28 Feb 2014, a total of 481 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg have been reported from 25 states and Puerto Rico since 1 Mar 2013. Most of the ill persons (76 percent) have been reported from California.

Since the last update on 16 Jan 2014, a total of 51 new ill persons have been reported from 5 states: Arizona (3), California (44), Hawaii (1), Tennessee (1), and Utah (2). CDC and state and local public health partners are focusing the investigation on interviewing ill persons about foods eaten and other exposures before becoming ill, continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons who have infections with outbreak-associated strains, and testing recent outbreak strains for antibiotic resistance.

Information about illnesses is available from 472 persons. The dates the illnesses began range from 1 Mar 2013 to 11 Feb 2014. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 93 years, with a median age of 18 years. 51 percent of ill persons are male. Among 394 persons with available information, 151 (38 percent) reported being hospitalized. 13 percent of ill persons have developed blood infections as a result of their illness. Typically, approximately 5 percent of persons ill with Salmonella infections develop blood infections. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that began after 29 Jan 2014, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigation update
--------------------
The NARMS [National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System] retail meat surveillance program isolated 1 of the 2 outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg that has recently increased from a retail sample collected in California of Foster Farms brand chicken wings, purchased on 27 Jan 2014.

Testing conducted by USDA-FSIS [Food Safety and Inspection Services] identified the other outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg that has recently increased in a leftover sample of raw chicken from an ill person's home in California. The person became ill on 11 Jan 2014. The outbreak strain isolated from this person was different from the strain isolated from the leftover chicken sample. Using shopper card records obtained with permission from the ill person, investigators determined that the chicken was a brand likely produced by Foster Farms. However, no packaging was available with the tested product to confirm this and the production date of this sample is unknown.

Antibiotic resistance testing results are not yet available for isolates from recent ill persons or isolates from recent food samples. Results of this testing will be reported when they become available.

[This is one of the 2 ongoing outbreaks of _S._ Heidelberg in the USA linked to chicken. This Foster Farms outbreak, related to 7 genotypically different isolates, is the largest of the 2 and is centered in California. After a hiatus of new cases, 51 new cases of salmonellosis due to outbreak strains have been identified. It is not clear from the CDC report if this is chicken from the previous recall that was not recalled and was thawed and eaten without adequate cooking. - Mod.LL
