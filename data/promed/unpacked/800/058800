[2] Liberia: Ebola free
Date: Thu 3 Sep 2015
Source: MMWR early release [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm64e0903a1.htm?s_cid=mm64e0903a1_e


Following 42 days since the last Ebola virus disease (Ebola) patient was discharged from a Liberian Ebola treatment unit (ETU), 3 Sep 2015 marks the 2nd time in a 4-month period that the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission (1). The 1st confirmed Ebola cases in West Africa were identified in southeastern Guinea on 23 Mar 2014, and within one week, cases were identified and confirmed in Liberia (1). Since then, Liberia has reported 5036 confirmed and probable Ebola cases and 4808 Ebola-related deaths. The epidemic in Liberia peaked in late summer and early fall of 2014, when more than 200 confirmed and probable cases were reported each week (Figure).

With partner support, the Liberia Ministry of Health (MoH) directed interventions that led to a progressive decline in cases (2-6). Beginning on 29 Dec 2014, a cluster of 21 cases (with 745 associated contacts) was identified in the St. Paul River Bridge community of Monrovia, and the last case associated with this cluster was in a patient admitted to an ETU on 18 Feb 2015. This chain of transmission was controlled through community engagement, early identification and triage of cases, and effective contact monitoring (3). Approximately 4 weeks later, on 20 Mar 2015, a single patient with Ebola was reported, who possibly acquired the virus through sexual contact (7). This patient died and was buried on 28 Mar 2015. 42 days later, on 9 May 2015, WHO declared Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission (1).

After this declaration, Liberia maintained WHO-recommended heightened surveillance for Ebola (8) by implementing community-based surveillance initiatives developed during the course of the outbreak and recommending postmortem Ebola testing for all reported deaths. In addition to emphasizing surveillance, other Ebola prevention activities included continuing to recommend safe burial of all dead bodies, establishment of a semen testing program for male Ebola survivors, and continued training and supervision of health care workers on Ebola infection prevention and control measures.

On 29 Jun 2015, approximately 50 days after WHO declared Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission, an Ebola case was identified through a postmortem swab collected from a patient from Needowein, Margibi County, one day after death. Through active case finding and contact tracing, an additional 5 confirmed cases (including an additional death), 2 probable cases, and 143 contacts were identified in Margibi and Montserrado counties. The last Ebola survivor was discharged from the ETU on 23 Jul 2015. Contacts were followed for 21 days, with the last contact completing monitoring on 2 Aug 2015. Investigations into the source of this cluster of cases are ongoing.

Several strategies were important for the rapid containment of this last cluster. 1st, command, control, and partner coordination were maintained through the existing MoH Incident Management System (4), which operated out of the National Emergency Operations Center in Monrovia (newly opened as of 19 Jun 2015), and a temporary field-based emergency operations center near Needowein. Rapid response plans that had been developed to address possible reintroduction of Ebola into Liberia were quickly executed. Field teams applied experience in contact tracing and active case finding accrued over the course of the previous year, such as during the Saint Paul Bridge cluster investigation (3). Health care worker surveillance and infection prevention and control strategies were implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission (6). Increased Ebola laboratory testing capacity, also developed over the course of the previous year, allowed for rapid testing and confirmation of cases. Throughout these efforts, ongoing community engagement was critical in building trust and cooperation within the affected community.

The rapid identification and control of this most recent Ebola cluster highlight the important achievements MoH has made in enhancing its public health response capacity. In addition, the occurrence of this cluster underscores the need for continued vigilance, postmortem testing, and adherence to WHO recommendations for heightened post-outbreak surveillance. Other public health activities are underway to strengthen surveillance, not just for Ebola but also for other diseases identified by MoH for inclusion in their revised integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) framework (9). Trainings are underway for county-level implementation of Liberia's revised IDSR framework. Work continues to improve public health laboratory capacity. In addition, a Field Epidemiology Training Program has been started in Liberia to increase public health workforce capacity at the national and local levels (10).

During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak, general health systems and public health capacity in Liberia were adversely impacted. As Liberia transitions again from an emergency public health response to a phase of continued vigilance, many of the practices that have been put into place will, in addition to ensuring continued heightened surveillance for Ebola, facilitate the overall rebuilding of the country's public health infrastructure.

[Sana Sambou, head of Disease Control and the National Incident Coordinator for Ebola, has cautioned the public that Ebola is still in the sub-region. According to Sambou, Gambia is termed as one of the most vulnerable countries because of its proximity to the epicenter. He said the country has a weak health system and, as such, they are taking advantage of the situation to see how best [the health system] can be strengthened not only for Ebola but any other current or emerging disease....more]

4 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone: More heartbreak for Ebola survivor after baby boy dies
http://news.yahoo.com/more-heartbreak-ebola-survivor-baby-boy-dies-121832077.html
[It was the new beginning that Sierra Leone's 1st Ebola survivor had yearned for after losing 21 of her relatives to the disease: a newborn who would allow her and her husband to start a new family.
But only weeks after the baby they named Barnabas was born, he died of an infection that overwhelmed his tiny body. In the Ebola-ravaged community of Kenema, the baby, who already had become a symbol of rebirth and renewal, was buried on Thu [3 Sep 2015], a day after he died. The cause of the baby's death was an infection and was not believed to be related to Ebola. ...more

Babies in Sierra Leone already faced some of the grimmest odds in the world even before the Ebola epidemic. Infant mortality is so high that tradition calls for children to be named only after they survive for a week. "A single case of Ebola catches the headlines, but nationwide, one in 11 children in Sierra Leone are dying before their 1st birthday, and that needs a stronger response," said Geoff Wiffin, head of UNICEF Sierra Leone.

This baby's death is particularly painful given the circumstances, but the rate of infant mortality, one in 11 children dying before their 1st birthday, cries out for attention. - Mod.LK]

3 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone and Guinea: Ebola Virus Disease -- Sierra Leone and Guinea, August 2015
S Hersey, LD Martel, A Jambai et al. MMWR early release
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm64e0903a2.htm?s_cid=mm64e0903a2_e
[Abstract. The Ebola virus disease (Ebola) outbreak in West Africa began in late 2013 in Guinea (1) and spread unchecked during early 2014. By mid-2014, it had become the 1st Ebola epidemic ever documented. Transmission was occurring in multiple districts of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and for the 1st time, in capital cities (2). On 8 Aug 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (3). Ministries of Health, with assistance from multinational collaborators, have reduced Ebola transmission, and the number of cases is now declining. While Liberia has not reported a case since 12 Jul 2015, transmission has continued in Guinea and Sierra Leone, although the numbers of cases reported are at the lowest point in a year. In August 2015, Guinea and Sierra Leone reported 10 and four confirmed cases, respectively, compared with a peak of 526 (Guinea) and 1997 (Sierra Leone) in November 2014. This report details the current situation in Guinea and Sierra Leone, outlines strategies to interrupt transmission, and highlights the need to maintain public health response capacity and vigilance for new cases at this critical time to end the outbreak.]

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/04/failures-of-dallas-hospital-during-ebola-crisis-detailed-in-new-report/
[Lack of communication among emergency room staff, poor configuration of information on the patient's electronic health records, and diminished focus on patient safety were 3 of the main deficiencies of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas during the 2014 Ebola crisis, according to an independent report released by the hospital Friday [4 Sep 2015].

According to the report, "The lack of complete history taking, particularly travel history assessment, documentation and sharing, the ineffective communications among the clinical team, and a seeming over-reliance on the EHR [electronic health record] rather than focusing on the complete care of the patient, leads the Expert Panel to recommend a broad review of the quality of care, IT [information technology], and the culture of the THD [Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas] Emergency Department"...more]
