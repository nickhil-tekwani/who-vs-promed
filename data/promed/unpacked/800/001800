[These are not official data. They are derived, with some editing, from the
above-mentioned source, which seems to be updated meticulously. The data
from some countries may include exceptional imported cases or exclude
exported cases which were found positive in the countries of destination.
During 2003, decreased incidence of recorded BSE cases, compared to 2002,
was seen in most countries. The exceptions were Portugal, Spain, Japan,
Poland, and the Czech Republic.

Since the previous update (29 Mar 2004), one new case each was observed in
the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Poland has observed 2 new cases, and,
already, since the beginning of 2004, 5 BSE cases, compared to 5 cases
throughout 2003.

On 3 May, the Italian press reported that the BSE research center of Turin
confirmed the 2nd Italian BSE case, in 2004, in an 8-year-old cow from a
breeding farm in the province of Bolzano. This case is not yet included in
the table.

On 14 May 2004, Denmark's 13th confirmed case of BSE was made public by the
Danish Veterinary Institute. It was found in a dead beef cow, the 1st such
case in 2004. No typical clinical symptoms were recorded. Reportedly, the
cow had been part of 2 herds, totaling 150 animals, in the central area of
the Jutland peninsula in western Denmark. This case is not yet included in
the table above.

USDA to try to track animal disease
------------------------------------
The Agriculture Department is about to start examining systems that could
help it locate, within 48 hours, animals that might have mad cow disease or
other infectious diseases.

The department will spend USD 18.8 million on the 1st phase of its
multi-year animal identification program, said Bill Hawks, undersecretary
for marketing and regulatory programs. The department will examine ways to
label the places where animals live, such as farms, ranches, and feedlots.
These systems might later be enhanced to identify the animals themselves,
Hawks said. In the initial phase, the department will evaluate the pilot
programs it currently funds, and look for others, Hawks said. Some pilot
programs are studying equipment that would identify the animals, such as
microchips that can be implanted in individual cattle. Others are creating
databases to store records.

The department expects that the facilities that keep the animals could
start receiving their identification numbers later in 2004, with
identification numbers for livestock possibly following shortly thereafter,
Hawks said.

The animal identification program would eventually replace the current
hodgepodge of incomplete records that left authorities scrambling after mad
cow disease was found in the United States in Dec 2003.

Officials wanted to track animals born in the same Canadian herd as the
Washington State Holstein that was diagnosed with America's only case of
the disease. Officials feared the animals could have eaten the same
potentially infectious feed.

In the end, the department conceded it would not be able to locate 11 of
the 25 animals it most wanted, but said the risk of disease in those
animals was extremely small.

Infected brains on menu for BSE tests
--------------------------------------
In an unappetizing experiment, health experts will feed cattle the brains
of cows infected with mad cow disease to find an early detection method for
the brain-wasting disease, officials said.

The National Institute of Animal Health will begin, in Jun 2004, a series
of tests using live cattle to combat possible outbreaks of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.

The forced cannibalism, which will artificially infect the healthy
herbivores with BSE, is also aimed at learning how the disease develops.

The tests will be conducted in a tightly sealed facility in Tsukuba,
Ibaraki Prefecture, that cost 7.1 billion yen (USD 62 million) to complete.

The National Institute of Animal Health, an incorporated administrative
agency under the jurisdiction of the farm ministry, has invited local
residents to take a tour of the new facility today [Sat 15 May] to
alleviate fears that the disease might leak out.

The new tests are needed, officials say, because of deficiencies in the
current BSE screening method. The current test is conducted on the brain
tissue of cattle, meaning, obviously, that the cows are already dead.

There are also limits to the current test's sensitivity to abnormal prion
proteins, leading to difficulty in dealing with the disease.

To prevent abnormal prions from leaking during the live cattle tests, the
facility is equipped with air and water purifiers. It also has a special
high-pressure, high-temperature system to safely dispose of cattle parts
after dissection.

The infected brains will be collected from the Hokkaido Animal Research
Center, where researchers started raising infected calves in Jan 2004 by
injecting prions into their brains.

After the healthy cattle are fed the infected brain matter, the Tsukuba
institute researchers can try to find a biochemical marker that indicates
BSE infection in the living animals, according to the officials.

Japan now tests all cattle slaughtered for consumption for BSE. The
mandatory testing started in Oct 2001, after Japan's 1st mad cow case was
confirmed.

The facility's construction costs were earmarked in a supplementary budget
for fiscal year 2001.

The institute has since provided explanations about the facility to local
residents, the officials said.

[A BSE research project, "Experimental production of bovine tissue for the
validation of BSE diagnostic tests (SE1736)", was reportedly launched by
DEFRA in the UK several years ago. One wonders if final, or interim,
results of the British research are available to spare duplications and to
complete needed data within the Japanese trials. - Mod. AS].

UK's BSE crisis draws to an end
--------------------------------
Fallout from the BSE crisis that hit the UK meat industry in the 1990s
could be nearly over, as the EU's food safety body paves the way for
British beef to move down from its 'high risk' classification.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), whose job it is to assess risk
in food, said, during the 2nd week of May 2004, that British beef will soon
be downgraded to a "moderate BSE risk," the same as meat from the rest of
Europe. Between Nov 1986 and Nov 2002, 181 376 cases of the fatal cattle
disease Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) were confirmed in the UK.

Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA scientific panel
on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) examined the UK's application to be
considered as a "moderate BSE risk" according to the standards of the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

"The panel concludes that the UK will reach the threshold that will enable
it to be considered as a "moderate BSE risk" country at a date no later
than Dec 2004," said the authority in a statement.

Causing millions of euros in lost revenues, and costing the UK taxpayer an
estimated BP 4.6 billion, the "mad-cow crisis" in the mid-1980s struck down
UK farmers, as countries blocked British beef imports over contamination fears.

The scientific panel has published its findings, but it is now up to the
European Commission to make the decision whether or not to bring UK beef
into line with the EU-wide "moderate BSE risk" category.

British beef exports are currently classed as "high-risk" incurring stiff
restrictions for UK farmers. The UK's National Farmers' Union welcomed the
news, saying it "reconfirms the effect of the UK's BSE controls and shows
that BSE is in rapid decline," and opens the way for the UK to export like
all other member states.

For a country to be labeled a "moderate risk," it must post less than 200
BSE cases per one million adult cattle.
