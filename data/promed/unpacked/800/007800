An outbreak of anthrax has been detected in free-ranging wood bison in the
Slave River Lowlands (SRL) in the Northwest Territories, Canada. This area is
under jurisdiction of the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT),
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR). The range of the Slave
River Lowland wood bison herd includes a series of prairies located east
(population approx. 350) and west (population approx. 400) of the Slave River,
and located northeast of Wood Buffalo National Park. Anthrax is endemic in
this region, with 6 document outbreaks between 1963 and 2001 killing at least
925 bison.
During a routine anthrax surveillance flight by fixed-wing aircraft on Monday
26 Jun 2006, a single dead bison (mature bull) was found in a northwestern
prairie within the SRL. Its location was marked by GPS, and an ENR crew
returned to the site by helicopter that afternoon to sample the carcass for
anthrax testing, and sprayed the carcass with formaldehyde (22 liters of 10
percent formalin) to prevent scavenging and do a superficial site
decontamination. During an additional surveillance of the area by helicopter,
a 2nd mature bull was found dead in the same prairie; given its location and
condition, it is believed to have died after the morning surveillance flight.
A field diagnostic test was run on both animals (a US Navy field ELISA test),
and one animal tested positive for anthrax. No new carcasses were detected
during surveillance flight on Tuesday 27 Jun 2006.
An additional case was found on Thu 29 Jun -- a mature male that was found
recumbent and displaying terminal thrashing -- it died within an hour. The
field ELISA was positive for anthrax. Samples from all 3 carcasses were also
collected and shipped to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Animal Disease
Research Institute in Lethbridge, Alberta for official confirmation. A
surveillance flight conducted on Saturday 1 Jul 2006 detected an additional 11
fresh carcasses, bringing the total to date to 14. All but one of the cases
are mature males, consistent with the pattern seen in anthrax outbreaks in
bison in northern Canada. A subsequent flight on Sunday 2 Jul found no new
cases.
The GNWT's Anthrax Emergency Response Plan was immediately implemented in
response to the index cases. In addition to media communications and area
closures to reduce disease risk to humans, this plan includes surveillance,
testing and carcass treatment/disposal (by burning and chemical disinfection).
The principal goal of proper and timely carcass disposal is to reduce
environmental contamination with anthrax spores, and thereby reduce the
severity and/or frequency of future outbreaks.
Given the remote location of the outbreak, logistics are difficult and are all
done by helicopter. Field crews are cutting wood, which will be used in
combination with coal to burn carcasses (approximately one cord of wood and
1000 pounds [450 kg] of coal per carcass). Carcass incinerations are
tentatively scheduled to start within 2 days once fuel is positioned at
carcass sites. Aerial surveillance will continue to monitor for additional
cases, and we are planning to use an infrared heat detecting system to find
carcasses under forest cover that are difficult to pick up visually.
Anthrax outbreaks in bison in northern Canada tend to occur in summers when
there is a wet spring followed by hot dry weather, and usually occur in mid
July to mid-August. The onset of this outbreak in late June is unusual, and
likely related to a very early spring/summer with extended periods of hot
weather in June. The last time an outbreak was seen this early in northern
Canada was in 1963, when there was a biphasic outbreak -- a small (15)
outbreak in late June, followed by a large outbreak (242) in mid-July.
Anthrax surveillance flights are also being conducted for the Mackenzie
[Sanctuary] bison herd, a separate herd in the NWT west of Great Slave Lake,
with no evidence of any cases as of Sunday 2 Jul 2006. The last anthrax
outbreak detected in the Mackenzie herd was in 1993, killing 169 bison.
[Actually it killed some 182 animals. Burning was very efficient, with all but
a very few carcasses burnt where they lay. It is probable that this has
successfully prevented further outbreaks. -Mod.MHJ]

[Talk about good timing! The northern anthrax group had their pre-season
meeting on 16 Jun 2006 in Fort Smith and were patently ready to roll. These
mature wood bison bulls can weigh some 2500 pounds [1130 kg] so burning them
is not simple. 'Hot-shot' forest fire-fighting teams are used to do the
burning. Experience over the years has demonstrated that a mixed wood plus
coal fuel is the most cost-effective. The infra-red heat detectors, used for
forest fire fighting, can locate a bull carcass for some 5-6 days after death
even when tucked in under the trees; their great bulk ferments the different
tissue series (rumen and intestines to viscera to muscle), in turn keeping it
above the ambient temperature. Why males are more commonly affected than
females -- a uniform rule until the outbreaks in the Peace River delta when it
was 50:50 -- is hard to explain once past the index case. As bull behaviour is
centered on their individual wallows and dust-tossing displays, it would
follow that a bull will drop dead near its wallow and the wallow inheritor
would also gain a patch of contaminated grazing. That others are involved
would suggest that tabanid flies yet again play a part in spreading the
infection. Obviously we need a keen grad student up there to take comparative
fly counts on bulls and cows. It might be a good idea to vaccinate them before
they head out. The bison are going into their summer breeding season and the
mature bulls are trying to collect bunches of cows. A stressful time for them.
It is one of my favourite places in the world up there, and wood bison cows
are superb navigators. - Mod.MHJ]
