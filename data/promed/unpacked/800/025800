C. Causal agent: vesicular stomatitis virus type New Jersey.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.
B. Other epidemiological details:
- Vesicular stomatitis is enzootic in Belize and is characterised by
sporadic occurrence and periodic epizootics. The last major outbreak was in
January 1997. It is felt that Belize along with the Yucatan peninsula and
northern Guatemala is an area of low occurrence of vesicular stomatitis due
to ecological factors particular to the area.
- The disease has always been reported in the central and southern parts of
the country. This is the first report of vesicular stomatitis in the
northern part of Belize and is due to improved surveillance.
Control measures:
- quarantine;
- screening.

[I would hazard a guess that the "ecological factors" referred to in the
notice is that the environment does not favor the vectors for this disease
-- primarily sand flies (Lutzomyia) and black flies (Simuliidae). However,
more detail from knowledgeable individuals as to why VS would be less
likely in the parts of Central America referred to above would be helpful.
