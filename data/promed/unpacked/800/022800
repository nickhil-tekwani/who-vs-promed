Spain: fungus destroys broccoli production
------------------------------------------
In the Alicante region [Valencia community] growers have practically
lost the harvest of this season of broccoli, one of the most important
products of the region. The crop has been hit by a fungus called
botrytis which makes the crop rot. 1800 hectares [about 4500 acres]
have already been affected, with losses greater than half a million
euros [about USD 665 000].

The broccoli season has begun just a few weeks ago, and if this
situation is not solved in time it could lead to much greater economic
losses for farmers. Weather conditions are conducive to appearance of
the fungus.

The current agricultural insurance system does not cover this type of
damage caused by plant diseases, and farmers have requested
compensation and direct assistance from the Department of
Agriculture.

[_Botrytis cinerea_ causes grey mould on a wide range of hosts,
including many crops such as brassicas and other vegetables, fruit
crops, grapevine, and peanut.

In brassicas, yield losses of up to 40 percent have been reported.
Symptoms of typical grey fungal growth and softening of tissues may
appear on all aerial parts of the plant, both in the field and in
storage. The fungus usually enters via damaged tissues, for example
following frost, tipburn, mechanical damage, or insect attacks, but
can also affect undamaged tissues that are in contact with infected
material. Affected areas are also more susceptible to invasion by
bacterial soft rots. The disease is favoured by high humidity and poor
ventilation within crops.

The fungus is spread by water, wind, mechanical means (including human
and insect activities), and with plant debris. It can overwinter as
mycelium in soil or plant debris, but sclerotia are formed for long
term survival. Disease management may include cultural practices (such
as field sanitation, good crop ventilation, avoiding plant damage),
use of clean planting material, and fungicides as sprays or prestorage
treatments.
