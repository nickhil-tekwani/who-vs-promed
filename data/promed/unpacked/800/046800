I just read the news on human rabies in Tanzania. Spread by foxes? Or is
it meant to be jackals? Pardon my curiosity, but I've just been involved
in a major rabies study here in Namibia, and it's interesting to hear what
happens elsewhere.

Recently rabies in Tanzania was mentioned and "foxes" as the source. I
wonder if [you meant to say jackals? I enquired of a wildlife expert
there (my brother-in-law, a wildlife safari guide). [He said that: "There
are foxes is Africa: the bat eared fox, the cape fox, the sand fox, and
Ruppell's fox. But the bat eared fox is the only one in East Africa. I
would imagine that the rabies is carried by jackals which look like foxes
and which have been known to bite people. The bat eared foxes are very
small; 2.5 kg in Kenya & Tanzania although they go [up to 4kg in Botswana.
They live mainly on harvester ants, supplementing their diet with termites,
lizards, young birds and beetle larvae."
Reference: Richard Deapard Estes's book _The Behaviour Guide to African
Mammals_.
[Once again, the power of so many well informed people in the ProMED-mail
loop is obvious. Thanks to both Roger Paskin and Hugh de Glanville for the
good information. Mod. pc
