[In response to ProMED-mail's RFI in posting 20160418.4167911:]
Disease could be hemorrhagic septicaemia caused by _Pasteurella multocida_.

[The media report on the event included the following data:

"Animal diseases in Gaili village in Peren district has led to the death of about 60 buffaloes and cows.

"A press release by the chairman of Gaili village council, Hegapungpe Haikube, stated that timely intervention of veterinary and animal husbandry department had contained the outbreak. It stated that the chief veterinary officer of Peren visited Gaili village on [15 Apr 2016] to spread awareness, vaccinate and distribute anti-virals to control the epidemic outbreak which started in the 1st week of April 2016."

In case the event turned out to be confirmed as an outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), an OIE-listed bacterial epizootic disease, the "distribution of anti-virals", as reported, remains to be explained.

In India, HS is endemic; during 2014 (the most recent year covered, so far, in the Indian pages of OIE's WAHIS interface), 135 outbreaks were reported. The last HS outbreak in the state of Nagaland (north-east India, bordering Myanmar; map at http://tinyurl.com/ja6usxw) were reported in March 2011. Earlier outbreaks there: 2007 - 3; 2008 - 23; 2009 - 1; 2010 - 5. No outbreaks reported during the years 2012-2014.

The following overview on HS is copied from ProMED-mail posting 20150607.3414297:

Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and buffaloes characterised by an acute, highly fatal septicaemia with high morbidity and mortality. It results from infection by _Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida_, a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Pasteurellaceae. _P. multocida multocida_ can cause a variety of diseases in animals, but only 2 serotypes of this organism classically cause hemorrhagic septicemia. Because 2 systems, the Namioka-Carter and Carter-Heddleston systems, are used to designate _P. multocida_ serotypes, each serotype has 2 names. One is known as B:2 in the Carter-Heddleston system and 6:B in the Namioka-Carter system. The other is E:2 in the Carter-Heddleston system and 6:E in the Namioka-Carter system. In both systems, the letter stands for the capsular antigen and the number designates the somatic antigen. In India, the serotypes A:1 and A:3 (Carter-Heddleston system) have also been linked to HS.

Septicemic pasteurellosis, a disease that is clinically indistinguishable from hemorrhagic septicemia, has been reported sporadically from wild ruminants, especially cervids. This disease may also be called hemorrhagic septicemia in the literature. A variety of serotypes including B:3,4, A:3,4 and B:1 have been linked to septicemic pasteurellosis. (For the above and additional information on HS, please refer to the review, updated 2009, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf.)

According to chapter 2.4.12 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012), HS, a notifiable bovine disease, is caused by serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_ that are geographically restricted to some areas of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe. The diagnosis of the disease is based on the clinical signs, gross lesions, morbidity and mortality patterns. Confirmation requires the isolation and characterisation of the pathogen using conventional and molecular techniques. There are no confirmed reports of human infections with _P. multocida_ B2 and E2; however, other serotypes do cause human infections and precautions should be taken to avoid exposure. The organism should be handled in biosafety level 2 laboratories. - Mod.AS
