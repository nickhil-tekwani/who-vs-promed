[3] Rwanda: use of robots, pooled testing
A. Use of robots

Rwanda has introduced robots as part of its fight against coronavirus.

With 314 confirmed cases of the virus as of [22 May 2020], the East African country has enlisted the help of 5 anti-epidemic robots to battle the virus. The robots were donated by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to the Kanyinya treatment center that treats COVID-19 patients in the capital city, Kigali. The robots -- named Akazuba, Ikirezi, Mwiza, Ngabo, and Urumuri -- were received by the country's Minister of Health and Minister of ICT [Information and communications technology] and Innovation last week [week of 18 May 2020].

They will be used for mass temperature screening, monitoring patient status, and keeping medical records of COVID-19 patients, according to Rwanda's Ministry of ICT and Innovation.

Keeping health workers safe
---------------------------
The robots perform a number of tasks relating to managing coronavirus. They can screen up to 150 people every minute for symptoms of the virus such as high temperature and dry cough. According to Dr Daniel Ngamije, Rwanda's minister of health, they also have the capacity to capture sound and visual data of patients and can notify health workers on detected abnormalities.

"These robots will perform temperature screening in our treatment centers. The robots will detect people walking in not wearing masks so that with the voice, the command post can quickly be informed and respond," he said. More than 90 000 health workers worldwide have contacted the COVID-19 in the course of treating affected patients. To reduce these numbers, the Rwandan government wants its health workers to have limited physical contact with patients under their care.

The robots have the capacity to deliver medicine, food, and other essentials in place of frontline workers to COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment, Ngamije said. They are programmed to communicate properly and can also educate health workers and patients on the dangers of the virus and how to stay safe, he added.

Robotics engineers from the UNDP will train staff of the Rwandan Ministry of health on how to use the robots so they can put them to work.

Robots fighting COVID-19
------------------------
Rwanda is not the 1st country to use robots in managing the spread of coronavirus. During Tunisia's lockdown in April [2020], police robots were deployed to patrol areas in the country's capital city to ensure that residents were observing the lockdown. They were controlled by officers who checked the ID of residents found wandering through the robot's camera. And in January [2020], doctors used a robot to treat the 1st person in the US to get coronavirus. The robot in a hospital in Seattle was employed to check the man's vitals, limiting contact with health workers.

[Fascinating intervention that will be very interesting to follow the results. Drones have been used in some areas for monitoring lockdown compliance and for deliveries of essentials to people in quarantine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will likely require the rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals, on an ongoing basis. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate but costly, making regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by combining samples and testing them in groups. We propose an algorithm for grouping subsamples, prior to testing, based on the geometry of a hypercube. At low prevalence, this testing procedure uniquely identifies infected individuals in a small number of tests. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in which a positive sample was detected even when diluted a 100-fold with negative samples. Using these methods, the costs of mass testing could be reduced by a factor of 10 to a 100 or more. If infected individuals are quickly and effectively quarantined, the prevalence will fall and so will the costs of regularly testing everyone. Such a strategy provides a possible pathway to the long term elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Field trials of our approach are now under way in Rwanda and initial data from these are reported here.

[The authors point out that each diagnostic test costs USD 30-50, Which makes high volume testing of the population cost prohibitive for the lower/middle income countries -- which makes "testing every individual in a population regularly, as may be essential to eliminating the virus, very expensive."

The paper presents algorithms for sample size for the pools based on expected/known prevalence in an area.

Another innovation Rwanda will be implementing to address adequate response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine on temporary pause
Date: Mon 25 May 2020 8:43 PM CEST
Source: NBC News [abridged, edited]
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-temporarily-halts-trial-hydroxychloroquine-over-safety-concerns-n1214341


The World Health Organization announced Monday [25 May 2020] that it is [temporarily] suspending a trial of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19, saying fears of the drug's potential danger are is causing it to "err on the side of caution." WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said evidence has shown harmful side effects, including heart problems.

Tedros cited the British journal The Lancet [see ref below] which published findings Friday [22 May 2020] showing that hydroxychloroquine doesn't help COVID-19 patients and might even increase deaths. "The executive group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity Trial while the safety data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board. The other arms of the trial are continuing," Tedros said in an online briefing from Geneva.

Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO's chief scientist, said the organization's investigators and regulators in individual countries have raised enough red flags to prompt the halt. "So the steering committee met over the weekend and decided that in the light of this uncertainty that we should be proactive, err on the side of caution and suspend enrollment, temporarily, into the hydroxychloroquine arm," she said. The WHO will take at least another week, perhaps 2, to gather more data, Swaminathan said.

"We want to use hydroxychloroquine if it is safe, if it reduces mortality, reduces the length of hospitalization, without increasing the adverse events," she added. "So this is a temporary measure." Tedros told patients taking the medication for its well-established uses beyond COVID-19 that they shouldn't worry. "This concern relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19," he said. "I wish to reiterate that this drug is accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases and malaria."

[This decision was taken in response to the Lancet publication which found an increased in-hospital mortality among the groups taking hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine than in groups not taking the drugs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Summary
--------
"Background Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a 2nd-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit. Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.

"Methods
"We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in 6 continents. We included patients hospitalised between [20 Dec 2019 and 14 Apr 2020], with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).

"Findings
"96 032 patients (mean age 53.8 years, 46.3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10698 (11.1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9.3%), hydroxychloroquine (18.0%; hazard ratio 1.335, 95% CI 1.223-1.457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%; 1.447, 1.368-1.531), chloroquine (16.4%; 1.365, 1.218-1.531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22.2%; 1.368, 1.273-1.469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0.3%), hydroxychloroquine (6.1%; 2.369, 1.935-2.900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8.1%; 5.106, 4.106-5.983), chloroquine (4.3%; 3.561, 2.760-4.596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6.5%; 4.011, 3.344-4.812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.

"Interpretation
"We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19."

This decision seems appropriate given the published results in Lancet. - Mod.MPP]

[5] Germany (Frankfurt): church associated cluster
Date: Sun 24 May 2020 9:36 PM

German authorities are trying to trace everyone who attended a church service in Frankfurt this month after more than 107 people tested positive for the coronavirus. Churches in the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, have been able to hold services since [1 May 2020] following the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions, provided they adhere to official social distancing and hygiene rules.

Reuters previously reported the service took place on [10 May 2020], the city's health department deputy chief Antoni Walczok told local newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau. "This situation shows how important it is that all of us stay alert and avoid becoming careless, especially now during the easing of restrictions. The virus is still there and will spread," Hesse state health minister Kai Klose said. He said the authorities hoped that identifying those who attended the service at a Baptist church on [10 May 2020] would help prevent others being infected.

It was not immediately clear whether all the 107 with the coronavirus attended the service, or whether the tally includes people who were infected by those who did. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen to 178 281, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday [24 May 2020]. The reported death toll rose by 31 to 8247.

[It seems as though religious gatherings have played a significant role in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 -- all denominations of religion, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu. Congregating in closed quarters without uniform use of face masks and unable to meet social distancing recommendations/requirements seems to be the operative. Singing and chanting out loud further propels potentially infective droplets into the environment. A recipe for problems if someone is asymptomatic or presymptomatic and doesn't know they are a source of infection. - Mod.MPP

A total of 160 health workers in Tanzania attended a 3-day virtual training session organized by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (https://www.afro.who.int/news/equipping-tanzanian-health-workers-skills-critical-care).

- The United Kingdom will contribute USD 3.8m for the COVID-19 response in the Caribbean. The financial contribution to the WHO Regional Office for the Americas will help Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines contain the spread of the disease and mitigate its impact (https://www.paho.org/en/news/22-5-2020-united-kingdom-contributes-38m-covid-19-response-caribbean).

- WHO has partnered with Vital Strategies and other global partners to launch a new technical package: Revealing the Toll of COVID-19: A Technical Package for Rapid Mortality Surveillance and Epidemic Response. This is a technical package for rapid mortality surveillance and epidemic response to support national governments with surveillance and response planning surrounding COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/revealing-the-toll-of-covid-19).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 57 171 new cases (57.0% of the global newly reported cases), and 3356 deaths (77.3%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 42.2% were reported by the USA, 28.9% were reported by Brazil, Peru 7.1 %, Chile 6.5 %, and Mexico 5.8%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 18 192 new cases (18.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 543 deaths (12.5%). Russia reported 49.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 13.2%, Turkey 6.3%, Belarus 5.2%, Italy 2.9%, and Spain 2.6% (?weekend artifact?)

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 12 026 new cases (12.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 176 deaths (4.1%). Saudi Arabia reported 19.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 14.5%, Iran 18.1%, Qatar 12.5%, Kuwait 7.0%, the United Arab Emirates 6.5%, Egypt 6.3%, and Afghanistan and Oman at 4.3% each.

The African region reported 2707 new cases (2.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 47 deaths (1.1%). South Africa reported 45.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 11.6%, Algeria at 7.1%, Guinea and Sierra Leone at 3.7% each, South Sudan at 3.4%, and Ethiopia at 3.3%.

The Western Pacific region reported 927 new cases (0.92% of the global newly reported cases) and 16 deaths (0.37%). Singapore reported 59.1% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 27.8%, Malaysia 6.5%, and Japan 3.3%. Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia account for 93.4% of the total newly reported cases in the region.

The South East Asia region reported 9241 new cases (9.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 204 deaths (4.7%). India reported 75.5% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 16.6%, and Indonesia 5.7%. These 3 countries make up 97.8% of all reported cases in the region.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 25 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
