Ministry of Health confirms 180th H5N1 case
-------------------------------------------
The Indonesia Ministry of Health, the General Directorate of
Infectious Disease and Environmental Health, through the National
Institute of Health Research & Development laboratory, confirmed an
additional H5N1 human case.

The victim is a 29-year-old female, resident of Bangli regency, Bali
province. She is a mother of 2 former H5N1 cases (5-year-old female,
and 10.5-year-old male).

The victim felt weakness, coughing, and breathing difficulty on 15 Oct
2011, and sought help at an emergency unit in the nearby regional
hospital. When she was about to be transferred to a referral hospital,
the victim escaped and was found at the place of an alternative healer
on the next day. Her condition was getting worse and she died in her
home on 17 Oct 2011.

Epidemiological investigation showed that the victim lived in area
where many people were rearing poultry. Also, the victim's family
owned flocks of poultry. This case brings the total number of H5N1
cases in Indonesia to 182 with 150 fatalities.

This case has been reported to WHO by the general director of
infectious disease and environmental health, Prof dr Tjandra Yoga
Aditama.

Indonesia confirms H5N1 death in mother of 2 earlier victims
------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia's Ministry of Health has confirmed H5N1 avian flu in the
death of a 29-year-old mother of 2 children who also died of the
disease, according to a report today [14 Nov 2011] from Bird Flu
Information Corner [see [1] above], an Internet message board operated
by Kobe University in Japan and Airlangga University in Indonesia. The
report said the patient, from the resort island of Bali, felt weak,
was coughing, and had breathing difficulty on 15 Oct 2011 when she was
hospitalized. However, she escaped just before she was to be
transferred to a referral hospital and was found in a place of
alternative healing the next day. Her condition deteriorated, and she
died at home on 17 Oct 2011. Her 5-year-old daughter and 10-year-old
son died 9 Oct 2011 and 10 Oct 2011, respectively, of H5N1 avian flu.
Many poultry deaths had been recently reported in the family's flocks
and those of their neighbors. If the woman's death is confirmed by the
World Health Organization (WHO), it would bring Indonesia's official
H5N1 case count to 181, including 150 deaths.

[It is confirmed now that the death of the mother of the 2 children
resident in Bangli regency, Bali Province, who both died as a result
of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection, was also a consequence of
avian influenza virus infection. While it is likely that the 3 members
of the same family were independently infected from the same source
(diseased poultry), it may be that they shared genetic susceptibility
to infection by the avian virus. No other person in the same village
was reported to have been affected. The situation deserves further
investigation.

According to the most recent WHO statement (see ProMED-mail Avian
influenza, human (64): Indonesia (BA) WHO 20111027.3198) the 2
deceased children were the 180th and 181st cases of avian influenza
A/(H5N1) virus infection in Indonesia. Consequently their recently
deceased mother would be the 182nd case. Hopefully the discrepancy in
numbering will be resolved when the next WHO update is available.
