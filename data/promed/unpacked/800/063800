Large outbreak of _Salmonella enteritidis_ in north east London
--------------------------------------------------
Public health officials are investigating an outbreak of _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype Enteritidis phage type (PT) 1 linked to a shop
selling kebabs in north east London (1). The health authority was
first alerted to the outbreak on 12 Feb 2005 after 31 patients with
symptoms of food poisoning presented at the emergency department of
the local hospital. 195 cases have now been reported from various
sources, 87 of which have been confirmed as infections with the
serotype Enteritidis PT 1. This phage type showed a distinct reduced
sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. Another 12 specimens are positive for
salmonella and are awaiting typing.
The patients' symptoms included diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
fever, nausea, and headaches. Some suffered from dehydration and
confusion. A number of patients were admitted to hospital with
possible systemic infection. Analysis of 76 outbreak questionnaires
indicated that 70 percent of interviewed patients were male and 80
percent were aged under 40. Almost all of the patients (94 percent)
had eaten at the kebab shop on 10 Feb 2005, and 87 percent developed
symptoms on 11 Feb. The incubation period was less than 12 hours for
2/3 of the patients. Approximately 1/4 of the interviewed patients
were admitted to hospital for 1 night or more. Consumption of food
items such as chilli sauce, mayonnaise, salad, and chicken doner were
each reported by more than 60 percent of patients.
The kebab shop owners stopped selling food voluntarily on 12 Feb
2005. The shop owners were interviewed and it was determined that 3
staff members had been unwell since early on 11 Feb, but continued to
work. Clinical specimens were taken from all 6 staff. 2 staff members
tested positive for the same phage type of salmonella.
38 food samples from the shop and 2 samples from patients' homes were
taken, of which 14 were positive for _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Enteritidis PT 1. This type is the 2nd most common salmonella strain
in the United Kingdom and has been recently associated with Spanish
eggs and poultry, or travel to Spain [2]. A sample of 120 eggs was
obtained later from the shop's supplier but tested negative. 20
environmental samples were also taken from the shop, one of which (a
duster/wiping cloth) was positive for the organism.
8 food samples were positive for _Clostridium perfringens_ toxin, 6
of which were also contaminated with the salmonella. The toxin was
also detected in 1 of 11 stool samples as well as salmonella.
Assessment of the restaurant after the outbreak identified a number
of potentially risky hygiene practices.
All patients who were interviewed were asked about other people who
ate food with them at the kebab shop. Only 2 other people were
identified as possibly having eaten food from the restaurant, but
they did not develop symptoms. Based on the estimated 300 to 400
portions of food served each day and a reported 195 symptomatic cases
the attack rate currently appears to be around 50 percent.
Around 2000 cases of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis PT 1
are reported each year in the UK, some as part of outbreaks. This
outbreak is the largest outbreak of this salmonella type reported to
date in the United Kingdom.
