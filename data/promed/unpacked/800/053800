Total: 2781/ 59/ 111/ 1337

Notes:

Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.

1. Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national
level, probable cases are reported by all countries except the United
States of America, which is reporting suspected cases under investigation.

2. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of Affected Areas.

3. One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.

China
WHO is now planning to deepen discussions with health authorities in
Beijing. This action follows concerns, connected with yesterday's report
from a WHO investigative team, about SARS cases in Beijing and systems of
case reporting and contact tracing.

China is today reporting 10 new SARS cases, with 2 new deaths, compared
with yesterday.

In a separate development, 2 laboratories in China have announced detection
of a coronavirus in specimens taken from SARS patients. The new virus,
which is unlike any known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family,
was isolated by a WHO virtual network of 11 laboratories set up to expedite
identification of the etiological agent and development of a diagnostic
test. Detection of the coronavirus adds further evidence that the outbreak
that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November 2002 was caused by the
SARS virus.

Hong Kong
Health authorities in Hong Kong have today announced that all household
contacts of confirmed SARS patients will be required to confine themselves
at home for up to 10 days with immediate effect. The new measure is
intended to facilitate early detection and treatment of SARS cases and to
reduce to the absolute minimum the risk of further spread. With a
cumulative total of 998 cases and 28 deaths, Hong Kong ranks just below
China in the severity of the SARS outbreak.

Household contacts can choose between confinement in their homes and
confinement in holiday camps. No visitors are allowed during the
confinement period, and permission to leave homes or camps will be granted
only on exceptional grounds. During the confinement period, the Hong Kong
Department of Health will conduct medical checks to monitor health, and the
police force will conduct compliance checks. Officials in the Department of
Health estimate that an initial 70 to 80 households, representing around
150 persons, will be subject to the new requirement.

In a separate development, ongoing investigations of the source of
infection in the unusual cluster of cases in Amoy Gardens have failed to
detect the virus in animals. The findings refute previous hypotheses that
the SARS might have been spread by cockroaches or rodents, possibly through
some common system serving vertically connected flats. Most Amoy Gardens
cases have been residents in a single wing of a single building, Block E.

Singapore
In Singapore, particular concern has centered on a cluster of suspect and
probable SARS cases first noted on 5 Apr 2003 in 21 staff at the Tan Tock
Seng Hospital. Intensive investigation by WHO staff and Ministry of Health
officials have traced most cases to a single Chinese man in his 60s was had
been treated for chronic kidney disease and diabetes at another hospital
(Singapore General Hospital) from 5 to 20 Mar 2003. The hospital
subsequently experienced a cluster of 19 probable and 33 suspected SARS
cases in staff, visitors, and inpatients. Most have been linked to the
Chinese patient.

The second hospital-related cluster of SARS cases has now been linked to a
decision to transfer all patients at Singapore General Hospital to 2 wards
at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. It is strongly suspected that the second cluster
arose from contact with the Chinese patient. The investigation is providing
some reassurance about the cause of these cases, which increasingly appear
to fit the known pattern of exposure during close contact with patients.

Viet Nam
The number of cases in Viet Nam remains stable at 62. WHO staff and
Ministry of Health officials anticipate that additional cases, associated
with a case in a provincial hospital, may emerge in the next few days.
However, vigilance is high, contact tracing is intense, and good infection
control procedures are in place.

Canada
Health Canada has reported a cumulative total of 97 cases, with 10 deaths.
The represents an increase of only 3 new cases for the second consecutive
day. Ontario has reported 94 probable cases. All cases have occurred in
persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the
household or in a health-care setting. British Columbia has reported 3
probable cases.

Malaysia: history of third probable case
WHO staff are collaborating with health authorities in Malaysia to conduct
in-depth investigations, including history of recent travel and visits to
health facilities, of the country's 3 probable SARS cases in an effort to
prevent a wider outbreak. 2 new cases were reported today. Investigation of
the country's third case has revealed a history of travel to Beijing, China
and Bangkok, Thailand. Onset of illness occurred in Bangkok. Upon return to
Penang, Malaysia, the patient visited 2 private hospitals over a 2-day
period. Possible contacts are now being traced.

Active contact tracing is a sound and essential public health measure for
detecting persons who may have been exposed and alerting them to the steps
to take should symptoms develop. Contact tracing can also establish whether
all probable patients and suspect cases are linked together, through close
face-to-face contact, and thus determine whether any instance of secondary
transmission in the general community has occurred.

Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have been
reported from 17 countries. Increases occurred in Brazil (1), Canada (3),
China (10), Hong Kong SAR (28), Germany (1), Malaysia (2), Singapore (8),
and the United States (5). Deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong
SAR (3).

[In today's update a cumulative total of 2781 cases and 111 deaths have
been reported to WHO from 17 countries. Increases occurred in Brazil (1),
Canada (3), China (10), Hong Kong SAR (28), Germany (1), Malaysia (2),
Singapore (8), and the United States (5). Deaths were reported in China (2)
and Hong Kong SAR (3). Noteworthy was the identification of the novel
coronavirus in specimens from 2 cases of SARS in China. This adds to the
existing evidence that this new coronavirus is the etiologic agent for SARS
(see SARS - worldwide (38):etiology 20030410.0869 for more information on
the novel coronavirus as reported in today's New England Journal of
Medicine early release). The presentation of daily cases by WHO has been
changed to include the number of new cases reported since the last update,
and the status of cases included the number of deaths as well as the number
of cases considered to be recovered.

There is also mention of suspected outbreak in Beijing that will be
investigated in collaboration with the WHO team in country. - Mod.MPP]
