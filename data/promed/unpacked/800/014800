In October 1998, the Zoonosis Control Division of the Texas
Department of Health announced voluntary reporting of selected
zoonotic diseases by veterinarians.
The disease list includes; anthrax, canine brucellosis, Chagas'
disease, dengue, EEE, WEE, and VEE, hantavirus infections,
leishmaniasis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, Lyme disease, murine
typhus, plague, psittacosis, Q-fever, rabies, spotted fever group
rickettsias, tuberculosis, and tularemia.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the only state agency in the US
presently collecting disease and demographic data on diseases
in animal species which may affect human health. We are
interested in finding other states or provinces which collect data on
zoonotic diseases to compare experiences and share information.

[Congratulations to Texas! We do question the inclusion of dengue, however,
since that is not a zoonosis except in Asia, where the reservoir is
monkeys - Mod.JW]
