A 12-year-old boy was hospitalized in Indonesia for developing bird
flu symptoms and [on the basis of] earlier contacts with a dead
chicken, local press said Wednesday [9 Jan 2008]. He was admitted to
the Hasan Sadikin Hospital in the West Java capital of Bandung on
Tuesday [8 Jan 2008] with high fever, cough, and respiratory problems.
A relative said [the boy had] picked up a dead chicken in front of
the house with bare hands and threw it to a nearby river. The
following day, he became ill, reported major national newspaper
Tempo's website.
If confirmed, he could be the 108th bird flu case [but see below] in
the country, where 94 people have died of the virus to make the
world's highest death toll among any other affected countries.

[According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Table of the
Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/H5N1,
as of 3 Jan 2008, the number of cases for Indonesia is 116 and the
number of deaths 94; see,
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2007_03_29/en/index.html>.
The percentage of fatalities in Indonesia is approximately 81 percent
compared with 47 percent for Viet Nam, the next most severely
affected country.
If this case is confirmed, it will be the 117th case and the 95th
fatality in Indonesia, and the 349th case and 217th fatality from
avian H5N1 virus infection globally. The last previous confirmed case
of H5N1 avian influenza in Indonesia, also in West Java, was reported
