Tarija [department] reports 7 cases of [a] hantavirus [infection]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The person in charge of Zoonoses of the Departmental Health Services (SEDES), Claudia Montenegro, reported on Wednesday [10 Dec 2014] that 7 cases of [a] hantavirus infection were confirmed in Oruro [department] so far in 2014.

"We have 7 cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] that were laboratory positive from the beginning of the year [2014] to date in the whole department, but we must make clear that from these dates [onward] cases will increase because the rainy season comes and the populations of rodents will increase," she said.

Montenegro commented that because of the nice weather at this time of year, people go for excursions or to camp and that is when they are in contact with the rodents that transmit the hantaviruses.

The SEDES official said that it is difficult to contemplate eradication of the vector that transmits the hantavirus, which are mice, because they multiply rapidly in the field.

"None the less, surveillance work has improved and now it is a disease that does not cause fatalities or is highly lethal. Previously, a hantavirus [infection] case would die, there were no alternatives, but now of the 7 cases, just one died," she stated.

[These cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occurred in Tarija department and were confirmed in Oruro department. Previous cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia. The infections probably occurred somewhere in the department, but the specific localities where the infections might have been acquired or the dates of acquisition are not stated.

Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been occurring in the Bolivian tropics, including in Tarija department. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases last year (2013) in Bolivia are not given. In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts, and their images that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases is Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg). Other hantaviruses and their rodent hosts that have been found in lowland Bolivia and can cause HPS include:
- Bermejo (Chodo rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html), and
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).
