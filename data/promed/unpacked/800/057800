Officials of the Zoonosis Division of the Program Area of the
Secretariat of Health confirm 2 cases of hantavirus [infections] in
the mountain area of Chubut. One of those infected is a resident of
more than 50 years in the El Turbio area, which is accessed by
navigating Lake Puelo. The other case involves a youth of 23 years in
the Lagos Tres area of the Rio Pico locale. Both cases were confirmed
by the veterinarian Gustavo Martinez of the Zoonoses Division of the
Secretariat of Health in Esquel.

It is worth remembering that a few days ago, veterinarian Alejandra
Sandoval, Head of the Zoonosis Division of the Comodoro Rivadavia
Program Area stated that there have been 3 suspected hantavirus cases,
noting that this year [2011] has produced massive flowering of colihue
cane, so that in many mountain sectors from Neuquen to Chubut there
has appeared a super population of rodents, increasing the risk of
cases of this disease. [Colihue cane, _Chusquea culeou_, is a
gramineae perennial bush of the bamboo subfamily that grows in the
humid temperate forests of Chile and southwestern Argentina. -
Mod.TY].

Veterinarian Alejandra Sandoval stated that last Monday [15 Aug 2011],
the office of the Director of Prevalent Pathologies and Epidemiology,
a unit of the Chubut Secretariat of Health, issued a hantavirus
epidemiological alert. She indicated that this alert is established in
the areas of Rio Pico and El Turbio after the notification of 3
suspected cases. "Given the situation of constant migration of people
into and out of the province, it is necessary to increase the alert
and surveillance of said disease not only in the affected area, but
also in the region," Sandoval indicated.

During recent months, a marked increase in rodent population has been
noted due to the flowering of colihue cane. Up to now, the samples
indicate that the majority of the rodents observed are the
"long-tailed" type, the carriers of [a] hantavirus. Sandoval indicated
that far from generating alarm, the idea is to inform the people about
taking preventive measures. Surveillance for hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome is justified due to the high fatality rate (up to 50 per
cent), and the risk of outbreaks. Surveillance is fundamental to
identify risk areas and reservoirs as well, in order to guide control
measures.

[The specific hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified. As
noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses
have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus
(western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host,
_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in
central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central
Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in
northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western
Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Without laboratory confirmation,
it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was
involved.

A woman from the mountain area of Valle el Frio, in the Cochamo
community, was evacuated by helicopter and taken to Hospital Base
Puerto Montt, presenting with symptoms suspected of [a] hantavirus
[infection]. Another 2 individuals were taken to Puerto Montt,
suspected of having symptoms of [a] hantavirus [infection]. Despite
negative rapid tests, [the 3 persons] remain under observation
awaiting results from the ISP.

One of these patients is a family member of a 33 year old man from
Ventisqueros, who died of a fulminant [infection] this Friday morning
[12 Aug 2011], after being evacuated from this place, also presenting
with symptoms of [a] hantavirus [infection], which was confirmed by a
rapid test.

The area is under a health and agricultural alert due to the increase
in rodents.

[Although not specified, the hantavirus involved in these cases and
those in the report below are almost certain due to Andes virus.

This Tuesday [16 Aug 2011] the head of the health unit, Claudio
Vallejos, stated that there might be a 6th case [of hantavirus
infection], the nephew of the woman who died recently of [a]
hantavirus [infection]. The suspected case is currently in serious
condition connected to mechanical ventilation in intensive care,
awaiting confirmation [of a hantavirus infection] from the Institute
of Public Health.

In addition to the 5 confirmed cases and the suspected case, there are
2 other cases of hantavirus [infection] which occurred during this
summer [2010-11]. According to projections by the Health SEREMI
[Regional Ministerial Secretariat], new patients should continue to
appear with hantavirus [infections].

Despite the cold and frosts during this winter, [conditions] have not
been sufficient to completely exterminate the rodents, and it is
foreseen that with spring commencing, the presence of mice in the
region will increase.

As for prevention, the SEREMI indicted that they now have delivered
1000 kits to families at risk, that is to say in rural and isolated
areas, expecting to deliver more preventive measures in these areas
where there is greater presence of long-tailed [rats].
