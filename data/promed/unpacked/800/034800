The US soybean rust distribution map looks significantly different
from a year ago [2008], said a plant pathologist in the University of
Kentucky College of Agriculture. For the 1st time, soybean rust has
overwintered on kudzu without any break in detection in Alabama,
Georgia, and Louisiana.

This is an important development for 2 key reasons. First, infected
kudzu could serve as a springboard for movement of soybean rust to
soybeans under the right weather conditions.

Also, it is very common for storm systems to originate in the central
Gulf area. These storms commonly blow up the Mississippi River Valley
and into Kentucky. When there is significant disease activity in the
central Deep South, spores of the rust fungus commonly move in high
numbers across a broad span of northern production areas.

If this occurs early enough in the growing season, serious crop
damage could ensue. Only time will tell what, if any, effects the
overwintering has on soybean rust distribution or the 2009 soybean
crop.

[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, Asian rust) caused by the
fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean
crops of up to 70 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and
spreading in the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment
in Europe. Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of
_Fabaceae_, including kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), can also be affected
and may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Spores are spread locally by
splashing rain, or by wind over long distances. Fungicides may be
used in disease management, and partially resistant soybean lines are
available. However, new fungal strains with increased virulence and
fungicide resistances are emerging.

The disease was introduced into the USA in 2004 where it overwinters
in southern regions. Spores are carried northwards by prevailing
winds every season, and by the end of 2007 they had been reported as
far north as Canada. The new pathogen reservoir reported above
provides now a more northerly base for spore release. This may
increase the risk of spread earlier in the season, which would incur
more serious damage than later crop infections.

A related, but less virulent species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in
South America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms.
