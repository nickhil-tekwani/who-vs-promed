Since the beginning of the circulation of the Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus in Mayotte, at the end of November 2018, 143 human cases have been reported to the ARS [regional health agency; Agence Régionale de Santé] by the CHM [Mayotte hospital centre; Centre Hospitalier de Mayotte] laboratory, and 126 animal foci have been reported. As soon as the 1st cases arrived, preventive measures and vector control measures had been put in place on the island in order to limit the spread of the disease on the territory.

Although the number of cases has stabilized for several weeks, the Rift Valley fever virus still circulates in some communes of the island. Therefore, the health authorities reiterate the importance of continuing to respect preventive measures to prevent infection and prevent an epidemic recovery when the rainy season returns.

Epidemiological situation as of 16 Aug 2019:
- The total number since the beginning of the epizootic is 126 outbreaks of sick animals (100 cattle and 26 small ruminants) - that is, no new cases since 12 Jul [2019].
- The CHM laboratory has reported one new human case since 12 Jul [2019]. Thus, since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number is 143 human cases. Of the cases reported, 2 serious cases have been reported to date.

[Case numbers are subsiding indeed, but since the virus has probably become endemic (circulating at a low level since 2011), reemergence is probable when (naturally) established immunity in animals wanes. "The development of syndromic surveillance (abortion, death, etc) requires strengthening surveillance network and identification data quality" (https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01823470). - Mod.AS

It may be that that RVF virus has indeed become established in Mayotte in local aedes mosquitoes, where the virus can be passed transovarially via infected eggs to the next generation of mosquitoes. Dried mosquito eggs containing RVF virus can persist for months or even years and hatch when flooded with emerging adults ready to transmit the virus. - Mod.TY
