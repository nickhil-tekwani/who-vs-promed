Island Health says it is investigating confirmed cases of cholera contracted by people who ate herring eggs on Vancouver Island.

The health authority is now warning the public not to consume herring eggs found on kelp, seaweed or other surfaces that have been harvested from the French Creek to Qualicum Bay area, as they could be tainted. Island Health said there has been one confirmed case of cholera and 2 other suspected cases linked to eating herring eggs.

_Vibrio cholerae_ is a bacterium found in water that can cause intestinal illness including the disease cholera. Symptoms can include mild to severe nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea that can lead to severe dehydration - though Island Health says most infections are either asymptomatic or only result in mild diarrhea.

Anyone who has eaten herring eggs in the area and has fallen ill should drink small amounts of fluid frequently to stay hydrated and see a doctor, according to Island Health.

The bacteria can be passed from infected people even if they're not displaying symptoms, so the agency is recommending that people wash their hands well after using the bathroom or caring for someone who has contracted the illness.

Island Health says it is investigating the cases of infection along with the BC Center for Disease Control and the First Nations Health Authority, which will include testing water and food samples. It called the situation "unique" and said it will release more information as it becomes available. "Implications on future harvesting is unclear at this time," Island Health said in a statement. "Any future advice or recommendations will be made in partnership with First Nations communities."

A news release issued by the authority points out that a sanitary shellfish closure is also in effect for bivalves in the French Creek and Qualicum Bay area.

[ProMED-mail would like more information regarding the isolates here, especially the serotype. It is likely that the strains are non-O1, non-O139 types.

As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are non-virulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for cholera toxin as the non-toxigenic O1 in this posting. Some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least in some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP (6).

Every spring (http://www.pacificherring.org/explorer/life-cycle/eggs), adult herring congregate in huge numbers to spawn along coastal shores. Between February and April, depending on the location, the females lay their sticky eggs on seaweed, sea grass, or rough rocks. On average, each female herring lays 20 000 eggs. The males spread their sperm over the eggs, turning large swaths of the ocean into a characteristic turquoise blue color. A spawn event can stretch over many kilometers of shoreline. About 5285 km [3284 miles] of British Columbia's extensive coastline have been classified as herring spawning habitat. Of this, an estimated 300 to 600 km [186 to 373 miles], or about 1.8 per cent of BC's total shoreline length, is intensively utilized by herring spawners in a typical season. Unlike salmon, herring do not die after spawning, and they spawn every year. The eggs can be seen in a picture at the above URL.

British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada, located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. With an estimated population of 4.8 million as of 2017, it is Canada's 3rd-most populous province. It can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia.
