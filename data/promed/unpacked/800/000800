An _Escherichia coli_ outbreak in King County, Washington has sickened at least 3 children under the age of 5, according to the county's public health department. 2 of them developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially life-threatening complication of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections, and have been hospitalized. The 3rd child is recovering at home. The children reported eating fresh produce before becoming ill, but health officials have not yet determined the source of the outbreak.

"This looks like the beginning of an outbreak as the 3 cases were reported within 13 days of each other - all from the same county. Additionally, all had the dangerous form of _E. coli_ that produces harmful toxins," said Elliot Olsen, an attorney.

Symptoms of an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infection usually develop between 2 and 5 days after exposure but can appear within 24 hours, or take as long as 10 days to develop. They include stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is sometimes bloody. Sometimes these symptoms, which last about a week, are accompanied by a low-grade fever. A child with bloody diarrhea should receive immediate medical attention. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections should not be treated with antimicrobial agents as this can heighten the risk for complications such as HUS.

HUS primarily affects young children and occurs in about 10 per cent who have enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_infections. In addition to kidney failure, it can cause seizure, stroke and coma. Most children with HUS recover, but about 30 per cent of them will experience long-term health effects including chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, and chronic neurologic damage.
