MEASLES - AUSTRALIA (WESTERN AUSTRALIA): IMPORTATION RELATED

Measles - Australia
---------------------
Health officials are investigating an outbreak of measles in Perth,
Western Australia. Seven cases have been confirmed (one adult, 36
years old, and 6 children under 11 years old), all of whom were
un-immunized. The measles virus appears to have been introduced by
overseas visitors who were part of an entourage accompanying a
religious leader (AMMA) which arrived in Perth on 31 Mar 2006. The
entourage visited other Australian States and Territories over the
following 2-week period. Whilst in Perth, AMMA held several meetings
of up to 1000 people. The WA cases all attended meetings or had
contact with members of the entourage, and the 1st cases became ill
on 13 Apr 2006.
The spread of the disease has been facilitated by the low uptake of
the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in many of the people who
attended the meetings. The risk of measles transmission and secondary
cases in this cohort is therefore high both in Western Australia and
in the other states and territories visited by the entourage.
Un-immunized people who attended the meetings and contacts of cases
have been encouraged to receive MMR vaccine or immunoglobulin when
appropriate. An Australia-wide media statement has been issued
warning people who attend AMMA meetings of the potential risk of
measles transmission.
Measles virus has been isolated from one case; its genotype is pending.

[While ProMED-mail has not been covering measles extensively in areas
where it is known to be endemic, it appears as though there has been
a resurgence of measles activity in the recent past in areas that
have undertaken measles elimination activities, and where measles is
no longer considered to be endemic. From the below see also list, one
can see a pattern in which measles has been increasing and
reappearing in areas that have previously made great strides in
interruption of local transmission of the measles virus. The pattern
one can see in the prior ProMED-mail postings is that importations
seem to be a major source of the resurgence of measles virus. The
above report, for which ProMED-mail is very grateful to have received
directly from Dr. Carolien Giele of the Department of Health in
Western Australia, is another example of measles re-introduction
through an importation. In the above example, it appears as though
this is also associated with a subgroup of the population that may
reject vaccination on religious grounds, another challenge the public
health sector faces when undertaking disease elimination campaigns/activities.
The above report does not mention where the visiting entourage came
from. The group mentioned, AMMA has it's origins in Kerala India, but
today has centers in 33 countries worldwide. Of note is that a prior
outbreak of measles in South Australia was associated with a tourist
returning from India (see Measles - Australia (Victoria)
20010216.0309). Studies on the genotype of the measles virus involved
in the above outbreak should assist in identifying the country of
most probable origin of this outbreak.
For background information on the measles elimination strategy in
Australia, see <http://immunise.health.gov.au/measles.htm>.
We look forward to more information on the above outbreak as it
becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
