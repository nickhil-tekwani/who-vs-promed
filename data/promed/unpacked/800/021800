A West Nile virus [WNV] outbreak is currently (since early August
2010) going on in Central Macedonia (Northern Greece); 200 people
were diagnosed with West Nile disease so far, and 20 of them died
(Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention website).
Diagnosis was established serologically by ELISA, and dengue virus
and tick-borne encephalitis virus infections (and, thus, possible
cross-reactions) were excluded. The characterization of the etiologic
virus, however, is of great importance. Virus isolation or molecular
detection out of human clinical samples may be limited by a rather
fast virus clearance. Consequently, in order to detect the infecting
virus, mosquitoes were trapped in the region, in which the human and
(few) equine West Nile disease cases occurred.

In the ProMED-mail posting of 16 Aug 2010 [archive no. 20100816.2843]
Dr Anna Papa reported -- based on a short sequence -- the detection
of a lineage 2 West Nile virus in a pool of _Culex_ mosquitoes from
the affected region. We characterized this virus further by RT-PCR
and sequencing of the main neutralizing antigen, that is, the
envelope (E) protein gene and the most conserved polymerase gene,
commonly used for flavivirus phylogeny. The obtained sequences proved
to be more than 99 percent identical to the lineage 2 West Nile
virus, which emerged in Hungary in 2004 (Bakonyi et al, 2006). We
observed limited dispersal of this virus in Hungary in the following
years, until in summer 2008 an explosive spread of this lineage 2 WNV
strain was seen involving the entire territory of Hungary and the
eastern part of Austria. In Hungary West Nile disease was diagnosed
in humans (only rather mild cases of meningitis), horses (some of
which died), and especially several different species of birds,
mainly birds of prey.

The probably most vulnerable species of birds for this particular
lineage 2 WNV infection is the goshawk (_Accipiter gentilis_), which
develops frequently neuroinvasive disease and dies. Goshawks found
dead are therefore good indicators for this infection. In Austria, so
far, only birds were affected. The virus established itself in the
areas in which it was detected in summer 2008, and caused outbreaks
also in summer 2009, and in this summer [2010].

The apparently higher pathogenicity of the lineage 2 WNV in Greece,
compared to the same virus strain in Hungary and Austria, is somehow
surprising and should be watched closely. The currently ongoing
nucleotide sequencing of the whole virus genome of the Greek virus
strain will allow us to determine possible changes in the viral
genome, which may be responsible for an increased pathogenicity.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Nowotny and colleagues for this interesting
report. It will be interesting to see if results of the entire genome
sequencing of the apparently more virulent Greece WN virus compared
with the perhaps less virulent WN virus lineage 2 from Hungary and
Austria will lead to detection of the genetic basis for this
difference.
