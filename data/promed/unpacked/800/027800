Fungal attack poses threat to apple crop
----------------------------------------
At a time when apple harvesting is in the full swing, [an] outbreak of fungal disease 'Marssonina', which causes premature defoliation, is threatening orchards in the major apple-growing areas of the state [Himachal Pradesh]. The rapidly spreading disease is leading to panic among fruit growers as 80 percent of [the] apple crop is still to be harvested. Orchardists said the premature leaf fall has surfaced recently and [the] fungal attack was affecting the crop adversely in some areas.

"Humid climate is favourable for it," said plant protection scientist Ishwar Das Gupta. He said the problem can still be controlled by spraying fungicides. Reports being received at the horticulture department reveal that so far 5-6 percent [of the] apple crop has been affected due to premature defoliation in areas of Shimla, Kullu, Mandi, and Chamba districts, said Gupta.

Underlining the need of proper weed management in apple orchards, he said bushes and grass usually trigger the problem as the undergrowth causes dampness around the trees. He added that [some] rootstocks were resistant to premature leaf fall. [The disease] first appeared in epidemic form in Shimla and Kullu districts of the state in 1995.

[Marssonina blotch (MB) of apple is caused by the fungus _Diplocarpon mali_. It has been found in some countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Infections first appear on mature leaves. Symptoms may include spots on leaves and fruit as well as severe premature leaf fall. In affected orchards, apples nearing maturity are often seen hanging from defoliated branches. MB affects size, colour, and quality of fruit making the produce unsaleable. It also reduces fruit set in the following season.

The fungus is reported to survive between seasons in fallen leaf litter, and spores are spread by mechanical means and wind. MB development is favoured by humid conditions. Multiple cycles of infection may occur in one crop leading to severe epidemics. Disease management includes phytosanitary measures, cultural techniques, and fungicides.

Severe outbreaks of MB have occurred in Himachal Pradesh previously (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). In some years, concurrent occurrence of MB and apple scab (caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_) has been reported to have further increased disease pressure on apple crops in the area. In India, MB has also been reported from the states of Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh.
