Yellow rust, also known as stripe rust, is caused by _Puccinia striiformis_
f. sp. _tritici_, one of the most widespread wheat diseases in the world.
Yield losses can be as much as 40 percent. This pathogen reproduces
asexually, with no known alternate host, and spreads by means of airborne
dicaryotic uredospores. On the other hand, brown rust, also known as leaf
rust, is caused by _Puccinia triticina_.
Most cereal rust researchers have agreed to discontinue the use of
_Puccinia recondita_ f.sp. _tritici_. Thus, brown rust and leaf rust are
the same disease. The use of 2 names for the same disease does not help
indexing and bibliographical search, but those names have been used for
more than a century, and it would be difficult to drop one rather than the
other.
I am indebted to Ivan Sache for clarifying the taxonomic status of the
stripe rust pathogen.
