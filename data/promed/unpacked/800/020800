With the identification of 3 raccoons with rabies in Manhattan's
Central Park in recent months -- 2 during the past week -- the Health
Department is cautioning New Yorkers to stay away from raccoons,
skunks, bats, stray dogs and cats and other wild animals that can
carry rabies. The recent cluster of findings suggests that rabies is
being transmitted among raccoons in the park. The Health Department
is increasing surveillance efforts to determine the extent of the problem.

Raccoons are the most commonly reported rabid animal in New York
City. Rabid raccoons are a relatively common occurrence in the Bronx,
and many were found in Staten Island in 2006 and 2007. In Queens and
Manhattan, rabid raccoons have historically been rare, and rabid
raccoons have never been seen in Brooklyn. Bats with rabies have also
been found in all 5 boroughs. So far this year [2009], 20 rabid
animals have been identified in New York City: 14 raccoons from the
Bronx, 4 raccoons from Manhattan, one raccoon from Queens and one bat
from Staten Island.

People and unvaccinated animals can get rabies, most often from a
bite by an infected animal. Infection leads to a severe brain disease
that causes death unless the person is treated promptly. Despite the
risk, there has not been a human case of rabies in New York City
since 1953. To reduce the risk of rabies, New Yorkers should avoid
all wild animals as well as any animal that seems sick, disoriented
or unusually placid or aggressive. Report such animals by calling 311
[the emergency telephone number]. Animals that have attacked or may
attack should be reported to 911. Any bite or scratch from a raccoon,
or other animal capable of transmitting rabies, requires medical attention.

To protect yourself against rabies:

- Do not touch or feed wild animals, or stray dogs or cats.
- Keep garbage in tightly sealed containers.
- Stay away from any animal that is behaving aggressively or a wild
animal that appears ill or is acting unusually friendly. Call 311 or
your local police precinct to report the animal.
- If you find a bat indoors that may have had contact with someone,
don't release it before calling 311 to determine whether it should be
tested. For information on how to safely capture a bat, visit:
<http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/zoonoses/rabies/>.

To protect your pet against rabies:

- Make sure your dog or cat is up to date on rabies vaccinations.
- Keep your dog leashed while outdoors unless at a specified
off-leash area or park.
- Do not leave your pets outdoors unattended.
- Do not try to separate animals that are fighting.
- If your pet has been in contact with an animal that might be rabid,
contact your veterinarian, and report the incident to 311.
- Feed pets indoors.

If you are bitten or scratched by an animal:

- Immediately wash the wound with lots of soap and water. Seek
medical care from your health care provider.
- If the animal is un-owned and can be captured, call 311.
- If the animal is a pet, get the owner's name, address and telephone
number to give to the Health Department so they can ensure the animal
is not rabid.
- Call the Animal Bite Unit (212-676-2483) between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
during the week to report the bite. You can call 212-POISONS
(764-7667) during after hours and on weekends. You can also file a
report online at: <http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/vet/vetegp.shtml>.

For information about medical follow-up, call 311 or your medical provider.

[In the United States, 6 viral strains of rabies are carried by bats,
and 5 viral strains are carried by land mammals, i.e., 2 fox strains,
2 skunk strains, and a raccoon strain. All strains of rabies are 100
percent fatal. Raccoon strain rabies is just as deadly to the raccoon
as it is to untreated humans, but the latency period before symptoms
become active in both raccoons and humans is about 2 months -- and
sometimes up to 6 months -- which is enough time for a diseased
raccoon to mate and produce a litter of rabid raccoons.

Both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the
respective state departments of health have participated in programs
to eliminate raccoon rabies through an Oral Rabies Vaccine, usually
in a rural setting. Vaccinating wild raccoons is the most effective
way to stop raccoon rabies. An Oral Rabies Vaccine bait is inserted
within a compressed block of fishmeal and fish oil, which is very
attractive to raccoons. Dropped from planes or distributed by land
vehicles, the bait is quickly consumed within 5 days. Once consumed
by the raccoon, antibodies will develop within 2-3 weeks to protect
the newly vaccinated raccoon against exposure from rabid raccoons.
Small quantities consumed by domestic pets will not harm the animal,
but people with immunodeficiency may be prone to a local virus infection.

Fortunately raccoon rabies has but rarely resulted in a fatal case of
human rabies, possibly only once. While raccoons, skunks, foxes and
coyotes are considered high-risk sources of virus, bats are the most
common source of infection for people across the United States. For
example, from 1990 to 2003, there were 38 human rabies cases acquired
within the US. Two of those occurred in New York State, and none
occurred in New York City. Of the 38 cases, 32 were due to bats.
