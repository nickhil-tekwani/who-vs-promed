From: [A contributor who wished to remain anonymous contributed this
abstract in response to reading: Campylobacteriosis, cyclist - UK: (Wales),
sheep dropping 20081208.3858. The following was presented at this year's
International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases regarding a
similar 2007 outbreak which occurred in western Canada. - Mod.LL]


An investigation points towards contaminated mud as the source of a
_Campylobacter jejuni_ outbreak associated with a mountain bike race,
British Columbia, Canada, June-July 2007: TL Stuart, J Sandhu, R Stirling,
B Wong, P Martiquet, E Galanis

Background: One of the largest reported _C. jejuni_ outbreaks in Canada
occurred in June 2007 in a small community in British Columbia. It was
associated with a 67 km mountain bike race that took place in wet and muddy
conditions. There were 785 individuals who raced.

Methods: Case definitions were developed. A retrospective cohort study was
conducted to test hypotheses regarding potential exposures. Race
participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Samples of
mud and water from the race course were collected and tested for
_Campylobacter_, generic _Escherichia coli_ and total coliform counts.

Results: Of race participants who responded, 25 (5 per cent) met the
laboratory-confirmed case definition, 200 (36 per cent) the clinical
definition, and 312 (57 per cent) the well case definition. Although
individuals who drank cups of water from official stations had an increased
risk of developing illness (relative risk (RR) = 2.04, 95 per cent
confidence interval (CI) 1.44-2.88), no association between refilling
personal water supplies at stations and illness was seen. Drinking water
samples tested negative for _Campylobacter_ and 25 racers were ill despite
not drinking water from official stations. Racers who reported
inadvertently consuming mud had a RR of illness of 2.11 (95 per cent CI
1.50-2.97). After stratifying by consumption of cups of water, the
relationship between mud exposure and illness remained. Mud samples tested
negative for _Campylobacter_, but most were positive for generic _E. coli_,
with coliform counts in some samples exceeding 24 192/100mL.

Conclusions: Mud contaminated with human or animal feces was the likely
source of _Campylobacter_. As _Campylobacter_ is difficult to isolate from
the environment, it is not surprising that samples taken 3 weeks after the
race were not positive for the organism. The presence of _E. coli_ and high
coliform counts along the trail suggests that fecal contamination was
present. The association between water consumption and illness was likely
due to contamination of the water with mud from racers' hands, lips and
faces. Recommendations include the use of fenders to decrease splashing and
hoses at water stations to clean water bottles, gloves and faces. The race
course should be surveyed to remove visible animal feces and racers
educated on potential risks associated with accidental mud ingestion.
