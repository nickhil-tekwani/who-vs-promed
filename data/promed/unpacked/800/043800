Newcastle disease in Thailand
--------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of Newcastle disease in Thailand reported to the
OIE: 1996).
Information received on 12 Jul 2004 from Dr. Yukol Limlamthong, Director
General, Department of Livestock Development, Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives, Bangkok.
Date of the report: 12 Jul 2004.
Within the framework of the active clinical surveillance for highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), an outbreak of Newcastle disease was
found in Nong-Kane subdistrict, Dong-Luang district, Mukdahan province (in
the eastern part of the country).
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 11 Jul 2004.
Estimated date of primary infection: 7 Jul 2004.
Description of affected population: native poultry, ducks, geese.
Total number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 3204.
Total number of deaths: 8.
Total number of birds destroyed: 3196.
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: North-Eastern Regional Veterinary
Research and Development Centre (Khon-Kaen province).
Diagnostic tests used:
- virus isolation by egg inoculation;
- hemagglutination test;
- hemagglutination inhibition test (against Newcastle disease virus antigen);
- intravenous pathogenicity test is in process.
Source of agent / origin of infection: under investigation.
Control measures:
- stamping out (the birds in the area were depopulated within 24 hours due
to suspicion of HPAI);
- quarantine of the affected farm;
- movement control inside the country.
[Newcastle Disease in domestic poultry is another viral disease of birds
that can decimate a local, or national, poultry industry. Fortunately, the
zoonotic implications are limited to mild conjunctivitis, not at all in the
same league as avian influenza. - Mod.PC]

[If you view disease control as a series of intertwined costs and benefits,
a moderately important benefit of the unfortunate avian influenza situation
in Thailand is the development of surveillance systems for animal health.
This report shows the system for surveillance is working. I would love to
see an animal health economist's analysis of the costs, and long term
benefits, of the AI outbreak. Just getting past the staggering initial
eradication costs would be a difficult undertaking, I suspect. But, if a
good animal health infrastructure is developed, there may be some small
compensatory benefits in the long run. - Mod.PC]
