[The dengue virus outbreak in Lahore continues. An article in the 26
Nov 2008 edition of The Times
(<http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=61000>) quotes a ministry
of health spokesperson indicating that so far 1149 patients of dengue
fever had been reported in Lahore while total of 1219 dengue patients
had been reported in Punjab province. A week ago, Lahore had 1099
dengue cases and Punjab province had 1150 (see ProMED-mail archive
no. 20081124.3710). There is no information about measures taken to
control the _Aedes_ mosquito vector of dengue virus, nor an
indication of which of the 4 dengue virus serotypes is involved in
this outbreak.

The Health Ministry said on Monday [24 Nov 2008] that more than 78
500 dengue fever cases were recorded so far this year [2008], with 79
people who died.

The number of dengue fever patients in October [2008] grew by over 20
percent while the number of deaths was reduced by 7 year on year.

In November [2008], the disease spread widely in many provinces and
cities, totaling 15 000 new cases, 15 deaths.

The Hanoi Department of Health said Hanoi had nearly 1700 patients in
November [2008] with no deaths.

Dengue fever patients in the capital city [Hanoi] live in 170
communes and wards of 21 districts. Around 81 percent of them are in
the inner city and 89 percent are adults.

in central and southern provinces of Viet Nam have created stagnant
bodies of water and perfect breeding grounds for the mosquitoes,
causing the spread of the disease [virus].

Dengue fever patients have overloaded the Ho Chi Minh City Hospital
for Tropical Diseases recently, with between 30 and 50 adult patients
admitted every day.

Ho Chi Minh City doctors have reported an alarming increase in the
number of dengue fever cases, up to 3 times the number of cases
usually reported at this time of year.

Health workers are also reporting an increase in the number of adults
falling victim to the mosquito-borne virus.

HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases Deputy Director Tran Tinh Hien
said the hospital had admitted between 150 and 200 dengue fever
patients. "The hospital receives between 30 and 50 cases a day," Hien
said. "Most patients come from District 2, District 7, and Tan Binh
District. The number of cases is double or sometimes triple the
number we had at the same time last year [2007]," he said.

Until October this year [2008], the hospital, the city's main
facility for treating dengue patients, had admitted 9600 dengue
cases, 70 percent of which were adults. Hien said patients of up to
50 year-olds had been admitted. Usually the maximum age for dengue
patients was 25, he said.

The increase in the number of cases has been blamed on this year's
[2008] extended rainy season, which usually ends in late October and
the increasingly polluted urban environment that has created ideal
conditions for mosquitoes to breed.

Health authorities expect there will be more cases of dengue fever in
Cairns, in far north Queensland, after 2 people were diagnosed with
the mosquito-borne disease [virus].

An outbreak has been declared, with the Tropical Population Health
Service also investigating another 5 suspected cases.

Medical entomologist Dr Scott Ritchie says the infections are centred
in the Cairns north area.

"The worrisome thing about this is it's in an area of older housing
and with the rains that we've had in the last fortnight, we suspect
there's a fair amount of mosquito breeding going on in the area," he
said.

It is 4 years since the last outbreak of dengue fever in Cairns, when
29 people fell ill.

Weeks of speculation on the existence of dengue fever in the
Federation were affirmed yesterday evening (26 Nov 2008) when the
Ministry of Health stated in a press release that over 2-dozen cases
of the disease have been found.

According to the release, "a number of tests were sent to the
Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC) lab for confirmation" by the
Ministry of Health, and those tests have finally returned with a
positive result.

Rumours of residents suffering from the symptoms of dengue fever were
first addressed by the Ministry of Health on 23 Sep [2008] after an
upsurge in the number of reported cases in Trinidad and Guyana.

That advisory stated that there were "no reported cases of dengue in
St. Kitts and Nevis [but] since the Federation is in relatively
proximity to affected areas, prevention and surveillance efforts must
be given the highest priority."

Anecdotal reports of the disease then spread like wildfire shortly
after the torrential rainfall of Hurricane Omar created numerous
pools of standing water in St. Kitts-Nevis -- a major breeding ground
for dengue fever's [virus] top carrier, mosquitoes.

The Ministry of Health attempted to allay fears of the disease with a
1 Nov [2008] release, which stated that there still had been no
confirmed cases, but it did go on to note that a "number of persons
[were] presenting to medical practitioners with fever, pain, and
other symptoms and signs suggesting dengue virus infection."

The final confirmation of dengue fever after the CAREC tests means
that "the mosquito that spreads dengue viruses remains highly active"
in the Federation, the Ministry's release said.

It was further stated that individuals should make it their top
priority to "eradicate" mosquito breeding grounds on and around their
property by draining any standing water and contacting the
Environmental Health Department through their local health center if
assistance is required.

[Health authorities are to be commended for their vigilance and
preparations for the arrival of dengue virus on St. Kits. One hopes
that their efforts to reduce vector mosquito breeding sites are
successful.

The president of the College of Physicians, Dr Waldo Ariel Suero,
issued an alert notice to the responsible authorities in reaction to
so many cases of dengue, leptospirosis, and rabies, which he said
were currently registered in public and private [health] centers in
the country.

According to Suero, the numbers of registered deaths and cases of
dengue fever are worrisome.

Public Health said that to date [27 Nov 2008] there are 3623
registered dengue cases and 30 people have died, which signifies that
there is one death for every 120 cases of the disease, while last
year [2007] there was one death per 222 [cases].

[In response, 2 physicians said] "We need an explanation because if
in 2007 to epidemiological week 48, there were 9101 cases and 41
died, that is one [death] for every 222 cases, then why now with only
3623 cases there have been 30 deaths, that is double [the case
fatality rate], one for every 120 ill people," they added.

Dengue is reported from various sectors of the capital city (Santo Domingo).

[There is no obvious explanation for the highly statistically
different case fatality rates with 2008 higher than in 2007. Three
possibilities are: (1) differences in reporting, with non-fatal cases
in 2008 being underreported; (2) the dengue virus strains circulating
in 2008 being more virulent than those in 2007; or (3) a dengue virus
serotype is circulating in 2008 and is different from that being
transmitted in 2007 and before, with immune enhancement of infection
in patients infected in previous years.

However, an article in Prensa Latina of 30 Nov 2008
(<http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7BA25622D2-0242-4DE5-B78D-E20A0F97AB2A%7D)&language=EN>)
indicated that there has been an increase to nearly 5000 dengue cases
and nearly 100 dengue-related deaths, which raises questions about
the reliability of the 2008 case fatality rates reported above. The
source of the case statistics reported in Prensa Latina was
attributed to "epidemiological sources," without specifying who or
what those sources might be, or how many of these cases had been
laboratory confirmed. The article stated that fumigation for vector
control had begun.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving any additional information
about this dengue outbreak. A comparative genetic analysis of the
dengue viruses being transmitted in 2007 and 2008 would be
interesting.
