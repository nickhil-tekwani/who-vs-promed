[While not specifically mentioned in the newswire, the above event
occurred in Pune, located in Maharashtra state. The above newswire is
vague in terms of a description of the symptoms associated with
ingestion of the sweet liquid product, and epidemiologic information
other than suggesting that the symptoms had onset presumably soon
after ingestion of the implicated product, a severe illness requiring
hospitalization and a predominance of children affected. This paucity
of information makes any speculation regarding the actual cause
rather difficult. The implicated etiologic "agent" (?toxin) is most
likely something that is water soluble as it appears to have been in
the sweet liquid. The preponderance of children affected may well
reflect the contaminated product, a sweet liquid, being a product
preferred by children, although that information is not provided in
the above newswire.

Some heavy metals are water soluble as are other toxins like ethelene
glycol and blue-green algae toxins. The sweet liquid could
potentially contain a variety of bacterial toxins.

Hopefully some test on the substance is being conducted. We look
forward to some more authoritative information when available.
