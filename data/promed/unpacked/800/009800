Eid-ul-Zuha (or Bakr-Id, as it is commonly known) [in Arabic Eid
al-Adha, Muslim "feast of sacrifice," "Festival of Sacrifice," or
"Greater Eid"] is turning out to be a costly affair for many a Muslim
family, and mysterious too.

At least 120 sheep and goats bought by Bangaloreans for Bakr-Id from
Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu and Dharmavaram in Andhra Pradesh have died
of a mysterious condition overnight. This has sent the buyers into a
tizzy after having wasted their monies on buying the livestock cheaper
from outside the state than from markets within the city.

Up to 30 Muslim families from Chamarajpet, Basavanagudi, Mysore Road,
Kamanahalli and adjoining areas in Bangalore who decided to buy goats
and sheep from Krishnagiri and Dharmavaram were in for a shock when
the sacrificial animals they had procured were found dead the very
next morning.

Syed Amanullah, a real estate agent from Chamarjpet, told DNA: "Before
buying the 5 sheep 3 days ago from Dharmavaram, we checked their
health. But the next day, all 5 were dead after reaching Bangalore.
Mine is not the only case. There are more than 30 people here whose
sheep and goats bought from neighbouring states and districts have
died mysteriously."

The deaths turned into a hotly argued issue on Friday evening [4 Nov
2011] as the aggrieved families were left with their pockets so much
lighter with just 2 days to go for Bakr-Id (on 7 Nov 2011).

The breeders merely speculated that the deaths could be due to a
sudden change in the weather. But this has not been verified, as such
a trend was not generally observed before.

The buyers are now suspecting foul play, presuming that they have been
taken for a ride, as the sellers from the neighbouring states had not
disclosed to them the nature of disease affecting the goats and
sheep.

[A rather blurred event, sudden deaths of purchased sheep/goats
affecting simultaneously 30 households do not seem related to a
"natural" disease but rather to toxic etiology. If a veterinary
investigation is implemented, results will be appreciated.
