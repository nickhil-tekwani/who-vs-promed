Moscow Threatened by Malaria
Moscow public health and epidemic monitoring authority is afraid of a mass
outbreak of malaria. As many as 14 people have been treated in isolation
hospitals since the beginning of the year. When summer starts, the
situation may become unpredictable if the municipal disinfecting station
fails to give prompt treatment to the local stagnant ponds, in which the
larvae of malaria mosquitoes have been discovered.
[Correspondent Every morning entomologists from the public health service
take up their nets and look for the larvae of anopheles mosquitoes in
Moscow's ponds. The malaria carriers do not look different from ordinary
woodland mosquitoes. Last year they were exterminated manually, as it were,
by scattering bacterial insecticides on all the local areas of water. Since
the beginning of 2000, fighting mosquitoes has [not been funded.
Meanwhile, as many as 14 people have already been treated in isolation
hospitals.
For [a trader from Tajikistan the diagnosis came as no surprise. It was a
usual 3 day bout of malaria. Guests from this country regularly appear in
[the Moscow isolation hospital at Sokolinaya Gora. His neighbor, a man
from Pakistan, has had malaria for two months but thought it was flu. The
disease is called a great imitator. It is easier to prevent it than to
diagnose.
There is no panacea against malaria. Not long ago all [Russian tourist
companies were instructed to issue notices to their customers and advise
them to take proper medicines before going on safari, for instance. [This
has not been required to date.

[As I could clear from Moscow, the medical authorities did not exclude a
possibility of secondary local cases of malaria in Moscow. Investigations
of each case of malaria are continued. - Alex Vladyko, ProMED-mail Regional
