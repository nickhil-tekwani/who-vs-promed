A death and 6 cases in only one month has San Diego County's public health department sounding an ever-louder alarm about wound botulism among the region's black tar heroin users.

According to the latest update from the county Health and Human Services Agency, released Friday afternoon, 20 Apr 2018, a 67-year-old man died recently despite being treated with antitoxin after he was hospitalized with botulism symptoms, which can range from double vision and slurred speech to drooping eyelids and difficulty swallowing.

Dr. Sayone Thihalolipavan, the county's deputy public health officer, said it is the largest concentration of wound botulism cases ever recorded in San Diego County and appears to be the 1st local death caused by the disease, spurring heightened vigilance in local emergency rooms, intensive care wards and drug treatment centers.

"It's definitely very concerning because we haven't seen this many cases before; we're not aware of similar cases in surrounding counties, and we've already had one death. That's why we're trying to do everything we can to get the word out," Thihalolipavan said. The physician added that it is the street drug itself that appears to be the problem. Investigators suspect that there is a supply of black tar heroin in the community that is infected with _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that produces the powerful neurotoxin that causes wound botulism.

It is extra bad news for a drug treatment community already struggling to respond not just to black tar heroin smuggled across the border with Mexico but also with the trend of creating fake heroin by mixing the potent pain killer fentanyl with other ingredients designed to mimic black tar heroin. A bad mixing job makes overdose more likely.

Jeanne McAlister, chief executive of the McAlister Institute, a large drug and alcohol treatment center in San Diego, said that she and her employees have definitely noticed a sustained increase in the availability of black tar heroin on local streets as the price of prescription opioids increases due to a wide-ranging clampdown on overprescribing.

"It's cheaper and more potent at the same time, and it's much more available, absolutely," McAlister said. "I just know that, if I wanted to, I could walk out on the street and in 2 blocks be able to buy something." She said the main focus of treatment centers is currently overdose. The idea that the drugs that people are taking may be contaminated with deadly bacteria has not yet gotten into the public consciousness. "We're going to have to keep an eye out for that for sure," McAlister said. Left untreated, wound botulism causes progressive paralysis, starting with the face and moving toward the legs. The most severe complications occur when the toxin paralyzes the muscles of the chest, causing respiratory failure.

As to why San Diego is seeing an uptick in wound botulism cases while other Southern California counties aren't, Thihalolipavan said investigators have found no clear answer. They have discovered, however, that those who have gotten infected have not been part of the same homeless population recently hit by the region's deadly hepatitis A outbreak. The fact that these infections are occurring among drug users makes diagnosis more difficult. Many of the symptoms of wound botulism are similar to those of heroin overdose, and it may take some time to discover the true cause.

"Even if they're seeking treatment, providers might not be recognizing it for what it is," Thihalolipavan said. "Patients can think they're feeling out of whack due to the drug itself and not realize that the drug is actually contaminated."

According to San Diego's 2017 prescription drug abuse report card, heroin addiction is a growing reason listed for admission to local drug treatment programs. In 2012, heroin made up 23 percent of all admissions, but that number increased to 28 percent by 2016, the most recent year for which records are available. Prescription pain medications, by comparison, have seen the opposite trend over the same span. In 2012, prescription pain meds were 4.7 percent of admissions compared to 4.1 percent in 2016. According to taskforce research, there were 45 overdose deaths in 2016 among non-prescription opioid users and 205 prescription opioid overdose deaths.

[The following is a discussion regarding black tar heroin, which, because of being injected intramuscularly, can subject the injected drug user to a number of infections, including botulism, tetanus, and necrotizing fasciitis http://www.drugaddictiontreatment.com/types-of-addiction/heroin-types-of-addiction/comparing-heroin-and-black-tar/:

"Black tar heroin is a type of illegal narcotic derived from morphine. Commonly called black tar heroin, heroin content is not actually what distinguishes this particular drug from other kinds of opiates. While black tar does contain an amount of heroin that can range from 29 to 80 percent, the drug is actually identified by the amount of comparatively crude derivatives of morphine that result from incomplete acetylation. Without delving into the chemistry too exhaustively, black tar is an unrefined product that is made without the complex equipment and chemicals necessary to produce heroin with a high level of purity. Black tar is manufactured primarily in Mexico, and is also commonly referred to as black, brown, manteca, night, or dark. It is also produced in smaller quantities in other parts of Latin America.

"Black tar use has spread throughout North America and can also be found in parts of Europe. Since the drug does not require the advanced equipment necessary to make pure heroin in white powder form, it is relatively cheap to manufacture and therefore cheap to purchase. It is less expensive to buy than white powder heroin, and it is much less expensive than commonly abused prescription opiates such as Vicodin or OxyContin.

"Black tar is distinct in appearance from white powder heroin. It ranges in color from black to light brown, and it is sold either as a cola-like chunk, a coarse powder, or a sticky substance with the consistency of melted tar, hence the name. Black tar can be injected in its tar-like form, snorted in its powder form, or smoked. The effects of black tar are similar to the effects of other kinds of opiates, and include feelings of euphoria, relaxation, loss of anxiety, and anesthesia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and dry mouth.

"The most common method of using black tar is injection, and this method poses risks apart from the dangers of the drug itself. For one, black tar users frequently suffer from venous sclerosis, a condition in which the veins shrink and harden. It may become impossible for users to inject intravenously if they develop venous sclerosis, forcing them to resort to subcutaneous injection. However, this method includes its own risks, such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. When black tar users inject repeatedly, they put themselves at risk for contracting wound botulism due to the impurities and adulterants present in the drug. The sticky consistency of the drug may also put users at greater risk of HIV if they are washing needles and reusing them.

"The cheapness of black tar has helped to make it comparatively popular among young users who are inexperienced with drug use. Complications from drug use are more common when users are inexperienced. In addition, the impurities present in black tar, as well as the inconsistent ratio of heroin present in the drug, make overdose or death from complications due to the adulterants much more likely. Like all derivatives of morphine, black tar is extremely addictive. Dependency can occur after very few uses, and tolerance can also increase rapidly, causing users to experience irresistible cravings for increasingly large amounts of the drug." - Mod.LL
