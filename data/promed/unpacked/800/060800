Suspected Fifth Case of Variant CJD in France
---------------------------------------------
PARIS: A fifth potential case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
[abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail, the human form of
mad cow disease, has been identified in France, according to a government
website. The French National Institute of Health, which updates the number
of identified cases each month, said on its Web site [
that it suspected a new case of the fatal, brain-wasting illness. That
would bring the total number of confirmed or suspected cases of vCJD in
France to 5. So far 3 people in France have died from vCJD, which
scientists believe is caused by eating beef products from cattle infected
with mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

Annick Alperovitch, who studies vCJD at national research institute INSERM
in Paris, stated that the patient displayed all the characteristics of the
variant form of the disease. Only postmortem tests can determine with
absolute certainty the presence of the disease, although biopsies on living
people are viewed as fairly reliable.

Those who contract vCJD suffer loss of coordination, confusion and
personality changes. More than 100 people have died from the disease, most
of them in Britain, and estimates of the eventual human toll vary widely.

Last month French researchers said as few as 205 Britons may die from vCJD,
a forecast that was sharply lower than the tens of thousands of victims
seen in previous studies.
