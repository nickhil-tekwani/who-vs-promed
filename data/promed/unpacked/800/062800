A 45-year-old woman suspected of suffering from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo fever, was shifted to an isolation ward in Rajkot Civil Hospital on [Fri 30 Mar 2018]. Her blood samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for testing. The report is expected in the next 5 days.

According to civil hospital sources, the woman belongs to Khijadia village in Rajkot district. Rajkot's chief district health officer (CDHO) Dr Mitesh Bhanderi said, "She was suffering from fever and had red spots on her skin. Our PHC (primary health centre) team visited her house and referred her to a civil hospital, where she was admitted to the dermatology department for the last 12 days. The doctors suspecting infection of CCHF virus, shifted her to an isolation ward." The woman's condition is stated to be stable.

Sources said the woman is a cattle breeder in Khijadia and that's why doctors at civil hospital suspect infection of CCHF virus. Doctors said they did not see much improvement in her condition during the treatment, and she also started bleeding from the red spots on her skin, which was unusual, they added.

The district health officer has sent a team in Khijadia village to verify if other people engaged in the same profession have complained of anything unusual and how many cases of fever were registered at the village PHC.

[In India, CCHF cases have been reported from Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh states. In 2017, CCHF cases were reported in Gujarat from the Rajkot and Sabarkantha districts.

The 1st cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were reported in Gujarat state of India in January 2011, resulting in 3 deaths in confirmed and suspected cases of CCHF, which included 2 health care workers (http://www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/topics/cchf/en/). Another notifiable outbreak occurred in July 2013 in Karyana Village, Amreli district, Gujarat State. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity against domestic animals https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229708.

During 2012-2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer) - Mod.UBA
