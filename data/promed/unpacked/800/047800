Niger: Hepatitis E Outbreak (Situation 12 Oct 2017)
----------------------------------------------------
New cases of hepatitis E are still being presented and recorded in the region of Diffa. Since the declaration of the epidemic by the Health authorities on the [Wed 19 Apr] 2017, a total of 1987 cases have been declared with 38 deaths recorded. Up to [Tue 25 Apr 2017] the mortality rate was 29 percent dropping to 1.91 percent by [Thu 12 Oct 2017]. Analysis of reported cases reveal that women and people aged 15 and over are the most likely affected.

Personnel from the Health authorities and partners from the Humanitarian sector are working jointly to ensure an effective response to those in need.

[The dramatic drop in the case fatality rate of this outbreak of hepatitis E suggests that most of the cases are not occurring in pregnant women. Much of the mortality in hepatitis E occurs in women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.

The following regarding hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy is extracted from: Chaudhry SA, Verma N and Koren G: Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy. Can Fam Physician. 2015; 6(7)1: 607-608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4501603/.

"Hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester, especially with genotype 1, is associated with more severe infection and might lead to fulminant hepatic failure and maternal death (11-13). Although the mechanism of liver injury is not yet clear, it is possible that interplay of hormonal and immunologic changes during pregnancy, along with a high viral load of HEV, renders the woman more vulnerable (14). Immunologic changes during pregnancy promote the maintenance of the fetus in the maternal environment by suppression of T cell-mediated immunity, rendering pregnant women more susceptible to viral infections like HEV infection. During pregnancy, levels of progesterone, estrogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin increase as pregnancy advances. These hormones play a considerable role in altering immune regulation and increasing viral replications (15).

"Hepatitis E infection with genotype 1 during the 3rd trimester can lead to maternal mortality in up to 15 percent to 25 percent of cases (16). Most of the studies showing high maternal mortality are from India, where infection occurs in epidemics. There is a very high risk of vertical transmission of HEV from the mother to the fetus. During a Delhi epidemic, a hospital-based study revealed that HEV infection during pregnancy was associated with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death in 56 percent of infants (6). One recent study highlights that HEV infection might be responsible for 2400 to 3000 stillbirths each year in developing countries, with many additional fetal deaths linked to antenatal maternal deaths (11). There is a very high risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women with HEV infection, with poor neonatal survival rates (11,17). In 2 separate studies from India, 15 percent to 50 percent of live-born infants of mothers with HEV infection died within one week of birth (11,18). During an outbreak in Sudan in 2010 to 2011, among 39 pregnant women with HEV infection there were 14 intrauterine deaths and 9 premature deliveries (19)."
