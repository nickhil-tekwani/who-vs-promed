Three epidemiologists from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention are investigating a cholera outbreak that has killed two
Salvadorans and affected at least 55 others this year. The team of two
Americans and one Peruvian has been working to identify the source of the
outbreak and help prevent its spread since arriving in El Salvador on
Tuesday. The bacteria have been traced to vegetables grown near the Las
Canas River in the communities of Soyapango and Tonacatepeque but there
could be additional sources, scientist Ellen Steimberg told reporters
Saturday.

MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Cholera is sweeping southern Somalia, where a
hospital director said Monday that at least 60 deaths have been confirmed
and doctors are struggling to treat hundreds of infected people. Many more
people were feared to have died in the drought-stricken countryside while
trying to make it to the hospital in Bardera, 250 miles southwest of the
Somali capital, Mogadishu.
Dr. Qasim Aden Egal, the hospital's director, said wards were overflowing
with about 250 cholera patients arriving from rural areas and nearby
refugee camps.
The article reported that the United Nations Children's Fund donated some
crates of porridge and a solution to help fight dehydration, but the UNICEF
supplies were not nearly enough to handle so many patients, local health
authorities said.
Officials said the cholera outbreak in Somalia's arid Gedo region, where
drinkable water is scarce, has been complicated by an influx of refugees
arriving mainly from northeastern Kenya.
According to the story, thousands of families reportedly have gathered
around a river running through Bardera to drink the dirty water. There have
been reports of dysentery in the region.
Local officials in Gedo appealed to the international community for more
help. However, many aid agencies have pulled their foreign staff out of the
area since a Kenyan working with the Italian aid agency Terra Nova was
slain last month.

Nairobi - The mystery epidemic ravaging the Coast is cholera, the
provincial medical director admitted yesterday. Dr S.K. Shariff said the
death toll had risen from 18 to 28, but denied reports by local councilors
that 132 people had died. He revealed, however, that he could not account
for people who have died in remote villages, where people have to walk more
than 15 kilometres to the nearest health centre. Dr Shariff said that the
cause of the outbreak was believed to be contaminated water from the River
Jombo. He appealed to residents to boil all water before use. More than 160
people have been admitted with cholera in the four health centres that
serve the area, which has an estimated population of 90,000.
The centres - at Vanga, Perani, Manda and Lunga Lunga - were yesterday
overflowing with patients. Three mobile clinics have been set up to help
fight the epidemic. Schools in the area have been closed and classrooms are
being used as wards for hundreds of patients receiving oral-rehydration
treatment (ORT) - a drink made of sugar and salt boiled in clean water
which helps to replace lost body fluids. Dr Shariff said a huge consignment
of antibiotics and intravenous fluids had been sent to the area. In
addition, four medical teams of three people each have pitched tents in the
villages to educate people about basic hygiene, environmental cleanliness
and sanitation. He said that more than 40 medical workers were in the
affected villages to fight the outbreak. Manda, Menzamwenye, Mwena, Bodo,
Kiwegu, Mwangulu Vanga and Lunga-Lunga are believed to be hardest hit.
Dr Shariff said the only NGO currently helping the government fight the
epidemic was the Aga Khan Health Services, working in parts of Kinango and
Samburu divisions. Chief Juma Pashua called an urgent baraza at Vanga to
tell villagers how to avoid catching the disease. He urged them to boil
water before drinking, ensure personal hygiene and environmental
cleanliness and dig and use pit latrines. A tour of the area yesterday
revealed a dismal and chaotic situation. Bottles of intravenous fluid were
hung from any available structure. Hundreds of people were camped at Manda
Primary School and Lunga Lunga dispensary compound, where they have been
for the last fortnight. Mattresses were laid on the floors of the
classrooms, verandahs and any other available space.
Overworked health workers were attending to the victims, the majority of
whom were women, children and the elderly. An official from the Kwale
District health office, Mr. Wilson Fondo, who is supervising treatment and
control of the epidemic, said more than 700 people had been treated over
the previous three weeks. He described as sterling the efforts of medical
teams. However, he said they were unable to do much since they had run out
of ORT, which is imperative to save many of the patients. Mr. Fondo added:
"We need drugs, we need personnel and we need all manner of assistance to
deal with this epidemic if we do not want it to get out of control." Dr
Shariff denied that all the diarrhoea cases in the affected areas were
caused by cholera, saying the majority of them were just severe diarrhoea.
"The situation on the ground is now under control and there is no cause of
alarm as medical personnel and drugs are available for those affected," he
said. Cholera, an acute intestinal infection is characterised by severe
diarrhoea and cramps and is caused by taking food or water contaminated
with bacteria.

Diarrhoea Kills 40 In Liberia, February 10, 1999
Source: News Media
MONROVIA, Liberia (PANA) - A diarrhoea epidemic spreading from Liberia's
northeastern Nimba county has killed 40 people, the chief medical officer
of the country, Dr. Nathaniel Bartee, told PANA in Monrovia Wednesday.
Other reports put the toll of the disease at some 100 people, but Bartee
said in an interview that health workers could be confusing cholera deaths
with those of diarrhoea. He said that following laboratory tests in
neighboring Cote d'Ivoire and Europe the disease has been diagnosed as the
Shigella diarrhoea, and that there are "few drugs in the country to combat
it."
The disease, according to Bartee, first surfaced in last June in Nimba,
some 250 km northeast of Monrovia, and has now spread to other parts of the
country. He said said the disease, referred to by rural dwellers as
"Samson" due to its strong resistance to several drugs, was now affecting
many persons in Liberia's central Bong and Margibi counties.
The symptom of the diarrhoea is a trait of bloody stool and fever which
could lead to death "within a couple of days" if not given immediate and
appropriate medical attention, he said. Bartee said since just few
expensive drugs were available in the country to treat the disease,
government was exploring avenues to acquire less expensive ones such as
nalidixic acid for widespread use in the country. He said the health
ministry has developed a protocol of identifying and treating the disease
for presentation to donors to help in providing the required drugs. Bartee
said the health ministry and NGOs have also formed a health partnership
team to launch an awareness campaign in parts of the country affected by
the epidemic, believed to be a water-borne disease. The medical
coordinator of the French charity, Medecins Sans Frontiers, Bart Depoorter,
recently told reporters that an assessment team which included Save the
Children-UK had recorded 50 deaths from the disease in central Liberia
alone, besides reports of hundreds of causes at various health posts.

Ten more people have died of cholera in Lusaka, Ndola and Kitwe. The death
toll from the epidemic in Lusaka now stands at more than 50. Ndola has
recorded 29 deaths and Kitwe three. Four people have died in Lusaka, three
in Ndola and three in Kitwe while 14 others are admitted to Kitwe Central
Hospital centre. Lusaka's Chawama alone had at least four deaths before
midday yesterday. Health minister Nkandu Luo and Local Government and
Housing Deputy Minister Elizabeth Kalenga closed 10 bars and restaurants at
Kitwe's Kapoto market, and confiscated raw meat and iceblocks from
marketeers at the sprawling Ipusukilo township in the city. They also
closed down a drug store selling prescribed drugs off the counter without a
licence.
Prof Luo, astounded by the state of bars and restaurants she entered, said
the council should ensure the business houses should not re-open until they
improved sanitation and water facilities. Ms Kalenga also ordered the
council to close its fee paying lavatory at the market for being in a
deplorable state. "I want you to close down that lavatory and rehabilitate
it before opening it to the public," she told senior KCC officials. Kitwe
council assistant public relations officer Dorothy Sampa said three people
were reported to have died of cholera in Maposa and the council had gone to
verify the reports. "Some residents of Maposa have reported that three
people have died of cholera but medical officials have gone there to verify
the reports and also transport one of the bodies which is still there," Ms
Sampa said.
Reports said a woman who died had travelled to Ndola to attend a funeral of
person who had died of cholera. In Ndola, Prof Luo ordered the closure of
two bars in Nkwazi. The council has banned the sale of fresh foods at
Masala and Nkwazi markets. Prof Luo criticised the cholera task force for
chlorinating wells as a preventive measure. She said it was a sheer waste
of money. "Money spent on chlorinating wells is money badly spent. There is
the dilution factor and you do not know the volume of water in the well,"
Prof Luo said. Prof Luo also inspected pit latrines. She lamented the dirty
surroundings that Zambians had got used to living in. She was accompanied
by Local Government and Housing Deputy Minister Elizabeth Kalenga, Central
Board of Health director-general Gavin Silwamba, Ndola Mayor Stanslous
Kazembe, Copperbelt Permanent Secretary Ngosa Simbyakula and town clerk
Emmanuel Chenda and officials from the cholera task force.
A Times team in Lusaka found the anti-cholera centre in Chawama, the most
cholera infested township in the capital, busy with medical staff bringing
in scores of suspected cases while relatives mourned their dead. Vendors at
Chawama market said: "We shall not stop selling our products unless the
council promises that it will provide food to our families." Lusaka Mayor
Patricia Nawa told Egyptian ambassador to Zambia, Safwat Ayoub at her
office that the Lusaka City Council (LCC) was scouting for funds to erect
fee-paying communal lavatories in townships to avert the periodic cholera
outbreaks.
In another incident, Ngwerere primary school faced an outbreak of cholera
with 21 pupils taken to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) after
complaining of abdominal pains. After thorough examinations, it was
discovered that drinks from the tuckshop were contaminated. And health
authorities in Kabwe are chlorinating water in wells in all the townships
and two rapid response teams are working to limit the water-borne disease.
District health acting director Henry Fumbeshi said yesterday the wells in
townships were being chlorinated to prevent any outbreak of cholera. In
Chongwe ZIS reports that the district health director Charles Chinyama has
denied reports that cholera had broken out in Ngwerere killing one person.
Mr. Chinyama said the reported case of cholera death was from Kabanana
shanty township near Ngwerere in Lusaka urban district and not Chongwe.

CBH Controls Cholera Death Announcements
February 24, 1999
Written by: Brighton Phiri
Lusaka - The Central Board of Health (CBH) has ordered nonmedical staff to
stop issuing statements on the cholera outbreak which has now spread to
Nyimba district in the Eastern Province.
Reacting to media reports quoting district council spokespersons, CBH
spokesman Dr. Ben Chirwa said wrong figures of new cholera cases and deaths
were being issued by the officials without the approval of the medical
experts involved in the fight against the epidemic.
"Such statements are misleading as they do not distinguish between genuine
cholera and diarrhoea cases occurring in the local communities," Dr. Chirwa
said. He said the board was worried that all deaths occurring in the
communities were being considered as cholera cases.
Dr. Chirwa said all cholera centres in the country were recording a decline
in the number of cases. According to Dr. Chirwa, the certified number of
people who have died from cholera was 45 while the rest died from either
diarrhoea or HIV and AIDS related diseases.

Gastroenteritis India, Febuary 15
Source: Internet News Media
DINDIGUL, Feb. 10.
The sudden outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in Dindigul district and a
steady arrival of patients found the Batlagundu Government Hospital
struggling to cope with the situation, due to its inadequate
infrastructure. They also brought to light the late reaction of the
district administration. According to the villagers, the gastroenteritis
resurfaced this year, claiming two lives last year. They feel that a
permanent solution to the problem is the need of the hour.
In Batlagundu and the surrounding villages, two persons had died and 110
were admitted with the symptoms of the disease since February 4. The
district health sources in Batlagundu admitted that the symptoms of acute
diarrhoeal disorders were reported from the villages from the very
beginning of this month. As many as 28 persons were treated by the Primary
Health Centre at Ayyampalayam and one of them, Kuruvammal (75) of
Pattiveeranpatti died on February 4. By the time the district
administration could think of serious preventive measures, it spread to
villages in and around Batlagundu. Since Tuesday, according to a senior
physician in the hospital, nearly 80 persons were admitted with the
symptoms of which one Krishnasamy of a nearby hamlet died.
The hospital was struggling to accommodate the steady arrival of patients
with the symptoms as it had a bed-strength of just 30 and the
administration, could not cope with the sudden rush. Hence, they
accommodated the patients in verandahs and in open space inside the
premises. Sticks were being used to hang the IVfluids sachets and the
doctors had to hop from one corner to another to treat the patients. "We
have no other alternative at present," said a paramedical staff. As
Batlagundu is a major town for several nearby villages, the people feel
that the hospital should be upgraded with more bed strength and latest
equipment.
Works were initiated to erect a temporary shed to accommodate the patients.
Officials urged the residents of Batlagundu to get themselves inoculated.
The Revenue Divisional Officer also made alternative arrangements to house
the patients in a nearby school. Authorities have sent the specimen to the
laboratory in Madurai Medical College Hospital to ascertain the exact
nature of the epidemic. The report is awaited.
Top health officials, and a host of doctors from Primary Health Centres,
were camping in Batlagundu to take care of the patients. According to them,
enough medicines were available in the hospital. They also asked the civic
authorities to plug the holes in the contaminated areas. The health
officials hoped that with nearly half of the patients responding to the
treatment and being discharged, the spread of the disease would be
contained in a day or two
