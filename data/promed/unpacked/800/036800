Anthrax outbreak in Kruger
--------------------------
An anthrax outbreak in the Kruger National Park (KNP) claimed at
least 65 animals in September 2010. The actual [number of] deaths
could be much higher as carcasses are not easily found and the park
has only one dedicated team on the ground. The 1st case was noted in
May, and since then, the disease has spread along the rivers and
spruits in the northern parts of the park (Shingwedzi area), a
pattern typically associated with anthrax.

"While anthrax may evoke horror images of letter bombs and terror
attacks, it is not a disease generally associated with human deaths.
In the KNP, anthrax poses no threat to tourists as people can only be
infected through contact with an infected animal," says At Dekker,
lab technician of the state veterinary department based in Skukuza.
According to Dr Valerius de Vos (professor extraordinary), veterinary
ecologist and renowned anthrax expert, the disease is an integral
part of the eco-system and, though the present outbreak is closely
monitored, it is not regarded as something out of the ordinary. Dr de
Vos, who, while he was employed in the KNP and had studied the
disease for 40 years, found spores on 250 year old bones in the Pafuri area.

Anthrax is endemic to the Pafuri region of Kruger and has its own
peculiar pattern and cycles as observed by Dr de Vos over many years.
An infected animal sets the cycle in motion, which is then sustained
and spread by blow flies and animals feeding on infected foliage.
Animals with a phosphate and calcium shortage do tend to chew on old
bones. Anthrax outbreaks occur in 10 to 20 year intervals in Kruger,
depending on several factors such as rainfall and population density.
The last outbreak was towards the end of 2009 in the Pafuri region
north of the Levuvhu river when about 150 animals died.

While most animals are susceptible to the disease, kudu, waterbuck,
roan antelope and buffalo are more vulnerable to infection due to
their feeding habits. Birds cannot be affected, but vultures,
especially, are known as carriers of the spore. After feeding on an
infected carcass, vultures wash themselves and defecate in shallow,
stagnant pools and so shed millions of spores in the water where the
spores then usually settle at the bottom of the pool. The herd
activity of buffalo in these pools stirs the spores to the surface
where, mostly the bigger bulls drink. This year, notably half of the
number of carcasses found was buffalo.

[The KNP takes anthrax seriously though this report rather downplays
it because of tourists. They have outstanding data going back many
decades. For a long time anthrax outbreaks in the Pafuri drainage
were Group B strains but following extensive flooding the Group B
spores were washed away and replaced by Group A strains spreading up
from the central parts of the KNP.

The best descriptions I know of the epidemiology of wildlife anthrax
in the KNP are Smith et al. 1999 "Meso-scale ecology of anthrax in
southern Africa: a pilot study of diversity and clustering," Journal
of Applied Microbiology, 1999, 87: 204-207; and Smith et al. 2000.
"Bacillus anthracis diversity in Kruger National Park," Journal of
Clinical Microbiology 38(10):3780-3784.

Anyone thinking that vulture contamination of their bathwater is
limited to southern Africa should think again. We have recovered
anthrax spores from the sediment in a Texas cattle trough, albeit a
shallow and narrow one, used by turkey vultures. - Mod.MHJ]
