Blast disease reported in some rice areas
-----------------------------------------
Farmers in regions 2 and 3 have reported a moderate incidence of
blast disease in their fields, a press release from the Guyana Rice
Development Board (GRDB) said yesterday [6 Aug 2008].

The GRDB said farmers, particularly those cultivating the rustic line,
have found evidence of the disease on their farms. It said the disease
is normally prevalent in the 2nd growing season (2nd crop) and its
severity increases with distance from the tidal flat. Areas 3-5 miles
[5-8 km] from the tidal flat or riverbank are vulnerable to the
disease "because of the high relative humidity and lack of air
movement."

Plants affected by the disease will have lesions or spots on the leaf
blade or necrotic areas on the borders of older leaves. It may also
affect the panicle -- defined by an online dictionary as "any loose,
diversely branching flower cluster" -- by developing necrotic areas
at its base which may result in no grain set or may cause only the
upper section of the panicle to produce normal grains, depending on
the time the disease occurred.

The GRDB said too high nitrogen (urea) application rates, high
relative humidity, high plant density, prolonged overcast conditions
along with frequent drizzles or dew are all factors that contribute
to the onset and severity of the disease.

Control measures include using resistant varieties especially during
the 2nd growing season as rustic [rice] is susceptible to the blast
disease organism. Farmers can also avoid high plant density (seed
rate) and avoid [large] quantities of nitrogen (urea) application in a
single dose on susceptible varieties. The GRDB said chemicals
(fungicides) are also available that can provide acceptable control of
blast disease.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_. It is one
of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide, often killing the
host. Yield losses of more than 50 percent are reported in infected
fields. Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are
influenced by climatic conditions. More than 50 species of grasses
and sedges can be affected, but most strains isolated from rice can
only infect a limited number of cultivars. The disease is spread by
infected plant debris, mechanical means, water, and wind. Disease
management may include fungicides and cultural practices, but relies
mainly on resistant varieties. The fungus is highly variable,
however, and new strains are emerging, breaking down host resistance.
