"Movements of birds and avian influenza from Asia into Alaska." Kevin
Winkler et. al.
Abstract:
Asian-origin avian influenza (AI) viruses are spread in part by
migratory birds. In Alaska, diverse avian hosts from Asia and the
Americas overlap in a region of intercontinental avifaunal mixing.
This region is hypothesized to be a zone of Asia-to-America virus
transfer because birds there can mingle in waters contaminated by
wild-bird-origin AI viruses. Our 7 years of AI virus surveillance
among waterfowl and shorebirds in this region (1998-2004; 8254
samples) showed remarkably low infection rates (0.06 percent) [There
were only 5 positive samples, and none were H5. - Mod.MHJ]. Our
findings suggest an Arctic effect on viral ecology caused perhaps by
low ecosystem productivity and low host densities relative to
available water. Combined with a synthesis of avian diversity and
abundance, intercontinental host movements, and genetic analyses, our
results suggest that the risk and probably the frequency of
intercontinental virus transfer in this region are relatively low.
Discussion:
Our surveillance did not show a "hotspot" of AI virus infection among
avian hosts. Much higher infection rates are known from other
multiyear surveillance studies at lower latitudes, e.g., Delaware Bay
(4.7 percent, [32]), southern Minnesota (10.8 percent, [5]), and
Alberta (22.2 percent, [32]) and British Columbia in Canada (55
percent, although only a single-year study, [33]). The infection
rates we found are substantially lower than those found for interior
Alaska (9 percent, [12]). Arctic conditions in Alaska prevail well
south of the Arctic Circle in the treeless regions of western Alaska,
and the US Arctic includes the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian
Archipelago (34), a tundra ecosystem where our sampling was
concentrated (for Figure go to source). Aerial surveys of waterfowl
across Alaska show more ponds and fewer ducks per unit area on
tundra; the number of ducks per pond on tundra habitat (2.1) is less
than half the number found in the boreal-forest dominated interior
(5.5, [18]). This simple ecologic factor (perhaps due to the lower
productivity of these tundra ecosystems), resulting in the dilution
of virus in waters with fewer available hosts, may in part explain
our results. This is the 1st geographically and taxonomically
extensive Arctic AI surveillance in North America, and it suggests
that some Arctic effect lowers infection rates, thus lowering the
risk of intercontinental viral transfer in these high-latitude
regions. Our infection rates are low, comparable to those occurring
at much lower latitudes (e.g., 9,35), whereas mid-latitude rates can
be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher (33).
Human population densities in Alaska are relatively low, especially
in the Beringian Crucible, and Alaska lacks a large agricultural
sector. However, mammalian carnivores abound and could be susceptible
hosts (36). Direct human infection from wild birds is possible, but
transmission from birds to humans is difficult (37,38). Nevertheless,
exposure in this region may be considerable; hunters kill around 99
000 waterbirds for food each year on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta alone (39).
Although the existence of North American and Eurasian viral lineages
is well established in the literature, evidence from other regions of
North America has shown that geographic structure has been
insufficient to prevent sporadic intercontinental exchange of some
hemagglutinin subtypes (29,40). Our results can be considered to
confirm the comparative rarity of such events in this important
region of Alaska. Despite high diversity of host species and high
numbers of individual birds in Alaska making intercontinental
movements, the low AI infection rates and the genetic attributes of
virus isolates (29) suggest that at most only small numbers of
Asian-origin AI viruses or genes likely arrive in Alaska annually.
Although AI viruses from Alaska have a clear link with other viruses
in the lower 48 US states (29), the predominance of Arctic ecologic
conditions and the lack of agriculture in the Alaska region most
affected suggest a low risk for intercontinental viral transfer in this region.

[One should never say "never", but the authors' comment that "the
risk and probably the frequency of intercontinental virus transfer in
this region are relatively low" would seem to be cautiously on the
high side, that is, the risk is probably negligible. - Mod.MHJ, JW]
