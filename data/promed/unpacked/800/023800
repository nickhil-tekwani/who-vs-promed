Bacterial canker is rediscovered in UK
--------------------------------------
Bacterial canker has been found in 2 tomato nurseries in the UK for
the 1st time in 10 years. ADAS [Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service] plant pathologist Tim O'Neill said the disease, which can be
carried either on the seed coat or in the seed embryo, is
particularly infectious and difficult to control due to a shortage of
effective chemicals.

Bacterial canker produces a range of symptoms, several of which can
be mistaken for other diseases. Some are superficial, where the
disease is not yet being carried in the plant's internal transport
system, and others are systemic. Superficial symptoms are spread by
water splash and include small irregular pale areas on foliage, white
mealy pustules on one side of the stem, and bird's eye spotting of
fruit. Once the disease is systemic, either because the seed embryo
was infected or where bacteria have entered the plant through pruning
wounds or damaged roots, leaves develop pale "windows" and plants
wilt and die. "Seed is considered the main source but bacterial ooze,
which has dried on structures or tools, is how the disease can
survive," said O'Neill.

Propagation nurseries have a statutory duty to report an outbreak but
there is no similar requirement for production nurseries, although
O'Neill said it would be good practice to report an outbreak so that
it was properly identified. "An outbreak can be contained if the
disease is detected early and there is no superficial infection," he
said.

[_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ (CMM) causes
bacterial canker on field and glasshouse tomatoes resulting in up to
70 percent yield loss. Its host range also includes a number of wild
relatives of tomato and solanaceous weeds, which may serve as
pathogen reservoirs. The bacterium has been found in various
locations worldwide. Its wide distribution accounts for a high risk
of new incursions, and this may have happened in the UK. The pathogen
is included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO).

Symptoms on tomato include wilting, degeneration of vascular tissues,
and necrotic lesions resulting in stem cankers. Fruits may fail to
develop or drop prematurely. CMM is spread by water and mechanical
means and is seed transmitted at a rate of around one percent.
Seedlings from contaminated seed appear healthy, symptoms appear only
as plants approach maturity. The bacterium survives for a long time
in plant debris and on equipment and remains viable for at least 8
months in seeds. Disease management relies on the use of clean seed
and plant hygiene measures (elimination of pathogen sources).
Resistant germplasm is available but has not yet been incorporated to
any significant degree into commercial tomato cultivars.

The genus also includes a number of other plant pathogenic species,
for example potato ring rot is caused by _C. m._ subsp.
_sepedonicus_, and ratoon stunt of sugarcane is caused by _C. xyli_
subsp. _xyli_.
