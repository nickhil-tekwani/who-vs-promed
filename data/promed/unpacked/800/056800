Worrying increase of malaria in Colon
-------------------------------------
Health and epidemiology officials in the department of Colon met with representatives of the Ministry of Health to evaluate the increase of malaria cases.

Most of the cases have been recorded in Sonaguera, Sheba, Tocoa, Trujillo, and Santa Fe districts: by the end of February 95 cases had been recorded in the city of Sonaguera, 93 in Tocoa, 91 in Trujillo, 62 in Sheba, and 19 in Santa Fe.

The remaining five municipalities have only recorded a few cases: 8 cases in
