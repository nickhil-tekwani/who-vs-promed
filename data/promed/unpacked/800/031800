Officials say a visitor to Yosemite National Park has recovered after becoming the 9th person diagnosed with a deadly rodent-borne illness blamed for 3 deaths linked to the park.

National Park Service spokesman John Quinley said Thursday the California resident stayed in the "Signature" cabins in the park's historic Curry Village in early July [2012]. The majority of the virus cases involved guests at the cabins. One visitor stayed at High Sierra camps in Yosemite's wilderness areas.

The disease [virus] is carried in the feces, urine and saliva of deer mice and other rodents, and carried on airborne particles and dust. People can be infected by inhaling the virus or by handling infected rodents. Infected people usually have flu-like symptoms including fever, shortness of breath, chills and muscle and body aches.

[One assumes that the latest infected individual survived his infection, since no mention was made of another fatality and the number of deaths remains at 3. The specific hantavirus involved in this case is not stated but is doubtless Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in California. Its rodent host is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_. The park is prudent to close the Curry Village camp grounds and to caution park visitors about the risk of exposure.
