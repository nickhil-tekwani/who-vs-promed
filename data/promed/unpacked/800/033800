The Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer
Protection and Human Welfare [Rospotrebnadzor] reported that during
the 1st 7 months of 2007, 26 cases of TBE were registered in the
Federal city of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region [province].
As of 20 Aug 2007, 8398 persons have [been reported to have] suffered
from tick bites, 1382 of whom were children. The greatest numbers of
victims have been registered in territories of the Kurortny district
(406), and the Primorsky district (150), and also Pushkinsky district
(49), and the Moscow district (45). Decrease [end?] of tick activity
this year is predicted for 15 Oct 2007 [when temperatures are
expected to fall too low for tick activity in the region. - Mod.JW]

[During all of 2006, 70 patients with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE),
including 7 children less than 14 years of age, were registered in
the territory of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region. The level
of morbidity was 1.52 per 100 000 population; the increase in
morbidity in comparison with 2005 was 2.2-fold. For the last 5 years
the greatest parameter [?rate], 2.9, was registered in 2003. See
<http://www.epid.ru/docs/infdoc19.html> (in Russian).
As the season of tick activity comes to an end, the epidemiological
situation of TBE in the given region is better than in other
territories. - Mod.NP

The seasonal activity of ticks is continuing. According to
Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services for
Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] data, from 1 Apr to 21 Aug
2007, 27 916 people have suffered from tick bites in the Sverdlovsk
region [province], including 4744 children. The number of cases is
higher this year [2007] than last [2006]. A total of 631 people were
hospitalized with a preliminary tick-borne encephalitis diagnosis,
110 of them were children. The diagnosis was confirmed in 158 cases.
Anna Ojiganova, Press-secretary of Rospotrebnadzor in the Sverdlovsk
region has reported that August is a month of increased tick
activity. Activity will fall only in October. Therefore, it is
necessary to take preventive measures during outdoor activities.
Besides, Rospotrebnadzor reminded the public that vaccination against
tick-borne disease could be performed all year round.

At this time, the danger is coming not from the forests but from the
plains [steppes]. During this period ordinary forest ticks fall into
hibernation, while their not less bloodthirsty plain 'brothers'
remain awake up to the 1st snow. Epidemiologists' advice is to be
careful during outdoor activities.
This year [2007], 13 000 residents of South Ural have suffered from
tick bites. Almost one third of them were children. A total of 52
cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been confirmed. All the
infected have received appropriate treatment and are being
followed-up by specialists.

Primorskiy region exceeded the average Russian indicator [?rate] of
tick-borne encephalitis by more than 40 percent. More than 5000
people have consulted doctors because of tick bites and 5 people have died.
Lidiya Sklyar, PhD, Associate Professor of Infectious Disease
Department comments that epidemical niduses [foci] have been
registered in West & East Siberia, in the Urals, in the Far East
(Primorsky region), & also in Leningrad, Archangelsk, Smolensk,
Pskov, Tver, Kaliningrad, Volgograd, Yaroslav, and other regions.
Since 1990 not less than 5000 tick-borne encephalitis cases are being
registered in Russia annually.
Most cases (93 percent) are registered in the Urals, West & East
Siberia regions. Currently, 65-80 percent of cases are being detected
among urban inhabitants [perhaps because they have easier access to
hospitals? I doubt that the cities are full of ticks; they probably
get them on weekend excursions to the country-side. - Mod.JW] It is
known that the number of tick bites exceeds the number of cases of
disease by 1.5-2 times. The mortality rate is dependent on the
region, particularly -- in the European part of Russia it is 0-1
percent, in Siberia it reaches 2-3 percent, and in the Far East it is
12-35 percent, which is explained by differences in the pathogenicity
of strains [but see comment below. - Mod.JW].
Therefore, immunization is very important in highly endemic regions.
Currently, 5 types of vaccines are being used in Russia and all of
them are highly immunogenic; 2 weeks after the last dose, immunity
develops among 90-97 percent of immunized people.

[TBE is caused by 3 related viruses, distinguishable by sequencing,
known as the European, Central Siberian & Far Eastern
subtypes. Infection with any one of them confers life-long immunity
to all. It is not clear whether the higher mortality in the Far East
is due to greater virulence of the strain or differences in
hospitalization and treatment between the regions. The natural
reservoir of the virus is in small mammals such as rodents & shrews,
moles & hedgehogs, which are hosts to developing stages of the tick
transmitters. - Mod.JW]
