Case Count Update
--------
Since the last update on 6 Oct 2015, 35 more ill people have been reported from 14 states. Illnesses that occurred after 15 Sep 2015 might not be reported yet. A series of events occurs between the time a person is infected and the time public health officials can determine that the person is part of an outbreak. This means that there will be a delay between when a person gets sick and confirmation that he or she is part of an outbreak. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks. Also, cucumbers have a shelf life of up to 14 days.

As of 13 Oct 2015, 767 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Poona have been reported from 36 states. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Alaska (16), Arizona (118), Arkansas (11), California (205), Colorado (18), Florida (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (24), Illinois (9), Indiana (4), Iowa (6), Kansas (2), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (5), Maryland (1), Minnesota (38), Missouri (12), Montana (15), Nebraska (7), Nevada (14), New Mexico (31), New York (6), North Dakota (6), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (12), Oregon (21), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Texas (38), Utah (53), Virginia (1), Washington (24), Wisconsin (42), and Wyoming (7).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Jul 2015 to 29 Sep 2015.
