Pet food manufacturers were cited as telling the BSE inquiry in London
that, after taking scientific advice, they had collectively adopted a
voluntary ban on the use of brain, spinal cord and other potentially
dangerous cattle offals in June 1989. A similar ban covering food intended
for human consumption was not introduced by the Government until five
months later and, according to earlier evidence submitted to the inquiry,
not properly enforced until 1995.
One company, Spillers Petfoods, said that it had stopped using cattle
spleen, brains and spinal cord in July 1988, a year and four months before
these items were banned from human food. Another firm, Pedigree
Masterfoods, said that it had stopped using some beef-derived items,
including brain, tonsils, thymus and intestines as early as the late 1970s,
but had continued using a limited amount of bovine spleen and spinal cord
until mid-1989.

halt in UK FSE cases it recommenced at a sporadic low level, believed to be
related to the use of imported continental products. - Mod.MHJ
