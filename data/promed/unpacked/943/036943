Another case of suspected Foot-and-Mouth disease has emerged in mainland
Europe, as the authorities in north-west Denmark placed a farm under
quarantine. However, the Danish news agency Ritzau said preliminary test
results have showed no trace of the disease.
A cow from a farm near Lemvig had blisters on its tongue, but veterinary
officials said it showed no other symptoms of the disease, which has been
found on more than 50 farms and abattoirs in the UK in the last 2 weeks.
The cow tested negatively in a preliminary test on Saturday [3 Mar 2001],
but a definitive result was not expected until Monday evening, Ritzau said.
The Danish Food Administration has toughened hygiene regulations,
temporarily banning all private food imports and limiting visits to cattle
farms.
