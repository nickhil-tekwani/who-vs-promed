Thailand is working on effective strategies to prevent an avian
influenza outbreak and respond to the continuing possibility of a
bird flu pandemic.
Presiding a seminar to draft Thailand's 2008-2010 avian flu and
influenza prevention strategy, Deputy Prime Minister Paiboon
Wattanasiritham, said the bird flu problem is worrisome. Therefore,
agencies concerned must take seriously their responsibility to
brainstorm ideas to achieve 4 target strategies -- to control any
bird flu outbreak among poultry, to prevent the spread of influenza
between humans, to improve surveillance and medical treatment, and to
create systematic cooperation. The new strategies will be proposed to
the cabinet for approval, together with a requested budget of Thai
Baht 10 billion [USD 304 million] to implement the plan.
The public health ministry projected that, if the H5N1 mutates into a
form that spreads easily among humans, there could be millions of
infections and the number of deaths could reach 143 000. However, the
World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly said there is no
evidence that such a mutation has occurred, or will take place.
Last week the government approved a budget of Thai Baht 1.5 billion
[approx. USD 45.6 million] to manufacture flu vaccines to be prepared
[in case of an emergency situation].
From 1997 to 2007, bird flu outbreaks in poultry occurred in 61
countries, and human cases of bird flu [were recorded] in 12 countries.

[Thailand's last outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was recorded in January 2007,
within the framework of an intensive surveillance campaign undertaken
from 3 Jan to 3 Feb 2007. Its last follow-up report to the OIE [World
Organization for Animal Health], dated 20 Apr 2007, can be accessed at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5226>

It will be interesting to note if another active surveillance
campaign is being contemplated for Thailand during 2007. - Mod.AS]

Vietnamese agriculture authorities say the current outbreak of bird
flu has spread to 2 more provinces, bringing the number of cities and
provinces affected by the disease to 10.
The national animal health department says about 2000 birds were
killed at a farm in Hoa Lu district, Ninh Binh province, after 250
poultry died of the H5N1 bird flu virus there.
The department also says about 950 poultry have been killed at a farm
in the northern province of Bac Ninh after bird flu was discovered there.
Viet Nam had been praised by international public health authorities
for its success in controlling the disease. Last week [21-27 May
2007], however, Vietnamese authorities said a farmer in Vinh Phuc
province had tested positive for bird flu. He is Viet Nam's 1st human
case of the virus since late 2005.
The World Health Organization [WHO] says bird flu has infected 93
people in Viet Nam and killed 42 of them since 2003.

Bird flu has hit another province in northern Viet Nam, despite
government efforts to halt its spread, the Agriculture Ministry said
on Monday [28 May 2007].
Tests on ducks and chicken at a poultry farm in Bac Ninh province,
just 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Hanoi, showed they were infected
with the H5N1 virus, the ministry's Animal Health Department said,
[and added that] all 950 birds on the farm were slaughtered
immediately on 25 May 2007.
The latest outbreak took to 10 the number of cities and provinces
struck by the H5N1 virus in less than a month, the department said.
Many of the provinces that have detected the infection this month
[May 2007], are along the national north-south Highway One,
suggesting poultry movement should be tightened further to keep the
virus from spreading, officials said.
The Animal Health Department said 36 provinces had completed the 1st
phase of poultry vaccinations against bird flu.
The Agriculture Ministry said it held a national conference of animal
health officials on Monday [28 May 2007], to discuss measures to stop
the outbreak from spreading, including a 2nd campaign to vaccinate
poultry against the deadly virus.
International public health officials describe Viet Nam's mass
poultry vaccination programme and other measures as a model for
keeping the virus at bay for the past 18 months. Nevertheless, last
Wednesday [23 May 2007], it recorded the 1st human case since
November 2005, when a man from Vinh Phuc province, near Hanoi, was
found to have contracted H5N1 after he helped slaughter chickens at a
friend's wedding about a month ago.
The World Health Organisation [WHO] said it was working with the
government to investigate the case and needed to verify the virus
sample. It said finding the suspected patient was not alarming if it
was an isolated case.
The H5N1 virus has killed 42 people in Viet Nam since it re-surfaced
in Asia in late 2003.
The virus returned to poultry in the south late last year [2006].
Last month [April 2007], WHO urged Viet Nam to accelerate poultry
vaccination and target more ducks, which can carry the virus without
showing symptoms. Viet Nam has vaccinated more than 121 million
poultry in 63 of its 64 provinces so far this year [207], the Animal
Health Department said.
The spread of the virus in May [2007], at the beginning of summer, is
unusual as experts say it appears to thrive best in cool temperatures
and weakens in warmer weather.

outbreaks reportedly starting between 9 and 19 May 2007, in the
following provinces: Nam Dinh (3 outbreaks), Quang Ninh (2), Dong
