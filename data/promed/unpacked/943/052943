The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) and New Mexico State University (NMSU) announce that the mosquito species _Aedes aegypti_ has been found in Luna County, making this the 1st time a species of mosquito capable of transmitting Zika virus has been found there.

"This does not mean Zika virus is in Luna County," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, Department of Health Veterinarian. "What it means is one of the types of mosquitos that could give you Zika virus has been found in the county."

There are no confirmed cases of Zika virus in New Mexico in 2017. The presence of _Aedes aegypti_ in Luna County, however, means that residents traveling out of the country to places where Zika virus is present could become infected with the virus, and, if no precautions are taken by travelers when they come home, they could get bitten by this specific type of mosquito and spread the virus locally.

The addition of Luna County brings the total number of counties in the state with mosquitos capable of spreading Zika to 10. There are 2 species of mosquitos NMDOH is monitoring in New Mexico: _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been trapped and identified in Do√±a Ana, Eddy, Chaves, Sierra, Lea, Otero, Hidalgo, Socorro, and Luna counties; and _Aedes albopictus_ in Roosevelt County.

NMDOH has been working with NMSU for 2 years now to track mosquito populations in the state and map out the range and distribution in New Mexico of both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, mosquito species that are able to transmit Zika virus to people.

Residents traveling abroad should be concerned about Zika transmission -- particularly women who are pregnant or trying to conceive and their sexual partners -- as Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains a list of countries with active Zika virus transmission on their Zika Virus Travel Information page.

The best way to prevent Zika, West Nile and other mosquito transmitted diseases is to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquitos typically can thrive in New Mexico during the summer months, but depending on weather conditions, they can hang on through October or until the 1st hard frost.

Certain species of mosquitos, particularly _Aedes aegypti_, prefer to bite people, so they tend to live indoors and outdoors near people. They are aggressive daytime biters, but they can also bite at night. NMDOH recommends the following ways to avoid Zika and other mosquito-related illnesses like West Nile virus:

- Look around your home, and remove any standing water that may be found in flower pots, bird baths, old tires, bottle caps or other small containers, and then scrub out the containers to remove any mosquito eggs. The small squiggly creatures you may see in the standing water are mosquito larvae that will turn into adult mosquitoes in a few days.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.
- Stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.
- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if you are overseas or outside and are not able to protect yourself from mosquito bites.
- Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents. When used as directed, EPA-registered insect repellents are proven safe and effective, even for children and pregnant or breast-feeding women.

[_ Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in various counties in southern New Mexico again this year (2017) as well as in earlier years. Although finding _Ae. aegypti_ in Luna county is not surprising, the number of breeding sites found in Carlsbad municipality is of concern (see.Invasive mosquito - USA (11): (NM) 20170906.5299477).

Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in New Mexico. Fortunately, thus far, no locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection in New Mexico have been documented. Should viremic travelers from areas of Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus transmission come to the areas in southern New Mexico where these vector mosquitoes are present, there is the possibility of local transmission. However, if the mosquito populations are not abundant, the probability of ongoing transmission is low. Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit vector abundance. However, the introduction of viruses such as Zika, chikungunya, or dengue into New Mexico will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.
