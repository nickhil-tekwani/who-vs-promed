Veterinarians and animal control officers say they are seeing an increase
in the number of rabies cases in Halifax County.
In the past 2 weeks, 4 animals in the county have been diagnosed with the
deadly disease -- the same number diagnosed in the entire state in 2005.
The animals include 3 raccoons and one dog.
The disease is rare in humans or domestic pets. During 2005, 80 percent of
confirmed rabies cases across the state were raccoons.
Part of the problem, veterinarian Kay Lawrence said, is that owners are not
getting their pets vaccinated. "We have a very sick pet here today that is
almost 2 years old and has never had any vaccine, much less a rabies
vaccine," Lawrence said.
Despite a state law requiring rabies shots for all domestic animals 4
months old or older, veterinarians are seeing even more cases where rabies
is spread between family pets and wild animals. Part of the reason: leash laws.
"We don't have a leash law so, they will roam, and that's a big problem in
our county because we are mostly rural," said Robert Richardson with the
Halifax County Animal Control.
Health officials say they are considering booster rabies shots to keep
humans and pets safe.
"You need to be more aware of it because it is rabies," Richardson said.
"It's not the flu, it's not distemper, it's not parvo -- it's rabies."
Some rabid animals show no signs, but there are symptoms to look out for,
including a change of temperament, sudden biting, shakiness or
uncoordinated movement, and a change in appetite.
Rabies vaccines and recommended booster shots are available at most animal
hospitals and clinics.

[It doesnï¿½t take long for rabies to spill from a wildlife population and
into domestic animals. This article indicates there is already one dog
involved. The article indicates the area is rural and there are no leash
laws. This makes it easy for rabies to spread from wildlife to dogs to people.
Vaccinating the pets, dogs and cats -- and even horses -- is one of the
cheapest insurance policies. Not having it could be fatal. - Mod.TG]
