Pelicans continue to get sick and die in St Petersburg [Pinellas county, Florida], but why is a still a mystery.

The latest report on pelicans found sick and dying around the city says dead birds continue to turn up but so far scientists still don't know what's killing them.

"To date we have confirmed reports of at least 70 dead or ill brown pelicans and at least one white pelican," said the report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg.

Reports about the dead birds have been pouring in since [Wed 11 Jan 2017] according to the report. Most of the birds were found around Coffee Pot Bayou, Bayou Grande and the Riviera Bay development's lake, but the most recent one found was a decomposing brown pelican found by Albert Whitted Airport.

Low levels of toxins from an ongoing Red Tide algae bloom were detected in the bodies of some of the dead pelicans, "demonstrating some exposure," the report noted. "These results are inconclusive, neither confirming nor ruling out Red Tide as the cause of death."

Some bird advocates fear what's going on could be linked to St. Petersburg's recent sewage crisis, when the city release tens of millions of gallons of waste into Tampa Bay during last year's [2016] storms. So far, though, there is no evidence of a connection.

About 30 birds that were ill were treated by the Seaside Seabird Sanctuary, and the Owl's Nest Sanctuary. The birds were weak or even paralyzed, and some, as they recovered from those signs, displayed some disturbing new signs such as blinding cataracts.

Owl's Nest hopes to release some of those survivors this week [week of 29 Jan 2017].

Some of the signs the survivors displayed could match a diagnosis of poisoning by Red Tide, a toxic algae that has stunk up Florida's beaches with fishkills for centuries. Spanish explorers recorded blooms when they visited in the 1500s.

Small, scattered colonies of the microscopic algae _Karenia brevis_ -- named for retired St. Petersburg biologist Karen Steidinger, who spent decades studying it -- live in the Gulf of Mexico all year long. Usually they cause no problems.

But every now and then, the algae population offshore explodes into something called a bloom in which the algae multiplies rapidly and spreads. The expanding bloom stains the water a rusty color that gives the creature its name.

No one knows what causes the bloom to begin offshore, and no one knows what causes it to end.

The big blooms release toxins that are deadly to marine creatures. A bloom along the Southwest Florida coast in 2013 killed 200 manatees.

[Red tides are caused by several species of microscopic plants called phytoplankton. These species produce strong chemical poisons called toxins. As the bloom increases the density of red tide, organisms increase to several million cells in each liter of seawater. The result is a deadly mass of toxin-containing water leaving a wake of dead and dying fish. These toxins cause extensive fish kills, contaminate shellfish and create respiratory irritation for people who live along the shore.

Dinoflagellates produce a number of toxins. How the disease is designated or named tends to reflect the organism responsible. Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes shellfish for consumption to be toxic. Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities because, under certain circumstances, these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally, these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals -- such as clams, oysters, mussels -- in which the toxins bioaccumulate.

The _Alexandrium_ genus is found in coastal waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and animals that swim in waters that are "blooming" with the organisms.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals. _Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a significant problem in many areas. Caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in extensions.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentrations can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. _K. brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic poisoning.

It would be possible for this marine toxin to affect the fish the pelican consume or to affect the birds directly.

Hopefully, more information from additional necropsies or studies will definitely ascertain the cause of death of the pelicans. - Mod.TG
