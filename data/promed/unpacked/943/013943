There's been another outbreak of the devastating banana disease, black
sigatoka, in a backyard operation in north Queensland near Cairns.
The fungal disease has the potential to wipe out our 300-million-dollar
banana industry and this is the second outbreak on the mainland in four
years.
Vicki Kippon O'Connor, Chair of the Queensland Banana Growers Association,
states that a quarantine area 7.5 km from the actual farm has been
established. Staff of the Department of Primary Industry will eradicate
all susceptible plants in that area. A 15 km zone which will then be
surveyed and no bananas will be permitted to move out of an area of 50 km
around that particular place. It is estimated that it will take about a
week to survey that area.

[The fungal pathogen causing black sigatoka disease is _Mycosphaerella
fijiensis_. The disease is worldwide in distribution, having been first
detected in Honduras in 1972. The disease has been reported in Queensland
since 1981, with subsequent occurrences being reported in 1988 and 1999.
Resistant hybrid banana cultivars may offer some hope of disease abatement.
