Latent introduction to the Netherlands of multiple antibiotic resistance including NDM-1 after hospitalization in Egypt, August 2013
-------------------------------------------------
We describe the introduction of various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains, including an NDM-1-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, through a traveler returning from Egypt, where the traveler had been admitted to a private hospital. All family members of the patient were colonized with 1 or more extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. These findings emphasise the importance of adherence to isolation precautions for returning patients and suggest the need for inclusion of _Enterobacteriaceae_ in admission screening.

We here report a patient who had been hospitalised in Egypt for appendicitis in July 2013, and was colonized with various multiresistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ including strains producing NDM-1, oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Explorative screening for multiresistant microorganisms among the patient's family members also yielded several ESBL-producing microorganisms. This report addresses the need for heightened awareness of patients and family members who have recently been exposed to healthcare environments in countries with high levels of antibiotic resistance.

Patients repatriated after hospitalization abroad are a risk for introducing multiresistant microorganisms into hospitals in their home countries. In 2008, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), which hydrolyses last-line carbapenem antibiotics, has been for the first time described in a Swedish patient returning from India [1]. Most reports on NDM are related to travelers returning from Pakistan and India. However, the global dispersal of NDM is of growing concern [2]. In the past 2 years, NDM-producing strains have been reported in patients returning from the African continent without obvious links to the Indian subcontinent [3,4].

Case description
----------------
A Dutch patient in his 40s [age group] was admitted to our hospital for fever and abdominal pain. On admission, computed axial tomography showed a periappendicular abscess. 4 days earlier, the patient had returned from holidays in Egypt with his spouse and 2 children. A week into their holiday (2 weeks before presentation at our hospital) the patient had complained about right lower abdominal pain and was admitted to a private hospital in Egypt where 400 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day and 500 mg metronidazole 3 times a day were given intravenously for 2 weeks. The patient was discharged after 13 days without having undergone any surgical intervention, and subsequently returned to the Netherlands. In our hospital, the abscess was drained and the patient was treated with piperacilin/tazobactam 4500 mg 3 times a day intravenously for 5 days with good clinical response.

A perianal screening swab taken on admission grew _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ which was resistant to meropenem (minimum inhibitory concentration: 32 mg/L). Molecular testing of the strain by PCR and sequencing of the PCR product revealed that the strain harbored the gene encoding NDM-1. Molecular testing of feces detected OXA-48, and culture of this sample grew _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_ positive for OXA-48.

We also screened the patient's spouse and children, who had been visiting the patient in the hospital in Egypt. Stool samples were obtained 14 days after admission of the index patient. The Table [see original URL] shows an overview of the screening results for multiresistant microorganisms of the family. The patient, his spouse and the youngest child carried ESBL-producing strains with CTX-M1. The older child carried 2 different ESBL-producing _E. coli_ strains positive for CTX-M9. A gene encoding _K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC) was detected by molecular tests from feces of the youngest child. The culture of this sample remained negative for carbapenemase-producing strains. Screening of contact patients on the ward where the index patient was treated did not reveal further dissemination of any resistant strains.

Discussion
----------
High prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria with rates of over 60 percent in Egyptian hospitals has been reported [5,6]. Also outbreaks involving OXA-48- and VIM-1 carbapenemase-producing strains have been described in the southern Mediterranean region including Egypt [7]. The occurrence of an NDM-1-producing _Acinetobacter_ in Egypt has previously been reported, but so far no reports of NDM-1-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ could be found in the literature [8]. This is in contrast to other countries in the area such as Morocco and the United Arab Emirates where these bacteria have already been isolated [9-11].

Highly sensitive and rapid screening methods are the mainstay to prevent introduction of multiresistant microorganisms in hospitals in low prevalence countries by repatriated patients. Molecular tests that allow detection of carbapenemase-encoding genes directly from clinical samples are promising when used in addition to conventional culturing [12].

In the youngest child, we detected a KPC gene by 2 molecular testing methods directly from feces, but we were not able to confirm these findings by culture. The bacterial load of the KPC- producing strain was probably too low to be cultured.

It is well recognized that repatriated patients are a risk for introducing multiresistant microorganisms. Family members attending patients hospitalized abroad may also be at risk of acquiring multiresistant bacteria, as our case illustrates. Although we cannot be sure that the family members picked up all strains in the hospital in Egypt, the diversity of multiresistant microorganisms including strains rarely found in the Netherlands makes this highly plausible. Neither can we rule out that the strains were acquired in Egypt outside the hospital, since traveling to African countries has been described as a risk factor for ESBL carriage [13].

Based on these findings, we recommend alertness and compliance with isolation precautions. Infection control guidelines may need to be expanded to include admission screening for resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ in low prevalent counties for a growing number of international travellers, including family members who have visited a patient abroad.

[Continued vigilance is needed to identify imported multiply antimicrobial resistant organisms in patients who had received medical care in other countries, as shown here. It is noteworthy that [apparently healthy] family members also harbored resistant enteric flora.
