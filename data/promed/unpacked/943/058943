I think all of us who have worked in the 'Third World" have been frustrated
over the unwillingness of many countries to admit to any medical problem
with international implications. There is an associated wrinkle. To wit:
Countries that do not admit to a problem cannot, of course, received
outside aid to fight it. In some cases this leads to an admission of, for
instance, a cholera outbreak, but once the desired
money is in the pipeline, it is announced that the epidemic has been
halted, and that no more infected individuals exist. Behold, a miracle!
This just is another type of report that should not be taken too seriously.
On vaccinations. I recall a reasonable suggestion being made, while working
in Ethiopia, that a program be carried out that would provide standard
infant immunizations for the population. I believe that it was the Minister
of Health who patiently explained that this one item would exceed the total
annual budget for the ministry. The Third World truly is a different world,
and it is necessary to differentiate the desirable from the feasible.

[Lack of appropriate disease reporting obviously is caused by a complex of
money, politics, ignorance, laziness, fear, legal complexities, egotism,
arrogance, anti-social elements, and other factors too awful to mention. I
do not know the order in which these items should be listed but I am
certain that money goes at the top of the list. - Mod.CHC
