Malaria strikes Mumbai
----------------------
The financial capital of the country [India] is under attack from
malaria as several residents are gripped with the infection. The worst
areas are Andheri and nearby places.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced a new 6-point
agenda to fight malaria and other diseases. It has also warned
citizens to take precautions against swine flu, after a 2nd wave of
H1N1 cases.

BMC officials said they would continue its battle against the disease
[malaria]. On the battle agenda are construction site corrections,
hygiene corrections at these sites, making doctors available for
workers, notices to 810 construction sites, medical check-ups every 15
days for labourers, and regular site inspections.

Sources say that BMC is targeting 2500 construction sites in Mumbai
and have drawn up other precautions to curb the rise in malaria
cases.

Meanwhile, tankers of mosquito larvaecidal oil (ML) that curbs
mosquito breeding had already arrived in 4 civic wards, but experts
say they are late.

[The article has no numbers of cases, but there are a constant flow
of reports of malaria in Mumbai, including a fatal case in a sailor
infected at Mumbai harbor. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation
(BMC) again focus on malaria risk at construction sites, but a more
important reservoir is most probably slum areas (see comment by
Michael Bangs in ProMED-mail Malaria - India, (Mumbai): urban malaria
comment 20110104.0040).

In ProMED-mail posting 20100717.2397 we mentioned a study from 2002
of malaria in the slum areas of Mumbai (Karn and Harada. Water Sci
Technol. 2002; 46: 269-75), which reported an annual incidence of 126
per 1000 population. These data urgently need to be updated.

ProMED-mail will be happy to post further data or comments and
reports of malaria in returned travelers infected in Mumbai.

Mumbai, the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra, can be
