The Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak that has killed dozens of people
in northeastern Kenya could threaten the livelihoods of pastoralists
living in the semi-arid province, after the government imposed
quarantine on local livestock. At least 28 people have died from the
disease since it was reported 2 weeks ago. Hundreds of animals,
mostly goats, in Fafi, Jarajila and Shanta Abak -- considered the
epicentre of the outbreak -- have also died. Other areas affected are
Korakora, Shanta Abak, Shell Gulliet and Shimbirey, all near Garissa.

The ban on movement of livestock -- aimed at containing the spread of
the disease -- comes just days before celebrations to mark the New
Year and Eid-Ul-Adha, a religious occasion marking the end of the
Hajj, in which Muslims are expected to slaughter animals.

On Wednesday, local leaders in the provincial capital, Garissa,
appealed to the government to declare the RVF outbreak and recent
floods in the region a national disaster, saying the disease had
negatively affected the welfare of the province's residents. They
said the quarantine would affect their revenue because they could not
collect on livestock sales.

Calling for emergency medical and food aid, Garissa Mayor, Siyat
Osman, said pastoralists in the affected areas were starving after
heeding the government's advice not to consume products from infected
animals. But the chief medical officer in Garissa, Shahnaaz Sharif,
said health officials had held a meeting with religious leaders to
advise residents on the dangers of slaughtering livestock at home.
"We expect that more than 20 000 goats will be slaughtered in the
province at the end of the month to mark religious festivities," he
said. "It is important that this is not done at home to reduce the
risk of humans contracting the disease."

The disease was first identified in Kenya in 1931. The World Health
Organisation (WHO) says it occurs in epidemics in animals in Africa
and is associated with spontaneous abortions in sheep, goats, cattle,
camels, and deaths in young animals. It can be transmitted to humans
via mosquitoes or through contact with infected animal material, such
as blood or other body fluids, or organs. Consumption of milk, a
staple for many pastoral people, is also thought to lead to infection.

Following the latest outbreak, Kenya's health ministry is carrying
out clinical case management, surveillance and social mobilisation
activities, as well as mosquito net distribution. The aim is to
reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission via unprotected
animal husbandry and slaughter practices. The government also has 100
000 doses of animal vaccine.

[The death toll in the Rift Valley fever outbreak in the North East
Province of Kenya has increased from 24 to 28 in the last few hours
and seems likely to increase.

A detailed account of the epidemiology of Rift Valley fever can be
found at the CDC web-site
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf.htm>), and
a map of the North Eastern Province of Kenya can be found at

[The temporary closure of abattoirs might indeed help in protecting
their workers from exposure to RVFV infection. However, animals --
particularly sheep -- intended for commercial, veterinary-controlled
slaughter, might join the numerous animals finding their way to
uncontrolled ritual home slaughter during the coming Eid-ul Adha (31
Dec 2006 - 2 Jan 2007) celebrations. It will be extremely difficult
to convince devout Muslims not to perform the traditional sacrifice
("Qurban") which commemorates Abraham's sacrifice of Ismael. A rather
efficient step in controlling RVF in animals and subsequently
reducing human exposure would be mass vaccination of domestic
ruminants. Unfortunately, the results of such an operation might only
be seen several weeks following vaccination. - Mod. AS].
