FMD outbreak confirmed in China
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture announced on Wednesday [8 Mar 2006] that
11 head of cattle had contracted foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
Gansu, a western inland province in China, the Oriental Morning Post
reported. A farmer in Zhangye, in Gansu Province, noticed his cattle
began showing symptoms of the disease on 1 Mar 2006. An official
laboratory for FMD identification was convinced his 11 head of cattle
had contracted serotype Asia 1. The Ministry of Agriculture and the
Gansu government have activated emergency response procedures and
have taken various measures, including implementing blockades and
disinfecting the village where the farmer lives. Veterinary
authorities in Gansu have eliminated the infected cattle and their
herd companions, totaling 18, to prevent the epidemic from spreading.
They also injected an emergency inoculation into other farm animals
prone to the disease in the surrounding villages.

[Gansu, a Northwest China Province on the upper reaches of the Yellow
River has an area of 455 000 sq km inhabited by 23 450 000 people.

According to China's reports to the OIE, not a single outbreak of FMD
was recorded there between May 1999 and the end of 2004. In contrast,
during 2005, the Chinese veterinary services sent the OIE 6 reports
on FMD, serotype Asia 1, causing 10 outbreaks in 4 (out of China's
22) provinces, one out of China's 5 autonomous regions and one out of
China's 4 major municipalities. The affected provinces were (in
brackets, number of outbreaks): Shandong (2), Gansu (1), Qinghai (1),
Hebei (2), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2), Beijing municipality
(1), and Jiangsu (1). Outbreaks of Asia 1 have been recorded from the
frontier regions of several of China's neighbors, primarily Russia.
The last official report from China to the OIE, sent on 16 Jan 2006,
added 2 infected regions, notifying one outbreak in the Jiangxi
province and one outbreak in Ningxia Autonomous Region; see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_35.HTM#Sec3>.
The recent posting of unofficial information on a suspected outbreak
in another province, Liaoning (see 20060207.0405), has not been
officially confirmed or refuted.
Since 2005, China has demonstrated a commendable tendency to improve
surveillance and/or reporting and/or transparency. A new update is
anticipated, hopefully to exclude involvement of the pig sector,
which is a major industry in Gansu. - Mod.AS]
