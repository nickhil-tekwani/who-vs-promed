A petting zoo's owner indicated as many as 100 people may have been exposed
in the last week and half to a bear cub that died of rabies at the rural
northeastern Iowa petting zoo.
State health official said visitors who had come in contact with the bear
should see a doctor immediately.
The 5-month-old black bear, which was on display at the Wild Midwest Petting
Zoo in Clermont, died Friday afternoon. Tests performed by the zoo's
veterinarian determined the bear was rabid, and the Iowa Department of
Public Health was informed Saturday.
"One of the things we're trying to find out is how long the bear had spread
rabies,'' state epidemiologist Dr. Patricia Quinlisk said. "Right now, I
would say that anybody who was bitten by the bear or got saliva on their
face or in an open wound in the last 2 weeks needs to go and see their
doctor and may need rabies shots.''
Rabies is a viral disease found in the saliva of infected animals and is
transmitted to pets and humans by bites, or possibly by contamination of an
open cut.

[If suspected in time, rabies is treatable with vaccine & immune globulin.
This is not the first case of a rabid animal being found in a petting zoo or
agricultural show -- see ref. above. Such places should routinely vaccinate
all animals before permitting the public to pet them - Mod.JW
