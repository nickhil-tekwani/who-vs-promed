Another horse at WSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital tested positive
for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) on Wednesday [25 May 2011], a College
of Veterinary Medicine spokesperson said.

The latest case contracted the virus from another horse at the
Veterinary Teaching Hospital, not from the horse show in Utah, where
the virus is believed to have originated, Charlie Powell, public
information officer for the College of Veterinary Medicine, said.
"This is what we call a secondary exposure," he said.

Powell said the horse had a fever during the routine checks, but
nasal swabs were initially negative for EHV-1. The fever persisted, he
said, and the tests came back positive Wednesday [25 May 2011].

Professor of Veterinary Clinical Science Debra Sellon said none of
the horses with the virus at the teaching hospital have shown
neurological signs, only fever.

"It's the horses with neurologic disease that usually have the
long-term problems," she said.

The neurological progression of EHV-1 can infect a horse's spinal
fluid, causing myeloencephalopathy, a severe viral brain and spinal
fluid infection, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Tanis MacDonald said on
her website.

The virus cannot be transmitted to humans, dogs, cats or cattle, but
is extremely contagious among horse populations, the Idaho Equine
Hospital's website said.

The WSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital has released the 1st infected
horse to its owners. The 3 subsequent cases remain isolated from the
other horses and camelids, Powell said. The equine section of the
hospital still remains under a voluntary quarantine and is not
accepting or releasing any animals.

Powell said each time a new horse tests positive for the virus, the
hospital extends the quarantine for 21 days.

The state of Washington has reported 7 cases of EHV-1, Powell said.
Three cases were reported in Whitman County, along with other single
cases in each Thurston, Spokane, Chelan and Asotin counties.

Officials canceled the Lipizzaner Stallion performance scheduled on 2
Jun 2011 at Beasley Coliseum due to the virus cases in Pullman, Powell
said. Leo Udy, Director of the Beasley Performing Arts Coliseum, said
Lipizzaner Stallions Inc. made the final decision.

"After discussion with the vet school here on campus, they made the
determination it would be best if they bypassed Pullman," Udy said.
Rich Thompson, Marketing Director for Lipizzaner Stallions Inc., said
it was probably the best solution for both parties. None of the
performance horses showed signs of the virus, but representatives from
the Veterinary Teaching Hospital raised concerns about bringing
outside horses to campus, Thompson said. "(The Lipizzaner horses)
don't come in contact with any people or other horses," Rich said. The
only human contact is with the company's staff, he said.

WSU and Lipizzaner Stallions Inc. will likely reschedule the show in
the future, Thompson said.
