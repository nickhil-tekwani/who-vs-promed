The table presents (26) Live bird markets (LBM), (15) Farms, (1) Backyard, others (2: 1 airport, 1 zoo), totaling 44 locations in the 14 provinces [Anhui(1), Fujian(1), Guangdong (22), Guangxi (1), Hebei (1), Heilongjiang (1), Henan (1), Hunan (5), Liaoning (1, new - later than), Inner Mongolia (2), Ningxia Hui (2), Shaanxi (2), Shanxi (1), Tianjin (1) Unknown (1)].

2. Situation update
a. Animals
Liaoning Province reported [25 Mar 2019] an H7N9 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in ornamental peacocks raised in Jinzhou Zoo in Linghe District, Jinzhou City. There were 394 ornamental/exhibition birds, of which 9 peacocks got sick and died. The local authorities culled 191 birds in accordance with the relevant plans and technical requirements for avian influenza prevention and control. The Jinzhou Zoo is located right next to the Xiangying Park where a lake is present, potentially hosting susceptible bird species.

Since the beginning of period 7 (1 Oct 2018), no H7N9 outbreak or H7N9 positive animal or environment findings were reported.

Animal/environmental findings: Since 4 Apr 2013, around 2500 virological samples from the environment, chickens, pigeons, ducks, turkeys, peacocks, a tree sparrow, and a magpie robin tested positive; positives mainly from live bird markets, vendors and some commercial or breeding farms.

b. Humans
Since the last update (6 Mar 2019), no human cases were reported.
For detailed information on human cases, please refer to WHO report [https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_02_03_2018.pdf?ua=1].

Figure 4 in the EMPRESS-AH report presents the number of officially reported human cases since February 2013, as of 3 Apr 2019.
Figure 5 in the EMPRESS-AH report presents incidence of officially reported human cases by month, based on onset date from October 2014 (beginning of period 3) to 3 Apr 2019.

Four new scientific publications are listed.

[2] Research: H7N9 spread in China
Date: Mon 4 Jun 2018
Source: Contagion Live [edited]
https://www.contagionlive.com/news/h7n9-spreading-westward-from-southern-and-eastern-china


A recent study has shown that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H7N9) virus is spreading westward from southern and eastern China.

Qiqi Yang, Wei Shi, and Lei Zhang, from Beijing Normal University, China, and colleagues published the results of their study online in the June 2018 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) monthly peer-reviewed public health journal.

"We report cases of human infection with H7N9 virus, including in one person who was infected with a highly pathogenic variant, in Shaanxi Province, western China, during April and May 2017," the authors write.

Since it emerged in 2013, the H7N9 virus has triggered 5 epidemics of infections in individuals in China. These waves have taken a heavy toll on human health, resulting in 1564 laboratory-confirmed cases and 612 deaths. [During 2018, 2 additional H7N9 waves, No. 6 and 7, have taken place; see fig. 5 in the EMPRE-AH update, item 1 above].

According to the authors, the 1st 4 waves of infections were limited to eastern and southern China. However, the 5th spread north and also infected many more individuals. Since then, additional cases of H7N9 have also been reported in southern China.

In their study, Yang, Shi, Zhang and colleagues analyzed samples from 5 patients from Shaanxi Province in western China with confirmed H7N9 infections. One patient was infected with HPAI H7N9, and the other 4 were infected with low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N9). Two of the patients, infected with LPAI, died.

The researchers analyzed respiratory tract specimens from all of these patients, in the form of either throat swabs or sputum samples. And, because human cases of H7N9 have been mostly traced to exposure to the virus at live poultry markets (LPMs) in mainland China, the researchers also examined 496 samples from LPMs and poultry farms from 4 cities in Shaanxi Province. These specimens included samples of poultry feces and swabs from poultry cages.

Of the LPM specimens, 14 tested positive for H7N9, the authors say.

By using genome sequencing techniques, they also found that the viruses from these LPM specimens and the sample from the patient with HPAI were similar and were all confirmed as HPAI.

When the researchers analyzed the HPAI viruses, they found similarities between them and previously isolated HPAI viruses from cases in southern China. The LPAI H7N9 viruses isolated from patients in Shaanxi Province were also similar to LPAI viruses previously identified in regions of eastern, central, and southern China. These findings highlight spread of both LPAI and HPAI H7N9 into western China.

Genetic analysis of H7N9 virus from infected humans in 2 cities in Shaanxi Province also showed genetic similarities with H7N9 from LPMs and poultry farms in the same regions.

Consistent with previous studies highlighting that poultry trade may be spreading H7N9 viruses, these results of this current study "provide evidence that H7N9 viruses infecting humans in Shaanxi Province derived, directly or indirectly, from strains circulating in local farms and LPMs," the authors conclude.

[The paper reviewed in the above Contagion-live report is: Yang Q, Shi W, Zhang L, Xu Y, Xu J, Li S, et al. Westward Spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus among Humans, China. Emerg Infect Dis. 2018;24(6):1095-1098; https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2406.171135.

Its abstract said:
"We report infection of humans with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in Shaanxi, China, in May 2017. We obtained complete genomes for samples from 5 patients and from live poultry markets or farms in 4 cities. Results indicate that H7N9 is spreading westward from southern and eastern China."

According to observations accumulated since the period covered in the paper (terminated in May 2017), the further spread of HPAI in China appears to have been put on hold. Since September 2017, a nationwide vaccination program against H7 and H5 viruses targeting all poultry on mainland China is being implemented, leading to a significant drop in H7N9 detections and outbreaks. The recent outbreak in a zoo in Liaoning province, northeast China, is the 1st H7N9 outbreak in animals reported since June 2018. No human cases have been recorded in China between February 2018 and the recent case in Gansu (20190406.6407503). - Mod.AS
