The Beijing Bureau of Health said at a press conference yesterday that 70
people in Beijing have been diagnosed as suffering from Guangzhou
Angiostrongylus meningitis.
The bureau said the meningitis outbreak had caused no deaths so far and 3
patients had left hospital after treatment. But the bureau warned people
not to eat raw or half-cooked snails and gave a phone number, 65066969, for
the public to report anyone improperly cooked snails.
Guo Zixia, an official with the Beijing municipal office of health
inspection, said it would impose administrative punishment on Shuguo Yanyi
Restaurant for improperly cooking the Amazonian snails, which caused the
outbreak.
The office on Sunday issued an urgent notice prohibiting the sale of raw or
half-cooked freshwater snails in the city's restaurants. The office also
required restaurants to boil snails thoroughly before serving them to
customers. It then inspected about 2000 restaurants, although it did not
find any selling raw or half-cooked snails.
Yin Quanxi, an official with the office, was quoted by the Beijing Daily
Messenger as saying thoroughly boiled snails were safe to eat.
Yin said the office would improve the inspection of aquatic products, such
as snails, fish, shrimps and crabs, by establishing a system of traceable
purchases and sales so that food sources could be quickly identified.
The Beijing Friendship Hospital, specializing in treating the disease,
yesterday launched a training course on the treatment of Guangzhou
angiostrongylus meningitis. The course will train about 200 doctors working
in the city's 3rd-class and 2nd-class hospitals.
The friendship hospital found the 1st case of meningitis on 24 Jun 2006
when a 34-year-old man suffered from violent headache and nausea after
eating a dish of cold snail meat at the Shuguo Yanyi Restaurant. The snail
meat was from the Amazonian snail ["fushouluo" in Chinese], which is a host
of _Angiostrongylus cantonesis_, a parasite that harms people's nervous system.
Yin Chenghong, an expert from the hospital, said people do not have to
panic, as the disease is curable and will not result in major problems if
treated in a timely and proper fashion. Yin said the disease has an average
latency period of 10 days, during which time people can suffer from
headache, fever, vomiting and a stiff neck.
Meanwhile, there have been no reports of illness related to Amazonian
snails so far in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province,
the local disease control and prevention office said yesterday.
"The city saw disease cases related to the snail in the 1980s, but has not
heard of any cases for more than a decade," said Mao Xinwu, director of the
food and health department of Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention. However, the city's health authorities have decided to launch a
one-week inspection campaign of freshwater seafood to raise awareness about
snail diseases.
Guangzhou was one of the 1st Chinese cities to introduce Amazonian snails
in the 1980s, as a delicacy. "Sales of Amazonian snails have been affected
in recent days," said Guo Qinghong, a vendor at the Guangzhou Huangsha
Seafood Market. "It is because people are now afraid of diseases. Once we
prove eating salad snails could harm health, we will issue an emergency
notice to the public not to eat them," said Huang Hui, an official with the
Guangzhou Health Bureau.
According to Huang, trade of Amazonian snails has not been suspended in the
city.

[_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is a nematode that lives as a parasite in a
variety of freshwater or land snails and slugs. The giant African snail, or
"fushouluo," its common Chinese name, and the Amazonian snail are often
consumed by humans due to their rich protein content. These snails are
agricultural pests. Their preparation prior to cooking is not an easy job.
The parasites are abundant in the fluid of the soft tissues. Good hygiene
practice is strongly recommended for food preparers, and the snail meat
must be well-cooked in order to kill the parasites before serving. Fresh
salad can be contaminated by small types of infected snails or slugs.
An outbreak of _Angiostrongylus_ meningitis was diagnosed in 12 out of 23
young travelers returning from Jamaica to the USA in 2002 (see ref 1
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11870244&dopt=Abstract>).
The symptoms, such as neck pain, nuchal rigidity, altered cutaneous
sensations, photophobia or visual disturbances, and severe headache began a
median of 11 days (range, 6 to 31 days) after their return to the United
States. Antibodies against an _A. cantonensis_-specific 31-kD antigen were
detected in convalescent-phase serum samples from 11 patients.
Similar outbreaks were reported from Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, among Thai
laborers between 1998 and 1999 (see refs 2 and 4). The main cause of the
disease was eating raw snails.
As also discussed in the previous ProMED-mail report (see below), there
have been several outbreaks in China between 1984 and 2003.
As stated in a 2005 letter to the CDC
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no10/04-1338.htm>, "Angiostrongyliasis
is an emerging foodborne public health problem in mainland China. Most
clinicians are not familiar with this disease and little is known about the
prevalence of _A. cantonensis_ in China. Thus, more studies should be
conducted on the biology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of
angiostrongyliasis, and more effective diagnostic methods and treatments
for _A. cantonensis_ should be developed."
