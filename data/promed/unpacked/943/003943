[As legionellosis has been increasingly identified and reported in
outbreaks world-wide (notice the very abridged version of prior ProMED-mail
postings in our "see also" reference section below), we have decided to
embark upon periodic legionellosis updates. We will still continue to post
alerts for special circumstances, such as identification of an outbreak
involving large populations with a potential common exposure such as the
outbreak associated with the aquarium in Australia (2000) and the outbreak
associated with the flower show in the Netherlands (1999). - Mod.MPP]

Pontiac Fever in Tennessee
-------------------------------------
The CDC confirmed what Metro Health Department officials suspected, that
about 100 patrons who got sick after dining at [a Cafe in a local] shopping
mall came down with Pontiac fever.

The ailment is a mild infection caused by Legionella bacteria found in
water. It is different from classical Legionnaires' disease because is
causes an influenza-like illness and not pneumonia. It was first identified
in Pontiac, Michigan. Legionella bacteria are spread by breathing
contaminated water mist from devices like cooling systems, showers, and
faucets.

Metro health officials had suspected that a water misting system in the
restaurant made the customers sick after food and person-to-person spread
from employees were both ruled out. After dining at the restaurant on the
weekend of 19 Apr 2002, 24-30 patrons initially complained of low-grade
fever, body aches, and headaches. After reports of the problem became known
by the public, the number of complaints rose to about 100.

The CDC on 9 May 2002 confirmed that the Legionella bacterium was present
in water samples taken from the restaurant's misting system, Metro Health
Department spokesman Brian Todd said. Earlier state tests were negative for
the bacterium, but Todd said that a different water sample was used.

Metro shut down the restaurant's misting system and is now developing a
plan to flush out the system and clean it, Todd said. Once it is free of
bacteria, officials will give permission to turn it back on. The department
plans to routinely test the system in the future, Todd said.

[The corporation owning the involved cafe], had been cleaning the water
system using chlorine to kill bacteria [no longer recommended see below -
Mod.LL] and were puzzled why that did not work.

Legionnaires' outbreak in Victoria
-------------------------------------------
Health authorities have reported another outbreak of Legionnaires' disease
in Melbourne, announcing 3 men had been hospitalized with the potentially
fatal infection.

Victorian acting chief health officer John Carnie said the men, aged 55,
75, and 84, contracted the disease after visiting suburban Moonee Ponds in
late April and early May 2002. Dr Carnie said 2 of the men remain
hospitalized, one in intensive care, while the third was recovering at home.

Air conditioning cooling towers in Moonee Ponds Junction have been
inspected, tested , and disinfected to destroy any Legionella bacteria
which may be present.

After announcing the latest scare, Dr Carnie called for calm."Despite these
cases there is no reason for people not to attend events in the area or go
about their normal business," he said in a statement. However, Dr Carnie
said workers, visitors or residents of Moonee Ponds who had suffered
persistent flu-like symptoms over the past 2 weeks should seek medical
attention.

Dr Carnie said the possible link between the latest cases had not been made
until 10 May 2002 when the third case was reported.

In Victoria this year there has been 48 cases of Legionnaires' disease,
including 5 cases contracted from a cooling tower system of an inner-city
building that houses a police station and a backpackers' inn. Over the same
period last there were 51 cases.

[Background information on legionellosis can be found on the CDC website
and GIDEON (The Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology
Network). Legionellosis is an infection caused by the bacterium
_Legionella pneumophila_. The disease has 2 distinct forms: Legionnaires'
disease, the more severe form of infection which includes pneumonia, and
Pontiac fever, a milder illness. Legionnaires' disease acquired its name
in 1976 when an outbreak of pneumonia occurred among persons attending a
convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia. The etiologic agent is
_Legionella pneumophila_ and other Legionella species. At least 43 species
and 65 serogroups have been identified. _L.pneumophila_, an ubiquitous
aquatic organism that thrives in warm environments (32- 45 degrees C)
causes over 90 percent of legionellosis in the United States. Transmission
is from inhalation of contaminated aerosols from devices such as cooling
towers, showers, and faucets, and aspiration of contaminated water.
Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Identified high risk groups
for severe illness include the elderly, cigarette smokers, persons with
chronic lung or immunocompromising disease, and persons on
immunosuppressive drugs.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/legionellosis_g.htm> and
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/legionellosis_t.htm>

Legionellosis is often acquired in proximity to central air conditioning,
building construction, saunas, whirlpools, etc during summer or warmer
months. Cases are reported worldwide, and account for 1-5 percent of
community-acquired pneumonia. Community outbreaks have most commonly been
associated with aerosolization from contaminated cooling towers.

1242 cases were reported for Europe in 1993; 1161 in 1994. 1255 cases were
reported by 24 countries in 1995 (including 22 outbreaks or clusters) - 96
percent of isolates were characterized as _Legionella pneumophila_ (79
percent of these serogroup 1 and 4 percent serogroup 3). 1563 cases were
reported in 1996; 1360 in 1997 (64.2 percent serogroup 1); 1442 in 1998
(including 32 outbreaks or clusters); 2136 in 1999 (including 32 outbreaks
or clusters).

Approximately 20 of over 40 Legionella species are found in man - but the
vast majority of infections are caused by _L. pneumophila_ (notably groups
1 and 6) and _L. micdadei_. Pontiac fever (caused by _L. anisa_, _L.
micdadei_, _L. feeleii_ and _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1) is characterized
by epidemics of mild 'flu-like' illness without pneumonia. GIDEON (The
Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network)
<http://www.GideonOnline.com>

The cluster of 3 cases of legionellosis in Melbourne reported in this
posting is a different cluster of cases from that reported in the
ProMED-mail posting in April 2002 (Legionellosis - Australia (Melbourne):
alert 20020417.3977). In both instances, the health authorities
identified distinct neighborhoods where the cases had presumed exposure to
the causative _legionella sp._ organism.

Now that misting of salad bars and grocery produce sections has become
vogue (at least in the southeastern USA states from personal anecdotal
observation), one wonders how many outbreaks of Pontiac fever may have gone
undetected, as most people (and their physicians) do not usually associate
a mild flu-like syndrome (fever, myalgia and headache) with the meal they
may have eaten out several days earlier, or shopping at their local
supermarket.

[Without appropriate molecular epidemiologic tools, it is not always
correct to assume that if Legionella is isolated from a water system, cases
of the disease found near the water must be linked to the water. It is
common that if one searches for Legionella in the environment, it will be
found. Mist machines have been associated with this infection in the past
(Ref. 1). According to Yu (Ref. 2), the use of chlorination of water to
disinfect a water source is no longer recommended because the organism is
relatively chlorine-tolerant and breakthroughs occur. A copper-silver
ionization appears effective and provides residual protection throughout
the system as well (Ref. 3). Superheating the water to at least 60 degrees
C for several days and flushing distally for 30 minutes can be useful for
urgent disinfection but can be logistically difficult.
