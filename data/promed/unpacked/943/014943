Rust risk in wheat
------------------
Yellow and brown rust is threatening to be a serious problem, agronomists believe. "We have had very few frosts this [2011/12] winter until recently which has allowed disease levels to build," says Colin Lloyd, Agrii.

With 32 percent of the UK wheat area in 2012 having a Recommended List [resistance] score of 5 or less for yellow rust, and 70 percent of the area scoring 5 or less for brown rust, there could be significant issues with infection.

"We are seeing new races of both brown and yellow rusts with varieties which have strong resistance to the disease breaking down in some situations," says Mr Lloyd.

Timings throughout the fungicide programme and the quality of the spraying is vital to ensure yield is protected.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons.

Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_. Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause yield losses of over 40 percent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems and later on heads. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" during favourable weather. Spores are spread by wind and mechanical means. The fungus needs living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops.

For both rusts, disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars and control of volunteer crop plants. Early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of both rusts with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
