The number of Czechs infected by tick-borne encephalitis rose to 854 last year [2020], which was 80 more than in 2019 and the highest number since 2012, according to the data of the National Health Institute (SZU) released Thursday [25 Mar 2021]. The VZP general health insurance company says the interest in vaccination against encephalitis has been growing. The number of tick-borne encephalitis cases was increasing since 2015 when the SZU recorded 355 of them, but the figure more than doubled by last year [2020]. By contrast, the occurrence of Lyme disease fell in the past 2 years. Last year [2020], 3710 people got infected with it, which was the smallest figure over the past 5 years. Last year, 153 400 VZP clients asked for tick-borne encephalitis vaccination, which was about 18 100 more than a year ago. The vaccine has to be repeated 3 times, already protecting after the 2nd dose after 14 days. One dose costs CZK 800-1000 [USD 36-45] and is partly covered by the health insurance.

[The reason for the increase in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases over the past 5 years is not given. TBE virus is endemic in the Czech Republic, and cases occur there annually. A 2016 ProMED post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur there yearly, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remain low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410).

The World Health Organization has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" (https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/).

TBE is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
