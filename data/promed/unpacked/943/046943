After her 2-year-old son became ill because of Rocky Mountain spotted fever following a tick bite, the mother is sharing their story to raise awareness of tick-borne illnesses. "The only thing I had ever heard of was Lyme disease," the 24-old from Louisville, Kentucky, told TODAY. "This was the scariest experience of my life. I would never wish this on anyone else."

When her son first had a slight fever she thought it was an ear infection. But when he became lethargic and developed a rash, she realized that he was much sicker than she had thought. On [Thu 16 May 2019], the boy and his father visited a local park to play. When they returned home, the father noticed a tick on Jackson and pulled it out, making sure to remove the head. For most of the weekend, the boy acted like his normal, rambunctious self.

But on [Sun 19 May 2019], the mother noticed he had a low fever. He often had ear infections with mild fevers and she believed he was developing another one. While his fever increased slightly, the family didn't worry about the toddler until a rash appeared. "When we woke up the next day he had this light pink rash all over his body," she said. "It looked like an innocent rash." Still, she took the boy to the pediatrician on [Tue 21 May 2019], and the doctor diagnosed him with a viral rash and sent them home with some medication. But instead of getting better, the boy got worse with his fever rising and his rash spreading. They returned to the doctor on [Fri 24 May 2019], who again said it was a viral rash and prescribed a steroid to help. "I wasn't really appeased. I didn't really feel that was the answer," she said.

When the pediatrician tried to assure the mother that this was a viral rash, she felt it was something more. Her instincts were right: Jackson had the rare, sometimes fatal Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Sadly, her instinct was right: Jackson did not get better. In fact, his health declined rapidly.

"[Mon 27 May 2019] he had a fever of 105. The rash looked like bruises the size of pinheads. His face, his neck, his hands, the bottom of his feet were covered in these dark red dots," she explained. He also slept for 22 hours and refused to eat, which further convinced her that he was seriously ill. The mother took him to the emergency room and explained he had been bit by a tick more than a week ago and his health steadily declined. Immediately, the doctors believed he had a mild version of rickettsiosis or the more serious Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is considered by the CDC to be one of the most deadly tick-borne illnesses. As doctors waited for the results, they treated him with IV antibiotics, which effectively treat both diseases.

But he did not immediately improve. "He swelled up like a little balloon," she said. "You couldn't touch him or move him or lay with him because you would push on his hands, feet face ... he'd wake up periodically to cry."

[When a female _Dermacentor_ tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed. If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice-daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

Given the short feeding time that occurred here, it is more likely that another, unnoticed, tick exposure was the source.

The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, and headache (which is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins on day 3 of the illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The early rash of this disease can be seen at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever_PHIL_1962_lores.jpg.

Delayed diagnosis contributes to morbidity and mortality of RMSF as it may have here. A tetracycline represents the best drug for treatment, even in children. Practicing infectious diseases in western Wisconsin as I do, we see many cases of tickborne disease this time of year and although RMSF is uncommon, tetracycline is also used for borreliosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis and is often begun empirically before diagnostics are available. - Mod.LL
