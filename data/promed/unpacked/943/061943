The Minister of Health, Franklin Vargara, reported 7 "hantavirus"
cases in Herrera province and one in the province of Cocle. He also
confirmed a case in a youth in Panama Oeste [Panama province] with
symptoms of the virus [infection] who visited Herrera province.

Vergara visited mills in Herrera province and warned that they must
take precautions, such as the use of masks. The recommendation in the
mills responds to the fact that these are the areas most propitious
for rodents to hide, thus transmitting the virus to the workers.

The "hantavirus"[infection causes] a pulmonary syndrome with 50
percent of the cases resulting in fatalities. The disease [virus] is
transmitted through rodent bites [rarely - Mod.TY], [exposure to]
urine or exudates, especially rural rats, which, for whatever reason
migrate into populated areas.

[Panama continues to report sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome. As indicated earlier for cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in Panama, the hantavirus most likely to be the etiological
agent in these cases is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail
archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts)
recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys
mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and
Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses,
only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
