--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has announced 3 new confirmed human
cases of H5N1 infection. The 1st, a 31-year-old female from Urumqi,
Xinjiang Autonomous Region, had onset of symptoms on 10 Jan 2009. She
received treatment in hospital but died on 23 Jan 2009.
Investigations into the possible source of her infection indicate
recent visits to a live poultry market. The local authorities are
currently conducting epidemiological investigations and close
contacts are being monitored. To date, no clinical symptoms have been
reported among the contacts.

The 2nd case is a 29-year-old male from Guiyang city, Guizhou. He had
onset of symptoms on 15 Jan 2009 and remains in a critical condition.
Investigations into the source of his infection indicate possible
exposure at poultry market.

The 3rd case is an 18-year-old male from Beiliu City, Guangxi
Province. He had onset of symptoms on 19 Jan 2009 and died on 26 Jan
2009. Investigations into the source of his infection indicate a
recent history of exposure to sick and dead poultry. Close contacts
of the case are being monitored and to date all remain well.

Of the 37 cases confirmed to date in China, 25 have been fatal.

[In his commentary on the Shandong avian influenza case in posting
20090124.0321, The moderator stated that: "It remains possible that
the woman involved contracted infection during the preparation of an
infected bird prior to cooking." Reports in China's media state that
the patient did indeed have frequent contact with poultry parts in
her work as a food vendor. Here is a translated excerpt from one
article. - Rapp.DS]

"Mr. Zhu [pseudonym] said that his wife helped him sell 'Ma La Tang'
on the street and frequent contact with duck blood, chicken wings,
chicken legs and other meat and poultry products was unavoidable.
[graphic Images of the content of Ma La Tang can be viewed at:
<http://www.02789.cn/qwmlt.asp >]. Even though health agencies have
not yet determined the exact source of Zhang Lixia's [pseudonym]
infection, Mr. Zhu believes that his wife's avian influenza is
definitely related to contact with these meat and poultry parts."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dan Silver for providing this additional
information which reinforces the Moderator's conclusion concerning
the possible exposure of the patient and indicates the likely route
of infection. In virtually all recent human cases of avian A/H5N1
influenza virus infection in China there has been some form of
contact with poultry (although the disease status of the poultry is
rarely known. The pattern of disease continues to be that of sporadic
infection of a few (possibly genetically) susceptible individuals
with no onward transmission of virus to their contacts.
