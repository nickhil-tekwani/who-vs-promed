So far, 85 swine flu (pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection) cases have
been, confirmed in Ukraine and 16 people have died from the disease,"
Liubov Nekrasova, chief doctor of the Central Sanitary and
Epidemiological Station, has said.

"The tentative conclusion is as follows: we can say that this type of
virus [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus] now prevails on the territory of
the country, and the majority of cases are caused by this type of
virus. But there [are] also other viruses [prevalent], including
seasonal flu and respiratory viruses," Nekrasova told a press
conference in Kyiv on 12 Nov 2009

We recall that 2 days ago, on 10 Nov 2009, Ukraine recorded 67 cases
of swine flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection], with 14 dying
from this viral infection.

[These numbers from official and semi-official sources in the Lviv
region of Ukraine are confusing. Undoubtedly there has been a large
number of people in the Lviv region of Ukraine affected by unspecified
flu or acute respiratory infections, and a large number of fatalities.
It is still unclear to what extent pandemic (H1N1) virus infection is
responsible for this situation. The 3rd of the reports above suggests
that only 67 case are confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection, of whom 14 have died.
