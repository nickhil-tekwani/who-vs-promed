----------------------------------------------------------------------
With respect to the request for information about the strain(s) of
_Coxiella burnetii_ causing the Dutch Q Fever outbreak, the US
Centers for Disease Control Emerging Infectious Diseases journal
published a letter from Dutch researchers working in Nijmegen and
Eindhoven in April 2009, reporting some preliminary results from
multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing
of _C. burnetii_ from a variety of human and animal clinical samples
linked to the outbreak obtained from different locations in the Netherlands.

The article (Multigenotype Q Fever Outbreak, the Netherlands by CHW
Klaassen, MH Nabuurs-Franssen, JJHC Tilburg, et al, Emerg Infect Dis.
2009 April; 15(4): 613-4. doi: 10.3201/eid1504.081612) is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/4/613.htm>.

The authors reported results showing "that the unprecedented, ongoing
Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands involves multiple genotypes of
_C. burnetii_. Because most of the genotypes differ only by a single
repeat difference, they might represent microvariants of a
hypervirulent strain that has been introduced in the Dutch animal population."

[The authors of the letter to the editor of 'Emerging Infectious
Diseases' above hypothesize that the Dutch strain of _C. burnetii_ is
'hypervirulent'. Experimental evidence for such statement and/or for
the pathogenicity of the strain, as alluded to in ProMED-mail posting
20091222.4304, has yet to be provided. Our request for information is
maintained. - Mod.AS]
