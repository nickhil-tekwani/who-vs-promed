Vitamin A insufficiency linked to hand, foot and mouth disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
Vitamin A status is associated with immunity to, and pathogenic condition of, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, say researchers whose study results show that the majority of those with the infectious disease also had vitamin A insufficiency. Furthermore, the complication rate was higher and duration of hospitalization longer among children with HFMD and vitamin A levels of 0.7 micromoles/L or less -- the level generally considered to indicate deficiency -- compared with those whose levels were higher, remarks the team in Clinical Nutrition.

Vitamin A is "an essential micronutrient with established roles in embryogenesis, growth, reproduction, maintenance of epithelial integrity, and optimal function of the immune system," explain Weiping Wang, from the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai, the People's Republic of China, and co-investigators. The last 2 functions are particularly concerning when considering the potential impact of vitamin A deficiency on HFMD infection, which is characterized by pathologic damage to the skin and mucous membranes, they add.

The team assessed dietary intake and serum concentrations of vitamin A in a group of 450 hospitalized HFMD patients aged a median 25 months at disease onset. Participants all weighed in the normal range for their age and none were malnourished. The cohort had a mean serum vitamin A concentration of 0.73 micromoles/L, measured by blood test, and 52.7 percent of patients presented with concentrations of 0.70 micromoles/L or lower, a "remarkably high number," say Wang and colleagues.

Mean length of hospital stay was significantly longer among vitamin A deficient than sufficient HFMD patients, at 3.5 versus 3.2 days. When the cohort was categorized according to vitamin A deficiency, the rate of disease complications was significantly higher in the deficiency group, at 46 percent versus 29 percent in the nondeficient group.

Results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that serum concentrations of interferon (IFN)-alpha were significantly lower in patients with complications than in those without, at 67.1 versus 87.7 pg/mL. More importantly, serum IFN-alpha concentration positively associated with vitamin A concentration, remark Wang et al.

"The mechanisms are unclear, but low vitamin A levels may be due to decreased intake, increased consumption, or increased catabolism," write the authors. They suggest that further studies are needed to determine the reasons for their findings, so that "appropriate interventions can be implemented to improve the vitamin A status of individuals with HFMD."

[Vitamin A deficiency is common in many developing countries, often because residents have limited access to foods containing preformed vitamin A from animal-based food sources and they do not commonly consume available foods containing beta-carotene due to poverty. According to the World Health Organization, 190 million preschool-aged children and 19.1 million pregnant women around the world have a serum retinol concentration below 0.70 micromoles/L. In these countries, low vitamin A intake is most strongly associated with health consequences during periods of high nutritional demand, such as during infancy, childhood, pregnancy, and lactation.

In developing countries, vitamin A deficiency typically begins during infancy, when infants do not receive adequate supplies of colostrum or breast milk. Chronic diarrhea also leads to excessive loss of vitamin A in young children, and vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of diarrhea. The most common symptom of vitamin A deficiency in young children and pregnant women is xerophthalmia. One of the early signs of xerophthalmia is night blindness, or the inability to see in low light or darkness. Vitamin A deficiency is one of the top causes of preventable blindness in children. People with vitamin A deficiency (and, often, xerophthalmia with its characteristic Bitot's spots) tend to have low iron status, which can lead to anemia. Vitamin A deficiency also increases the severity and mortality risk of infections (particularly diarrhea and measles) even before the onset of xerophthalmia.

In developed countries, the amounts of vitamin A in breast milk are sufficient to meet infants' needs for the 1st 6 months of life. But in women with vitamin A deficiency, breast milk volume and vitamin A content are suboptimal and not sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin A stores in infants who are exclusively breastfed. The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries begins to increase in young children just after they stop breastfeeding. The most common and readily recognized symptom of vitamin A deficiency in infants and children is xerophthalmia.

The body needs vitamin A to maintain the corneas and other epithelial surfaces, so the lower serum concentrations of vitamin A associated with measles virus infections, especially in people with protein-calorie malnutrition, can lead to blindness. Consequently it is feasible that vitamin A deficiency may play a role in susceptibility to HFMD.

Measles virus infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. About half of all measles deaths happen in Africa, but the disease is not limited to low-income countries. Vitamin A deficiency is a known risk factor for severe measles. The World Health Organization recommends high oral doses (200 000 IU) of vitamin A for 2 days for children over age one with measles who live in areas with a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency [36]. A similar regime should be explored in the cases of HFMD.
