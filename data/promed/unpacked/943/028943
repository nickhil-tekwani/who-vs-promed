A Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) patient died in a private hospital of Karachi. The death toll from the tick-born viral disease has climbed to 17 in the megacity this year (2019). Sindh Health Department confirmed the death of a 52-year old man, [HK], a resident of Lyari area of Karachi who died in private hospital of the city due to CCHF. The patient was brought to hospital a few days ago with fever where he was diagnosed.

The tick-born viral disease had infected 36 people this year (2019) so far out of which 17 died. Currently, a 62 year old man [MD] is under treatment in a private hospital. CCHF is a fatal viral disease that spreads through a tick bite, which is a [arthropod vector and transmits the CCHF virus into the blood of animals]. The CCHF is mainly contracted by people who deal with cattle and livestock. The symptoms include backache, joints pain, pain in the abdomen, high grade fever and bleeding from any part of the body.

Two people have died due to Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer. Blood samples of people who came in contact with them are being sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune for examination, Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma said on [Wed 11 Sept 2019].

He said that blood samples of a total of 136 people were taken for the investigation of Congo Fever, out of which 2 people were found positive and they eventually died in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer.

A team formed by the medical department is surveying the affected areas and distributing kits for prevention, the minister said in a statement. The department has issued guidelines to medical officers across the state to tackle the disease.

The minister said that the staff has been trained for blood sample collection and all the Chief Medical and Health Officers of Jodhpur Division, Medical Officers of Medical College and AIIMS and all Medical Officers of Jodhpur District have been oriented.

Also, through video conferencing on [9 Sep 2019], the officials have also been instructed to remain alert and take immediate action. He said that people coming into contact with positive patients will be monitored for 14 days and their blood samples are being sent to NIV, Pune, for examination.

He added that in order to provide better medical facilities to the people in the state, the government will soon bring the 'Right to Health' law. In its election manifesto, Congress had promised to provide the right to health to the people.

Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is transmitted to people either by tick bite or through contact with infected animal blood or tissue during and immediately after slaughter. Human to human transmission could occur due to close contact with body fluids of an infected person. It has symptoms like high fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, body pain and stiff neck.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the _Bunyaviridae_ family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent.

CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north - the geographical limit of the principal tick vector.

It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever.

In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.

Public health advice should focus on several aspects.
1. Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
- wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);
- wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;
- use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;
- use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;
- regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;
- seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; and
- avoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.

2. Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:
- wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;
- quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides 2 weeks prior to slaughter.

3. Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:
- avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;
- wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;
- wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.

4. Controlling infection in health-care settings
- Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.
- As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions.
- Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.

Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers. - Mod.UBA
