[The 2 patients mentioned in the above MOH announcement appear to be the same individuals reported by the MOH as being asymptomatic contacts of a confirmed clinically ill case in prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (63): Saudi Arabia, new cases, WHO 20130829.1911345.

These cases were referred to as:
SA85: 16-year-old male family contact of a confirmed case (SA84), asymptomatic and no comorbidities.
and,
SA86: 7-year-old female family contact of a confirmed case (SA84), asymptomatic and no comorbidities.

[These 2 cases appear to be newly reported cases, or perhaps asymptomatic contacts of other previously confirmed clinical cases. This moderator was unable to find more information on these cases to determine whether they are newly confirmed. If these are newly confirmed cases, they will represent the 109th and 110th laboratory confirmed infections of MERS-CoV, globally.

It is noteworthy that these individuals are also from Hafr Al-Baatin, where the other 2 asymptomatic contacts of a confirmed clinical case are from. It is possible that these represent other contacts of the case referred to as SA84 in the report from the MOH contained in MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (63): Saudi Arabia, new cases, WHO 20130829.1911345. Clarification from knowledgeable sources in the region would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
