Bird Flu Suspected In Denmark; 9 Dead Swans Found In Islands
------------------------------------------------------------
In Denmark, authorities say 9 dead swans have been found on Falter
Island and Bornholm island. Falter Island is just 30 miles from the
German island of Ruegen, where bird flu-infected swans were found.
Both islands are in the Baltic sea. [See map at

The Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research are carrying out tests.
Danish poultry farmers have been told to keep all their poultry
indoors by the Veterinary and Food Administration.
As bird flu spreads across Western Europe, poultry farmers are
experiencing 2 serious problems:
1. The threat of losing their poultry to infection.
2. Crashing poultry sales. In Italy, supermarkets have reported a 90
percent drop in the sale of chicken.
Ornithologists say that the spread of bird flu could be accelerated
when birds start migrating from Africa, where bird flu is
establishing itself (Nigeria), to Europe.

[Results of the tests applied on the Danish samples are anticipated.
Suspected mortality was also reported on Wed 15 Feb 2006 from Poland
(Gdansk), where 3 dead swans were found on a Baltic beach in the
northern city of Krynica Morska and forwarded to the laboratory.
Preliminary tests showed no signs of bird flu.
Infected swans have been identified, so far, in the following
European countries: Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Greece, Italy,
Austria, Slovenia, Hungary & Germany.

Panic spreads bird flu in Nigeria
---------------------------------
Nigeria's chief veterinary expert on Tuesday [14 Feb 2006] warned
that panic selling of chickens was fueling a growing epidemic of bird
flu, as fresh outbreaks were reported in Africa's most populous
country.
Dr. Lami Lombin, director of the National Veterinary Research
Institute, said distress sales by poultry farmers were exacerbating
the situation in the sprawling nation, where the disease has thus far
been confined to the north.
"I think they should stop the panic, because the panic makes them
want to sell out. We've told them not to panic," she told AFP, adding
that her message to them was to "keep it on your farm."
Lombin stressed that the government would compensate farmers for
chickens that die and help them restock after the crisis abates.
Lombin said avian influenza had been detected in 2 more farms in
Plateau State overnight [14 Feb 2006], bringing the total there to 5,
and that samples would be sent to the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization to check whether it is the deadly H5N1 strain, as with
previous outbreaks.
"We are hoping that we will soon have the reagents to test for H5N1
ourselves; that is our most urgent need," she said.
Officials in Jigawa and Borno states in the north of the country,
where there have been as yet no confirmed cases, told AFP that
farmers were dumping chicken quickly on the market at low prices. [See map at

Tens of thousands of chickens, geese and ostriches have been culled,
burned and buried, and the government has vowed tough measures to
prevent the virus spreading to the densely-populated southwest and
the economic capital Lagos.

Follow-up report No. 1, Greece
------------------------------
In a report sent to the OIE on 15 Feb 2006, the following data are
given pertaining to a case on the island of Skyros confirmed as H5N1
by the reference laboratory in Weybridge[UK]:
On 3 Feb 2006 in the area of Skyros Island, people informed the
veterinary authorities about the presence of one wild goose found
dead. The veterinary authorities collected the wild goose and sent it
to the NRL immediately. The bird species is _Branta ruficollis_. No
anatomopathological signs were observed. In addition, the Veterinary
Authority of Evia has been applying, since 10 Feb 2006, an epizootic
survey and fully implementing all the measures [stipulated in] the EU
Commission Decision 2006/86/EU throughout the whole territory of the
Island.
According to this survey, there are no findings of avian influenza in
the area, while strict biosecurity measures have been applied to all
backyard flocks kept in villages over the whole island. There are no
commercial poultry farms on the island.
