Guinea says 2 people tested positive for Ebola
--------------------------------------
Two people have tested positive for Ebola in Guinea, the government said on Thursday [17 Mar 2016], hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared neighboring Sierra Leone's latest outbreak was over.

Four people were tested and 2 of them were found to have Ebola, a government agency spokesman said. They were all from Korokpara, a village where 3 people from the same family have died in the past few weeks from diarrhea and vomiting.

"All of the sick people have been taken to the Nzerekore treatment center," the National Coordination of the Fight against Ebola in Guinea's Fode Tass Sylla said.

The world's worst recorded Ebola epidemic is believed to have started in Guinea and killed about 2500 people by December last year [2015], at which point the WHO said the virus was no longer being actively transmitted.

More than 11 300 people have died since the outbreak began in 2013, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The WHO did warn on Thursday [17 Mar 2016] however that Ebola could resurface at any time, since it can linger in the eyes, central nervous system and bodily fluids of some survivors.

It was not immediately clear how the villagers from Korokpara had contracted the disease but the area had previously resisted efforts to fight the illness in the initial epidemic.

Government spokesman, Damantang Albert Camara, said: "Vaccines have been taken to the zone to avoid new infections. The area has been locked down."

Residents and authorities remain on edge across West Africa, though in many areas procedures to combat Ebola remain lax, experts say.

"Strong surveillance and emergency response capacity need to be maintained, along with rigorous hygiene practices at home and in health facilities and active community participation," WHO said in a statement released earlier on Thursday [17 Mar 2016].

The WHO had announced Sierra Leone has had no new cases of the virus for 42 days, twice the length of the virus's incubation period - the time that elapses between transmission of the disease and the appearance of symptoms.

Sierra Leone was 1st declared free of Ebola transmissions in November [2015] before tests revealed one woman had died of the disease in January [2016], the same week that the WHO had declared the region free of new transmissions of the virus.

The case of [the woman] displayed how easily Ebola can return if precautions are not taken and patients do not seek quick medical attention.

[She] had traveled across the country and come into contact with dozens of people after contracting the illness. Family members had washed her corpse, considered dangerous since the virus remains contagious for days after death.

[2] Guinea (N'zérékoré)

In Guinea, in the prefecture of N'zérékoré, a yet unidentified disease is making the population anxious.

Two people have already died but a health official, contacted by the BBC, does not confirm if this indicates reappearance of Ebola.

The symptoms observed in 2 persons before their death were vomiting and diarrhea.

These people belong to the same family living in Poropara, 45 kilometers from the center of Nzerekore.

A 3rd person [a minor] is in critical condition.

Joined by the BBC, a health official refuses any official interview. Because he said, "we must avoid shortcuts." The doctor says that bood has been drawn and is being analyzed.

As for the family concerned, it would have resisted the Red Cross workers dispatched to the quarantine.

For its part, the site Guineematin.com tried unsuccessfully to talk with the officials of the National Coordination of the fight against Ebola.

The Ebola outbreak officially ended in Guinea and neighboring countries. But Guinea is still in the enhanced surveillance period of 90 days.

Two people died of an unidentified disease in N'zérékoré in the south-east of Guinea.
----------------------------
A man and his wife died of a mysterious disease sowing panic in the population in the locality of Koropara, located 45 kilometers from the center of Nzérékoré.

The symptoms observed in the 2 persons, before their death, are vomiting and diarrhea. A 3rd person, a minor, is in a critical state.

According to our colleagues at Guineematin.com, it was impossible to meet with those responsible for the national coordination of the fight against Ebola.

The epidemic of Ebola has formally ended in Guinea and in the neighboring countries, but the country is still in the period of closer monitoring of 90 days.

The WHO has announced today, Thu [17 Mar 2016], the end of Ebola in Sierra Leone and the end of transmission in West Africa.

[The World Health Organization announced that Guinea was free of Ebola virus transmission in late December 2015. The epidemic in the country had begun at the end of 2013 and has led to 11 300 dead; with 22 000 children having lost a parent. The economy and the development of a general way of life have taken a serious blow. The country is in full reconstruction with the support of the technical and financial partners (PTF). A new epidemic of the EVD could be dramatic for the country. .-Mod.BM. transl LK]

[In the WHO Ebola situation report for 16 Mar 2016, Guinea was declared free of Ebola transmission linked directly to the original outbreak on 29 Dec 2015, and was due to complete its 90-day period of enhanced surveillance on 27 Mar 2016. "Human-to-human transmission linked to the most recent cluster of 2 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 1st reported from Sierra Leone on 14 Jan 2016 will be declared to have ended on 17 Mar 2016, 42 days after the 2nd and last case in the cluster provided a 2nd consecutive negative blood sample (RT-PCR) and was discharged. Human-to-human transmission linked to the most recent cluster of cases in Liberia was declared to have ended on 14 Jan 2016. Guinea was declared free of Ebola transmission linked directly to the original outbreak on 29 Dec 2015, and would have completed its 90-day period of enhanced surveillance on 27 March 2016.016." ...-more)( See http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/who-ebola-situation-report-16-march-2016)
