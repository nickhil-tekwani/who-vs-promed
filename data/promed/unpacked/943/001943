Investigations and control measures following a case of inhalation
anthrax in East London in a drum maker and drummer, October 2008.

We discuss the investigations and control measures undertaken
following the notification of a fatal case of inhalation anthrax in
East London. The patient is believed to have acquired the infection
from making animal hide drums. Environmental investigations
identified one drum and 2 pieces of animal skins contaminated with
anthrax spores.

[It is recommended that readers review the full report.

The clinical progress was rapid but not unusual and such patients are
traditionally very hard to save. But 2 aspects jump out to this reader:

[1] How did he get infected?/what was the infective dose? Only one
drum and the left-over bits of skin from that drum were contaminated.
And "None of the surfaces at the studio flat were positive for
anthrax. It was therefore decided that extensive decontamination of
the flat would not be necessary. However, the contaminated drum was
removed and the area surrounding it was decontaminated using 10 000
ppm hypochlorite solution." This is in contrast to the 2006
Pennsylvania case where there was extensive workshop contamination of
his apartment, workshop and of his van. The factors in his favour
were that he went for medical attention early and he might have had a
cutaneous infection in 2003, and thus a measure of prior immunity. If
the investigators did a thorough swabbing of the workshop and it was
clean either he had his head very close to the contaminated drum
(skin) when working on it and/or he had a prior risk factor, inspite
of being late in getting attention. As with the Scottish drum it is a
pity it was not beaten and the spore genesis measured before the drum
skin was destroyed.

[2] Having suffered from a bad bout of Cl. difficile infection thanks
to cipro I am sensitive to the prolonged use of oral ciprofloxacin.
The human vaccine is a toxoid and therefore can be given
similtaneously with antibiotic treatment. And thus a 2nd vaccine shot
at around 10-14 days should be adequate to provide onward protection
without any more antibiotic cover; if cautious, a 3rd shot could be
considered. Some may disagree.

In retrospect any experienced investigator will tell one of things
that could have been done differently so no critiscism is implied in
my comments. I have been there. - Mod.MHJ]
