A total of 7358 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) have been recorded in the state from the beginning of this year [2013] till 21 Sep 2013. According to statistics from the Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (CPRC) of the state Health Department's Communicable Disease Control Section, there were 11 903 cases during the corresponding period last year [2012].

Kuching Division registered the most cases at 1737, followed by Miri (1712 cases), Sibu (1022 cases), Samarahan (550 cases), Sarikei (487 cases), Limbang (387 cases), Bintulu (369 cases), Mukah (346 cases), Kapit (309 cases), Sri Aman (222 cases), and Betong (217 cases). State Health director Datu Dr Zulkifli Jantan told The Borneo Post yesterday [6 Oct 2013] that although the number of HFMD cases had breached the 7000 mark, the situation was under control. "The situation has not breached the alert level in the state. "Kuching, Sibu, and Miri are the highest because of natural distribution of population. Cases are mostly urban, but we noticed an increasing trend in the rural areas."

CPRC statistics showed that the number of pre-schools closed till 21 Sep 2013 due to HFMD was 15. Dr Zulkifli advised parents and carers to continue practising a high level of personal hygiene and cleanliness to keep the contagious disease at bay. They should wash their hands regularly with soaps or hand sanitizer after visiting toilets, coughing, or sneezing, and before preparing food. He advised parents against bringing their children to crowded public places such as shopping malls and recreational parks. "Parents must also ensure that their children are not sent to school if he or she is down with HFMD. They should practise self-isolation at home. This includes non-sharing of eating utensils and handkerchiefs."

He stressed that it was mandatory for nurseries and schools to report to the department if they suspected a child was down with HFMD. Dr Zulkifli stressed that if any child exhibited HFMD symptoms or were unwell, they must not be permitted into the premises to prevent the spread of the disease. He added that both private clinics and hospitals were required to notify the authorities of HFMD cases.
