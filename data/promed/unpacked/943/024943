An outbreak of invasive group A _streptococcus_ (iGAS) infections caused by a rare emm type has been observed in Vancouver's downtown core ("Downtown Eastside") [A map showing the location of Downtown Eastside Vancouver can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downtown+Eastside,+Vancouver,+BC,+Canada. - Mod.ML]. The outbreak was identified after a significant increase in the number of iGAS bacteremia cases was detected in patients seen at St. Paul's Hospital from December 2019 to January 2020 compared to the same time period in the prior 2 years.

Since [1 Dec 2019], there have been a total of 25 cases of iGAS at St. Paul's Hospital, 9 of which were severe, including 3 mortalities. The majority of hospitalized cases presented to hospital with complicated skin and soft tissue infections, followed by toxic-shock syndrome in 7 cases, and pneumonia in 5 cases. The current outbreak is affecting predominantly younger adult males who have a history of injection drug use, are homeless, or live in crowded conditions like single-resident occupancy rooms or shelters.

As many as 18 of 25 (72%) cases have been attributed to subtype emm6, which is a relatively rare subtype in Canada; 4 cases have been attributed to non-emm6 subtypes, and 3 isolates are still waiting to be typed. During this period, St. Paul's Hospital captured 71% of the hospitalized emm6 iGAS patients regionally within Vancouver Coastal Health Authority. The recent emergence of emm6 GAS suggests rapid spread of a virulent bacterial clone within the downtown community amongst drug users and homeless individuals.

Previously, the only other described outbreak of emm6 GAS involved military recruits in the Canadian Armed Forces at a military training base in Quebec from 2016 to 2017 (1). The military outbreak included 4 cases of invasive infections, and approximately 600 cases of pharyngitis - all attributed to emm6. Precise virulence factors and transmissibility factors that enable emm6 GAS to spread clonally remain unknown. In the coming weeks, descriptive and molecular epidemiological studies will be conducted to better characterize the dynamics and transmission of this outbreak.

In the interim, Vancouver Coastal Health Public Health have alerted healthcare workers and outreach groups in downtown Vancouver regarding the presence of a potentially more virulent strain of GAS circulating in the community. Public notices have emphasized conducting frequent skin/wound checks, maintaining good personal hygiene and respiratory practices (if possible), avoiding shared injection equipment and supplies, and seeking early medical attention if infection starts to develop.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Lynne Li for submission of the above report of an outbreak since 1 Dec 2019 of invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) infections due to rare emm type 6 in predominantly younger adult males who are homeless, are injection drug users or live in crowded conditions in single-resident occupancy rooms or shelters in downtown Vancouver, Canada.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) commonly cause pharyngitis and superficial skin infections but can also cause invasive infections, including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis (NF), toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Serious non-suppurative sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, and glomerulonephritis may also occur.

GAS can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html). Over 200 _emm_ types have been identified. Molecular analysis of the isolates emm aids documenting a common source of an outbreak.

A prior ProMED-mail post reported an outbreak of iGAS infection in 2016 - 2017 in homeless people and people who inject drugs in London, Ontario Canada that was due to emm types 74 and 81; these emm types differed from emm types that were circulating in the general population, emm type 1 being most common (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A - Canada (05): (ON) fatal, under-housed, IDU, comment 20171129.5472190).

Another prior ProMED-mail post reported an outbreak of GAS infection in 2016 - 2017 in residents of a shelter for homeless in Toronto, Canada that was mainly due to emm74 (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (02): (ON) fatal, homeless shelter, emm74, clonal 20170406.4952247); and another ProMED-mail post reported an outbreak in homeless people in Montreal in 2017 due emm74 (ProMED-mail Streptococcus, group A - Canada (03): (QC) fatal, homeless, emm74, RFI 20170816.5252887).

The following is the abstract from the journal article reporting an outbreak at a Canadian military training facility due to GAS emm type 6 referenced in the report submitted by Dr. Li above:

Abstract
--------
"Between December 2016 and April 2017, two cases of invasive Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections were reported at a Canadian military training facility. An outbreak was declared and a field investigation was launched to characterize the outbreak and identify associated risk factors to limit transmission. Throat culture data from military personnel at the garrison were analyzed. Investigators tracked invasive GAS cases and non-invasive hospitalized GAS cases, and conducted site visits and case interviews. Sensitivity and specificity for a rapid antigen detection test were evaluated. Molecular typing and phylogenomic relationships of outbreak isolates were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing. During this outbreak, 4 invasive cases were reported and 6 non-invasive cases were hospitalized. In a sample of 705 throat cultures examined, 35.2% were GAS-positive. Among 65 platoon contacts of one invasive case, 30.2% were GAS-positive. Reluctance to seek medical care, challenges in following cough etiquette, and low compliance with antibiotics were identified among recruits. The rapid antigen detection test had low sensitivity (31.6%) during the outbreak. The outbreak sequence type was emm6.4 and outbreak isolates were highly related phylogenetically, differing by 0-4 single nucleotide variants. This is the 1st report of a GAS outbreak among Canadian military trainees. Increased surveillance of GAS infections, increased control measures and outbreak-specific clinical guidelines were implemented in-garrison. No further invasive GAS cases were identified. A GAS surveillance system was implemented and efforts to improve antibiotic compliance and medical consultation were recommended."

It is hoped that the ongoing investigation will elucidate any linkage between the current outbreak in downtown Vancouver and the outbreak at the Canadian military training facility, both due to GAS emm type 6. - Mod.ML
