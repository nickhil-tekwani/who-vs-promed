Update on Measles in Mexico - (Updated 3 Jun 2004, Released 7 May 2004)
---------------------------------------------------
As of 17 May 2004, the Mexican Secretariat of Health has reported 64
cases of measles this year, all linked to an imported strain with
origins in Asia. The cases have occurred in 5 areas: the Federal
District and the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Campeche, and Coahuila.
Mexico reported only 44 cases of measles in 2003, no cases in 1997
and 1999, and few cases during intervening years. Most of the persons
affected have been older than 15 years of age.
The Mexican government has launched a vaccination campaign and
enhanced surveillance in response to the situation.
On 14 May 2004, the Mexican Secretariat of Health reported 2 cases of
measles in Coahuila state across the border from Del Rio, Texas. In
response to the 2 border cases, Texas Department of Health (TDH)
issued a notice asking Texas doctors and others to be alert for
possible cases of measles along the state's border with Mexico. The
TDH notice recommends that persons visiting Mexico follow the
standard ACIP recommendations for international travelers. Persons
who travel or live abroad and who do not have acceptable evidence of
immunity should be vaccinated with MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella
vaccine). In general, people can be considered immune to measles if
they have documentation of physician-diagnosed measles, laboratory
evidence of measles immunity, or proof of receipt of 2 doses of live
measles vaccine on or after their 1st birthday. Most people born
before 1957 are likely to have had measles disease and generally are
not considered susceptible.
However, measles or MMR vaccine may be given to this group of people
if there is reason to believe they might be susceptible. Children who
travel or live abroad should be vaccinated at an earlier age than
recommended for children remaining in the United States. Before their
departure from the United States, children aged > 12 months should
have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days,
with the 1st dose administered on or after the 1st birthday. Children
aged 6-11 months should receive a dose of measles vaccine before
departure. These children should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR,
the 1st of which should be administered when the child is aged >12
months and the second at least 28 days later.
Although vaccination against measles, mumps, or rubella is not a
requirement for entry into any country (including the United States),
U.S. residents traveling internationally to any destination or living
abroad should ensure that they are immune to all 3 diseases. Measles
is still common in many countries, including developed countries in
Europe and Asia. For more information, see
