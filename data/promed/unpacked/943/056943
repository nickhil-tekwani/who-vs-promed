Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 28 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 May 2014, the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point of Jordan reported to WHO an additional Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) case in Amman, Jordan.

The case is a 69-year-old male Jordanian citizen and resident of Amman governorate. The patient was admitted to hospital on [29 Apr 2014] for a surgical procedure. He was discharged on 3 May 2014. On [8 May 2014], the patient presented with fever. His condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the same hospital on [11 May 2014]. 2 days later, on [13 May 2014], he started to complain of cough. A specimen collected from the patient tested negative for MERS on the same day, but a chest X-ray showed pneumonia. A 2nd specimen was collected and it tested positive by PCR on [23 May 2014]. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit in critical condition.

The patient is known to have comorbidities, no history of travel, and no history of contact with animals. He also has no history of contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case. However, he was admitted to the same hospital where a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV fatal case was admitted. This case was reported to WHO on [6 May 2014].

Contact tracing and screening of family members, health workers, and patients for MERS-CoV is currently ongoing.

Globally, 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 193 deaths. This global total includes all of the cases reported in this update, plus 17 laboratory confirmed cases officially reported to WHO by Saudi Arabia between [16 and 18 May 2014]. WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

[3] USA (Illinois) NOT MERS-CoV infected: media report 28 May 2014
Date: Wed 28 May 2014
Source: NBC News [edited]
http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/mers-mystery/cdc-backtracks-illinois-man-didnt-have-mers-after-all-n116436


The Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) has infected more than 500 people since it was first identified in 2012, spread to 16 countries, including at least 3 cases in the United States, and killed about a quarter of its victims.

Federal health officials backtracked Wednesday [28 May 2014], saying an Illinois man believed to be infected with the mysterious new MERS virus didn't have signs of the disease after all.

A more sensitive blood test came back negative for MERS in the man who was originally thought to have been infected by the 1st US MERS case, an Indiana health worker who contracted the virus in Saudi Arabia, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

"After completing additional and more definitive laboratory tests, our experts have now concluded that the Indiana patient did not spread the virus to the Illinois patient," Dr David Swerdlow, who's leading the CDC's MERS response, told reporters.

The infection would have been the 1st instance of person-to-person spread of MERS in the US, a potentially worrisome development for the virus that surfaced in 2012 and has sickened at least 635 people and killed 193 worldwide. MERS is believed to have mortality rate of 30 percent, experts say.

CDC officials originally said the 2 men, who are business associates, met twice, including one 40-minute, face-to-face session, and shook hands, potentially spreading the MERS virus.

Health officials had said the Illinois man tested negative for active infection and had no symptoms of illness, but that blood tests showed he had developed antibodies that were apparent evidence of past infection with MERS, said Dr David Swerdlow, who is leading the CDC's response to the virus.

Now, however, CDC officials say that the blood work relies on 3 separate tests and that while the 1st 2 showed evidence of MERS antibodies, the 3rd, more definitive test, which takes longer, came back negative. MERS is also known as MERS coronavirus, or MERS-CoV.

"Based on the results of these tests, which require careful interpretation, CDC has concluded that the Illinois resident was not previously infected with MERS-CoV," officials said.

CDC officials appeared to defend the premature release of potentially alarming information. "While we never want to cause undue concern among those who have had contact with a MERS patient, it is our job to move quickly when there is a potential public health threat," Swerdlow said in a statement. "Because there is still much we don't know about this virus, we will continue to err on the side of caution when responding to and investigating cases of MERS in this country."

Swerdlow said the CDC acted quickly in notifying the public and potential contacts of the Illinois man in the interest of transparency and public safety. "We really can't wait until we have all the tests back," he said.

The 3rd test, known as the neutralizing antibody assay, not only takes longer but relies on live MERS virus, so must be conducted in a high-containment lab, a cumbersome and time-consuming prospect, officials added.

CDC officials originally had said the Illinois man was not counted as an active case, but could have been an example of silent MERS infection in people who don't develop symptoms of the disease. Early research suggests that about 20 percent of the cases show no signs of active infection, but have MERS antibodies in their blood.

The Illinois man has been cooperating with CDC and local health officials, wearing a mask and limiting contact with crowds. Swerdlow said he couldn't describe the man's reaction when he found out he didn't have MERS.

Wednesday's [28 May 2014] announcement came a week after health officials said the 2nd US case of MERS, a 44-year-old Florida man, had tested negative for the disease and was discharged from the hospital. In addition, follow-up testing on all 23 health workers exposed to the Florida MERS patient showed that they didn't contract the virus, health officials said. They've since returned to work.

Tests now show that 53 healthcare workers who cared for the Indiana man, plus household contacts, didn't catch the virus, either. The man felt ill after returning from Saudi Arabia on [27 Apr 2014] and was confirmed to have MERS on [2 May 2014] officials said. Along the way, he took 2 international flights and a 70-minute bus ride. So far, none of his fellow passengers has evidence of the virus, Swerdlow said.

The good news, CDC officials said, is that the lack of infection in the Indiana man underscores their belief that MERS is not easily spread in community settings and that there is very little danger to the general public.

"It's a little reassuring that this gentleman was not a case," Swerdlow said.

[4] USA (Illinois) NOT MERS-CoV infected: CDC press release 28 May 2014

CDC concludes Indiana MERS patient did not spread virus to Illinois business associate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
After completing additional and more definitive laboratory tests, CDC officials have concluded that an Indiana MERS patient did not spread the virus to an Illinois associate during a business meeting they had before the patient became ill and was hospitalized.

CDC and state and local public health officials are conducting voluntary testing of people who had contact with 2 travelers who went from Saudi Arabia to the US where they were confirmed to have Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. One type of tests conducted by state and CDC labs uses respiratory samples and can quickly indicate if a person has active infection with the virus. These tests are called PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, assays. Another type of testing, conducted on blood samples in CDC labs, is called serology and is designed to look for antibodies to Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Antibodies would indicate that a person had been previously infected with the virus and developed an immune response. To conduct serology for MERS-CoV, CDC performs 3 separate tests -- ELISA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IFA or immunofluorescent assay, and a 3rd more definitive test called the neutralizing antibody assay, which takes longer than the other 2 tests.

The Illinois resident, a business associate who had extended face-to-face contact with the Indiana MERS patient, tested negative for active MERS-CoV infection by PCR in the days after his interaction with the man. Given the Illinois man's contact with the MERS patient, CDC conducted serology testing to see if the Illinois man had antibodies to MERS-CoV. Preliminary ELISA and IFA results announced by CDC on [17 May 2014] indicated that the Illinois resident appeared to be positive for MERS-CoV antibodies.

"The initial ELISA and IFA serology results indicated the possibility that the Illinois resident had been previously infected with MERS-CoV," said David Swerdlow, MD, who is leading CDC's MERS-CoV response. "This compelled us to notify and test those people with whom he had close contact in the days following his interaction with the Indiana MERS patient."

CDC scientists have since tested additional blood samples and completed the slower, definitive serology test, the neutralizing antibody test, which requires at least 5 days before a result is available. Based on the result of all of these tests, which require careful interpretation, CDC has concluded that the Illinois resident was not previously infected with MERS-CoV.

"While we never want to cause undue concern among those who have had contact with a MERS patient, it is our job to move quickly when there is a potential public health threat," said Swerdlow. "Because there is still much we don't know about this virus, we will continue to err on the side of caution when responding to and investigating cases of MERS in this country."

To date, active MERS-CoV infection has not been found in any of the contacts of the 2 people in the US confirmed to have the disease. However, investigations are ongoing, including voluntary serology testing of contacts. This vigilant approach is intended to help CDC reduce any immediate public health threat, as well as help the global scientific community gain a better understanding of how MERS-CoV spreads so we can more effectively control this disease in the future. There is currently no evidence of sustained spread of MERS-CoV in community settings.

As CDC continues to gather additional information, officials will update the agency's MERS recommendations as needed. At this time, CDC's recommendations to the public, travelers, doctors, and other healthcare providers have not changed.

[This update includes the daily report of MERS-CoV newly confirmed cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia bringing the total numbers of cases and deaths reported by Saudi Arabia to 565 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV cases including 186 deaths (see [1] above).

The next report (see [2] above) is a WHO update confirming the earlier reported case of MERS-CoV in Jordan. Additional information provided in this update is that the patient had been previously admitted to the same hospital as an earlier confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection, but for health issues not related to MERS-CoV infection. Several days following discharge from this hospital, this individual had onset of symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection. Hence, this case would be considered as a nosocomial associated infection. According to the WHO update for 28 May 2014, there have now been 636 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV officially reported to WHO including 193 deaths, including cases reported by Saudi Arabia through 18 May 2014. Since 18 May 2014 there have been an additional 34 cases including 17 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia, and 2 cases reported in the press by the Iranian MOH. Inclusion of these additional cases and deaths would bring the global tally of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections to 672 cases including 210 deaths.

A map showing the locations of recently reported cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia can be seen at the Ministry of Health URL above. For a map of Jordan, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2504495,91. - Mod.MPP]
