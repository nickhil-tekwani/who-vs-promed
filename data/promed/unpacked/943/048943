Wisconsin residents were advised Wednesday [17 Oct 2007] to discard
certain frozen pot pies linked to salmonella illnesses of 22 people
in 15 counties in the state.

A Banquet frozen turkey pot pie tested positive for the bacterium at
the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection
laboratory, according to Stephanie Marquis of the state Department of
Health and Family Services.

The previously unopened pot pie came from the freezer of a person who
was diagnosed with salmonellosis in September 2007, she said in a
news release.

Further laboratory testing was pending to confirm whether the
bacteria matched the strain blamed for 211 illnesses nationwide,
including the 22 in Wisconsin.

According to health officials, people should discard all varieties of
the following 7-ounce single serving brands bearing an establishment
number "P-9" or "Est. 1059" on the side of the package:

- Banquet (sold in many stores)
- Great Value (sold at WalMart)
- Albertson's (sold at Albertson's)
- Food Lion (sold at Food Lion)
- Hill Country Fare (sold at HEB)
- Kirkwood (sold at Aldi)
- Kroger (sold at Kroger)
- Meijer (sold at Meijer)
- Western Family (now discontinued)

[This may be the 1st confirmation of a "smoking" pie. By that, it is
meant that the same organism has been isolated from the implicated
vehicle. - Mod.LL]

[This posting increases the total number of cases to 211 and the
states involved to 35. The previous thread, citing a 15 Oct 2007 CDC
report, had 181 cases and 33 states. At least 6 of the new 30 cases
were in Colorado, which previously had only one implicated case of
the _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- strain. A discussion on _Salmonella_
nomenclature can be found in a previous thread (Salmonellosis, frozen
poultry pie - USA (multistate)(04): recall 20071013.3355). - Mod.LL]
