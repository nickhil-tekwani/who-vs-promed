Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1

Outbreak statistics
Species Swine
Apparent morbidity rate 0.10 percent
Apparent mortality rate 0.00 percent
Apparent case fatality rate 0.00 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost* 100.00 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
------------
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: One pig with vesicular lesions was found in
a detention pen (only one pig in that pen) of the slaughterhouse in
Tao Yuan County. Samples for virus detection were collected and sent
to the national laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute). The
prefecture animal disease control competent authority immediately
destroyed the pig. Cleaning and disinfection were implemented in the
index slaughterhouse. Positive results of the tests were obtained by
national laboratory confirming that the pig was infected with serotype
O of foot and mouth disease virus.

The prefecture animal disease control competent authority traced back
to the farm of origin. The clinical investigation showed that all pigs
on farm were healthy. Samples from the farm of origin were collected
for serological tests and virus isolation. Movement control of all
pigs on the farm of origin was implemented. The serological test and
virus detection of the farm of origin of the affected pig are under
way.

Control measures
----------------
Measures applied: Quarantine; Movement control inside the country;
Screening; Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
Modified stamping out; No vaccination; No treatment of affected
animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

[The FMD O serotype matches the same serotype that has occurred
recently in the Penghu Island. Infected pigs in Penghu Island were
identified as coming from Taiwan.

The fact that a single pig in this report was found at a
slaughterhouse with clinical signs and yet there were no other pigs
infected at the farm of origin combined with the history of exported
cases to Penghu Island last month are reasons to be worried about how
well the current situation is controlled. It is important that
intensive efforts are made to put out this low but seemingly
persistent occurrence of FMD serotype O in Taiwan. See Mod.AS in Foot
& mouth disease, swine - Taiwan (03): (PH ex mainland Taiwan) 20111105.3292. - Mod.PC]
