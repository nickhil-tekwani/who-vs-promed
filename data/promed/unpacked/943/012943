[1] Cholera - Malawi (Dedza)

Cholera in Malawi
-----------------
A cholera outbreak has hit the eastern parts of Dedza that lie parallel to
Lake Malawi, with about 51 people suffering from the disease. Dedza
district health officer Isyu Mwakasungura confirmed the outbreak in 7
villages along the shores of lake Malawi but said his office had deployed
emergency teams to help the patients.
He said the outbreak was 1st reported towards the end of last week, with 31
cases at Kaundu and Nakaladzi hospitals. He said the outbreak had affected
51 people by Thu 8 Dec 2005. "The figures are cumulative. It started with
31 cases last week and now we are talking about 51, but what is more
worrisome is that a 7 year old boy has died from the disease," said
Mwakasungura.
He suspected the disease might have been caused by contaminated water,
since all the villages affected lie on the Lake Malawi coastline. "These
are some of the episodes of the rainy season. We are surprised it has come
so powerfully. We did not have this outbreak in 2004," explained Mwakasungura.
Other reports also say another person has died from cholera in Mangochi,
but district health officer Suzgo Mzumara refused to confirm the reports
"because the media have always misquoted him." 10 people suffered from the
disease in Mangochi in November 2005, but they were all treated at Mbowani
Health Center in the district.

[2] Cholera, Liberian refugee camp - Ghana (Central Region)

2 die of cholera at Liberian refugee camp in Ghana
--------------------------------------------------
At least 2 people are said to have died as a result of a cholera outbreak
at the Buduburam Refugee Camp, which hosts about 42 000 Liberians at Gomoa,
Central Region in Ghana. Our Ghana correspondents have quoted the
coordinator of the health and water at the Sanitation Department of the
Liberian Refugee Welfare Council (LRWC), Andrew Nagbe, as saying that the
outbreak was the result of over crowdedness on the 141 acre of land
allocated for the refugees. "It is true that there is an outbreak of
cholera at the Buduburam Camp and [that it] has claimed 2 lives so far,"
said Nagbe, adding, "Refugees bath, toilet in plastic bags and dispose them
in nearby drainages thus causing the environment to be polluted."
He said that health workers at the Saint Gregory Catholic Clinic at the
Buduburam Camp told him that the 2 deaths were caused by high grade
diarrhea leading to dehydration but that the results from Korle-Bu Teaching
Hospital in Accra are yet unknown.
Mr Nagbe further noted that the time lapse in dislodging public latrines in
the camp was one of the major problems. Dislodgement of feces is done every
month to avoid overflow of feces. "But with the increase in population at
the camp, we realize that the toilets get full quicker. We have recommended
that dislodgement be done much earlier," Nagbe indicated, saying, "We are
also trying to advise, educate and sensitize residents about the dangers of
the disease, but it is yielding little or no results."

Taiwan has sent a mission to Sao Tome and Principe to help the African ally
control a cholera outbreak that has killed nearly 20 people, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official said Thu 8 Dec 2005.
According to Lee Chen-hsiung, director-general of the ministry's Department
of African Affairs, more than 1000 suspected cholera cases had been
reported in Sao Tome and Principe as of 4 Dec 2005 since the outbreak 1st
erupted in October 2005, with 60 of the cases having been confirmed.

Cholera epidemic kills 17 in tiny Sao Tome - UNICEF
---------------------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic on the tiny African island of Sao Tome has struck 714
people, killing 17, since October 2005, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said on Fri 2 Dec 2005. "The number of cases has doubled in the
past 2 weeks. It is extremely worrying," a UNICEF spokesman said. Some 30
per cent of those affected are under 14.
Cholera is endemic on the volcanic island in the Gulf of Guinea off West
Africa. An outbreak in May 2005 claimed 3 lives among 255 people hit by the
disease, which is spread through contaminated water and food, causing
severe dehydration due to diarrhea.
UNICEF, which is supplying clean water to affected areas and latrines, is
also considering a government request to deploy its own health experts in
hospitals due to the limited number of staff doctors, the spokesman said.
It has also helped to launch a radio campaign broadcasting simple
prevention measures for the population to take, such as boiling water
before use.
Nearly a 5th of Sao Tome's people have no access to safe drinking water,
and just 9 per cent use hygienic toilet facilities, according to UNICEF.

Cholera kills 18 children in Bonthe
-----------------------------------
18 children are reported to have died of diarrhea in fishing villages
around Delken and its surrounding area in the Bonthe district, southern
Sierra Leone over the past week. This epidemic is reported to have affected
over 1000 people, of whom 30 are children, in that area.
An emergency medical response team from the Ministry of Health and
Sanitation and World Vision-Sierra Leone has been dispatched to the area to
carry out curative and preventive treatment.
Elizabeth Domboi, nurse in charge of health and sanitation, confirmed that
the epidemic killed 18 children before native herbalists put it under
control. She complained that local residents in the district have negative
response towards conventional treatment.
It should be noted that 10 years ago, an outbreak of diarrhea and cholera
claimed the lives of more than 50 people in villages around Bonthe and part
of neighboring Moyamba district

8 reported dead in DR Congo cholera outbreak
--------------------------------------------
At least 8 people have died in a cholera outbreak in Katanga province in
the south east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the charity Medecins
sans Frontieres (MSF -- Doctors without Borders) reported. "We have
registered 50 cases in 2 weeks at Kabalo, which have resulted in 7 deaths
up to today," Diego Cameno, general coordinator of MSF-Spain, told AFP. "In
the area around the town, at least 2 cases have been reported and one death
registered."
The area is a conflict zone where the army has launched an operation
against local militias. "The epidemic is progressing very rapidly," Cameno
said. "We have a team at Kabalo backing up the main hospital and the
surrounding pharmacies and taking care of health emergencies, but the
problem is getting to the patients" in a zone where Mai Mai militias are
active.
Violence carried out by armed groups and fighting between them and
government forces have led to the displacement of about 36 000 people in
Nord-Katanga, according to the World Food Program, of whom about 3000 are
in the Kabolo area.
Humanitarian agencies have practically no access to displaced people in the
combat area and cannot organize convoys in militia-controlled districts
because of a lack of security.

told DVB that there have been no preventative measures from the authorities
and that staff from the government health department had made no concerted
efforts to treat the victims or attempted to stem the outbreak. He added
that the villagers could not protect themselves from the epidemic because
of dire poverty, as they could not even buy necessary basic medicines.

Contaminated wells cause diarrhea outbreak in Samar
---------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) on Mon 12 Dec 2005 said that contaminated
deep wells may have caused an outbreak of diarrhea in Guian, Eastern Samar,
which left 3 residents dead and at least 302 people affected.
Eric Tayag, head of the DOH's National Epidemiology Center, told ANC that
the diarrhea outbreak that started in October 2005 was caused by dirty
water from deep wells. Tayag said that residents have been advised to boil
the water taken from wells and faucets before drinking.
He said that 3 residents of the affected barangays have already died of
diarrhea, while at least 302 people are still being treated. Most of the
victims were children between the ages of one to 14. Tayag also said that
the DOH regional office and the provincial government of Eastern Samar have
already sent medicine and chlorine tablets to Guian.
Luz Pimentel, surveillance officer of Filipe Abrigo Memorial Hospital,
earlier said that the diarrhea was 1st reported in Barangay Bungtod in
Guian. The disease later spread to 42 other barangays of Guian, she added.

Dysentery on the rise in wake of floods
---------------------------------------
Health authorities yesterday, 5 Dec 2005, warned that the number of
patients affected by dysentery had increased over the last few days
following torrential rains and flood situations in many parts of the
country. The number of patients affected by dysentery has topped 160. The
number of dysentery cases island-wide stood at 101 as of last Fri 2 Dec 2005.
"The highest number of dysentery cases are reported from Kurunegala (77)
and Matale (32), while Puttalam also had recorded 12 cases," a Ministry
spokesman told the Daily News. Besides, a significant number of cases are
reported from Kandy, Dehiwala, Tirncomalee and Hipalogama in Anuradhapura.
Health officials attributed this increase to the pollution of water due to
the flood condition experienced during the last week. "Excreta has found
its way into drinking water, leading to high level of pollution." Officials
requested the public to drink boiled water only and desist from consuming
raw vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, for some time to prevent the
spread of disease.

Diarrhea claims 3 lives in Catanduanes
--------------------------------------
3 people died of diarrhea in Barangay Cogon in Virac, Catanduanes,
prompting the Department of Health (DOH) to investigate the cause of an
apparent outbreak among other residents, ANC reported Tue 6 Dec 2005.
Dr Ferchito Avelino, assistant regional health director in Bicol, said the
cases could be related to a similar incident reported in the municipalities
of San Andres and Virac in September 2005. "There were 14 confirmed deaths
in San Andres and Virac [in September 2005] which were caused by water
sources contaminated by _E. coli_ bacteria," Avelino said.
At least 70 other residents in Cogon were taken to hospitals after showing
symptoms of the disease. The apparent outbreak was 1st reported on 30 Nov
2005. A 4 person team from the DOH has been sent to the barangay to
investigate the spread of diarrhea.

Diarrhea hits Vanuatu volcano evacuation camp
---------------------------------------------
Diarrhea has hit some people in an evacuation camp on South Pacific Vanuatu
after a volcano began erupting, according to the Monday, 12 Dec 2005,
report from Ambae Island, Vanuatu.
Around 5000 evacuees were moved on Ambae Island last weekend after Mt
Manaro began erupting sulfur gas and ash up to 3000 meters above this
island of 10 000 villagers in northern Vanuatu. Aid staff said they
received reports of diarrhea in the evacuation camps. After checking with
the health nurse at the center, "there are a few people with these diseases."
Villagers used to living in huts built from palm fronds and sheets of tin
in the cool jungles on the volcano's flanks are now crowded into hot
concrete block buildings close to the shore.
