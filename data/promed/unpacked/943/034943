State and local health authorities in Colorado are acknowledging they are investigating an apparent foodborne illness outbreak involving a Chipotle Mexican Grill near Denver.

2 agencies, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE] and the local Tri-County Health Department, are involved, and CDPHE issued the following statement:

"CDPHE is partnering with the Tri-County Health Department on a suspected foodborne outbreak at the Chipotle located at 6710 S Cornerstar Way. The investigation is ongoing, and at this time, the cause of the illness has not been identified. Symptoms appear to be consistent with viral gastroenteritis, which is often caused by norovirus. So far, CDPHE has identified a total of 8 ill patrons
and employees. Public health officials are working closely with the restaurant, which has implemented disease control measures."

As many as 5 local high school tennis team members and 6 other people from the community blame the Chipotle location in Aurora, Colorado, next to Denver, for their illnesses. One customer told a local television station that her family had 3 burritos, a burrito bowl, and a small soft taco, and within 36 hours, all were sick except for her husband. "Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, we all had a low-grade fever, body aches, it was awful," she said. Her 8-year-old was admitted to urgent care for severe dehydration. Anti-nausea medicine was used to treat the other ill family members.

The customer contacted both the local restaurant and Chipotle's corporate headquarters in California. The restaurant promised to get back to her. Corporate Chipotle did not provide anyone to talk to her but directed her to their website. She wants someone from the restaurant chain to take responsibility for the illnesses.

A spate of foodborne illnesses involving Chipotle in 2015 led to dramatic reductions in its stock values, a change-out of its corporate leadership, and its corporate headquarters move to Newport Beach, California from Denver. CMG has recovered since then with its stock price tripling since its 2015 troubles.

[The etiology of this cluster is yet to be clearly determined.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about 1 in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it is about 1 in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for a smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the USA and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LL
