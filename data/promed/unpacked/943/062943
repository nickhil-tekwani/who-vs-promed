Anthrax-Infected Cow Found In Russia's Voronezh Region
---------------------------------
The Voronezh regional office of the Russian federal food quality
watchdog Rospotrebnadzor reported Monday a case of anthrax in the
central-Russia region of Voronezh.
An anthrax-infected cow was found on a private holding in the village
of Turovo in the Nizhnedevitsky district of Voronezh.
Rospotrebnadzor said the cow had been removed and killed, the area
was being disinfected and the people who had come into contact with
the infected animal were being treated by local doctors.

[As this disease is characteristically initiated by finding an animal
dead which had been in apparent good health the day before, I am a
little leary of this account. Animals clinically ill from anthrax are
usually noted once the disease has broken out when owners are then
aware of what is going on. And secondly cows respond well to
antibiotic treatment even when seemingly moribund. Also there would
be no need to treat "exposed" humans unless they had butchered the
animal. So it is probably the same old story of diagnosing anthrax
after the event. MHJ Mod]
