HPAI in Europe 2007: Concurrent Outbreaks in Poultry and Wild Birds
[text excerpts]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 13 Jul 2007, the ongoing outbreaks in Europe reveal that deaths
occurred in: 1) 1800 domestic turkeys in the Czech Republic starting
on 21 Jun 2007; 2) 8 mute swans (_Cyngus olor_) and a Canada goose
(_Branta canadensis_) on 25 Jun 2007 in Germany; 3) 153 black-necked
grebes (_Podiceps nigricollis_) in Germany and 3 mute swans in France
on 4 Jul 2007; 4) a domestic goose in Germany on 8 Jul 2007, and 5) a
mute swan in the Czech Republic on 10 Jul 2007.
To date from surveys and surveillance in wild birds, with the
analysis of more than 300 000 freeranging healthy bird samples in
over 40 countries, only a very few rare samples from healthy wild
birds have been shown to be positive for H5N1 HPAI virus. Therefore,
we could say that a wildlife reservoir for this disease has not yet
been clearly identified. In fact, to answer this question whether
wild birds are reservoirs or not, additional surveillance is
necessary, and a more focused approach is warranted with emphasis on
determining whether healthy wild birds are found to be positive for
H5N1 HPAI near, adjacent to, or on infected poultry farms,
demonstrating movement of virus either from poultry to wild birds, or
visa versa.
While introduction of H5N1 HPAI from wild birds can not be ruled out,
as we have seen from many past H5N1 HPAI outbreaks that initially
occurred in poultry facilities, a much more classical explanation for
the initial outbreak is importation of contaminated egg shells or
their crates, poultry, or unintentional spread of disease by workers,
equipment, or other fomites. Thus far, no information exists to
support these introduction mechanisms either, further emphasizing the
need for thorough epidemiological investigations that take into
consideration a full evaluation of biosecurity as well as production,
trade, and wildlife mechanisms of disease introduction.
A more likely explanation of the events observed since 21 Jun 2007 is
that the disease has spilled over from the turkey farms in the Czech
Republic resulting in wild bird infections. Although no recognized
migrations are occurring at this time of year in Europe (or the rest
of the world for that matter as in this time frame all long distance
migration has ceased and birds are in their breeding or moulting
habitats), it is certainly conceivable that swans could have become
infected in the Czech Republic and flown relatively short distances
from the Czech Republic to Germany where they died. Another scenario
might be that bridge species (sparrows, jays, etc.) may have carried
the disease from the index farm out into more natural habitats where
swans became infected.
Preliminary analysis indicates that the two viruses isolated from
separate poultry infections in the Czech Republic share 100 percent
identity and 99.6 percent identity with the mute swan isolate from
the Czech Republic. The isolate from a mute swan in Bavaria (Germany)
is 99.2 percent homologous to the Czech isolate from turkeys and
other isolates obtained from wild birds in Germany and France also
group closely with the virus from the Czech Republic. This suggests
local dispersal of the same virus after introduction.
According to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, phylogenetic analysis
of the Czech isolate for HA1 reveals closest genetic similarity (99.5
percent at the nucleotide level) to recent viruses isolated from
poultry and 'captive hunting' falcons in Kuwait in March 2007. These
isolates group more widely with contemporary and 2006 strains from
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Azerbaijan. However, they appear to be less
related to viruses isolated from both wild birds and poultry during
the outbreaks in EU Member States in 2006 and different from the
viruses obtained during outbreaks in Hungary and the UK at the
beginning of 2007. Therefore, the current outbreak in Europe
represents a new introduction of virus into Europe, however the
source remains unknown.

Communicated by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley
[A total of 7 countries in Europe and the Middle East have now
reported index outbreaks of the H5N1 HPAI virus in turkey flocks.
Since 2005, commercial turkey farms have been reported as the site of
index outbreaks of H5N1 among poultry in Turkey (2005), France
(2006), Germany (2006), Israel (2006), Jordan (2006), United Kingdom
(2007), and Czech Republic (2007) [see references below].
Available reports show that index outbreaks of H5N1 in at least 3
European countries -- Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Germany --
occurred on modern commercial turkey farms where only turkeys kept in
"biosecure" indoor facilities were affected; free-range poultry on
farms in the immediate vicinity were not affected -- including
free-range geese on the very same farm, in the case of Germany; no
infected wild birds reported in the area of the affected farm at the
time of the outbreak.
It should be noted that there appear to be questionable references to
"backyard flocks" as the site of outbreaks in at least some official
reports of index outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry. For example, the
affected bird population for the 2005 index outbreak of H5N1 in
Turkey was identified in the initial OIE report on this outbreak as a
"backyard flock" of 1800 turkeys (see OIE notification report for
Turkey at link below):
