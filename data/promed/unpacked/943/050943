Central Nigeria is said to be hit by fresh sleeping sickness and river
blindness outbreaks. The National Institute of Trypanosomiasis Research,
Kaduna, has reported a fresh outbreak of tsetse fly-borne diseases in some
communities in Plateau State [central Nigeria]. Communities affected are
Barkin/Ladi, Mangu, Jos East, and Wase local government areas, where fresh
infestations of sleeping sickness and river blindness [onchocerciasis] are
said to be endemic.
The director of the institute, Prof Lamidu Zaria, announced this in Jos,
where he paid a courtesy call on the Plateau State governor, Chief Joshua
Dariye.
Prof Lamidu said efforts are being made to rehabilitate the 20-bed sleeping
sickness hospital in Gboko, Benue State [southeastern Nigeria]. Responding,
Governor Joshua Dariye, represented by his deputy, Chief Michael Botmang,
promised the support of the state government to ensure total control
[eradication?] of tsetse fly from all the endemic communities.
Correspondent Okechukwu Anakudor [phonetic transcription of name] reports
that Prof Lamidu later visited the institute's outstation in Vom, where he
appealed to the state to demonstrate greater commitment to their duties.

[Trypanosomiasis is a zoonotic disease with cattle as is primary reservoir.
Trypanosomiasis in Nigeria is caused by _Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_ and
is transmitted by a tse tse fly (_Glosina palpalis_) complex. There are no
recent reports from FAO or WHO on trypanosomiasis in Nigeria.
Trypanosomiasis has been increasing since 1960, and over the past 10 tears
a large epidemic in central African countries -- especially Angola and
Congo [Democratic Republic, or Republic?] -- has followed breakdown of
control programmes.
Onchocerciasis (caused by _Onchocerca volvulus_) has no animal reservoir
and is transmitted by blackflies (_Similium damnosum_), which breed in
fast-flowing water in West Africa.
Control of both diseases rests on vector control programs, and the
increasing numbers of cases show that the control programmes are not
functioning. The WHO estimates that trypanosomiasis was almost eradicated
from West Africa after 1960 but has been increasing since then, with
approximately 500 000 cases annually. Comments from the Nigerian
authorities, WHO, or FAO would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
