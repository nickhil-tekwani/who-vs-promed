Twenty foreign workers came down with dengue fever at their work site in
the Upper Changi Road area and the Environment Ministry (ENV) ordered
Hyundai Engineering and Construction to stop work for four days to clean up
the premises. Yesterday, one of the workers, [a 42-year-old male , died
at the Singapore General Hospital after being in a coma for nine days.
The ministry said that the 20 workers affected, who are all from China,
came down with the illness last month at the site of the proposed Singapore
Mega Exhibition Centre in Xilin Avenue. It sent its officers to inspect
the place after receiving a report on June 17. They found _Aedes_
mosquitoes in several areas. They were breeding on the ground, on top of a
container which was used as an office, in a plastic drum, some concrete
blocks and on the covers of a manhole and refuse bin.
An ENV spokesman said that work was stopped on its orders. The place was
fogged continuously with insecticide for seven days.
Dengue fever cases are still on the rise. There were 2,079 cases in the
first five months of this year, compared with 1,285 cases in the same
period last year. Construction sites are a haven for these pests, which can
breed wherever water collects, from uncompleted floors to discarded
building materials. A Hyundai spokesman said that it has taken preventive
measures since the incident. It is also working closely with some of its
50 sub-contractors to educate the 400 workers on the site. Work teams have
been set up to keep the premises clean and safe, and the site is fogged
three times a day to keep it mosquito free.
