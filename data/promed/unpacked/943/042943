Follow-up report No. 2
Translation of a fax received on 11 November 1998 from Dr V.M. Bahau, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Kishinev:
End of previous report period: 14 October 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[41, 149, dated 16 October 1998).
End of this report period: 11 November 1998.
The farms in the villages of Malaeshty, Ivancha, Dyshkovo and Putsuntei
(Orgeyev district) are now free from classical swine fever. To date, no
further deaths or animals presenting clinical signs have been reported in
these localities. In consequence they are now recognised as free from
classical swine fever virus and all restrictions and quarantine measures
there have been lifted. Restrictions have also been lifted in the zone
previously considered to be at risk.
