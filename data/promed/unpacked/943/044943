Occurrence of Tomato chlorosis virus on tomato in Reunion Island

Pronounced yellowing symptoms on the lower and middle leaves of tomato
plants, similar to those caused by magnesium deficiencies, were observed in
2004 and 2005 in farmers' greenhouses in Reunion Island. Fruits on such
plants were smaller, and yields were indirectly affected. The flame-like
pattern of the discolored leaves and the abundance of whiteflies on these
plants suggested the possible involvement of Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV)
or Tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV) (_Closteroviridae_,
_Crinivirus_) (Wisler et al., 1998).
20 symptomatic leaf samples were collected from tomato plants in March
2005, and total RNA was extracted from these samples using the Qiagen
RNeasy Plant Mini kit. For detection of a potential crinivirus, a nested
PCR was performed (Dovas et al., 2002). The method consists of a 1-step
RT-PCR using primers HS-11 and HS-12, followed by nested PCR with primers
TIC-3/TIC-4 and ToC-5/ToC-6, for detecting TICV or ToCV respectively. These
primers were designed to amplify the highly conserved region of the heat
shock protein 70 gene. A PCR product at the expected size was observed with
ToCV primers for 14 of the symptomatic leaf samples. No PCR product was
observed for the PCR performed with TICV primers.
3 PCR products were cloned using pGEM-T easy vector system II (Promega,
France) and sequenced (Genome Express, France) (Accession Nos AJ968394,
AJ968395 and AJ968396). Sequences obtained from the 3 samples had 99.5
percent nucleotide identity when aligned (DNAMAN, Lynnon BioSoft, Quebec).
The most significant sequence alignments (NCBI, BLASTn) were 98 percent
with ToCV isolates from the USA (Accession No AF024630), Spain (Accession
Nos AF233435, AF215818 and AF215817) and from Italy (Accession Nos AF234029
and AY048854).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ToCV in Reunion Island.

[Criniviruses are filamentous viruses containing 2 separate genomic
segments (650-850 and 700-900 nm), both of which are required for
infectivity. Field and glasshouse tomato crops are the main host, but other
crops such as potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_)
are susceptible. 2 weed species (Jimson weed, _Datura stramonium_ and Black
nightshade, _Solanum nigrum_) are also hosts that may contribute to
maintaining these viruses in the wild. TICV is transmitted only by _T.
vaporariorum_, but ToCV is transmitted by the greenhouse whitefly
(_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_), the banded-wing whitefly (_T. abutilonea_),
and by _Bemisia tabaci_ (biotype A) and _B. argentifolii_ (biotype B). Once
either virus is established in an agricultural environment containing
susceptible hosts, it is very difficult to prevent infection. Disease
management requires use of virus-free transplants, avoidance of susceptible
hosts (especially weeds), roguing (physical removal) of infected plants,
and control of insect vectors by chemical insecticides. - Mod.DH]
