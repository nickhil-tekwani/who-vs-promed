More young people are carrying the sexually transmitted disease syphilis in Kansas City, Missouri this year [2013]. According to the health department, from May to June 2013, the number of cases jumped 150 per cent.

The majority of cases were found among men under the age of 35. About half of those infected with syphilis are also co-infected with HIV.

A health department spokesperson recommends getting tested. The disease can be treated.

[The news article above reports an increase in incidence of syphilis in Kansas City, Missouri in recent years that is occurring mainly among younger men, as has been reported elsewhere in the US and in many parts of the rest of the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below) and, although not specifically mentioned in the news article above, may likely be among men who have sex with men (MSM).

For example, although in the US during the 1990s primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis primarily occurred among heterosexual men and women, during the 2000s, cases increased primarily among MSM. The estimated proportion of P&S syphilis cases attributable to MSM in the US increased from 7 per cent in 2000 to 64 per cent in 2004, and by 2011, MSM accounted for 72 per cent of all P&S syphilis cases (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm). In 2002, rates of P&S syphilis were highest among men 30-39 years old, but by 2011, rates of P&S syphilis were highest among men 20-29 years old (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis-detailed.htm).

Reported increases in incidence of P&S syphilis among MSM have been characterized at times by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in P&S syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue", -- that is, diminished motivation to practise safer sex.

Kansas City, with a population of almost 500 000, is the largest city in the US state of Missouri, and its metropolitan area of more than 2 million people spans the Missouri-Kansas border. It is approximately in the geographic center of the contiguous states of the US. - Mod.ML
