A 7-month-old child unvaccinated for measles, returning from Japan
and accompanied by 4 family members, arrived in Sao Paulo, Brazil on
16 Jun 2001, on Varig flight RG8837. After a 40 minute stop in Los
Angeles, the flight continued to Sao Paulo, terminating in Rio de
Janeiro. On 14 Jun 2001, while still in Japan, the child had onset of
high fever (38.9 C), which persisted for 5 days. On 17 Jun 2001, after
arrival in Brazil, the child had onset of rash which began on the face
and spread to the rest of the body over a 2-day period. On 18 Jun 2001
the child had onset of cough and coryza, and was brought to her
private pediatrician, who suspected measles and immediately notified a
health post of the Municipal Health Secretariat of Sao Paulo.
The epidemiologic investigation was initiated on 19 Jun 2001 with
collection of blood specimens as well as oropharyngeal and urine
samples for viral isolation. All household residents without
documentation of measles vaccination or natural disease were
vaccinated. During the investigation, the mother reported that while in
Japan the child had contact with his (her?) uncle who had initial
symptoms of measles on 1 Jun 2001 and was hospitalized with measles
on 3 Jun 2001.
In Brazil, the infant had been brought to a family luncheon on 17 Jun
2001. On 21 Jun 2001 all unvaccinated family contacts from the
luncheon were vaccinated. The infant tested positive for measles IgM
antibodies on 21 June. The list of crew and passengers was obtained
through the National Sanitary Surveillance Agency. All passengers
and crew resident in Brazil have been contacted by the state
surveillance services.
The Pan American Health Organization was notified so that other
countries could initiate investigation and follow-up as needed.
To date no secondary cases have been reported.

[As mentioned in a prior posting, the ongoing effort to interrupt
measles transmission in the Americas began in late 1989 and was
adopted as a regional goal in 1994. The region has made great strides
in reducing measles transmission to a level that only 5 countries are
presently considered to have endemic transmission: Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Dominican Republic, and Haiti.
<http://www.paho.org/english/HVP/towardsmeasl_err.htm>
As of 26 May 2001, measles transmission has been ongoing in Brazil
this year, with 3574 suspect cases still under investigation and 29 cases
confirmed:
<http://www.paho.org/English/HVP/HVI/sme0721.pdf>.
As of 22 Jun 2001 a total of 60 cases of measles have been confirmed
in the USA since 1 Jan 2001 of which 38 were indigenous and 22 were
imported cases:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5024md.htm#tab3
>.
While both Brazil and the USA have had measles transmission this
year, it has been at record low levels for both countries, and an
imported case remains of concern to both countries for introduction of
the virus into new areas. As per this report, the case in question was
already symptomatic at the time of travel (high fevers began 2 days
prior to travel). Hence, there should be concern about transmission
through aerosolized droplets during the entire course of the child's
travel between Japan and Brazil. We do not know if the child was in
the Los Angeles airport during the 40-minute layover en route, a
situation which would increase the number of individuals exposed
(readers are reminded of the probable imported case of measles in
Mexico with transit in a USA airport -- see ref. above).
It should be noted that the current recommendations for measles
vaccination in Brazil are to give a first dose at 9 months of age with a
booster dose given in adolescence. The case reported in this article is
not considered a preventable case, as the child is younger than the
recommended age for beginning vaccination.
Information from other countries potentially affected by this case
would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP
