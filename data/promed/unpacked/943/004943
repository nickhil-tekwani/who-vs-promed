1st Report of _Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ on _Vitis vinifera_ and French
American Hybrids in Chile.
J. Auger, M. Esterio, and I. Perez, Departamento de Sanidad Vegetal,
Facultad de Ciencias Agronomicas, Universidad de Chile, Casilla 1004,
Santiago, Chile; and W. D. Gubler and A. Eskalen, Department of Plant
Pathology, University of California, Davis 95616. Plant Dis. 88:1285, 2004;
published on-line as D-2004-0913-02N, 2004. Accepted for publication 19 Aug
2004.
_Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ (W. Gams, Crous. M.J. Wingfield & L. Mugnai)
Crous & Gams (= _Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum_) was isolated during the
growing seasons of 2003-2004 from roots, trunks, and cordons of grapevines,
including cvs. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir, Thompson seedless,
Ruby seedless and root stock 3309C, and Kober 5BB, from 10 locations in V,
VI, VII, and metropolitan regions of Chile. _P. chlamydospora_ was isolated
from 82 percent of samples from vines 2 to 18 years old that showed decline
symptoms in the field.
Isolates were identified on the basis of a previous description (1) and
internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) rDNA sequences identical to
those of _P. chlamydospora_ isolated from _Vitis vinifera_ (culture CBS
22995, GenBank Accession No. AF 197973). _P. chlamydospora_ is established
as a member of the petri and esca disease complex and as a pathogen of
grapevines (2,3).
Pathogenicity tests were completed by injecting into the pith of 50
single-node, rooted cuttings of Pinot noir and 3309C, approximately 20
microliters of a 1 million conidia per ml suspension, obtained from 4
isolates from Chile and one from California. 10 control cuttings of Pinot
noir and 3309C were injected with an equal volume of sterile distilled water.
24 weeks after inoculations, all _P. chlamydospora_-inoculated cuttings
exhibited dark streaking of the vascular tissue extending 40 to 45 mm from
the point of inoculation. The vascular streaking observed in inoculated
plants was identical to symptoms observed in declining vines in the
vineyard. No symptoms were observed in the controls.
_P. chlamydospora_ was isolated from the region of vascular streaking in 85
percent of inoculated cuttings. _P. chlamydospora_ was not isolated from
the water-treated controls. The reisolated _P. chlamydospora_ was verified
by means of morphological characters and polymerase chain reaction
amplification with the species-specific primers (3).
_P. chlamydospora_ is widespread and readily isolated from declining
grapevines in Chile and other grape growing regions of the world.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P. chlamydospora_ from the
cultivars cited above in Chile.

[_Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_ [Pc] _, _P. inflatipes_ and _P. aleophilum_
are 3 pathogenic fungi that cause Petri disease, young vine decline and
grapevine measles. These diseases can cause significant economic losses due
to vineyard replanting and yield loss. They have been documented in
vineyards for at least 100 years, and have been identified in vineyards in
every grape growing region in the world. These fungi are often present in
propagation material coming from mother plant material in nurseries.
However, vines also apparently become infected during the propagation
procedure. A detection method using nested-PCR is currently being developed
to provide a rapid and sensitive test to determine the presence of these
fungi in grapevine material throughout the propagation process. PCR will
facilitate detection of infected vines. Hot water treatment (30 ins, 50
degrees C) reduces incidence of PC in young grapevine, thus preventing
development of Pert disease in young vines.
