Paraguayan health officials expressed concern today [23 May 2014] that the propagator bug disease known as Chagas disease could be moving toward urban areas.

According to Silvio Ortega, the director of the organization charged with fighting the pest, more than 165 000 people are suffering from the disease, transmitted by the insect known here as "chinche", which has begun to be found in some cities of the nation. According to statements to the local press by Ortega, whose specific charge is director of the National Eradication Service Vector-Borne Diseases, the conditions now exist for the bug to multiply in urban areas.

Until now, the argument was put forward that it could only be found in indigenous communities and rural areas, but the lack of cleanliness and housing insecurity led to its appearance in other areas. He explained that, unlike mosquitoes that transmit other diseases, the insect lives generally between the bricks of the houses and other open spaces, because its normal habitat is dry; no moisture is required.

The departments of Itagua, Cordillera and Paraguari were identified as at-risk areas, with Itagua being the most troubling case, as it had been previously declared free of the disease by the World Health Organization (WHO).

[Over the past decade, transmission of South American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) by food has been increasingly documented (see below). This must be taken into account when an increasing prevalence of Chagas disease in urban areas is discussed. Apart from transmission by infected triatomid bugs, other routes of transmission are mother-to-child transmission and transmission through blood transfusion. No matter what the explanation, an increase in the prevalence of Chagas disease is very worrying as it adds a burden of chronic disease in the country. - Mod.EP
