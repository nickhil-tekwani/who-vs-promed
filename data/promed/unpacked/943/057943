The European Union's medicines regulator has recommended authorising Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for use in children aged between 12 and 17, marking the 1st time the shot has been approved for people under 18.

In a decision on Friday [23 Jul 2021] the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said research in more than 3700 children of 12-17 years of age showed that the shot produced a comparable antibody response to that seen in 18-25-year-olds.

Use of the vaccine, Spikevax, will be the same in adolescents as in people over 18, the EMA said.

Formal approval by the European Commission -- the EU's executive arm -- is needed to start rolling out the vaccine for teenagers. The body typically follows EMA recommendations.

Until now, the vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech has been the only option for use in children as young as 12 in North America and the EU.

Vaccinating children has been considered important for reaching herd immunity and in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant. Most children with COVID-19 develop only mild symptoms or none. Yet children remain at risk of becoming seriously ill and can spread the virus.

Moderna said in May [2021] that its vaccine was found to be safe and effective in teenagers. Hundreds of millions of doses of the shot have already been administered to adults.

The EMA said common side effects in teenagers after vaccination with Spikevax were similar to those seen in older people. But due to a smaller study size, the trial could not detect new uncommon side effects or estimate the risk of known ones such as myocarditis and pericarditis.

"The overall safety profile of Spikevax determined in adults was confirmed in the adolescent study; the CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use) therefore considered that the benefits of Spikevax in children aged 12-17 outweigh the risks," the EMA said.

Heart inflammation such as myocarditis and pericarditis has been listed by the EMA as a possible but rare side effect from use of mRNA vaccines such as Moderna's and Pfizer's in adults.

Spikevax is already being used in the EU for people over 18, and in the United States and Canada. Moderna has also sought authorisation in the US and Canada for its use in adolescents. But with global vaccine supplies still tight, much of the world still is struggling to immunise adults, let alone children.

Agencies including the World Health Organization have urged rich countries to donate their doses to the developing world -- where fewer than 2% of people have been vaccinated -- rather than moving on to inoculate their less-vulnerable populations.

[2] Vaccine booster for the immunocompromised
Date: Thu 22 Jul 2021 7:10 p.m. EDT

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is exploring an option to get additional coronavirus doses to immunocompromised people through a program that allows sick people to get unapproved drugs, a senior vaccine official said Thursday [22 Jul 2021].

At a meeting Thursday [22 Jul 2021] of its advisory panel on vaccines, panel members spoke of the urgent need to give additional doses to people with fragile immune systems amid growing concerns about waning immunity in vulnerable populations and surging infections from the delta variant.

But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices cannot recommend that until the Food and Drug Administration gives full approval to the currently available vaccines or amends its emergency use authorization. The FDA's existing authorization permits only a 2-dose regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson product.

Immunocompromised patients represent about 3% of US adults and include those who are organ transplant recipients, people on cancer treatments, and people living with rheumatologic conditions, HIV, and leukemia. They are more likely to become seriously ill from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and might more frequently spread the virus to others, experts say.

Amanda Cohn, the CDC's chief medical officer for vaccine policy, said the agency is exploring options to make additional doses possible for such patients.

"I think what you're asking about is, you know, is there a way to offer a 3rd dose to individuals ... through a study, or through an investigational new drug format for this population? I will just say that we are actively looking into ways that could be done to potentially provide access earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions," Cohn told panel members.

When clinicians and others want to use a product that is not FDA-approved, they can seek an investigational new drug application from the FDA under a program known as expanded access or, more commonly, compassionate use. It gives patients with a serious disease or condition a potential pathway to get an investigational product. The coronavirus vaccines are considered such products.

This route is one option the CDC is exploring as a bridge until regulators give full approval for the vaccines, a CDC official said. Such a process would require enrolling individuals in a clinical study where additional doses can be given.

Camille Kotton, a transplant-medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a member of the advisory committee, said many patients have "taken matters into their own hands, and many are proceeding with additional doses of vaccine as they see fit," which she said is "really challenging." She said she is concerned about patients doing this in an unsupervised fashion, noting "our hands are really tied with the current regulatory situation."

The situation also raises equity concerns, she said, because patients who tend to be more educated and more empowered to take care of their own healthcare are getting additional doses, while others are being left behind.

The CDC used the expanded access program in 2013, for instance, to allow a vaccine that was not yet licensed to be given to students at increased risk for meningococcal disease during an outbreak at college campuses.

Emerging data suggests that an additional dose in immunocompromised people may enhance disease-fighting antibody responses and increase the proportion of those who respond to the vaccines, Sara Oliver, a CDC vaccine expert, told panel members.

On 23 Jun [2021], the New England Journal of Medicine published results of a study of 101 organ-transplant patients in France who received 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and found that their rate of antibodies against the coronavirus was 4% after the 1st dose, 40% after the 2nd dose, and 68% after a 3rd dose, showing that the 3rd dose dramatically increased the likelihood of developing a disease-fighting response.

For people who showed no protection after the 2nd dose, 44% developed an antibody response after the 3rd dose, according to the study.

Debate over the need for booster shots has intensified since Pfizer and BioNTech this month [July 2021] announced they would seek regulatory approval for a 3rd inoculation for all eligible adults, not just the immunocompromised, amid rising global concern about the highly transmissible delta variant. The companies' announcement that they would seek an emergency use authorization for a booster prompted health officials to declare that Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a 3rd shot at this time.

But health officials make a distinction between boosters for people who already have an immune response after getting vaccinated versus additional doses for the immunocompromised who have failed to respond fully or at all to the shots.

At a Senate panel hearing this week, Anthony S. Fauci, the White House's chief coronavirus medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said immunosuppressed individuals "may actually need a boost as part of their initial regimen, in the sense of getting them up to the point where they are protected."

Some panel members and the World Health Organization have also criticized the attention on boosters when so much of the world has little access to 1st doses. Low global vaccination rates and the spread of variants elsewhere in the world pose a risk for people in the United States.

Israel's Ministry of Health on 12 Jul [2021] began offering a 3rd dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to severely immunocompromised adults. Britain has announced a plan for booster shots to begin in September [2021], targeted 1st to groups that include people who are immunosuppressed, people older than 70, and front-line health-care workers.

["People who are immunocompromised are at above-average risk for becoming severely ill if they catch COVID-19, Dr. Sara Oliver, with the CDC, told the committee. They are also more likely to transmit the virus to people they live with. And more than 40% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 after being vaccinated are immune-compromised.

"About 2.7% of the population -- or 900 000 Americans -- are immunocompromised, she said" (from https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/07/23/covid-booster-shots-immunocompromised-people/8061006002/).

It does look like a good strategy, to provide booster doses to those who fall into the category of immunocompromised. But it will be important to follow their responses to the 3rd dose. - Mod.LK]

[3] Europe: restrictions
Date: Sat 24 Jul 2021
Source: Wall Street Journal [abridged, edited]
https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-holdouts-face-restrictions-in-europe-as-delta-variant-spreads-11627119123?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/Xjblunsny3


European governments worried about the rapid spread of the delta coronavirus variant are nudging, and in some cases pushing, people to get a shot by introducing restrictions to daily life for those without a COVID-19 vaccination.

In most cases, vaccination still isn't obligatory, with a few exceptions such as healthcare workers in Italy. Yet by closing off the unvaccinated from aspects of daily life such as indoor dining at restaurants or going to the gym, governments are looking to make life more difficult for people holding out against getting vaccinated.

The governments have the dual objective of overcoming hesitancy among people who don't have a hard-core ideological stance against vaccinations, while stemming the need for new lockdowns that would damage European economies. Politicians and public-health officials are pushing the idea that vaccination equals more individual liberty, not less.

The tool being used in most European Union countries to separate the vaccinated from the holdouts is the digital COVID-19 certificate, which has different monikers in different nations.

The certificates, called green passes in Italy and health passes in France, were designed principally to facilitate travel between countries, but now have found an expanded use. They have a unique QR code and can be printed or stored on a mobile phone. In most countries, they can also be accessed through official coronavirus contract-tracing mobile-phone apps.

"The green pass is a means by which people can continue to do their activities, with the guarantee they are doing it in the presence of people who aren't contagious," Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Thursday [22 Jul 2021] as he presented a series of new restrictions.

Startups, governments, and nonprofits are racing to create "vaccine passports" aimed at helping people travel and safely move around in public.

If France, Italy, and other European countries succeed in getting the undecideds to roll up their sleeves for a shot, their efforts could become a blueprint for the US and other countries that have seen their vaccination drives stall.

The restrictions have had early success, pushing millions of French people to sign up for vaccination appointments in the past week and helping turn around a stalled campaign. The most recent data show that, on average, 298 000 1st shots have been administered a day, compared with 161 000 a day in early July [2021].

In Italy, the number of daily 1st doses ticked up in the past 2 weeks as the government discussed making activities unavailable to the unvaccinated. In several of the country's 20 regions, requests for a 1st shot doubled on Friday [23 Jul 2021], the day after the new measures were announced, compared with what they had been at the beginning of the week.

"We can't force people to get vaccinated, but those who don't do it will have fewer opportunities," Walter Ricciardi, a professor of public health and an adviser to Italy's health minister, said in a newspaper interview.

But in deference to one of the daily rituals of millions of Italians, the vaccination requirement for indoor dining and drinking doesn't apply to people having an espresso or cappuccino while standing at a bar.

In most countries that have introduced restrictions on the unvaccinated, proof of recovery from COVID-19 or a negative test will open the same doors. The restrictions usually apply to everybody older than 12, the youngest age for which vaccines have been approved.

In Greece and other countries, indoor dining is open only to the vaccinated, recovered, or tested. Italy will follow suit on 6 Aug [2021], adding the requirement for those taking part in indoor sports such as swimming, going to a gym, and attending large events like concerts, whether indoors or outside. Trade fairs, museums, and a host of other venues are on Italy's off-limits list for the unvaccinated. In France, the government has set restrictions for museums and movie theaters and plans in August [2021] to extend them to venues including restaurants, both indoors and outside.

In England, beginning in September [2021], proof of full vaccination will be required to get into nightclubs, and the government has said the requirement could be added to other venues where large crowds gather. A COVID-19 pass has been added to the state-run National Health Service's mobile-phone app, allowing users to demonstrate proof of vaccination.

As in the US, most infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in recent weeks in Europe have been in people who aren't vaccinated. In France, a Health Ministry study showed 94% of infections between 28 Jun and 4 Jul [2021] were among people not fully vaccinated.

In Italy, about 61% of people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with 57% in France and 68% in the UK, according to Our World in Data, an Oxford University project tracking the global vaccine rollout. In the US, which for a long time had a lead over continental Europe, it is 56%.

[Having digital vaccination certificates seems like the best approach to opening up public venues safely to allow life to resume as before. Cell phones are ubiquitous, facilitating confirmation of vaccination. This action may encourage the vaccine holdouts to get vaccinated, even if the statistics on who is most at risk of severe illness doesn't. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 15 countries including Indonesia (45 416), India (40 341), Brazil (38 091), the USA (36 779), UK (31 285), France (25 624), Russia (23 947), Iran (18 632), Malaysia (15 902), Mexico (15 823), Thailand (15 335), Turkey (12 381), South Africa (12 056), Argentina (11 136), and Colombia (11 064) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 8249 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 22 Jul 2021 to late 23 Jul 2021). A total of 55 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 55 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 5 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.9 %, while daily reported deaths have increased by 17.2 %. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 56.1 % increase in daily reported cases and 7.3 % increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 194.41 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.16 million reported deaths -Mod.UBA]
