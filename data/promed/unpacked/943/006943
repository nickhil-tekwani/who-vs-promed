Turin: Following an outbreak of Legionellosis that has resulted in 11
deaths and 20 infected individuals, authorities have brought criminal
charges against officers of the Molinette, the largest hospital in
Piedmont, including its former and current director.
[Note: it is not clear if the 11 deaths are part of the 20 cases - AO]

Milan: authorities have requisitioned documents for the purpose of
investigating the extent of legionellosis in hospitals. The investigation
was prompted by the death of an immunosuppressed 47 year old woman at the
Instituto Europeo Oncologico who was struck while taking a shower.
[Note: that is what the report says, I think she probably acquired the
infection while taking showers as has been the experience in this and other
countries where the _Legionella_ was found to be present in shower heads - AO]
The San Raffaele hospital (in Don Verze) reported that since January 1998
they had 6 cases of legionellosis with 2 deaths.
In the Lombardy region there have been 25 cases of legionellosis during the
first 6 months of 1999. Two cases were found in a prison.
