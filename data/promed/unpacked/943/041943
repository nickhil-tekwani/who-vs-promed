Modern gun deer hunting season is about to begin, with new hunter guidelines focused on precaution after an April [2014] discovery in Holmes County, Ohio of a transmittable disease in a captive deer.

"This season, hunters coming to Kentucky from Ohio will not be able to transport whole carcasses of deer into Kentucky because a case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) was identified in Ohio," said Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Officer James Beckett. "Brain matter and spinal materials from cervids are not allowed into the state from Ohio because of it." Deer, elk and moose are considered cervids.

According to KDFW (Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife), "...there are laws in place restricting the importation of both live and harvested cervids (including, but not limited to deer, elk, reindeer, and moose). Importation into Kentucky of live cervids is prohibited by statute, except in specific circumstances (KRS 150.725, 150.730, 150.735, and 150.740) and is a Class D felony."

Transportation of whole deer into or even through Kentucky is also prohibited from Illinois, Missouri, Virginia, and West Virginia, where CWD has also been identified, officials said.

Since April [2014], a single buck which tested positive for CWD has been quarantined on a private hunting preserve in Millersburg, Ohio. According to officials, the deer had come from a private herd in Pennsylvania, which was also discovered to have CWD.

A cervid can have the disease for months or years before signs appear, and there is currently no practical live-animal test for chronic wasting disease, officials said.

According to officials, Ohio has quarantined 43 captive deer operations in Ohio since 15 Apr 2014 for receiving approximately 125 deer from private preserves in Pennsylvania that later tested positive for CWD, but has since lifted more than 50 of the quarantines and continues to monitor the others until ODNR (Ohio Department of Natural Resources) is satisfied that the threat of disease transference has passed.

ODNR officials reiterated that there is no evidence CWD affected the wild deer population in Ohio.

There have also been no reported cases of CWD in Kentucky in either wild or preserve area deer, Beckett said.

Chronic wasting disease was 1st discovered in captive mule deer in Colorado in 1967.

Since 2002, more than 22 000 deer harvested in Kentucky have been tested for CWD with none testing positive for the disease, officials said.

Though major concentrations of CWD have been identified in western states, only a few cases of CWD, usually in captive herds, have been found.

According to KDFW website information, CWD belongs to a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [TSEs], which include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. It is suspected that the agent responsible for causing TSEs is an abnormal protein called a prion.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, the disease, which produces brain lesions and is fatal in deer, elk and moose, cannot be transmitted to humans; still, hunters should use precautions when field dressing their kill. In addition, hunters should not harvest any animal which appears sick or is acting strangely and should contact the local fish and wildlife department with location information, officials said.

[Hunters are advised to visit the recommended web sites and learn the rules of states they are hunting in as well as states they may travel through on their return home. It is likely that the penalty for running afoul of these rules would be quite stiff.
