Health authorities in the southern China province of Jiangxi have confirmed a new case of a person infected by the H7N9 strain of avian influenza, state news agency Xinhua said late on [Sat 31 Dec 2016]. The 53-year-old man is being treated in a hospital in the provincial capital Nanchang and is in critical condition, Xinhua said in a brief report.

A total of 17 people have been infected with bird flu in China so far this winter, at least 2 of whom have died.

The last major bird flu outbreak in mainland China (from late 2013 to early 2014) killed 36 people and led to more than 6 billion USD in losses for the agricultural sector. China has culled more than 170 000 birds in 4 provinces since October [2016] and closed some live poultry markets after people and birds were infected by strains of the avian flu.

China's Ministry of Agriculture said on [Fri 30 Dec 2016] that the recent outbreaks of bird flu have been handled in a "timely and effective" manner without spreading and have not affected chicken products or prices.

[The public awareness to reduce potential transmission events must be raised as human cases of Influenza A/H7N9 continue to be reported. Perhaps more stringent cleanup protocols in wet/bird markets or limiting public contact with the poultry, even though it may appear healthy, should be encouraged. - Mod.UBA
