There have been close to 1900 cases of salmonella in Queensland so far in 2015, more than double what would normally be expected, health authorities say. Queensland Health has issued an alert to businesses involved in food preparation and the community as a whole. Health Protection Unit executive director Dr Sophie Dwyer said the reported 1895 cases were more than double what would normally be expected. "Half of the cases reported this year have been from the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium strain, with the majority being reported in south-east Queensland," she said.

"_Salmonella_ Typhimurium has caused 13 outbreaks of foodborne disease in south-east Queensland in 2015 to date, 10 of which have been confirmed or suspected to have involved foodborne transmission. These figures show the vital need for food handlers to be aware of food safety procedures."

Yesterday, 12 Mar 2015, health authorities said they believed a cafe on the Gold Coast was responsible for a food poisoning outbreak after about 20 people were admitted to hospital.

In February 2015, about 250 people reported gastro-intestinal symptoms following a school principals' conference in Brisbane that was attended by about 1200 delegates from across the state. After Queensland Health announced the suspected salmonellosis outbreak at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, the ABC revealed there had been an outbreak of foodborne illness affecting about 10 people who attended a conference at the same venue a week earlier.

Dr Dwyer said Queensland Health were urging people to be particularly aware of safety when handling and consuming eggs. They recently urged consumers not to purchase or consume cracked, dirty or unstamped eggs, and to report any incidences to their local Public Health Unit.

Meanwhile, a Darling Downs egg company has issued a voluntary recall of its products. Darling Downs Fresh Eggs said they have been advised of a potential production issue with its caged and mountain range free range. The recall applies to eggs stamped with numbers between 036 and 063. "It is possible that dirty eggs may have been packed into some of these cartons and we are implementing a voluntary recall of these eggs," a statement read.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding whether the serotype Typhimurium strains related to these outbreaks are genetically related. Adequate cooking and good kitchen hygiene can prevent much foodborne illness caused by salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
