Fusarium on the march and wreaking havoc
----------------------------------------
Once limited to wheat fields in southern Alberta, fusarium head blight is spreading quickly into central Alberta and beyond. "Over the past few years, (fusarium) has increased considerably," said Trevor Blois, 20/20 Seed Labs. "This year [2014], around 16 percent of samples are testing positive." In 2007, only one percent of samples sent to his lab tested positive for fusarium. That figure jumped to 9 percent in 2012 and 13 percent for [2013].

But the news gets worse -- the disease has spread to areas where it's never been seen before. "In 2007, it was pretty much restricted to 5 counties in southern Alberta," said Blois, adding it's now becoming common in central and northern Alberta. "Right now, 57 percent of counties that we test seed in are testing positive. It's quite widespread."

"_Fusarium graminearum_ causes the most severe losses, but we are seeing the highest levels of other fusarium species as well," said Blois, adding those species can cause seedling blight, root rot, and crown rot in other crops as well and also produce harmful mycotoxins.

This sudden rise in fusarium in Alberta has been caused, in part, by tighter rotations, a shift toward zero-tillage farming, and "a general increase in the inoculum." Environmental conditions also need to be right. An [increase] in corn [maize] acres has also played a role. "It will probably survive for a couple of years in the corn stubble."

But the biggest issue is infected seed. "One of the most important things is testing your seed and ensuring that you're using clean seed," said Blois. "There's a lot of planting of infected seed."

Losses in Canada from fusarium head blight have ranged between CAD 50 million and CAD 300 million [about USD 41.4 million USD 248 million] and annually since the early 1990s, when fusarium outbreaks began in Eastern Canada.

[Several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_ can affect wheat and other cereals causing foot rot, seedling blight, and head blight symptoms. The pathogens form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings and adult plants. Current names of the fungi include _Gibberella zeae_ (previously _Fusarium graminearum_), _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_ (previously _Fusarium_ or _Microdochium nivale_), and _Microdochium majus_.

The diseases are generally favoured by humid conditions, and stress factors may increase plant susceptibility. Besides dramatically reducing yield and quality, the grain may also become contaminated with fungal toxins (mycotoxins). The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues, spores are spread by wind, water, mechanical means, and with infected plant material (including seeds). For seedling blights, the main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Disease management includes fungicides as crop sprays or seed treatments, long crop rotations with non-hosts, and planting of cereal varieties with reduced susceptibility. Use of certified clean seeds, as mentioned above, is essential.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide. Re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported from the UK (ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497). In Canada, the emergence of a new FHB strain with increased mycotoxin levels has been reported in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20091210.4211).
