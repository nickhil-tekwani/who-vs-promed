A man in China has died after testing positive for the hantavirus, according to Chinese state media. Global Times reported the patient, a migrant worker from southwestern Yunnan Province, died while traveling on a chartered bus to Shandong Province for work on Monday [23 Mar 2020].

There is more than one strain of hantavirus, some more harmful than others, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is no approved cure or vaccine against hantaviruses in the United States. An inoculation may be available in China.

The group of diseases is spread primarily among rodents, and from rodents to humans. Humans may become infected with hantaviruses through contact with rodent urine, saliva, or feces. The fatality rate is 36%.

"New World" hantaviruses are known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, followed by coughing and shortness of breath, according to the CDC and other health authorities.

Human-to-human transmission is extremely rare. A case of person-to-person transmission was recorded in Argentina in 1996, according to the CDC [several cases of person-to-person transmission of Andes hantavirus have been reported in Chile and Argentina. - Mod.TY].

Malaysian Chinese-language newspaper China Press reported Wednesday [25 Mar 2020] the patient, [T], was traveling on a bus with 30 migrant workers. It is unclear whether they were also infected. When [T] developed a fever, emergency staff may have suspected a case of the novel coronavirus, according to the report.

Southern Metropolis Daily, a Chinese newspaper published in the city of Guangzhou, said T's home province of Yunnan has reported a total of 1231 hantavirus cases from 2015 to 2019. China developed a vaccine against the virus 20 years ago, which may have lowered fatalities, according to reports.

The hantavirus is named after the Hantaan River in South Korea, where Lee Ho-wang, a South Korean scientist, 1st isolated the virus in 1976, according to South Korean news service News 1.

[Although no symptoms were reported for this fatal case, a hantavirus infection was laboratory confirmed as the etiological agent. There is no indication if the 30 other passengers in the bus were tested for infection, but no additional illnesses or fatalities were mentioned, which would have likely been indicated had they occurred. The specific hantavirus involved in this case is not stated. In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China. A bunyavirus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, is unlikely, as during the winter season, ticks, the vectors of this virus, will not be active.

Hantaan virus has several (up to 5 have been reported) subtypes and is transmitted by the field mouse _Apodemus agrarius_, whereas Seoul virus is less variable and is transmitted by the rat _Rattus norvegicus_. A 3rd hantavirus that causes HFRS, Muju virus, has been reported from the Korean peninsula. Since Yunnan province has many rural areas, either Hantaan or Seoul virus could be involved. It has been reported that during 1990-1997, there were recorded in China nearly 400 000 cases of HFRS, of which 1.6% were fatal.

An image of _Apodemus agrarius_ can be seen at http://www.hlasek.com/foto/apodemus_agrarius_11035.jpg and of _Rattus norvegicus_ at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg.

Coincidentally, another report from northeastern India states that people in Nagrijuli and Kumarikata of Baksa district are panic-stricken after they learned that a man died in Yunnan province of China after testing positive to hantavirus (https://nenow.in/north-east-news/fear-of-hantavirus-outbreak-sets-panic-button-along-indo-bhutan-border-in-assam.html). It is not clear why there is fear along the individuals in the Indo-Bhutan border in Baksa district of Assam, since this locality is about 900 km (560 mi) distant from Yunnan province in China. This additional report appears to be incorrect as it also mentions that 32 individuals who were passengers on the bus with the fatal Yunnan case were positive for hantavirus infections. This is not substantiated in the above report of the fatal case that mentions that there were 30 passengers, not 32, without any indication that they have been tested. - Mod.TY
