Russia: Hepatitis Outbreak in Tver Region Attributed to Contaminated Beer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some 461 people, including 117 children, have been admitted to the hospital in
a hepatitis A outbreak in the southwest Russian region of Tver. The outbreak is
believed to have been caused by a local beer, produced by the Rjevpivo brewery,
the Interfax News Agency reported. Sales of the beer have been suspended as a
result. "It is expected that for another few days about 40 [more] people will
contract the disease daily, and then the number will begin to decline," Tver
Governor Dmitry Zelenin told reporters.
Officials said earlier that the newly-admitted patients were in
better condition than those who fell ill a few days before, an
indication that the illness was now being diagnosed in its early
stages. 7 people had already been released from the hospital, the
governor's spokesman Igor Gmyza was quoted as saying by the
RIA-Novosti News Agency.
A number of cases of hepatitis A have also been recorded in Moscow
and in the western province of Smolensk.
Hepatitis A is a highly contagious viral infection of the liver.

[Although hepatitis A virus is a frequent contaminant of water
supplies in many parts of the world and resistant to inactivation in
the environment, advice to travelers usually includes a statement
that beer, wine, and carbonated beverages are usually safe to drink.
Indeed, I have been unable to find any report of a previous incident
involving transmission of hepatitis A by consumption of beer. It
seems unlikely that hepatitis A virus would survive the processes of
fermentation and filtration or heat treatment in the production of
beer, although it is conceivable that the virus could become a
contaminant if there were gross lapses of hygiene prior to bottling.
The evidence implicating beer as the source of infection in this
outbreak seems to be largely circumstantial. Itar-Tass reported on 7
Jun 2005
<http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=2110400&PageNum=0>
that: "The deputy chief physician of the Tver central hospital, Raisa
Shiker, had said at a meeting of an anti-epidemic commission that the
interviewing of the affected people suggested that infection
originated with beer of Rjevpivo brewery, as 82 percent of patients
used its products. Rjevpivo delivered its beer also to the Tver,
Moscow and Smolensk regions. Sanitarians have established that there
had been failures of the water supply and violations of sanitary
standards at the brewery, operation of which was stopped on 31 May
2005. The brewery used the water from an artesian well on its
grounds. Its beer is being removed from sale. Doctors have obtained
blood samples from Rjevpivo personnel to examine them for markers of
vital hepatitis A virus infection."
The outcome of these tests is awaited with interest. If the presence
of infectious hepatitis A virus in Rjevpivo brewery beer is
confirmed, the general advice dispensed to travelers regarding drinks
with low alcohol content may have to be revised. - Mod.CP]
[Re: "Some 461 people, including 117 children, have been admitted to the
hospital in a hepatitis A outbreak" and "infection originated with beer of
Rjevpivo brewery, as 82 percent of patients used its products." 82 percent of
461 = 378. 461-117 = 344 adults. Therefore 378-344 = 34 children drank beer.
Or have they got their statistics wrong? - Mod.JW]
