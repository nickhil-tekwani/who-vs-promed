Killer bugs that are "extremely" resistant to antibiotics are spreading through European hospitals, experts have warned. They include strains of bacteria that trigger sepsis, meningitis, cellulitis and other life-threatening conditions.

Antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ are spreading through European hospitals, experts have warned. _K. pneumoniae_ are resistant to the last line of antibiotics -- a type of drug known as carbapenems -- and so are considered "extremely" drug resistant. As a result more people are dying after contracting the bugs.

In 2007, around 341 deaths in Europe were blamed on _K. pneumoniae_. By 2015, that number had increased 6-fold, to 2094.

Once antibiotics stop working against strains of the bacteria, there are few options left to medics.

Experts said infants, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems are at Scientists from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Freiburg analysed the genomes of almost 2000 samples of _K. pneumoniae_ taken from patients in 244 hospitals across 32 countries. It marks the largest study of its kind into carbapenem-resistant bacteria in Europe.

The scientists discovered that some genes produce enzymes, which "chew up" the antibiotics, rendering them useless. They warned the heavy use of antibiotics in hospitals provides a breeding ground for these highly-resistant bacteria to spread.

Dr Sophia David, 1st author of the study, said: "The One Health approach to antibiotic resistance focuses on the spread of pathogens through humans, animals, and the environment, including hospitals. But in the case of carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_, our findings imply hospitals are the key facilitator of transmission.

"Over half of the samples carrying a carbapenemase gene were closely related to others collected from the same hospital. This suggests that the bacteria are spreading from person-to-person primarily in hospitals." Dr David's team also found the antibiotic-resistant bacteria samples were also more likely to be closely related to samples from different hospitals, in the same country. That suggests national healthcare systems as a whole play an important role in the spread of the potentially killer bugs.

The scientists said better infection control could help stop the bug's spread. They recommend reviewing how patients are moved between hospitals and hygiene interventions, to make a difference.

Prof Hajo Grundmann, co-lead author from University of Freiburg, said: "We are optimistic that with good hospital hygiene, which includes early identification and isolation of patients carrying these bacteria, we can not only delay the spread of these pathogens, but also successfully control them. This research emphasises the importance of infection control and ongoing genomic surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to ensure we detect new resistant strains early and act to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance."

Prof David Aanensen, who also authored the study, said: "Genomic surveillance will be key to tackling the new breeds of antibiotic-resistant pathogen strains that this study has identified. Currently, new strains are evolving almost as fast as we can sequence them. The goal to establish a robust network of genome sequencing hubs will allow healthcare systems to much more quickly track the spread of these bacteria and how they're evolving."

The findings are published in the journal Nature Microbiology [1].

Abstract
-----------
"Public health interventions to control the current epidemic of carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ rely on a comprehensive understanding of its emergence and spread over a wide range of geographical scales. We analysed the genome sequences and epidemiological data of [more than] 1700 _K. pneumoniae_ samples isolated from patients in 244 hospitals in 32 countries during the European Survey of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae. We demonstrate that carbapenemase acquisition is the main cause of carbapenem resistance and that it occurred across diverse phylogenetic backgrounds. However, 477 of 682 (69.9%) carbapenemase-positive isolates are concentrated in four clonal lineages, sequence types 11, 15, 101, 258/512, and their derivatives. Combined analysis of the genetic and geographic distances between isolates with different [beta]-lactam resistance determinants suggests that the propensity of _K. pneumoniae_ to spread in hospital environments correlates with the degree of resistance and that carbapenemase-positive isolates have the highest transmissibility. Indeed, we found that over half of the hospitals that contributed carbapenemase-positive isolates probably experienced within-hospital transmission, and interhospital spread is far more frequent within, rather than between, countries. Finally, we propose a value of 21 for the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms that optimizes the discrimination of hospital clusters and detail the international spread of the successful epidemic lineage, ST258/512."

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems, as well as frequently most other beta-lactam antibiotics. Other resistance mechanisms, which include reduced affinity of penicillin-binding protein (PBPs) for carbapenems, increased efflux of the beta-lactam antibiotics, or decreased permeability of the outer membrane due to loss of outer membrane porin channels, may be combined with production of the carbapenemase. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); NDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, which can facilitate spread of resistance genes among organisms of the same species or even different bacterial species. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ are Gram-negative bacteria that can cause healthcare-associated infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. The principal reservoir for these organisms is the gastrointestinal tract, and spread occurs from there on the contaminated hands of healthcare workers and the environment. - Mod.ML
