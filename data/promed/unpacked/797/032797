The Basque Institute for Agricultural Research and Development Neiker-Tecnalia [NT] have identified for the 1st time in Spain genotype Blue13 (13_A2) [of _Phytophthora infestans_]. Blue13 is the most aggressive genotype currently present in Europe and has been detected in the provinces of Alava, Orense and Tenerife.

NT have also identified 2 variants called Misc from Alava and Cadiz. These do not match any other type described to date in Europe, which could mean that they are the result of sexual recombination of the 2 existing mating types (A1 and A2). This would entail a significant change in the epidemiology of the pathogen in Spain.

NT have been detecting new physiological types of the pathogen in recent years with previously unobserved aggressiveness and resistance to the fungicides currently used. It is also noted that new types are adapting to weather conditions, allowing them to expand their range.

These changes in the populations of _P. infestans_ should lead to greater efforts in the development of new resistant potato varieties. Early warning systems are necessary [and] it is essential to combine active ingredients to prevent the emergence of resistance.

NT will continue [surveying] to complete the map of all production areas in Spain. It also aims to extend the study to tomatoes, another major host for the pathogen.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers, and in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are vital. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually, increasing the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop (such as the 2 misc variants mentioned above). All blight outside Mexico was A1 until in 1976 when potatoes were imported into Europe from Mexico to satisfy shortages. Soon after A2 strains were detected in Europe.

It has been reported that regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist in Europe, where strains like the particularly aggressive A2-Blue13 (EU_13_A2; ProMED-mail posts 20090406.1332 and 20100212.0505) as well as Pink6 (ProMED-mail post 20100604.1851) are now dominating, and further strains, such as Green33 (ProMED-mail post 20120202.1031230), are emerging. The arrival of Blue13 in Spain poses a risk of additional crop losses and increased costs of PLB control for the national potato industry.

Furthermore, while the incidence of A2 strains has increased over time, the incidence of mixed A1/A2 strains which is used as an indicator of genetic recombination frequencies appears to have remained constant until now (ProMED-mail post 20071207.3939). Therefore, the detection of 2 additional novel strains, as reported above, with mixed A1/A2 parentage is particularly worrying and increases the threat of PLB to potato production for European countries and their trading partners.
