A major US pet retailer, Petco, has announced the removal of all China-made dog food from stores over concerns it could have caused the deaths of some 1000 pets.

The move will likely cost the company tens of millions of dollars. Pet deaths and illnesses were investigated by the US Food and Drug Administration, which "received in total more than 4800 complaints of illness in pets" between 2007 and 2014. The stricken pets, mostly dogs, ate treats, "nearly all of which are imported from China," the FDA report said.

Although the agency's initial tests found no connection between the Chinese food and pet illnesses, 2 big retailers, Petco and PetSmart, promised in May 2014 that they would ban the treats. Petco is the 1st to act on its promise. On Monday [5 Jan 2015], the company announced it "has completely removed all China-made dog and cat treats from shelves at more than 1300 retail stores nationwide."

The FDA is meanwhile still investigating the illnesses and deaths. Petco will now sell treats made in the US or countries like the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and South America, the company's Vice President John Sturm said, according to AP. He also mentioned that a change in vendors might cost the retailer tens of millions of dollars.

[The article does not specify which treats are involved, but most likely they are chicken jerky treats. This move is significant for the retailer and for pet owners. While the change in vendors will likely cost the retailer a large amount of money, it is likely to draw strong public support and thus come back to the retailer in the form of increased business. - Mod.TG
