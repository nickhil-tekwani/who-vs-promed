TULAREMIA - SWEDEN (VARMLAND)

Tularemia cases are being detected increasingly
in southern parts of Sweden. In 1999, in the
county of Varmland in central Sweden (bordering
Norway), the 1st outbreak of more than 20 cases
was detected in the southern part of the county.
Since then, there has been an annual average of
22 cases notified over the previous 7 years (1999 - 2005) (1).
This year, 2006, a large outbreak has been
recorded, with 90 reported cases in Varmland so
far (16 laboratory confirmed cases, others
reported as having typical clinical
presentation). The majority of these cases have
been reported from areas near Lake Vanern. It is
expected that more cases will be identified if
the warmer weather persists. So far in 2006, a
much larger number of tularemia cases have been
reported in Varmland than elsewhere in Sweden (2).
19 of the patients live in Hammaro municipality,
an area that was also considerably affected
during the outbreak in 1999. An investigation
into the 1999 outbreak detected an apparent
association with Hammaro golf course and the
immediate area, and this association has also
been made for several of the 2006 cases so far.
The places around the northern shores of Lake
Vanern which are affected by tularemia are also
where a river delta, beaches and golf courses are
located. This fact coincides with the hypothesis
that the bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is
disseminated via mosquitoes and water-living protozoa.
_F. tularensis_ is a gram-negative bacterium. The
disease spreads from small rodent reservoirs to
hares and then humans through direct contact,
insect bites, or inhalation/ingestion of feces or
urine. After 3 to 7 days, patients often become
ill with a fever or swollen lymph glands and
occasionally also characteristic skin lesions.
Some patients develop general infection with
pneumonia or septicemia. The clinical
manifestations are related to the common routes
of transmission, mostly with swollen lymph glands
and fever when transmitted by insect bites.
Tularemia occurs throughout North America and in
many parts of Europe, the former Soviet Union, China and Japan (3).*
Family doctors (general practitioners) in
Varmland have become proficient in identifying
the disease. The Varmland local health
authorities are considering actively promoting
increased use of insect repellent on golf courses in future seasons.
*Erratum - the original text stated incorrectly
that tularemia was found further south around the
equator. This was corrected on 22 Sep 2006 by the editorial team.

[The form of tularemia that occurred in these
cases(i.e., ulceroglandular, oculoglandular,
typhoidal, or pneumonic) is not stated. Although
classically transmitted to man via infected
animals such as rabbits or a tick vector,
infection with _Francisella tularensis_ may be
acquired from contact with soil or water
harboring the bacterium. Although tularemia
pneumonia is the form of the disease associated
with biological terrorism, it may also occur
naturally, as is exemplified by the sporadic case
described in New York City and outbreaks among
gardeners on Martha's Vineyard, both cited in past ProMED postings below.
Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia,
outbreaks include 64 cases in Dagestan, Russia
associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49 cases
in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated
water system (2), and an outbreak in the Smolensk
province of Russia also attributed to contamination of a water supply (3).
At present, no licensed tularemia vaccine is
available in the USA. However, the LVS vaccine
(live vaccine strain) is available to military
personnel under an investigational new drug
protocol held by the US Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases (4). It is
administered via scarification using multiple
punctures of a bifurcated needle. LVS is derived
from strain 15 developed in the former USSR and
was obtained by the US military in 1956 (5). It
is not well standardized and contains 2
phenotypes of _F. tularensis_, only one of which
seems immunogenic (6). However, in studies
published in 1977, the vaccine was shown to
significantly reduce the incidence of typhoidal
tularemia in US government lab workers from 5.7
to 0.27 cases per at-risk employee years (7). It
did not reduce the incidence of the
ulceroglandular form, but the disease in
vaccinees was reported to be milder. I am not
aware whether the vaccine is effective if given post-exposure.
