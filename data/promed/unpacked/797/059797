Cattle disease hits Gulu
------------------------
A contagious cattle disease has claimed 6 head of cattle and infected over
600 others in Gulu district, the district veterinary officer has said.

Dr Okidi Ochora said on Wednesday [5 Aug 2009] that contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia (CBPP) broke out in Patiko sub-county, affecting 1879 head
of cattle last week [week of 27 Jul 2009]. "We have already notified the
commissioner of livestock health and entomology who gave us 2000 vaccines
for the cattle," revealed. He added that a quarantine had been enforced in
Patiko.

CBPP attacks the lungs of the cattle and its surrounding tissues. It is
characterised by severe coughing, loss of weight, and eventually death.

Okidi said all the non-infected cattle in Patiko would be vaccinated. "I
appeal to the people of Lukodi, Pabwo, and Owalo to prepare cattle to be
vaccinated against CBPP." Every vaccine per head of cattle costs UGX 500
[approx USD 0.25], he said. He added that the most affected areas in Patiko
were Kal, Ajulu, and Patalira. Okidi warned the people against violating
the quarantine.

[CBPP, a disease of cattle caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp.
_mycoides_ SC (bovine biotype) (SC = small colonies), is manifested by
anorexia, fever, and respiratory signs such as dyspnoea, polypnoea, cough,
and nasal discharge.

The disease is endemic in parts of Africa, including Uganda. Sporadic
outbreaks are also reported in the Middle East, and are probably caused by
cattle imported from Africa. Although CBPP reemerged in Europe in the 1980s
and 1990s, it was eradicated and has not been reported since 1999.

The morbidity and mortality rates for CBPP are highly variable. In a naive
herd, the outcome varies from complete recovery of all animals to the death
of the majority. European breeds seem to be more susceptible to this
disease than indigenous African breeds. Morbidity also increases with close
confinement, due to the increase in transmission. Mortality can be affected
by secondary factors such as nutrition and parasitism, and varies from 30
to 80 per cent in Africa, although mortality rates over 50 per cent are
uncommon.

The main problems for control or eradication are the frequent occurrence of
subacute or asymptomatic infections and the persistence of chronic carriers
after the clinical phase.

The current outbreak remains to be laboratory confirmed. The
internationally recognised diagnostic techniques and vaccine requirements
are described in chapter 2.4.9. of OIE's International Terrestrial Manual,
at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.04.09_CBPP.pdf>.
