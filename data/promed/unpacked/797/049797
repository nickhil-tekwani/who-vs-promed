[Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) viruses, of the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae, cause disease ranging from mild febrile reactions to fatal encephalitic zoonoses in equidae and humans. They are transmitted by haematophagous insects, primarily mammalophilic mosquitoes http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.13_VEE.pdf.
