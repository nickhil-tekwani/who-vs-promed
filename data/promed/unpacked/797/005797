Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: scientists at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute have reported a presumably new emerging disease in rainbow trout in Western Norway. Occurrence of diseased fish is primarily in fresh water where 4 different hatcheries have been affected. After sea transfer the mortalities and clinical signs of the disease are apparently reduced. Further information is presented in the websites of the Norwegian Veterinary Institute: http://www.vetinst.no/eng/Highlights/Updated-information-on-a-new-disease-in-rainbow-trout (to be updated) and http://www.vetinst.no/Nyheter/Oppdatert-informasjon-om-ny-sykdom-hos-regnbueoerret2/(language)/nor-NO (in Norwegian). Through a recent pilot trial the Norwegian Veterinary Institute has substantiated an association between a newly detected virus, so-called virus Y, and the mentioned disease in rainbow trout. The infectivity trial indicates that the virus Y is contagious for rainbow trout by horizontal transmission. Further investigations will be carried out.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); emergency harvest; tracing forward; tracing back

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) / histopathological examination/ 11 Jun 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

Information obtained from the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) website, and last amended on 18 Jun 2014 (http://www.vetinst.no/eng/Highlights/Updated-information-on-a-new-disease-in-rainbow-trout) indicated in the epidemiological comment that: "In late August 2013 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) received the 1st case of diseased rainbow trout from a hatchery. The signs of disease were unusual for fish at this age. The 2nd and 3rd cases were submitted to the NVI during October and primo November. The most recent hatchery affected by this disease was recorded in January 2014. Diseased fish were sized from 30-100 g. One hatchery reported high mortality in some pens. The other affected sites reported moderate mortalities.

"Diseased fish were exposed to freshwater or water with low salinity (less than 1 permil). Fish from hatcheries affected by the disease were transferred to seawater. In one case high mortality after seawater transfer was reported, but the mortality ceased after a short period. 2 farms have experienced disease 2 to 3 months after sea transfer. In other cases no specific problems in sea water have been recorded.

"The fish farmers involved have from a preventive perspective and after having consulted the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA), carried out measures to mitigate the risk of spreading the disease.

"Disease signs
--------------
Sick fish show signs of circulatory failure and may have pale viscera due to anaemia. Ascites may also be observed. Histopathological findings are inflammation in heart- and red muscle tissue and cellular necrosis in the liver.

"Disease investigation
----------------------
Tissue from diseased fish has been analysed by PCR for the following fish pathogenic viruses: viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHS), infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISA), pancreas disease virus (SAV) and piscine orthoreovirus (PRV). None of these agents were detected. Infectious pancreatic virus (IPNV) was detected in small amounts in fish from one of the farms.

"Virus cultivation in conventional cell lines has so far not succeeded; however, further work on that issue is being completed. Extended virus cultivation is also being carried out. Pathogenic fish bacteria were not detected, and antibiotic treatment carried out in one case, had no effect.

"Detection of virus Y
---------------------
Sequences from a virus (virus Y) have been detected in material from diseased fish. The virus was detected in blood and may be associated with the disease. Sequences from the virus are used to establish a PCR method for detection of virus Y.

"The significance of virus Y
----------------------------
The NVI has conducted a pilot infection trial aiming to confirm that the disease is transmissible. So far it has not been confirmed that virus Y is the causal agent of this disease. However, results showed that the amount of virus Y increased in the blood of rainbow trout injected with infected material, and that virus Y was transferred to cohabitants through the water. Clinical symptoms and mortality were not observed during the trial, but histopathological findings indicated that the disease was transferred.

"The infection trial showed that the amount of virus Y also increased in the blood of Atlantic salmon injected with infected material, however, slower compared to rainbow trout. No current information indicates that neither virus Y nor the new disease is transmissible to Atlantic salmon.

"It is now documented that virus Y survives in the blood of rainbow trout, but more research is needed to confirm that the virus is the causative agent of the new disease.

"The disease cannot be transmitted to humans.

"Occurrence of virus Y
----------------------
Virus Y has been detected in hatcheries with diseased rainbow trout and in contact sites to these hatcheries, both in brood fish and seawater sites producing rainbow trout for human consumption. In addition virus Y has been detected in small quantities from randomly tested historical material from the counties of Hordaland and More & Romsdal back to 2011.

"Actions taken by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute:
- Informing the NFSA and the industry
- Screening of selected fish populations for virus Y
- Next generation sequencing is conducted to characterise virus Y, and for detection of other potential pathogenic agents
- Electron microscopy
- Establishing cell cultures for cultivation of virus Y
- Extended examination of historical material
- Investigate the possibility of vertical transmission of virus Y
- Applications for funding of a large scale infection trial"
