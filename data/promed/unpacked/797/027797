The state [Missouri] wants hunters in Boone and other designated counties to have their deer tested for chronic wasting disease during opening weekend of next year's [2016] firearm hunting season.

Recommendations for mandatory testing for the disease were approved Friday [11 Dec 2015] by the Missouri Conservation Commission for counties in chronic wasting management zones.

The regulations would also prohibit feeding deer and the use of other attractants like grain, salt and mineral products inside the management zones, Joe Jerek, a spokesman for the Department of Conservation, said.

The regulatory changes would be finalized by the Conservation Commission after taking public comments. If approved, the rules would take effect in time for the 2016 fall hunting season.

Chronic wasting disease has continued to spread since it was 1st detected in captive deer in Linn County in 2010. In 2012, the Conservation Department detected the disease in free-ranging deer in Macon County.

Deer hunting in Missouri has been valued at up to USD 1 billion a year.

The Department of Conservation offered hunters free testing on several days during the recent firearms season, and results are in for 66 percent of deer tested since [1 Jul 2015].

The 2 zones are designated as the north and central management zones. According to the conservation department's website, of the 1575 deer tested from the north zone, 1005 tested negative and results were pending for the remaining 570 samples.

In the central zone, which includes Boone County, 1494 deer were tested with 995 results negative and 499 samples pending. Outside the zones, 264 deer were tested with 1 positive result from Franklin County, 206 negative results and 57 pending.

Jasmine Batten, wildlife health specialist and chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance coordinator for the Department of Conservation, said about 235 deer from Boone County were tested and about 41 results were pending. There have been no confirmed cases of the disease in Boone County.

The conservation department collects test samples provided by hunters, cooperating taxidermists, deer killed by motor vehicles and from department employees and authorized landowners following deer hunting season, Batten said.

Chronic wasting disease is a transmissible neurological illness causing brain lesions in infected deer and elk.

There are no confirmed cases of the disease being transmitted to humans, and the state informs hunters with deer that test positive.

Batten said that she and other department employees contact hunters and tell them that while there is no strong evidence of health risks associated with eating the meat of a diseased deer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend its consumption.

"The health risk posed by CWD cannot be fully assessed at this time, but the absence of known CWD transmission to humans suggests that the risk, if any, is low," Ryan Maddox, epidemiologist for the CDC, said. He added, however, that "results from laboratory studies have sometimes been less reassuring."

Transmission of the disease has been confirmed in non-human primates, Maddox said.

To date, there have been 27 confirmed cases of the disease in free-ranging deer in Macon, Adair, Cole and Franklin counties.

[Many states with CWD are doing surveillance on hunter killed animals during hunting season. Some states also collect taxidermy specimens and/or road kill. This is not unusual. - Mod.TG
