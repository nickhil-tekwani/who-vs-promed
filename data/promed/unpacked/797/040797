Identification of BTV-8 in two Highland Cattle in East Anglia, UK
(September 2007)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On Sunday, 16 Sep 2007 the keeper at a rare breeds farm at Great
Blakenham, Near Ipswich, in Suffolk in the East Anglian region of
England noticed that a highland cow (which had been reared in the UK
and was a resident on the farm for ~7 years) was behaving abnormally,
was eating less and had shifting lameness. The animal was initially
suspected as being infected with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV)
but by Fri, 21 Sep 2007, FMDV had been ruled out and bluetongue was
considered as a possible diagnosis. All other animals on the farm
(~70 including sheep, cows and alpaca) appeared healthy at that time.
Samples of blood from the suspect case (IAH reference collection
number: UKG2007/01)
[<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/btv-8.htm#UKG2007/01#UKG2007/01>]
were sent to the Bluetongue Reference Laboratory at IAH Pirbright and
arrived at 23:00 on 21 Sep 2007. These samples were shown to be +ve
by ELISA for BTV-serogroup-specific antibodies. Samples of RNA
extracted from EDTA treated blood, were also +ve by
BTV-serogroup-specific RT-PCR targeting genome segment 1 (Shaw et al
2007) with CT-values of ~21. This value indicates a relatively high
level of circulating viral RNA in the blood sample and indicates a
significant viraemia. These results also suggest that by 23 Sep 2007,
the animal had been infected for a minimum of ~10 days (and possibly longer).
The samples of RNA were also tested by conventional format, RT-PCR
using serotype-specific primers (targeting genome segment 2) for all
24 BTV serotypes (Mertens et al 2007), which confirmed that the cow
had been infected with BTV-8. The cDNA products were sequenced and
data was obtained for 2 regions of genome segment 2 (nucleotides
102-1732 and 2139-2688). Sequence comparisons to the 24 reference
strains of BTV (Maan et al 2007) showed a close relationship with
other strains of BTV-8. Detailed comparison with these other BTV-8
strains showed that UKG2007/01 clusters with the other isolates of
BTV-8 from northern Europe (with ~99 percent identity in Seg-2 with
strains from Belgium and the Netherlands from 2006 or 2007),
confirming that the virus was derived directly from the existing
outbreaks in northern Europe.
Further testing of the animals on the same farm identified a second
infected cow, and on 23 Sep 2007 an additional infected cow was also
found ~ 50 km [31 miles] away on a farm at Lowestoft in the same
region, on the eastern coast of England. Studies of the regional
weather patterns in northern Europe, in collaboration with the UK Met
Office, show that a plume of air from the near continent travelled
across East Anglia on the 2-4 Aug 2007. This plume is likely to have
brought the BTV-infected midges whose bites are considered likely to
have infected these 3 cows.
However, until there is evidence that the virus is being transmitted
from one host animal to another within the UK, this is not yet
considered to represent an 'outbreak' of the disease. Intensive
surveillance is therefore ongoing in this region of the UK (in
Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex).

[ProMED-mail is very grateful for the above 1st-hand authoritative
report. The speed and thoroughness of the laboratory investigation
are exemplary.
Two points in time mentioned deserve special attention: the plausible
timing of wind-borne, infected vector "immigration" from continental
Europe, suggested as 2-4 Aug 2007; and the date of the detection of
clinical symptoms on 16 Sep 2007. The sick highland cow must have
been infected at least 7-14 days earlier. Was that the 1st infected
cow in the UK? In view of the time lapse between 4 Aug and 16 Sep
2007 and the fact that bluetongue infection -- and viraemia! -- can
be subclinical and thus unnoticed in goats, camelids but also in
cattle, this is highly questionable. It will be interesting to note
if the other animals (about 70 including sheep, cows and alpaca) on
the premises, as well as ruminants elsewhere in south-east England,
have been sampled and serologically tested; in case this has been
done, results will be welcomed.- Mod.AS].
