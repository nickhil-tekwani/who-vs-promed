According to a reliable source, mass mortality in duck breeding
flocks, reaching very large dimensions, has been observed recently in
China; a similar event was later observed in Thailand. Though no
further details (age groups, clinical signs, post-mortem changes, etc)
have become available, the event was considered by the source to be an
emerging (new?) infectious (viral?) disease.

Any available information -- confirmatory or otherwise -- and
complementary epidemiological, diagnostic, and/or geographical data,
will be much appreciated.
