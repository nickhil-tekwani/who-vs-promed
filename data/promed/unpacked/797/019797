Ranch quarantined after anthrax confirmed in dead cow in northeast Colorado
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A cow that died in northeast Colorado's Logan County had anthrax, and about 50 other cattle that died at the same ranch in the last several days were likely exposed to the disease, the Colorado Department of Agriculture said Wednesday [8 Aug 2012].

Health officials said 7 people, including a veterinarian and ranch workers who had direct contact with the cattle, were potentially exposed and will be treated with antibiotics. None has shown symptoms of infection so far, said Dr Tony Cappello of the Northeast Colorado Health Department. "Anthrax is not spread person to person, so there's no concern this will spread to the general population," Cappello said. [Correct. - Mod.MHJ]

The ranch, which state agriculture officials would not identify, has been quarantined, and the remaining cows were being vaccinated. No cattle left the ranch before the quarantine, state veterinarian Keith Roehr said. He estimated the ranch has about 500 mother cows and an unknown number of calves. Test results this week confirmed one of the ranch's dead cows had anthrax, Roehr said.

Health officials were telling firefighters, state troopers, and hazardous material teams in northeast Colorado how to protect themselves if they work near the affected ranch.

Roehr said the anthrax case is the 1st in Colorado in 31 years, but outbreaks have occasionally happened in the western US.

[With some 50 dead cattle we can safely assume that the neighbouring ranches are at serious risk from biting flies (tabanids) with contaminated mouthparts which had been feeding on these cows when they were moribund or freshly dead. Ranches within 10 miles (16 km) of this ranch should be on the watch out for sick animals in their herds. And with this number of blood meal sources I would not be surprised if a few people reported cutaneous lesions following fly bites. It happens.

These outbreaks seemingly out of the blue commonly follow upon earth moving when an old cattle grave gets disturbed, such as, from putting in a new water-line, bulldozing a road, clearing clogged ditches and springs. I would expect that the ranch had also had at least a rain shower following which grass grew and was grazed. And not being aware of the risk the deaths can get away from one before it can be diagnosed. - Mod.MHJ]
