The North Dakota Department of Agriculture reports 4 confirmed cases and one suspect case of West Nile virus in horses, and one infected sheep. Animals resided in Ramsey, McIntosh, Stark, Grand Forks, Barnes, and Nelson counties. Two of the animals have died.

According to the CDC, West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. The virus typically infects birds, horses, and people, but any animal can be infected. Vaccines are available to prevent infection in horses, but there are no vaccines currently approved for people.

The ODA [Oregon Department of Agriculture] received 6 confirmed reports of West Nile virus (WNV) diagnosed in Oregon horses in the past 2 weeks.

One additional suspected case is under investigation. The affected horses live in multiple counties throughout the state: Umatilla, Malheur, and Klamath. None of the infected horses were recently vaccinated against WNV, and most of the horses have never been vaccinated for WNV.

Numerous additional WNV cases have also been reported recently in Washington, Idaho, and California near the Oregon border. Therefore, ODA advises annual vaccination as an effective tool for preventing WNV infection in horses.

West Nile virus is a reportable disease in Oregon. Veterinarians must report suspected cases to the Oregon State Veterinarian.

[The ODA also confirmed new cases of EHV-1 in Oregon. Please see the equine herpesvirus report on ProMED for information on the horse with EHV, archive 20210923.8695753). - Mod.TG]

The latest report from the Colorado State Veterinarian's Office shows there have now been 21 confirmed cases of equine West Nile virus (WNV) cases in Colorado, including the 1st case in Mesa County. Additional horses have also tested positive in counties where the virus had already been found this year [2021], including another Morgan County horse, and 5 of the infected horses in Colorado have died or been euthanized, the update notes.

The tally from the update shows Morgan County has had 2 horses test positive. Weld County has had 8 confirmed cases, Adams County has had 3, and Boulder County, 2. Douglas, Elbert, Fremont, Larimer, Mesa, and Otero counties have each had one case.

"The West Nile virus vaccine has proven to be safe and effective in preventing disease. Horse owners should work with their veterinarians to determine the most appropriate vaccination schedule for their horses. It is important to note WNV is a core vaccine recommended by the American Association of Equine Practitioners," said Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin.

Mosquito pools from Weld, Larimer, Boulder, Adams, Arapahoe, Delta, Denver, Mesa, and Pueblo counties have tested positive for WNV this summer. There have been 58 human cases of WNV in Colorado in 2021 resulting in 2 human deaths. CDPHE publishes data on human West Nile cases and positive mosquito pools on the CDPHE WNV website.

Vaccination for WNV is an effective way to protect horses from the virus. If a horse has not been vaccinated in previous years, it will need the 2-shot vaccination series. Horses need an annual booster to protect against WNV. Visit the AAEP website (https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/core-vaccination-guidelines) for a comprehensive list of vaccination recommendations. In addition to vaccinations, horse owners should also work diligently to reduce mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas where horses are located. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, using mosquito repellents, and keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, typically early in the morning and evening.

Any time a horse displays clinical signs consistent with neurologic disease, a complete veterinary examination is warranted. All infectious or contagious equine neurologic diseases are reportable to the Colorado State Veterinarian's Office. A chart of reportable animal diseases in Colorado can be found on the CDA website at https://ag.colorado.gov/animals/livestock-health.

WNV is a viral disease cycling between wild birds and mosquitoes, and can sometimes affect other species, like people and horses, as dead-end hosts. Clinical cases in horses are typically characterized by anorexia, depression, and neurological signs, which may include ataxia, weakness or paralysis of one or more limbs, teeth grinding, aimless wandering, convulsions, and/or circling. For information on human WNV signs and prevention, see https://cdphe.colorado.gov/animal-related-diseases/west-nile-virus/west-nile-virus-and-your-health.

On 15 Sept [2021], officials at the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) confirmed an unvaccinated 2-year-old Quarter Horse filly at a private facility in Benton County with West Nile virus (WNV). The filly experienced onset of clinical signs, which consisted of ataxia (incoordination), fever, hyperesthesia (extreme skin sensitivity), muscle tremors, and nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), on 3 Sep [2021]. She was subsequently euthanized.

About West Nile virus
WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include
- mild anorexia and depression;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

[A vaccine is available for horses. The WNV vaccine is often combined with eastern and western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. One vaccine to help prevent potentially deadly consequences for your horses is something every horse owner should be vaccinating with. Please consult your veterinarian regarding getting your horse vaccinated. Also please remember to use mosquito/fly spray approved for use on horses. Some components of sprays not specifically approved for horses can cause serious problems.

Please pay attention when a health department has a news release regarding mosquito trapping or birds with WNV or EEE. These are early warning signs to vaccinate your horses.

Remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations that can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. - Mod.TG]
