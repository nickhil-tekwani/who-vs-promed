Health officials hope a mass vaccination programme aimed at 44 000
people aged between 1-20 will prevent the spread of the deadly
meningococcal C disease in Northland after 2 deaths in the past
month.

Two Northlanders have died from meningococcal C disease, a
one-year-old from Ruakaka and [another person] from Whangarei, and 4
other people have been confirmed as having type C, while 2 others had
type B meningococcal [disease].

Northland medical officer of health Clair Mills said the situation was
now a community outbreak and that concern over the spread of the
disease and its random nature -- there are no known links between any
of the cases -- had prompted the mass vaccination campaign.

Dr Mills said the programme would target the highest risk group of
those aged between 1-20, with the most at risk, high school children,
to be the 1st to receive the free meningococcal C vaccination.

Those out-of-school-aged under 20 will be able to get the vaccine from
their GP, or attend special clinics in their area, as soon as vaccine
becomes available. The DHB [District Health Boards] will liaise with
community groups, employers and tertiary institutions to get to that
group.

"Initially, the programme will be offered to high school students in
the highest risk areas progressively over the 2 weeks from 26 Sep
2011," Dr Mills said. "With exams coming up, it's important to get
that group vaccinated before the exam season starts." The 1st schools
involved are Kamo High, Bream Bay College, Whangarei Boys' and Girls'
High, Whangaroa College, Kerikeri High, Springbank, Northland College,
Te Kura Kaupapa O Kaikohe, Okaihau College, Bay of Islands College,
Taipa Area School, and Kaikohe Christian School.

Dr Mills said there are usually between 0-2 cases of type C per year
in Northland, while in previous years, meningococcal type B disease
was the most common type in the region. "The current situation is,
therefore, consistent with a community outbreak. Following expert
advice and in consultation with the Ministry of Health, we have
decided to launch a vaccination campaign to help control this outbreak
and prevent more cases of disease," she said.

The DHB hoped to vaccinate about 35 000 of those in the 1-20 age group
before 16 Dec 2011 and was optimistic it would reach this target. Dr
Mills said the disease was serious and had major health implications,
and she did not think there would be widespread opposition to the
vaccination campaign. The DHB would not say how much the vaccination
campaign would cost or who was paying for it -- the DHB or the
Ministry of Health -- with discussions between the 2 organisations
over that issue ongoing.

Those outside the targeted age group could buy type C vaccinations
from their doctor, but the immunisation campaign is likely to take up
most of the country's available stock. Once new stock arrives from 6
Oct 2011, the campaign is expected to be offered to primary schools
from the beginning of November 2011.

"Vaccination offered through a school-based programme is the most
effective way of ensuring that as many students as possible are
protected against the disease," Dr Mills said. The vaccination
campaign will be launched with extensive media advertising, public
relations, a poster campaign and widespread communication with
schools, parents and caregivers, students, and health professionals in
Northland.

[Meningococcal disease is caused by the bacterium _Neisseria
meningitidis_. There are several different pathogenic serogroups of
meningococcal bacteria including groups A, B, C, Y and W135. These
groups of bacteria can be further divided into specific strains.
Between 1991 and 2004, New Zealand experienced epidemic levels of
meningococcal disease due to a particular strain of group B
meningococcus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/).
During the outbreak, the number of cases grew to about 400 cases each
year, with 80 of every 100 cases caused by the epidemic strain. There
were over 5300 cases of meningococcal disease reported, with 215
deaths
(http://www.southerncross.co.nz/AboutTheGroup/HealthResources/MedicalLibrary/tabid/178/vw/1/ItemID/143/Meningococcal-Disease.aspx).
The epidemic disproportionately affected Maori and Pacific peoples,
and the greatest number of cases consistently occurred in the upper
North Island
(http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/Files/immunise-handbook/$file/16MeningococcalInvDisease.pdf).
The MeNZB vaccine was developed to curb this epidemic due to the
particular group B strain. However, this vaccine only protected
against the particular strain that was causing the epidemic, not any
other group or strain of meningococcus.

The news release above states that the current outbreak in the
Northland region of New Zealand is caused by serogroup C _N.
meningitidis_. The Northland region, one of the 16 regions of New
Zealand, is the northernmost of New Zealand's administrative regions,
with an estimated population of 157 300 in 2010, approximately 1/3rd
of which are Maori (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region).
