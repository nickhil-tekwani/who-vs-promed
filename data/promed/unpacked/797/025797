More than 1500 students at 22 schools in [the cities of] Seoul [and]
Inchon and the province of Kyonggi have gotten sick after eating
school meals supplied by the nation's biggest food provider, CJ Food
System. The number of victims is the largest ever in school-lunch
related illness in South Korea.
The education authorities yesterday, 21 Jun 2006, ordered 68 schools
in the region to stop providing students with foods delivered by CJ.
Thus, about 70 000 students of the schools now have to take lunch from home.
Some 930 elementary, middle and high school students in Seoul, 500 in
Inchon, and 57 in Kyonggi Province have shown symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, fever and diarrhea since 16 Jun 2006. The symptoms have
spread rapidly, and some students received treatment at hospitals.
The education and health authorities suspect the mass sickness
resulted from the same food ingredients supplied by CJ. The company
delivers foods to all the schools except 2 in Kyonggi Province. An
official at the Inchon education office said 7 schools in Inchon had
pork supplied by the company.
The Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) and the Korea Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) dispatched inspectors to
the affected schools to examine students, banning the provider from
delivering food ingredients until the inspection result comes out. CJ
is also examining the case independently.

[Clusters of presumed food-borne illness are not posted on ProMED
unless there is an unusual or noteworthy vehicle or the outbreak is,
like here, substantial and widespread. No information is given
regarding the potential incubation period or length of illness, but
the presence of fever speaks against a toxin-related illness such as
those associated with _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _Clostridium perfringens_.
