In recent months, cattle have died in Denmark and Walpole in Western Australia's south-west after contracting a disease carried by bush ticks.

The disease, known as BATOG (bovine anaemia and theileria orientalis group), is caused by a blood parasite that is carried by ticks, infecting and destructing red blood cells in cattle.

The disease is believed to have originated from the eastern states.

Senior veterinary pathologist from the Department of Agriculture and Food, David Forshaw, said farmers might not see signs of the disease in all infected cattle.

However, he said, the most obvious indicators of the disease were cattle appearing weak, panting, becoming jaundiced, and abortions in pregnant cattle. The worst case scenario was death.

"The disease is most prevalent around the time of calving, as it seems that there is a suppression of the immune system and the cattle can't cope with the infection and they end up with the anaemia," Dr Forshaw said.

Denmark cattle farmer Kevin Hard had firsthand experience with the disease 18 months ago, when he lost 2 cattle and treated another 10.

He has been farming in the area for the last 40 years and said he had never seen anything like it.

"I know this year in the area there have been some farmers that have lost up to 14 head of cattle, which on today's prices is quite substantial," he said.

"You know, AUD 14 000 or 15 000 [about USD 10 000 to 11 000] worth of cattle he's lost."

[Theileria are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying theileria feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anaemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of theileria throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (fewer than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies have also been shown to transmit infection.
