I have been following with interest the discussion on the increase in the
incidence of dengue in Thailand. There obviously has been a dramatic
increase in the number of reported cases in the 1980's and 1990's. This is
similar to the situation in Malaysia.
Two explanations have been put forward: (1) herd immunity maybe decreasing,
(2) increased virulence and infectivity of the virus. Another important
factor seems to have been missed out, that is increased creation for
mosquito breeding grounds. (building sites, discarded modern day trash
such as discarded tyres, tin cans, and other markers of increased
prosperity in a society!)
>From the mid 1980's and the 1990's, Thailand and Malaysia have undergone a
boom period in their economies, leading to a feverish building boom.
Unfortunately vector control during this period was very slack, to put it
mildly. This had created fertile breeding grounds for the _Aedes_ mosquito
(at construction sites etc.). This was compounded by the rapid demographic
change of increased urban migration. It is again interesting to note that
the highest incidences have occurred in Bangkok. In Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur
and the Klang valley accounted for the most dengue cases, areas of intense
development.
Unless there is effective vector control in these countries, going hand in
hand with development, dengue will continue to be a growing problem in
South East Asia.
