Deaths of pigs not caused by Nipah virus
----------------------------------------
The Nipah virus and swine fever were not the cause of death of more than
120 pigs in a farm in Kampung Paya Mengkuang, Malacca, recently.
Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk Dr Hawari Hussein
said the test results did not show any traces of those viruses. However,
he added, the cause of death was still unknown.
"The earlier test conducted was merely to determine whether there were
traces of Nipah or swine fever viruses. That was our prime concern. Since
we have ruled out both, I think it is safe to say that this particular case
should not be cause for alarm," he said in an interview today.
The affected pigs in the farm, located about 40km from Malacca, had
symptoms of constipation, staggering and blood in their urine before they
died last week. The pigs also had infections in their lymphatic systems
and ulcerated intestines.
Although the worst is over, Hawari said the department would continue to
monitor the farm which would still be under quarantine.
There were still more tests to be done to find out the cause of death of
the pigs, he said. "I would like to stress that this is not a serious
matter and there is no need to quarantine the whole village," he added.
Nipah virus, which got its name from the village where it first appeared,
killed around 100 people in the outbreak in Malaysia in 1999.
The Nipah virus causes pneumonia symptoms in pigs and encephalitis in
humans and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with
infected pigs.

[Although not yet official, it is a relief that the pig mortality in
Malaysia has, most probably, not been caused by Nipah or CSF viruses.
Diagnosis is still pending. - Mod.AS]
