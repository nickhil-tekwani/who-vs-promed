Most COVID pneumonia survivors had lung anomalies at 1 year: study
------------------------------------------------------------------
Among 91 COVID-19 pneumonia survivors in Austria, 54% had lung abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) imaging 1 year after symptom onset, suggests an observational study yesterday [29 Mar 2022] in Radiology.

A team led by University of Innsbruck researchers evaluated the chest CTs of the 91 patients 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after COVID-19 symptom onset. It was a secondary analysis of a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted from 29 Apr-12 Aug 2020. Average patient age was 59 years, and 38% were women.

CT abnormalities were seen in 54% of participants, including 34% with patterns of subtle subpleural reticulation (interlacing lines resembling a net) or ground-glass opacities (hazy areas), or both. Approximately 20% had extensive ground-glass opacities, reticulations, bronchial dilation, and/or microsystic (abnormally small red blood cells) changes.

Multivariable analysis showed that age older than 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 5.8), severe COVID-19 illness (OR, 29.0), and male sex (OR, 8.9) were tied to CT abnormalities at 1 year. Lower qualitative CT severity score was seen during subsequent CTs. Over the study period, 44% of patients experienced complete resolution of their CT abnormalities, while 63% saw no further improvement beyond 6 months.

"Our results emphasize early and longitudinal monitoring of COVID-19 participants," the study authors wrote. "Unfortunately, there is still an urgent need for further studies focusing on histological and clinical correlations within the first 3 months after COVID-19 to identify participants at risk for developing CT abnormalities and who would benefit from early tailored therapeutic concepts."

"The results of this study by Luger et al. (2) are largely concordant with those of prior prospective longitudinal studies (3-7) that reported the temporal evolution of pulmonary abnormalities at CT in patients with COVID-19 extending to 12 months after acute infection. ...

"Despite concerns earlier in the pandemic that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may incite an auto-inflammatory response that initiates or potentiates (in setting of occult interstitial lung abnormality) an interstitial (fibrotic) lung disease (ILD), longitudinal, observational studies to date have not documented cases of progressive fibrosis in patients without previously known ILD. SARS-CoV-2-triggered acute exacerbations in patients with known ILD have been reported and likely contribute to the increased mortality observed in the ILD population who become infected with COVID-19. With no data on the histopathologic correlates of persistent CT pulmonary abnormalities after the acute stage of infection in COVID survivors, the nature of these findings is unknown but likely represent a continuum in patterns of lung injury, including organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage. Physicians should exercise caution in presuming that CT findings such as subpleural cysts, bronchial dilatation, and linear bands represent fibrosis, particularly during the first 3-6 months after acute infection, as these findings have been observed to resolve in some COVID-19 survivors (6,7). Whether further regression of persistent CT findings such as ground-glass and reticular opacities beyond 12 months after acute infection will occur remains to be investigated. A 15-year follow-up study of patients infected in 2003 with SARS-CoV showed slow improvement of persistent CT lung abnormalities for several years after acute infection (8).

"Advances in medical treatment not available during the earlier stage of the COVID-19 pandemic likely alter the course of infection and limit the generalizability of results in the study by Luger et al (2), where corticosteroid therapy was not administered. Lack of correlation of the observed, persistent CT findings to clinical data such as patient symptoms and pulmonary function tests leaves unanswered the important question, "What is the clinical significance of these CT findings?" Given the frequency of respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 survivors with PASC, with its attendant morbidity magnified on a global scale, large-scale national trials have begun to address this and other important questions."

Data spotlight loss of taste may linger 9 months after COVID-19
---------------------------------------------------------------
A new research letter in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases from French scientists shows that, 9 months after COVID-19 diagnosis, 30% of patients have an impaired sense of taste, but complete loss of taste is uncommon.

The observational, retrospective study was conducted at the Nord Franche-Comte Hospital and included COVID-19 inpatients and outpatients from 1 Mar-31 May 2020. A total of 214 patients were involved, and the mean age was 48.8 years.

Of the patients seen at the hospital, 65.9% had loss of taste, and 34.1% had a reduced ability to taste during their initial illness. Of the patients with impaired taste, 192 (89.7%) had olfactory dysfunction (impaired ability to smell) as well.

Three months after diagnosis, 86.9% of patients had recovered their sense of taste, but after 9.5 months, 29.9% of patients still reported taste dysfunction. Patients who had persistent taste dysfunction reported a longer period of taste loss during their initial illness (median duration, 24 days), compared to patients who had their taste return (14 days during initial illness.)

Only two (3.1%) patients reported total loss of taste 9.5 months after infection.

The authors said a long duration of loss of taste during the initial illness is likely associated with persistent taste dysfunction.

Global COVID cases ebb amid testing blind-spot worries
------------------------------------------------------
After rising for 2 weeks, global cases declined again, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest weekly snapshot of the pandemic, but it urged caution about interpreting trends, due to reduced testing in a number of countries. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---29-march-2022]

In other global developments, the WHO today [30 Mar 2022] released its 3rd strategic plan for battling the pandemic, along with a decade-long plan for improving genomic surveillance of pathogens. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/strategic-preparedness-readiness-and-response-plan-to-end-the-global-covid-19-emergency-in-2022]

WHO raises concerns about drops in testing
------------------------------------------
The world's COVID-19 cases dropped 14% last week, compared to the week before, with decreases seen across all of the WHO's regions. However, deaths rose 45%, primarily due to changes in how some countries define COVID deaths and retrospective adjustments from others.

Overall, about 10 million cases were reported to the WHO last week. The 5 countries reporting the most cases were South Korea, Germany, Vietnam, France, and Italy.

The WHO noted that recent case rises earlier this month [March 2022] occurred despite reduced testing in many countries, which it says is a sign that the virus is still circulating at very high levels. It warned that a decline in testing could lead to less robust data that makes it harder to track the virus and how it is spreading and evolving. The situation could impair how quickly countries can respond with targeted control measures to reduce hospitalizations and deaths.

In its weekly report, the WHO said the omicron variant makes up 99.5% of sequenced samples. Officials added that they're monitoring recombinant viruses, including a BA.1-BA.2 version that was first observed in the United Kingdom and appears to be about 10% more transmissible than the omicron's BA.2 subvariant.

Latest pandemic game plan
-------------------------
At a briefing today [30 Mar 2022], WHO officials unveiled its 3rd version of a strategy for fighting the pandemic, which spells out 3 scenarios for how the situation might unfold this year [2022]. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the most likely scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve but severity declines as populations build up immunity due to vaccination and infection. [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-who-press-conference-30-march-2022]

"Periodic spikes in cases and deaths may occur as immunity wanes, which may require periodic boosting for vulnerable populations," he said, adding that the best-case scenario is the emergence of less severe variants, and the worst-case situation would be the emergence of a more virulent, highly transmissible variant.

Tedros said the world already has the key tools it needs to end the pandemic's acute phase this year [2022], with equitable vaccination as the single most valuable tool for saving lives.

"Even as some high-income countries now roll out 4th doses for their populations, 1/3 of the world's population is yet to receive a single dose, including 83% of the population of Africa," he said.

Vaccine supplies have made their way to Africa, but some countries are struggling with efforts to immunize their population, which requires trained workers, supplies, cold-chain capabilities, and communication efforts. In a related development, the European Commission has contributed USD 17.8 million to help the WHO shore up vaccine campaigns in 15 African nations where only 15% of populations are vaccinated. [https://www.who.int/news/item/29-03-2022-european-union-funding-boosts-covid-19-vaccination-in-africa]

Also at today's [30 Mar 2022] briefing, Tedros announced the launch of a new WHO strategy to boost genomic surveillance of pathogens that have the capacity to trigger epidemics or pandemics. In a statement, the WHO said country capacity to conduct genomic surveillance is increasing steadily, rising from 54% in March 2021 to 68% by January 2022. [https://www.who.int/news/item/30-03-2022-who-releases-10-year-strategy-for-genomic-surveillance-of-pathogens]

They added that even greater gains were made with public sharing of sequencing data.

The complexity of the process means not all countries can develop capabilities on their own, and new technology runs the risk of increasing inequities, one of the targets of the new strategy.

Asian hot spots grapple with omicron
------------------------------------
China's daily COVID-19 total spiked to 8655 new cases today [30 Mar 2022], though about 82% were asymptomatic and mostly from Shanghai, where much of the city is on lockdown, and mass testing is under way.

Due to Shanghai's continuing surge of cases, officials started the 2nd phase of a lockdown in some western districts 2 days early, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/china/shanghai-expands-lockdown-more-areas-new-local-cases-hit-5982-2022-03-30/]

In South Korea, where health officials saw signs of a peak last week, cases rose steeply again for the 2nd straight day, with about 424 000 new cases reported today [30 Mar 2022], according to Yonhap News. Daily deaths reached their 2nd highest level, and the number of critically ill patients rose to a record high. [http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220330000205]

Health officials said the more transmissible BA.2 omicron subvariant made up 56.3% of sequenced samples last week.

[3] Vaccines: comparison
Date: Tue 29 Mar 2022
Source: Nature [edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00885-y


A rare head-to-head comparison shows that the COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna outperform those from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax(1). The data also provide a finely detailed picture of the immune protection that each vaccine offers -- information that could be useful for designing future vaccines.

The research was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 21 Mar 2022. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

The study assessed the 4 vaccines using 14 metrics, including levels of several types of immune cells such as T cells and B cells, as well as immune molecules called neutralizing antibodies. Such investigations are sorely needed to sort through the flood of COVID-19 vaccines in the research pipeline and on the market, researchers say.

"It's a really nice analysis by premier immunologists that builds upon what has been previously shown," says Robert Seder, an immunologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.

Previous comparisons of COVID-19 vaccines have often brought together data from different studies, which might have been conducted with slightly varying laboratory techniques. For the latest study, by contrast, researchers applied the same techniques across all the vaccines they investigated.

"When you try to compare [vaccine data] between different papers, which is what many of us have been doing for over a year now, you get apples to oranges comparisons, and you can be way off," says Shane Crotty, an immunologist at La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and a co-author of the preprint.

The 4 vaccines that Crotty and his co-authors examined fall into 3 classes. The jabs made by Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and by Pfizer in New York City and BioNTech in Mainz, Germany, are both based on messenger RNA. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) of New Brunswick, New Jersey, has produced a 'viral vector' vaccine that uses a harmless virus to deliver SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into host cells. The vaccine made by Novavax in Gaithersburg, Maryland, contains pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Antibody levels induced by 2 doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's mRNA vaccine tended to wane substantially over 6 months. By contrast, antibody levels from J&J's one-shot vaccine were stable or even increased over time. But antibody levels measured 6 months after vaccination with the J&J jab were still lower than those observed 6 months after vaccination with an mRNA vaccine.

Novavax's 2-shot regimen induced antibody responses on a par with those of the mRNA vaccines. However, after the Novavax jab, levels of CD8+ T cells, which destroy infected cells, were low to undetectable, whereas the other 3 vaccines performed well in this metric.

These results generally support the findings of previous studies. But the latest research offers a more extensive analysis of the immune system's response than do earlier studies, and uses an apples-to-apples approach.

"This is not meant to proclaim winners and losers," says study co-author Alessandro Sette, an immunologist at La Jolla. Instead, the study is meant to "provide a comprehensive evaluation of the different variables", he says.

Novavax has received authorization for its vaccine in 38 countries. The vaccines made by Moderna, Pfizer and J&J have all received wide authorization globally.

One caveat is that the study looked at the effects of the Novavax jab in only 12 people. It examined the other 3 vaccines in 30 volunteers each.

Seder notes that the analysis considers the effects of only a 2-dose regimen of the mRNA vaccines. It does not consider the protection provided by boosters, because the authors began the work in late 2020, before a 3rd shot was recommended by health authorities. Crotty, Sette and their colleagues are now conducting a similar head-to-head study that includes mRNA boosters.

[In the past 24 hours, 21 countries including South Korea (320 675), Germany (267 367), France (169 024), UK (86 839), Vietnam (85 765), Italy (71 411), Australia (61 608), the USA (54 094), Botswana (41 576), Austria (34 743), Brazil (33 937), Netherlands (27 766), Thailand (27 560), Greece (22 451), Russia (20 145), Switzerland (16 334), Malaysia (15 941), New Zealand (15 300), Turkey (14 993), Canada (11 552), and Israel (10 164) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5334 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 28 Mar 2022 to late 29 Mar 2022).

A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 27.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.2% decrease in daily reported cases and an 18.1% decrease in reported deaths. These show an overall global trend of decreasing cases and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.50 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 487.09 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.16 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
