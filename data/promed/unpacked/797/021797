[This communication concerns the post Skin disorder, sheep farmers -
UK: RFI 20071103.3567. Mod - DK]
I discussed this issue with a colleague, Dr. Henry Kahn. It is
interesting to note that the article does not mention Q-fever. It
would not be unusual for a large percentage of sheep farmers to have
antibody titers against _Coxiella burnetii_.

It is also well documented that skin testing for sensitization to
_Coxiella burnetii_ may cause severe reactions. The skin on the human
ear is sensitive and unprotected in most animal workers.

Since _C. burnetii_ is known to grow to very high titers in amniotic
fluid and products of conception, and airborne spread from
aerosolization is well documented, is it possible that this could be
a reaction to Q? I would recommend obtaining serologic titers in the
affected workers and look for possible changes with exposure.

[Q fever could certainly be a possibility. Many sheep have no
clinical signs of this disease. We will hope that someone will
conduct a proper medical and epidemiological investigation. - Mod.TG]
