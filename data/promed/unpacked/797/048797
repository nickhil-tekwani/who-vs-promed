The coronavirus is not the only threat to Mexico. In the 1st 2 months of 2020, 8029 cases of respiratory tuberculosis were reported, almost double that recorded in the same period of 2019: 4448.

[The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has noted that tuberculosis (TB) has been a concern for border areas in both Mexico and the United States. At the time (2005), both countries reported approximately 15 000 cases of TB each year, with an incidence rate of 15 cases per 100 000 in Mexico and 4.7 per 100 000 population in the U.S. However, U.S.-Mexico border states reported a TB incidence rate higher than the national average, with rates of 7.9 in U.S. border states and 26.3 in Mexican border states (1). However, in San Diego, California during 1980-1997, 34 percent of culture-confirmed TB cases in children aged under 15 years were caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_; approximately 90 per cent of these children were USA-born and of Hispanic ethnicity (2).

Although human TB is usually caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, other species within the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex can also cause TB. _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex is composed of closely related species that include _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_ (the usual cause of bovine tuberculosis), _M. bovis-BCG, _M. microti_ (a pathogen in rodents), and _M. canetti_ and _M. africanum_ (both rare causes of TB in Africa). _M. bovis_ can be distinguished from _M. tuberculosis_ by specific gene probes (the standard nucleic acid amplification assay only identifies the organism as a member of the "_M. tuberculosis_ complex"), colony morphology and specific biochemical assays (_M. bovis_ does not produce niacin or reduce nitrate), and intrinsic mono-drug resistance to pyrazinamide among _M. bovis_. The news report above does not specify the species that are causing TB in Mexico.

Bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Latin America, including Mexico (3). One study determined that 17 percent of cattle sampled at meat-processing plants in Mexico were infected with _M. bovis_ (3a). In the US, human TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who acquire the infection in their countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (4,5).

People of Hispanic ethnicity and consumption of unpasteurized milk products produced in Latin America are not restricted to states of the USA bordering Mexico. An investigation in New York City identified 35 cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ during 2001-4; 19 of the 23 interviewed patients reported eating cheese produced in Mexico while they were living in the USA (6). However, human-to-human, airborne transmission from patients with _M. bovis_ pulmonary tuberculosis is also possible (7).

More information concerning TB in Mexico would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
