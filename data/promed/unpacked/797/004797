The mystery emerged slowly, its clues maddeningly diverse. Sally
Lester, an animal pathologist at a British Columbia (BC) laboratory,
slipped under her microscope a slide from tissue obtained from a dog
on Vancouver Island. Her lens focused on a tiny cell that looked like
a boiled egg. It was late 1999. She had started seeing a lot of those.
On the eastern side of the island, several dead porpoises washed
ashore early in 2000. Scientist Craig Stephen, who runs a research
center on the island, found the lungs seized by pneumonia and the
other organs swollen by strange, flower-like tumors.
At work at the family trucking firm in Victoria, on the southern tip
of the island, a lively 45-year-old mother, was feeling poorly in the
fall of 2001. She had headaches and night sweats and was tired, her
family said. The doctor told her it would pass. She eventually died
of the same process affecting the animals.
All would become pieces of a medical mystery centered on a tropical
disease apparently brought to North America and enhanced by a warming
climate. An alien fungus took root on Vancouver Island 8 years ago
and has since killed 8 people and infected at least 163 others, as
well as many animals.
Similar cases have been found elsewhere in BC (Canada) and in
Washington state and Oregon (USA). Scientists say the fungus may be
thriving because of a string of unusually warm summers here. They say
it is a sign of things to come.
"As climate change happens, new ecological niches will become
available to organisms, and we will see this kind of thing happen
again," said Karen Bartlett, a scientist at the University of British
Columbia (UBC) who played a central role in the search for the
disease's cause. Her investigation eventually would focus on a
fungus, a member of the yeast family, called _Cryptococcus gattii_.
The microscopic fungus is found in the bark of eucalyptus trees in
Australia and in other tropical zones.
Physicians in North America are familiar with a relative,
_Cryptococcus neoformans_. In humans, it shows up through pneumonia
when immune systems already are weak, most typically in AIDS
patients. In dogs and cats, it can form abscesses below the eyes.
Lester, working in her pathology lab in 1999, was used to seeing
tissue specimens from 6 to 10 pets a year with it. But by 2000, vets
on the island were sending her 10 positive samples a month. Lester
knew _Cryptococcus_ causes a disease that, like bird flu and West
Nile virus, affects animals and humans. She put in a call to the BC
Centre for Disease Control.
The call came at a busy time for Murray Fyfe. Fyfe consulted Pamela
Kibsey, a microbiologist at the Vancouver Island Health Authority.
Kibsey said she had noticed an increase in human cases of
cryptococcus. And it was infecting healthy people, not just the sick.
Fyfe formed a group to begin combing records of veterinarians and
hospitals, tracing the 1st cases back to 1999. He asked Bartlett, at
UBC, to join the group. They sent samples of the yeast recovered from
diseased tissue for further analysis. The results showed it wasn't
the familiar form.
"This was an Australian fungus," Stephen said. More disturbing, the
fungus appeared to be more virulent than in Australia. There, it
infects about 4 people per million and is rarely fatal. On Vancouver
Island, the rate was 27 per million, and it was more often killing people.
The scientists can only guess how, or when, the fungus arrived. It
could have been brought on eucalyptus trees imported by nurseries
from Australia. Or it may always have been on the island. "With
global warming, it may have finally been able to emerge to a level
(at which) it is infectious," Fyfe said. Bartlett formed a team of
students to try to find _C. gattii_ in the wild. Armed with new
detection kits, they tramped through back yards on Vancouver Island,
digging up soil, taking air samples, swabbing bark on trees. They
went out with hour-long questionnaires to talk to survivors of the
disease and to owners of infected pets.
One common site came up: Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park, an expanse
of moss-covered fir and hemlock trees, next to the Strait of Georgia.
Several of the patients had been there.
Fyfe helped the students swab an old Douglas fir at the park. Two
weeks later, Bartlett called him, excited. The swabs had come back positive.
By the start of 2003, Bartlett's students had found the fungus in
other spots. They eventually concluded that it had infested a several
hundred-kilometer range on eastern Vancouver Island. Health
authorities agreed with business leaders in the adjacent city of
Parksville that it was no longer fair to target the park alone, and
warning signs at the Rathtrevor Beach Park came down in favor of a
wider information campaign.

[The following is a discussion written by Eleni Galanis MD and Laura
MacDougall MSc from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control,
Canada, from ProMED-mail posting, Cryptococcus gattii - Denmark ex
Canada (BC) 20070103.0022. The references cited can be found in the posting.
"Endemic acquisition of _C. gattii_ has been occurring in the
province of BC since 1999. There has been no recent increase or
cluster of cases. There have been over 160 human cases reported to
date among BC residents, for an annual provincial incidence of 6
cases/million population (2). Contrary to comments made in the ProMED
posting, cases have been exposed largely on the eastern coast of
Vancouver Island. The incidence of _C. gattii_ infection on Vancouver
Island is 36/million (3). Vancouver Island is the largest island on
the Pacific coast of North America, located approximately 50 km (31
miles) west of the BC mainland. The vast majority of the rest of BC
remains unaffected by this environmental fungus.
Cases among tourists to Vancouver Island have been previously
reported, mostly among BC residents traveling from the mainland to
Vancouver Island (4). Publications such as the one by Jens Lindberg
and colleagues (1) help raise awareness that _C. gattii_ infection
can be acquired in non-tropical environments such as BC.
_C. gattii_ has been found in most tree species, in soil, water, and
air on Vancouver Island (5,6). It has not been isolated from
eucalyptus trees in BC. _C. gattii_'s range is believed to be
increasing. Since 2003, human and animal cases without exposure to
Vancouver Island but with the same or similar genotype as that found
on the Island have been found on the BC mainland and in Pacific
Northwestern US states (3). BC researchers continue to study _C.
gattii_ to better understand the reasons for its emergence and spread."

[It would be helpful if there was a more in-depth decription of the
lesions along with a more detailed description of what the clinical
signs in pets may be. The near-neighbor fungus may not present in the
same way. It would also be helpful to know if the infection has been
diagnosed at an early stage and what treatment may be successful. -Mod.TG]
