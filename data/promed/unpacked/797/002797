The district of Manjakandriana has been confronted with the bubonic
plague. With the last information communicated by the service of the
transmissible disease, the disease has killed, up to now, 3 people.
In addition to a 38-year-old man, an inhabitant of Manankasikely and
dead on 5 Jan 2008, a 12-year-old is also dead in Ambohitseheno. The 3rd
victim lived in the rural district of Ambatolaona, and his death
occurred in December 2007.
Moreover, as of 10 Jan 2008, 4 men and a woman are under treatment in
the hospital complex of the district.
"The rats haven't been beaten down. We have rushed a medical team to
Manjakandriana to address the situation," said Dr. Rolland Robinson,
chief of the service of the Emergenies and Transmissible Diseases within
the Ministry of Health, Family Planning and Social Protection.
In all the cases, the killing of rats are not done, because "that
supports the profusion of the fleas and, so the recrudescence of the
malady," said Dr. Robinson. He encourages the cleansing of the places
and the insecticide use.

[3 deaths are reported in this press posting but 18 deaths are noted in
the web posting below. ProMED would appreciate learning more
information regarding this outbreak.
Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial
resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al:
Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable
plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997;337: 677-81). The strain was resistant to
chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline but sensitive to
fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This
was an ominous observation, however, it is not clear if this naturally
occurring strain has persisted or spread.
Manjakandriana is an administrative region in the central Madagascar
province of Antananarivo. The area can be found on a map of the island

At least 18 people have died of bubonic plague on the East African
island of Madagascar in the past 10 days, and at least 5 patients are
still in hospital. Bubonic plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_
bacillus carried by rat fleas.
At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of
Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages.
[The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S,
Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease
in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998;4: 101-104:
"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on
the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management.
However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic
plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each
year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being
notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has
accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."
