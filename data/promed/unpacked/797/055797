Afghan Cholera Epidemic Feared
-------------------------------
More than 2000 suspected cases of cholera have been detected in the Afghan
capital in recent weeks, and at least 8 people have died, a health expert
said Tue, 14 Jun 2005, warning that the city is on the verge of an epidemic.
The Health Ministry on 13 Jun 2005 confirmed up to 300 cases, but claimed
they have been dealt with and there had been no fatalities. It said there
was no risk of the disease spreading.
"An epidemic is about to break out here. Over 2000 cases have been reported
so far that would meet the case definition of cholera," said Fred Hartman,
an epidemiologist and technical director for a USA Agency for International
Development-backed program, the Rural Expansion of Afghanistan's
Community-based Health Care. Hartman, who has combated cholera outbreaks
around the world for 30 years and has been directly involved with efforts
to contain the disease here, told The Associated Press that 8-9 people had
died in the past 2 weeks, and warned the disease could spread quickly
throughout the city's 4 million population.
Hartman said the government was well-equipped to deal with the outbreak and
had set up an emergency task force to ensure that hospitals have the
necessary equipment and medicine to treat patients. "For an undeveloped,
war-torn country, Afghanistan's ministry of health has been able to respond
very well," he said.
Hartman said the disease had been detected in wells around the city, the
source of drinking water for most of the city's residents, as well as
irrigation ditches.
A spokesman for UNICEF, the UN children's agency, Edward Carwardine, said
the last cholera outbreak in Kabul was in 2003 when there were 7000
suspected cases. But he said the government was fast to respond and the
disease quickly disappeared after wells were chlorinated. In 2001, 114
people died from a cholera outbreak in Afghanistan's north, according to
the WHO's Web site. It had no information on the latest cases.
