Pepper growers are in distress as 'Soragu Roga' (Bacterial wilt) is affecting the crop. The pepper vines in most of the plantations in [Kodagu district] have started to rot due to excessive rain followed by disease. The pepper leaves have turned yellow, and seeds have started to wither. The disease, originating in the stem, gradually spreads to the vines.

Even though the pepper crop was good this year [2018], the disease has dealt a big blow to the growers. The current type of bacterial wilt is spreading faster compared to the disease inflicted by worms [slow wilt, caused by nematodes - Mod.DHA].

Pepper growers have expressed their inability in controlling the disease, which is spreading at a fast rate. An agriculturist said the crop loss due to the disease was huge.

[Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is an economically important spice crop in many tropical areas. It is known to be affected by several fungal, nematode, phytoplasma, and viral pathogens, including quick wilt (also called foot rot; caused by _Phytophthora capsici_) and slow wilt (also called slow decline or yellows; caused by nematodes) as mentioned above (for more information see ProMED-mail post 20170303.4876056).

A 'bacterial leaf spot' (or wilt) is considered to be one of the most serious diseases of the crop in India and especially Karnataka, with both _Pseudomonas syringae_ and _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _beticola_ reported as causal organisms (see links below). Furthermore, bacterial wilts due to species in other genera (e.g., _Ralstonia_) can affect many crops. It is not clear which bacteria are considered to be the cause of the problems above, but reliable diagnosis is needed for successful management.
