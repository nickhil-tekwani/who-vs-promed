Abstract
---------
Anthrax is a worldwide zoonotic disease. Anthrax has long been a public health and socio-economic issue in Mongolia. Presently, there is no spatial information on carcass burial sites as a potential hazard of future anthrax outbreaks and possible risk factors associated with anthrax occurrences in Mongolia. Here, we analyze retrospective data (1986-2015) on the disposal sites of livestock carcasses to describe historical spatio-temporal patterns of livestock anthrax in Khuvsgul [Hovsgol, Khovsgol] Province, which showed the highest anthrax incidence rate in Mongolia.

From the results of spatial mean and standard deviational ellipse analyses, we found that the anthrax spatial distribution in livestock did not change over the study period, indicating a localized source of exposure. The multi-distance spatial cluster analysis showed that carcass sites distributed in the study area are clustered. Using kernel density estimation analysis on carcass sites, we identified 2 anthrax hotspots in low-lying areas around the south and north regions. Notably, this study disclosed a new hotspot in the northern part that emerged in the last decade of the 30-year study period.

The highest proportion of cases was recorded in cattle, whose prevalence per area was highest in 6 districts (i.e., Murun, Chandmani-Undur, Khatgal, Ikh-Uul, Tosontsengel, and Tsagaan-Uul), suggesting that vaccination should prioritize cattle in these districts. Furthermore, size of outbreaks was influenced by the annual summer mean air temperature of Khuvsgul Province, probably by affecting the permafrost freeze-thawing activity.

[Other than a very useful general view of this livestock disease in a single province in Mongolia, for which we have had no national reports since 2015, the report shows the concentration of cases in just 6 districts and the authors' valid observation that any vaccination program in this province must concentrate on those 6 districts. Obviously, surveillance must cover all other districts to be aware of sporadic outbreaks elsewhere and then take necessary action.

We normally expect to see anthrax outbreaks in livestock in hot dry summers. Cold also negatively impacts the innate resistance and thereby lowers the infective dose of spores needed to initiate a possible lethal infection. "Low-lying areas" collect rainfall and thus will have more vegetation for grazing, plus the inflow of minerals from surrounding soils raises the pH. Together, along with the accumulation of humus in the topsoil, they provide an excellent situation for prolonged anthrax spore survival and multiplication.

Khovsgol (Hovsgol) Aimag, the northernmost province of Mongolia, can be located on the map at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/mongolia_pol96.jpg. - Mod.MHJ]
