A cholera epidemic in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) claimed 4
more lives this week, raising the death toll to 19, the FSM government said
in a statement Thursday. Quoting Amato Elymore, National Health
Statistician/Public Health Surveillance Coordinator the statement said
since the Pohnpei governor last month relaxed an emergency order people
have lowered their guard, with some thinking there was no more cholera. He
urged people to practice the same hygienic safeguards that existed under
the emergency orders.
