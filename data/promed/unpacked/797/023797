A description of the disease is given in the following paper published last
year in the Veterinary Record. In all I found 3 references on the disease
by searching the CAB ABSTRACTS database.

Following an outbreak of wobbly possum disease in a colony of brush tail
possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), the disease was established experimentally
in captive possums by inoculating the animals i.p. with tissue homogenates.
Crude tissue homogenates of liver remained infectious after freezing at
75C or filtration through a 0.22 m filter. The
disease was characterized by docility, incoordination, loss of balance and
wasting. 15 of 16 infected animals were destroyed owing to the severity of
the clinical signs. Cachexia was the only change observed PM.
Histology showed widespread perivascular infiltrations with plasma cells and
lymphocytes which were severe in the liver and kidney and moderate to mild
in other tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle. Changes in the
brain consisted of a mild to moderate mononuclear perivascular cuffing. Most
of the animals had small to large numbers of circulating nucleated red blood
cells and eosinopenia when killed. There was a consistent decrease in serum
albumin concentration and an increase in serum globulins, which resulted in
a decreased albumin:globulin ratio. Virus-like particles were detected in
preparations of liver from 2 animals; they were spherical or icosahedral and
45 nm in diameter.

I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, but the US's CDC has a
review article on the Web on Borna Virus, in their online journal of
Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID). The URL is:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/eid.htm>
It is in the July-September l997 issue.
