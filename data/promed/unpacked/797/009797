5 herds of cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis (TB) in northwestern
Minnesota all seem to have the same strain of the bacterial disease, state
veterinary officials said. The outbreak could lead to new federal
restrictions on the sale of Minnesota cattle.
Cattle producers packed a meeting room in Bagley on Tuesday [17 Jan 2006],
as officials discussed details of the state's 1st outbreak of bovine TB in
34 years.
"I think everyone in this room will be affected by this deal," Terry
Boldingh, district veterinarian for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health,
told those gathered.
That wasn't what producers wanted to hear. Jerry Handside, who owns a cow
and calf operation near Lengby, said news that exports could be affected
came as a surprise.
"There was no concern in November [2005]," when Handside sold his calves to
be fed for slaughter, he said. "I think this year [2006] we are getting a
little concerned about it. We'd like to see the state stay TB-free."
Tests on the 4th and 5th herds in question are not complete, said Linda
Glaser, another Board of Animal Health official. But it appears to be the
same strain as that afflicting the other 3, the same strain seen in cattle
from Mexico and the U.S. Southwest, but not what's been seen in recent
bovine TB outbreaks in Michigan or Manitoba.
Lee Boehland, a district veterinarian for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, said officials had been worried about Minnesota's population
of roping steers, which are often imported from Mexican states and
sometimes make a circuit of rodeos throughout the U.S. west.
But so far, he said, no link has been found between the current TB outbreak
and Mexican roping steers.
About a year ago, a heifer slaughtered in Wisconsin was found to have TB
lesions in her carcass. An investigation found the animal had been born and
raised on a farm near Wannaska, Minnesota, near the Thief River Falls.
Further investigation found 3 other herds, 2 of them neighboring the
premises of origin, with TB infections and connections to the premises of
origin's large purebred operation.
Glaser said other links between the 5 infected herds are still unclear, but
she expects a common connection to be discovered.
The USDA is expected to publish its finding later this month [January 2006]
that Minnesota has lost its 34-year TB-free status. That means new
restrictions on selling cattle 18 months and older to other states. Several
states have already restricted the importation of Minnesota cattle.
The state Department of Natural Resources confirmed last week [2nd week
January 2006] that a 5-year-old buck deer shot within a mile of the
premises of origin tested positive for bovine TB.
Michelle Carstensen Powell, a DNR wildlife specialist, said it's likely a
"spillover" effect from the deer overlapping with the cattle's habitat.
It's not as serious as a more pervasive outbreak of TB among whitetail deer
in Michigan, she said.
The DNR is asking owners of the 5 infected cattle herds to take part in a
special deer hunt next week [4th week January 2006]. They'll get permits to
shoot dozens of deer on their land, and DNR scientists will stand by to
test the carcasses for TB on the spot.
Even if no more cattle or deer are found to be infected with TB, it will
take the state at least 2 years to regain its federal TB-free status.
John Gilbertson, owner of a cow and calf operation in Puposky and a Board
member of the state Farm Bureau, said he'd push the group and local
legislators to seek state funding for TB testing of herds. "We need to find
out where it is and get it cleaned up as quickly as possible," Gilbertson said.
Boldingh has worked as a veterinarian in northwestern Minnesota for more 44
years and remembers TB outbreaks in the 1960s and '70s. But, he said, "this
has been the most challenging thing I've ever faced. And I don't think it's
going to change for a couple of years."

[Minnesota has already become a Modified Accredited State under the USDA
rules. If there are no further cases, it will take 2 years to regain the
coveted Tuberculosis Free status. Unless the states receiving animals from
Minnesota have a more stringent rule, the federal rule indicates an animal
18 months old or older must be tested negative to tuberculosis within 60
days of moving to the receiving state.
Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease. It is difficult to get rid of,
because it can take so long to develop. - Mod.TG]
