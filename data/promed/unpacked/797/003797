Qaeda Trying to Harness Toxin for Bombs, U.S. Officials Fear
------------------------------------------------------------
Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch is said to be seeking castor beans for making
ricin. American counter-terrorism officials are increasingly concerned
that the most dangerous regional arm of Al Qaeda is trying to produce
the lethal poison ricin, to be packed around small explosives for
attacks against the United States.

For more than a year, according to classified intelligence reports, Al
Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen has been making efforts to acquire large
quantities of castor beans, which are required to produce ricin, a
white, powdery toxin that is so deadly that just a speck can kill if
it is inhaled or reaches the bloodstream.

Intelligence officials say they have collected evidence that Qaeda
operatives are trying to move castor beans and processing agents to a
hideaway in Shabwa Province, in one of Yemen's rugged tribal areas
controlled by insurgents. The officials say the evidence points to
efforts to secretly concoct batches of the poison, pack them around
small explosives, and then try to explode them in contained spaces,
like a shopping mall, an airport or a subway station.

These officials also note that ricin's utility as a weapon is limited
because the substance loses its potency in dry, sunny conditions, and
unlike many nerve agents, it is not easily absorbed through the skin.
Yemen is a hot, dry country, posing an additional challenge to
militants trying to produce ricin there.

But senior American officials say they are tracking the possibility of
a threat very closely, given the Yemeni affiliate's proven ability to
devise plots, including some thwarted only at the last minute: a bomb
sewn into the underwear of a Nigerian man aboard a commercial jetliner
to Detroit in December 2009, and printer cartridges packed with
powerful explosives in cargo bound for Chicago 10 months later.

A range of administration officials have stated that the threat of a
major attack from Al Qaeda's main leadership in Pakistan has waned
after Osama bin Laden's death in May [2011], on top of the Central
Intelligence Agency's increasing drone assaults on Qaeda targets in
Pakistan's tribal areas over the past 3 years.

But the continuing concern over a ricin plot underscores the menace
that regional Qaeda affiliates, especially Al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula, now pose to the United States and American interests
overseas.

Al Qaeda's arm in Yemen has openly discussed deploying ricin and other
deadly poisons against the United States. "Brothers with less
experience in the fields of microbiology or chemistry, as long as they
possess basic scientific knowledge, would be able to develop other
poisons such as ricin or cyanide," the organization posted to its
online English-language journal, Inspire, last fall, in an article
titled "Tips for Our Brothers in the United States of America."

Senior administration officials say ricin is among the threats focused
on by a secret government task force created after the
printer-cartridge plot. The task force is working closely with Saudi
intelligence officials and the remnants of Yemen's intelligence
agencies, and it is using information gleaned from the shipboard
interrogation of a Somali terrorist leader with ties to the Yemeni
branch of Al Qaeda, who was captured by Navy Seal commandos in April
[2011].

The intelligence reports indicating ricin plots by Al Qaeda's Yemeni
affiliate were 1st uncovered during reporting for a book,
"Counterstrike: The Untold Story of America's Secret Campaign Against
Al Qaeda." It will be published next week [15-19 Aug 2011] by Times
Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company.

American officials now say that Al Qaeda's most direct threat to the
United States comes from the Yemeni affiliate. These officials have
also expressed growing alarm at the way the affiliate is capitalizing
on the virtual collapse of Yemen's government to widen its area of
control inside the country, and is strengthening its operational ties
to the Shabab, the Islamic militancy in Somalia, to exploit the chaos
in both countries. The affiliate has also become a magnet for
terrorists fleeing the increasing pressure from drone strikes in
Pakistan, and is recruiting specialists in bomb-making and other
skills.

Largely because of the Americans in the Yemeni affiliate's top
leadership, including Anwar al-Awlaki, a cleric born in New Mexico who
is in hiding in Yemen, American counter-terrorism and intelligence
officials fear the affiliate's innovative agility. "The
fastest-learning enemy we have is A.Q.A.P.," said the senior United
States official.

In 2003, British and French operatives broke up suspected Qaeda cells
that possessed components and manuals for making ricin bombs and maps
of the London subway system.

A ricin-dispersing bomb detonated in a major subway system or in a
mall or at a major airport would not result in mass destruction on the
scale of the attacks on 11 Sep 2001, counter-terrorism specialists
said. But it could inflict disproportionate psychological terror on
big-city transportation systems. "Is it going to kill many people?
No," said Mr. Leiter, the former counter-terrorism official. "Is it
going to be a big news story and is it going to scare some people?
Yes."

[A brief version of this article appeared on 14 Aug 2011 in The Times
of India:

We are coming up to the anniversary of "9/11." The serious terrorists
know that the US intelligence folk, and others, will be on high alert
and therefore they may well delay any anniversary celebration until
October or November. In the meanwhile dispersed Al Qaeda small cells
and trained lone wolves may well initiate their own attacks. Small and
with limited probability of success they will carry, when discovered,
a high propaganda value and cost to the targeted governments. The one
individual with explosives in his shoes initiated millions of dollars
in US protective responses, which is still costing us. We may never
lose the TSA. A ricin-bungler will have the same effect, whether or
not he or she causes any illness.

A major component of an effective counter-terrorism activities is an
aware public. The governmental intelligence agencies monitor many
things, but especially communication traffic and known individuals.
Expensive and time consuming. We know none of that but we will notice
the fellow acting strangely, the new neighbor with suspect purchases
(guns, ammunition, explosive powders), someone hanging around and
sussing out a possible target. Remember that an alert street vendor
was the 1st person to sound the alarm in the failed May 2010 Times
Square bombing attempt, and it was a concerned family member who
provided authorities with the information to thwart a planned November
2010 attack against a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,
Oregon. And it is better to catch an attack in development than to
deal with the effects however successfully afterwards. - Mod.MHJ]
