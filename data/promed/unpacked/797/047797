An Altoona horse barn is under quarantine for at least 2 weeks after a case of equine herpes virus was confirmed there Monday [25 Mar 2019].

Iowa state veterinarian Dr. Jeff Kaisand said his office has confirmed the presence of EHV, which is a neurological disease in horses that can damage blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord.

Kaisand said the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship cannot release the exact location.

EHV doesn't pose a threat to humans or other species of animals, Kaisand said. It's common in large horse populations and is spread through respiratory tract and nasal secretions. It also can be spread indirectly from horse to horse through inanimate objects like grooming equipment and wipe rags, as well as by human hands and clothing.

Most horses have been exposed to the virus at some point in their life, but most show no serious side effects, he said. The virus can be latent in the horse's body for many years.

"It's impossible to tell where the horse was exposed to the virus," Kaisand said in an email.

The owner of the stable will be responsible for notifying horse owners so they are aware of the quarantine order.

Quarantine procedure will require barn staff to check horses' temperatures 2x a day. If another horse spikes a fever, that horse will be removed from the herd and tested, and the 2-week quarantine will begin again.

Several strains of EHV exist. Vaccines are available to protect against strains EHV-1 and EHV-4.

[This article does not specifically tell us whether this is the respiratory form or the neurological form. The 1st paragraph suggests it is the neurological form of the disease, sometimes called equine herpes myeloencephalopathy or EHM.

A thorough explanation of EHV may be found in ProMED-mail post: Equine herpesvirus - North America: USA (05): USA (NV) horse 20190321.6380047.

From the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP):
None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of EHM by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy), the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
