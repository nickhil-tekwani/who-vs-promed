99/182 Update on the situation of _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. citri in
Florida (US) (edited)
At present, _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. citri (EPPO A1 quarantine pest)
occurs in Florida (US) in four areas: Collier, Dade and Broward, Hendry,
and Manatee counties. Once thought to have been eradicated, the pathogen
was again found in south Florida (Dade and Broward counties) in October
1995 (EPPO RS 95/228, 97/129). This area is mostly urban and virtually no
infection was detected in commercial orchards. Infestations were found on
an area of 676 square km. In May 1997, citrus canker was detected in
Manatee, essentially in commercial orchards. The infested area covers about
360 ha. In June 1998, it was found in Collier county (EPPO RS 98/160) in
commercial orchards, on an area of 74 ha. In February 1999, citrus canker
was detected in Hendry county on a area of approximately 97 ha, mainly in
commercial orchards. Intensive surveys are continuing in Florida to detect
all infected trees in commercial orchards, nurseries and their vicinity, as
well as in private gardens. Many infected trees and nearby trees have been
destroyed and measures are taken to prevent any further spread of citrus
canker.
