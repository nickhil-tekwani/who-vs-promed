[C] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - Multi-country outbreak
- Update 43 30 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_04_30/en/>
Situation in China: more cases than the rest of the world combined
Situation in China
China reported an additional 166 probable SARS cases with 11 deaths,
bringing the cumulative total to 3460 cases and 159 deaths. China now
accounts for more probable cases than the rest of the world combined.
Beijing reported the highest number of new cases (101) and deaths
(9), for a cumulative total of 1440 probable cases and 75 deaths. Of
these new cases, 31 were previously reported as suspect cases while
70 were reported for the first time.
9 hospitals in the Chinese capital now deal exclusively with SARS
patients. Just outside Beijing, a 1000-bed complex has been built to
accommodate incoming patients. Health authorities have expressed
concern that the SARS outbreak could overwhelm Beijing's already
crowded hospitals.
Xiong Ke Chest Hospital will open a new wing with 100 more beds for
SARS patients tomorrow, hospital officials told a WHO expert during a
visit to the hospital today. With 235 beds all occupied by SARS
patients, the hospital already has the largest number of SARS
patients in the country.
Dr James Maguire, from the WHO team of experts, said that despite
extremely difficult working conditions, hospital staff had risen to
the occasion. "Their esprit de corps is excellent. They are taking
great pride in what they are doing and working very hard," he said,
adding that some staff work 45 days without seeing their families.
The rigorous infection control procedures included heavy and hot
protective clothing.
Dr Maguire, an epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said there was a need for more
specialized equipment such as masks, gloves, ventilatory equipment,
layer protective gear, and ambulances to transport patients between
hospitals. WHO staff are aware that other hospitals in the city may
need more or better supplies.
The disease continued to make its mark elsewhere in the country.
Jiangsu Province, which borders Shanghai, reported its first case
today. More cases were reported in western China, with 34 more
probable cases from Shanxi and 7 more from Inner Mongolia, giving a
total of 299 and 127 probable cases respectively. One fifth of the
cases (65) in Shanxi Province are among health workers.
Hebei also continued to report more cases, with 9 more probable
cases, giving a total of 48. Tianjin reported 5 more probable cases
for a total of 49 cases, while Guangdong reported 6, for a total of
1405.
Update on countries and cases
As of today, a cumulative total of 5663 probable cases with 372
deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an
increase of 211 new cases and 19 deaths when compared with yesterday.
The new deaths were reported in China (11), Hong Kong SAR (7), and
China, Taiwan (1). This was the first death in Taiwan, where the
number of probable SARS cases has more than doubled, from 37 to 78,
over the past week. China, Macao SAR reported its first probable case
today.

SARS Situation Update 30 Apr 2003
Today, 2 more patients have been discharged, bringing the total
number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 141. 35 patients
remained hospitalised, of whom 15 are in intensive care. No new
probable cases were reported today.
There is one SARS death reported today, involving a 25-year-old male
foreign nurse from the Orange Valley Nursing Home. He was admitted to
[Tan Tock Seng Hospital] TTSH on 6 Apr 2003 as a probable case, in
view of the fact that he was a healthcare worker and may have come
into contact with a SARS patient.
Situation Update of Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market (PPWM)
5 suspected cases admitted in relation to the PPWM were discharged
today. They consist of one worker and 4 visitors to the market. In
addition, there was one death due to non-SARS cause involving a
82-year-old woman. She was a family member of a suspect SARS case.
There was one new suspect case, who was a visitor to the PPWM. To
date, there are 8 suspects related to the PPWM who are in hospital.
They include 7 visitors to the market and a family member.
Suspect SARS Patients
There were 17 patients who were admitted as new suspect cases today.
Of these, 13 had been on daily surveillance or home quarantine. The
remaining 4 included 2 travellers who travelled overseas, one visitor
to the PPWM during the period of 5 to 19 April 2003 and one where a
contact history has not been established yet.
2 other travellers were picked up through thermal scanning at the airport.
i. Passenger One who resides in Hongkong arrived in Singapore on
SQ859 at 5 pm on 27 Apr 2003. He was sent from the airport to TTSH,
where he was admitted. He has been classified as a suspect SARS case.
ii. Passenger 2 was in Shanghai for 3 weeks prior to his arrival in
Singapore on MU 545 at 9.04 pm on 25 Apr. He was picked up at the
Airport through thermal screening and was admitted to TTSH on the
same day. He is diagnosed as a suspect SARS case.
There had been another passenger, who had already been reported as a
probable SARS case on 26 Apr 2003. He is a Singaporean male who had
travelled to Jakarta on 18 Apr. His mother was admitted to TTSH on 19
Apr and diagnosed as a probable SARS case on 22 Apr. He returned to
Singapore on GA 828 on 22nd April at 5.40 pm. That night, he had a
fever. He was admitted to TTSH and was diagnosed to have probable
SARS on 26 Apr 2003.
Active contact tracing has been in progress for all 3 cases, and as a
precautionary measure, [health quarantine orders] HQOs are being
served to passengers on these 3 flights.
Quarantine Figures*
Discharged patients under home quarantine: 419**
PPWC Quarantine: 1946
Contacts under home quarantine: 525
Total under home quarantine orders: 2890
*Quarantine cases refer to those who are required to stay at home for
precautionary reasons as they may have had contact with a SARS
patient. These are healthy individuals.
** This is an added precautionary measure for discharged SARS
patients as well as those with co-morbidities.
Summary of SARS cases
Discharged: 141
Hospitalised: 35 (including 15 in intensive care)
Deaths: 24+1 (pending further post mortem test results)

Taiwan SARS Update(30 Apr 2003)
Several workers including foreign labors on a food production factory
in Taichung were excluded as SARS infection. However, those workers
were required to complete their home quarantine orders due to some of
them had influenza B virus tested positive. The company is allowed to
operate but Taiwan CDC reminds managers to watch for workers' health
and seek immediate medical services should symptoms arise.
Taiwan SARS case update
As of 3:00 PM 30 Apr 2003, there were 78 probable cases (25
discharged, 3 died), and 96 suspected cases (44 discharged). This
brings a total number of probable, suspected and pending cases to
389, and 74 of them were discharged while the remaining 315 cases are
still being cared for in negative pressure rooms.
3 deaths were attributed to SARS, 2 were from Hoping Hospital and one
was from China Medical College Hospital.
As of 2:00 PM 30 Apr 2003, a total of 4465 close contacts of probable
SARS cases had been assigned to home quarantine; 1844 of them have
completed their quarantines.
On 29 Apr 2003, 10 incoming passengers and 5 outbound passengers at
CKS International Airport had fever. They were not required for
further evaluation.

[The information on the identification of Influenza B activity in
factory workers is a reminder that there are other concurrent
outbreaks of acute respiratory illness that are occurring in Asia
(and elsewhere in the world). These other concurrent outbreaks may
very well be confounding variables for identifying SARS outbreak
related cases. - Mod.MPP]

Updated Interim Surveillance Case Definition for Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) --- United States, April 29, 2003
CDC's interim surveillance case definition for severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been updated to include laboratory
criteria for evidence of infection with the SARS-associated
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [see Figure and Box at website link provided
above]. In addition, clinical criteria have been revised to reflect
the possible spectrum of respiratory illness associated with
SARS-CoV. Epidemiologic criteria have been retained. The majority of
U.S. cases of SARS continue to be associated with travel*, with only
limited secondary spread to household members or health-care
providers (1).
SARS has been associated etiologically with a novel coronavirus,
SARS-CoV (2,3). Evidence of SARS-CoV infection has been identified in
patients with SARS in several countries, including the United States.
Several new laboratory tests can be used to detect SARS-CoV.
Serologic testing for coronavirus antibody can be performed by using
indirect fluorescent antibody or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
that are specific for antibody produced after infection. Although
some patients have detectable coronavirus antibody during the acute
phase (i.e., within 14 days of illness onset), definitive
interpretation of negative coronavirus antibody tests is possible
only for specimens obtained >21 days after onset of symptoms. A
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test
specific for viral RNA has been positive within the first 10 days
after onset of fever in specimens from some SARS patients, but the
duration of detectable viremia or viral shedding is unknown. RT-PCR
testing can detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens, including serum,
stool, and nasal secretions. Finally, viral culture and isolation
have both been used to detect SARS-CoV. Absence of SARS-CoV antibody
in serum obtained <21 days after illness onset, a negative PCR test,
or a negative viral culture does not exclude coronavirus infection.
Reported U.S. cases of SARS still will be classified as suspect or
probable; however, these cases can be further classified as
laboratory-confirmed or -negative if laboratory data are available
and complete, or as laboratory-indeterminate if specimens are not
available or testing is incomplete. Obtaining convalescent serum
samples to make a final determination about infection with SARS-CoV
is critical.
No instances of SARS-CoV infection have been detected in persons who
are asymptomatic. However, data are insufficient to exclude the
possibility of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV and the
possibility that such persons can transmit the virus. Investigations
of close contacts and health-care workers exposed to SARS patients
might provide information about the occurrence of asymptomatic
infected persons. Similarly, the clinical manifestations of SARS
might extend beyond respiratory illness. As more is learned about
SARS-CoV infection, clinical and laboratory criteria will provide a
framework for classifying the full spectrum of infection [see Figure
at website link provided above -- the figure divides cases by
clinical and laboratory criteria -- clinical criteria being mild
respiratory illness/asymptomatic, moderate respiratory illness
(suspected case)/, and severe respiratory illness (probable case);
the possible laboratory criteria are laboratory confirmed/
undetermined/ negative - Mod.MPP].
This surveillance case definition should be used for reporting and
classification purposes only. It should not be used for clinical
management or as the only criterion for identifying or testing
patients who might have SARS or for instituting infection-control
precautions (4,5). This definition will be updated as new data become
available or if changes in the epidemiology of SARS occur in the
United States.

The number of SARS cases in India doubled to 19 on Wednesday as 9
staff members of a hospital that treated an infected family came down
with the flu-like disease and another man tested positive after
visiting Singapore.
The 9 staff were among 22, including 3 doctors, of the Siddharth
Hospital in the western Indian city of Pune who quarantined
themselves in the hospital after it was shut down last week following
treatment of 4 infected family members. On Wednesday, a laboratory
test confirmed the 9 were carrying the SARS virus, said Sushil Kumar
Shinde, chief minister of Maharashtra state where Pune is located. A
second test is necessary for final confirmation. The hospital
director, however, said none of the nine were showing symptoms and
there was no risk of the virus spreading.
Earlier Wednesday, authorities had reported the country's 10th SARS
case, a man in the southern state of Tamil Nadu who returned from
SARS-hit Singapore last week.

[As of 30 Apr 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 5663
probable cases of SARS with 372 deaths reported to WHO. In the past
24 hours there have been 211 new cases reported of which 166 were
from China, 17 from Hong Kong SAR, 12 from Taiwan and 11 from the
USA. China continues to have increasing numbers of cases reported
both in Beijing and other provinces.
Since the last update, India, which had reported a single probable
case as of 21 Apr 2003 has been removed from the list. Today's news
had more reports of positive cases in India, as shown above, where
supposedly laboratory tests were positive for the SARS related virus
but in many cases the individuals were asymptomatic, or improved.
Official clarification of the situation in India would be appreciated.
The addition of laboratory results to the categories of case
reporting in the USA should provide more needed information on the
disease and allow for reviews of clinical/epidemiologic criteria
along with laboratory findings. We look forward to seeing
presentations of these data by the USA as they become available.
Today's press gave coverage to the ongoing international conference
on SARS in Toronto, with presentation by Dr. Plummer of the Canadian
Microbiology Laboratory findings that 40 percent of their probable
SARS cases are negative for the coronavirus, and 14 percent of
non-SARS (by clinical criteria) patients with history of exposure are
positive for the coronavirus. Clearly we await further details and
more data as they become available. - Mod.MPP]
