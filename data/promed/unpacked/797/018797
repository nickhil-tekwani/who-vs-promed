The Department of Health is today [Mon 8 Jan
2007] issuing the latest information about the
numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 5 Jan 2007
----------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 46
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 158
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 7
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 165
(The next table will be published on Mon 5 Feb 2007).
Since the previous monthly statistics were
released on Mon 4 Dec 2006, the total number of
deaths from definite vCJD remains unchanged and
stands at 158. The overall total number of
definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive)
has increased by one (surviving) individual and becomes 165.
These data are consistent with the view that the
vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline. The peak
number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, and 5 in 2006.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2006
-----------------------------------------------
As of Fri 5 Jan 2007, in the UK in the year 2006,
there were 106 referrals, 53 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 5 from familial CJD, 5 from variant CJD, 3
from GSS and one from iatrogenic CJD.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was 1st
diagnosed, up to the present, there have been 953
deaths from all forms of CJD including the 158
deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD.

[The Prion Disease Surveillance Data remains
essentially unchanged. Previously, the Moderator
noted an apparent inconsistency between the
national data and a figure circulated by the
Virginia Department of Health. The Virginia
Department of Health/CDC report cited above lists
3 cases -- 2 cases probably contracted in the
U.K. -- and the young adult described above who
was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. The EUROCJD
data for October 2006 in part (2) above also
lists 2 U.S. cases, both assumed to have been
contracted in the U.K. The U.S. National Prion
Disease Pathology Surveillance Center Data
published on 8 Nov 2006, on the other hand, lists
only a single U.S. case believed to have been
contracted in the U.K. The following
clarification has been provided by Ermias Belay of the CDC/CCID/NCZVED]:
The inconsistency noted by Mod.CP is appropriate,
but it stems from the fact that the EUROCJD data
is for October 2006 and was not updated to
include the 3rd U.S. vCJD case in a Saudi man
announced by CDC in November 2006. The data from
the U.S. National Prion Disease Pathology
Surveillance Center lists only cases confirmed by
the center. The only U.S. vCJD case tested at the
pathology center is the 1st U.S. case. The 2nd
case was tested and confirmed in England and the
3rd case was tested and confirmed by UCSF.
Incidentally, the 1st Saudi vCJD case was tested
and confirmed by the U.S. pathology center, but
the patient was never in the United States (hence
not attributed to the U.S.); brain biopsy tissue
was shipped to the U.S. by Saudi physicians.

[4] Prion reduction by blood filtration

Scientists hail blood filtration technique
-------------------------------------------
Scientists have found a way to remove
disease-causing proteins from infected animal
blood, which they hope may fight the human form
of mad cow disease. UK and US researchers
identified a molecule which removed the prion
proteins from blood infected with scrapie, the
Lancet reports. Scrapie, which can affect sheep,
is related to variant CJD. It is hoped the
technique could also treat human blood. But a
blood transfusion expert said it 1st had to be
properly assessed. Prion diseases, including
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- or mad
cow disease -- and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD), are fatal neurodegenerative
diseases that occur after years of incubation with no apparent symptoms.
In the UK, 3 people have died from vCJD after
receiving blood from donors who later went on to
develop the disease. Globally, there have been
200 cases of vCJD reported, 164 of which were in
the UK. The researchers, including scientists
from Cambridge University, suggest removing the
infectious ability of prions -- mis-formed
proteins -- might be one of the best ways of
reducing the risk of vCJD transmission through
blood. They screened millions of molecules and
found that one, called L13, binds prion protein
(PrP), removing it from the blood.
The team checked this by passing 500 ml of
scrapie-infected hamster blood through a filter
that removes white blood cells, something which
is done to all blood donated from transfusion in
the UK. When they injected the blood into 99
hamsters, 15 became infected with scrapie. But
when they passed treated blood through devices
containing the removal molecule and injected 96
hamsters with it, they found that none became
infected. L13 was also found to bind to PrP from
human infections of vCJD, suggesting that it may
also remove prion infectivity from human blood.
Dr. Robert Rohwer, from the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore, who was involved in the study, said:
"Removal of vCJD infectivity by adsorption gets
around the extremely difficult problem of
detecting the very low concentrations of these
agents in blood, especially during the long
asymptomatic period when people donate.
Writing in the Lancet, Marc Turner of the
Edinburgh Blood Transfusion Centre, said there
were concerns about how best to check whether the
technology worked, as there is nothing to compare
it against. There are also worries that passing
blood through filters may cause blood to be
caught up in the device and therefore lost, or
could alter the blood's properties. He added
that: "The UK and Irish Blood Services have
produced quality, efficacy and operational
specifications for such filters and are
considering an assessment program that will
include independent investigation of efficacy and
clinical safety studies. Until these technologies
can be clinically and operationally assessed, the
best protection against the uncertain risk of
transfusion-associated prion disease remains in
ensuring that blood products are used only if
needed and that the uncertainties surrounding
potential risks are communicated effectively to
patients and to the public at large."

[The Lancet paper which is the subject of this
report is entitled: "Reduction in infectivity of
endogenous transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies present in blood by adsorption
to selective affinity resins," authored by Luisa Gregor and 8 others,
<http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606698978/abstract>.
The Summary reads as follow:
"Background: Transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE) can be contracted through
blood transfusion. Selective adsorption of the
causative agent from donated blood might be one
of the best ways of managing this risk. In our
study, affinity resin L13, which reduces
brain-derived infectivity spiked into human red
blood cell concentrate by around 4 log10ID50, and
its equivalent, L13A, produced on a manufacturing
scale, were assessed for their ability to remove
TSE infectivity endogenously present in blood.
Methods: 500 ml of scrapie-infected hamster whole
blood was leucoreduced at full scale before
passage through the affinity resins. Infectivity
of whole blood, leucoreduced whole blood
(challenge), and the recovered blood from each
flow-through was measured by limiting dilution titration.
Findings: Leucoreduction removed 72 percent of
input infectivity. 15 of 99 animals were infected
by the challenge, whereas none of the 96 or 100
animals inoculated with the final flow-throughs
from either resin developed the disease after 540
days. The limit of detection of the bioassay was
0�2 infectious doses per ml. The overall
reduction of the challenge infectivity was more
than 1.22 log10ID. The results showed removal of
endogenous TSE infectivity from leucoreduced
whole blood by affinity ligands. The same resins
adsorb normal and abnormal prion protein from
human infections with variant, sporadic, and
familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in the presence of blood components.
Interpretation: TSE affinity ligands, when
incorporated into appropriate devices, can be
used to mitigate the risks from TSE-infected
blood, blood products, and other materials
exposed to TSE infectivity." - Mod.CP]

Transfusion risk analysis with regard to vCJD in France
-----------------------------------------------
(By M. Martin, J.-F. Legrasa, E. Pouchola and
J.-H. Trouvina (DEMEB, departement de
l'evaluation des produits biologiques, 143-147,
boulevard A.-France, 93285 Saint-Denis cedex, France)
ABSTRACT: The latest updates (February 2004 and
February 2005) of the analysis of the risk of
transmission of the agent of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) by blood and blood products in
France 1st reported in 2000, were triggered by
the 2 cases of probable transmission of variant
CJD (vCJD) by transfusion reported in the UK and
the notification of 2 French cases of vCJD who
had been blood donors on several occasions before
clinical onset. Even though some figures of the
quantitative assumption used in the risk analysis
have been modified since 2000, the conclusion as
regards the risk for blood cellular component is
considered unchanged: it can be assumed that one
unit of labile blood products will contain more
than one infectious unit if the donor is
incubating the disease. Therefore, the residual
risk of receiving by transfusion one infectious
blood unit is dependent on the prevalence of
subjects incubating the disease in the blood
donor population. For this particular aspect, the
expected number of clinical vCJD cases to occur
in France has been lowered since 2000. However,
the worst-case scenario of 300 cases in the next
60 years has been maintained in the risk
analysis, leading to the hypothesis that one
blood donor per 120 000 could be infectious. In
conclusion, the risk of getting one infectious
blood unit is considered probable to a level of
1/120 000, but the benefit outweighs the risk if
the use of transfusion is restricted to well
justified indications and if patients are informed a priori and a posteriori.

vCJD and blood transfusion: risk assessment in the United Kingdom
-----------------------------------------------
(By S.A. Dobra, a, and P.G. Bennettam Department
of Health, Wellington House, 133-155 Waterloo Rood, London SE1 8UG, UK)
ABSTRACT: The risk of vCJD transmission via blood
transfusion depends on potential levels of
infectivity, recipients' exposure to infected
donors and individual susceptibility. On
infectivity, SEAC (the UK's main scientific
advisory committee on TSEs), has published an
updated position statement. Based on animal
models, this suggests that infectivity is split
roughly equally between leucocytes and plasma,
with negligible levels directly associated with
red cells or platelets. Risk assessments are now
therefore based on the amounts of plasma and
leucocytes within each component as transfused.
Recipients' exposure to infection depends
critically on the prevalence of infection in the
population. This remains unknown, so a range of
assumptions must still be considered. A further
consideration is the likelihood of any infected
donors' blood being infective. Those infected in
the primary outbreak will now have been
incubating vCJD for 10-25 years. Current thinking
is that blood may be more infective later in the
incubation period. This reinforces the case for a
precautionary approach to transmission risks,
despite the small number of incidents seen so
far. Exposure will also depend on how many donors
contributed components to a given individual.
Recent work has shown that more patients receive
large numbers of units than previously thought.
These highly-transfused patients are a particular
cause for concern. The current precautionary
assumption is of all recipients being susceptible
to infection by transfusion, though incubation periods may differ markedly.
