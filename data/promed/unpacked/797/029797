Since there have recently been severe outbreaks of foot and mouth
disease [FMD] in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia,
there has been an impact on development of the livestock industry.
The Daqing area has been particularly hard hit, with severe losses of
dairy cows.

[The above translated excerpt of a local, Chinese corn market report
seems to be indicative of the actual situation of FMD in China.

China has reported to the OIE 3 outbreaks during 2010: A new outbreak
of FMDV serotype A in dairy cattle in a village in Daxing district,
Beijing, which reportedly was controlled by stamping out; and 2
outbreaks of FMDV serotype O, reported in early March 2010 (starting
in February) on 2 pig farms in Guangdong (one in Guangzhou, the 2nd
one in Shenzheng); both were reportedly controlled by stamping out.

During 2009, China reported 14 FMDV outbreaks which were declared
resolved. In November 2009, a notification of a new outbreak, caused
by FMDV serotype A, was sent to the OIE. It involved cattle in the
Changji Prefecture, Xinjiang and was followed by 2 additional
outbreaks in January 2010, similarly affecting cattle in Xinjiang:
one in Bayingolin Mongolia Autonomous Prefecture and the other one in
Baicheng county. This FMDV serotype A outbreak is currently defined
as "continuing;" (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8688>).

No information on cases in other provinces, including the ones
mentioned above, namely Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Inner
Mongolia, has become available during 2010. Since serotype O seems to
affect mainly swine, while serotype A seems to be bovine-adapted, it
may be assumed that the described outbreaks may have been caused, at
least in the Daqing area, by the latter; confirmatory information or
otherwise is requested. In case confirmed, details on the serotype
involved, species affected, measures applied and availability of
effective vaccine(s) are essential in a regional and international
context. - Mod.AS]
