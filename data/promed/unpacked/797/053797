Rio Grande do Norte investigates a yellow fever [YF] death - the 1st case in 73 years
------
The state Secretariat of Public Health of Rio Grande do Norte (SESAP) reported that this Tuesday (29 [Dec 2015]) they are investigating the death of a woman in July [2015] in Natal for which tests gave a positive result for yellow fever (YF). This case has attracted attention because the state is not classified as a YF risk area by the Ministry of Health and there have been no occurrences in the region. The victim had not traveled to YF-endemic areas [another hypothesis that always must be investigated is the possibility that this is a complication of a serious post-YF vaccination adverse effect. - Mod.RNA]

The tests [which ones? serological? virus isolation? PCR? immunohistochemistry? - Mod.RNA] that identified the disease were done by laboratories of the Instituto Evandro Chagas in Belem and in the Instituto Adolfo Lutz, in Sao Paulo. Both are national reference laboratories for testing of this type.

The victim was a nursing aid in RCSS and was 53 years old. She was hospitalized on 2 Jul [2015] and died 4 days later [due to clinical complications? - Mod.RNA]. The case is being jointly evaluated by the Natal Secretariat of Health and by the Ministry of Health. Both the state and the municipality request tests to confirm or reject the disease [diagnosis] [confirm or reject in another laboratory and not in the reference laboratories that provided positive results? confirm or reject by means of another laboratory technique? - Mod.RNA].

According to information from SESAP, the patient presented with symptoms similar to those of dengue or Zika [virus infections], but these 2 diseases were ruled out by laboratory tests. From then on, research on other viral diseases was initiated [based on the clinical picture or syndrome? - Mod.RNA], which culminated with finding the YF virus.

SESAP was intrigued with the case. "As of the present time, we still have not encountered a clear explanation for the initial results, since there is no history of patient travel to endemic areas and no other cases were detected in the [Natal] municipality," they stated.

With these questions, action to collect insects and biological materials from primates for virus investigation is being done [and active searching for other possible human cases? - Mod.RNA]. "One of the hypotheses is that the tests were positive due to the patient having been vaccinated against YF, even though decades have passed. [if the patient was in fact vaccinated sometime in the past, some protection would be expected. - Mod.RNA]. An investigation of her vaccination history is being done in health units, and the Ministry is aware of the possibility of conducting more detailed laboratory tests," it was stated [which tests? was a necropsy done? immunohistochemistry done? - Mod.RNA].

According to the Natal Secretariat of Health, routine and constant collection of _Aedes aegypti_ (the possible vector that transmits the disease [virus]) is carried out in Natal, and then tested for viruses, and there is no record of YF [virus detection].

The Ministry of Health was notified by the Rio Grande do Norte Secretariat of Health of a suspected case of yellow fever [YF] in the capital, Natal, near the Dunas Park. A brief accompanied the investigation and offered help to the state and municipality health secretariats in conducting [investigation] of the case.

The Ministry classifies the case as suspected until the investigations are concluded, but reiterates that there is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that there is YF transmission in the municipality, in view that in the last 6 months, have been no recorded cases.

Concerning this case under investigation, the patient's symptoms began (which were not compatible with those of YF) on 28 Jun 2015. It is worth repeating that the patient had no history of travel to a YF-endemic area. The results of the laboratory tests done by the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC), in Belem in Para, and confirmed by the Instituto Adolfo Lutz (IAL) in Sao Paulo, suggested infection by the YF virus. The Ministry of Health was informed of the results on 22 Dec [2015]. However, it is still necessary to investigate further.

It is important to emphasize that there has been, up to now, no other suspected cases in humans or in non-human primates confirmed in RN state, so that no evidence exists of transmission of the virus to humans in the Natal municipality since 1930.

In order to clarify the case, other measures are underway: epidemiological investigation (collection of insects and other biological materials from primates in order to search for virus); conduct of additional laboratory tests on samples that have already been collected.

YF is an acute infectious febrile disease transmitted by mosquitoes. In the American Continent, there are urban and sylvan transmission cycles. The urban cycle has people as the principal host, with _Aedes aegypti_ as the main vector. In the sylvan transmission cycle, monkeys are the principal host and the vectors are sylvan mosquito species of the genus _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_. The last cases of urban transmission in Brazil occurred in 1942 in Acre. Since then, all the registered cases have been of the sylvan transmission cycle. The Ministry of Health offers YF vaccinations free of charge in its One Health System. The vaccine is recommended within the routine of the National Calendar of the National Program of Immunizations to people living in areas recommended for [YF] vaccination and travelers who go to those areas.

[The time between the death and the notification of the Ministry of Health is worrisome. - Mod.RNA

The key question is whether this patient died of an infection by YF virus or of some other pathogen. Mod.RNA raises some important questions in the above reports. ProMED awaits further information about the additional testing as it becomes available, and if YF virus infection is confirmed, further information about the circumstances under which the infection was acquired. As long as there are abundant populations of _Aedes aegypti_, there is always the risk that a viremic individual can come into that locality and initiate ongoing YF virus transmission. However, the above report appears to exclude that possibility in the Natal case. - Mod.TY
