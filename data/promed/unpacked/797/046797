[H5N8 HPAI was first introduced into Eastern Europe in mid-October 2016; during the 2016-2017 winter and 2017 autumn seasons, it was detected in 30 of 43 European countries, particularly in Western and Eastern Europe. In 2019, the reported number of infections decreased drastically.

New introductions of HPAI H5N8, affecting poultry, have been recently reported from Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary, attributed to the virus being transmitted from wild migratory birds.

The causative pathogenic agent which may have caused a recent suspected disease event affecting broilers in Northern Ireland has not yet become available (see 20200108.6877259). - Mod.AS
