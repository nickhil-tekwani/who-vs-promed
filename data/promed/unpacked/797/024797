I agree that _B. recurrentis_ is the probable identification of the
_Borrelia_ in the Sudan epidemic. It should be noted that some past
epidemics have been associated with louse-borne typhus (_R. prowazekii_).
It is important to exclude this diagnosis because , if present, it would
influence the choice of antibiotic for treatment (chloramphenicol,
tetracycline or doxycyclin rather than a penicillin). After treatment,
observation of the patient is needed for a few hours because a
Jarish-Herxheimer type of reaction is extremely frequent in relapsing fever.
