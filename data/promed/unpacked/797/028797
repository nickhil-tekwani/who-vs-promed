A local source inside Al-Hol camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians, confirmed on [Mon 19 Mar 2018] the spread of typhoid fever among the internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in the camp, which is located east of Al-Hasakah.

The source, who preferred not to be named, said: "269 persons, mostly women and children, are infected with the disease due to water, which is not suitable for drinking and use." The source pointed to the existence of a state of fear and panic among the residents of the camp, especially after the complaint of many IDPs and refugees that the water brought by the tankers to the camp's tanks is dirty, and smells like sewage.

The source said that an expanded meeting is under way with the participation of the administration of Al-Hol camp, the humanitarian organizations, the Kurdish Red Crescent, and the health centers in the camp.

Al-Hol camp, located 70 km (approx. 43 mi) east of Al-Hasakah, is home to 16 194 people -- Iraqi refugees and Syrian IDPs -- who have fled the [so-called] Islamic State (ISIS) during the years of control over large parts of western Iraq and eastern and central Syria.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is often reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly [both liver and spleen enlarged]. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
