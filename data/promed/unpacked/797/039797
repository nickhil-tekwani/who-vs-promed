Owston's palm civets in national park die of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------------
Five Owston's palm civets, which are named in the Red Book of Viet Nam, are
reported dead because of bird flu in the Cuc Phuong National Park.

From 2 Feb to 2 Mar 2008, 5 Owston's palm civets (_Chrotogale owstoni_), 2
common palm civets, 5 peewit hoopie birds, 2 langurs, and one loris have
died. Independent tests performed by the HCM (Ho Chi Minh) City Tropical
Hospital and the Central Veterinary Diagnosis Centre show that the 5
Owston's palm civets died because of H5N1 virus, said Nguyen Van Cam,
director of the Central Veterinary Diagnosis Centre. The park's animal
preservation area currently has 8 Owston's palm civets and a black civet.

Cam said wild birds and mice could enter the cages of these civets and
transmitted H5N1 virus to them. The sources of food for civet are worms,
fresh beef, and poultry meat bought from outside [which] could also bear virus.

To protect the remaining civets and other species of animals in the park,
the Central Veterinary Diagnosis Centre will conduct bird-flu tests on the
8 civets. The park management board has tightened control of disease in the
park and carried out some measures to protect animals.

In June-July 2005, at least 3 Owston's palm civets in the Cuc Phuong
national park were reported dead because of H5N1. At that time, the case
was considered mysterious because the dead civets lived in the same cage
with 20 other healthy civets. Moreover, they ate pork, worms, and fruits,
not chicken.

Owston's palm civet is a civet that lives in the forests and wooded lowland
river basins of northern Viet Nam, northern Laos, and southern China. It
feeds mostly on earthworms and other invertebrates. The mating season is
apparently in late January. After a gestation period of 3 months, a litter
of 1-3 young are born.

In Viet Nam's Red Book, Owston's palm civet is named among species in risk
of extinction, which are banned from trade.

[The newswire above adds some background to yesterday's (11 Mar 2008)
initial report on Viet Nam's civet cases (item 3 in ProMED-mail posting
20080311.0982), including suspected routes of the virus introduction and a
photo of Owston's palm civet in the Cuc Phuong National Park, which
interested subscribers can see at the source URL above. As in the 1st
report, however, clinical signs and/or pathological changes are not
included. Such data might be helpful in confirming the cause of death.

For further information on avian influenza in civets, readers are referred
to the paper: SI Roberton, DJ Bell, GJD Smith, et al. Avian influenza H5N1
in viverrids: implications for wildlife health and conservation. Proc R Soc
B 2006; 273: 1729-32, published online 18 April 2006 and available (free)
at
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1634780&blobtype=pdf>.

Its abstract says: "The Asian countries chronically infected with avian
influenza A H5N1 are 'global hotspots' for biodiversity conservation in
terms of species diversity, endemism, and levels of threat. Since 2003,
avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have naturally infected and killed a range
of wild bird species, 4 felid species, and a mustelid. Here, we report
fatal disseminated H5N1 infection in a globally threatened viverrid, the
Owston's civet, in Viet Nam, highlighting the risk that avian influenza
H5N1 poses to mammalian and avian biodiversity across its expanding
geographic range." - Mod.AS]
