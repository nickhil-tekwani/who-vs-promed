A 6-year-old Eustis boy reportedly died of rabies [Sun 14 Jan 2017] at an Orlando hospital after being scratched by a sick bat that Lake county officials said had been living in his home.

[HR] confirmed his son's death to NBC News after previously telling the "Today" show that [the boy] became infected when the bat scratched him.

Lake county deputies responded to the Eustis home about 2 weeks ago after they were told the family's pit bull may have had rabies. When they arrived, somebody told them the residents were at the hospital with their son, who had been scratched by a bat, sheriff's Maj. Chris Delibro said.

"We're told the bat had been in the house for a week or 2 prior to the boy going to the hospital," Delibro said.

During that time, authorities said the bat may have come in contact with the dog.

Deputies didn't see the bat, but they took the pit bull and a cat to the Sheriff's Office's animal shelter for testing. Delibro did not know the results of the tests.

[HR] said in an interview with the "Today" show that he found the sick bat and put it in a bucket. He told [the boy] not to touch it, but he did and was scratched, the father told the show.

After the scratch, [HR] said in the interview, he washed the wound but didn't take [the boy] to the hospital because the boy cried when he was told he would need shots.

About a week later, the 6-year-old complained of a headache and numbness in his fingers. Then the family took him to the hospital, but reportedly it was too late for him to receive shots.

"That's my buddy, he's my boy, he's my everything," [HR] said in the "Today" interview. "He tells all his friends 'My daddy will fix anything.' I can't fix that. I've never loved anything or anybody so much in my life. Ever."

Attempts by the Orlando Sentinel to reach the family weren't successful, but a GoFundMe page raising money for medical expenses said [Mon 15 Jan 2018], "We are so sad to say that [the boy] lost his fight last night... our little baby is now an angel."

Rabies deaths in the United States are rare, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 2008 and 2017, only 23 cases have been reported, and the number of deaths blamed on the disease has declined since the 1970s, according to the agency.

Most rabies hosts are wild carnivores and bats.

Orange County Health Department spokesman Kent Donahue said people should avoid touching wildlife. "If you believe you may have been exposed to rabies, contact your health care provider and your county health department immediately," Donahue said in an email. "If an exposure occurred, it is important to administer treatment right away."

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, being infections almost always fatal, unless treated.

Some months ago, a rabid child from Dominican Republic was saved by a treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol. The Milwaukee protocol, sometimes referred to as the Wisconsin protocol, is an experimental course of treatment of an infection of rabies in a human being. The treatment involves putting the patient into a chemically induced coma and administering antiviral drugs.

It was developed and named by Rodney Willoughby, Jr, following the successful treatment of Jeanna Giese. Giese, a teenager from Wisconsin, became the 1st patient known to have survived rabies without receiving the rabies vaccine. - Mod.PMB
