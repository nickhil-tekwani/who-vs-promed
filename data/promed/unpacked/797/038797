[The 68 new confirmed and 731 suspected cases indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is increasing fairly rapidly as Nigeria enters the new period of the year, when more cases usually occur as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There are 51 confirmed deaths, up from 12 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, 4 new healthcare workers in Edo state were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 19 states (up from 16 in a previous reporting period) and 51 LGAs (up from 40 in the previous reporting period).

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts of their excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY
