Q fever found in Luxembourg flocks
----------------------------------
A [bacterium] which could prove fatal to certain livestock has been
found in 2 goat farms in Luxembourg.

Luxembourg's veterinary services has conducted regular tests in goat
farms in the Grand Duchy since the last outbreak of Q fever in Holland
in 2009.

Today (Wed 17 Aug 2011) it announced that it had found 2 separate
outbreaks in smallholdings in the country.

Since the discovery, emergency procedures have been carried out to
prevent any further spread, by limiting access to the farms in
question, and disposing correctly of animal by-products and dead
livestock.

The animals have also been vaccinated and their milk pasteurised
before being sold on the market.

Q fever is a disease caused by infection with the _Coxiella burnetii_
bacterium, which can affect humans and other animals. Infection occurs
through inhaling the spores and from contact with milk, urine, or
feces of infected animals.

It can cause miscarriages in livestock and, if transferred to humans,
it causes flu-like symptoms. Contamination is not possible by eating
infected animals alone. The incubation period of the bacterium is 9 to
40 days.

[It may be assumed that the identification of Q fever in Luxembourg's
goats does not mean a 1st introduction but reflects intensified
surveillance. Has this been a clinical disease (abortions/milk
contamination) or rather an odd positive serological finding?

The following information on the Q fever situation in Luxembourg is
available in OIE's WAHID interface:
2007: never reported (0000), not notifiable
2008: never reported (0000), not notifiable
2009: confirmed infection (no clinical disease), not notifiable
2010: confirmed infection (no clinical disease), not notifiable.

It will be interesting to note if Q fever vaccination has been applied
also in other (adjacent?) goat or sheep farms in Luxembourg. In case
officially confirmed, a notification to the OIE may be expected.-
