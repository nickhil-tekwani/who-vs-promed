[Now that the West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to CDC
through ArboNET are appearing weekly in MMWR (see part 7 below),
ProMED-mail will no longer provide abstracted information from the USGS
West Nile virus maps. A summary map of the current situation is reproduced
in MMWR, and the more detailed USGS maps, down to county level in some
categories, can be accessed via
<http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov>
for anyone requiring such detailed information.
Now that the 2003 West Nile virus season is in full swing, only extensions
of West Nile virus geographic range or host species, and exceptional items,
will be posted separately from these weekly updates. - Mod.CP]

Possible Consequences of Power Supply Failure
---------------------------------------------
It will be interesting to monitor new human case reports of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection over the next week or so to see whether there is a dramatic
increase in cases from the areas affected by the failure of the US-Canadian
electrical grid on 14 Aug 2003. Of particular interest will be the New
York City (NYC) metropolitan area where, due to high temperatures, large
numbers of people spent the evening hours outdoors, or perhaps in rooms
with open, unscreened windows. Given the fact that WNV-positive mosquito
pools have been reported from all boroughs of NYC, a significant number of
individuals may have placed themselves at risk of infection. Although it is
probably not feasible to structure a formal epidemiological study of this
event, it will be instructive to see whether a "spike" in WNV human illness
does occur. Perhaps we can get a qualitative notion of how much an
air-conditioned environment shields individuals from vector-borne infections.

Colorado: 8th West Nile Virus Death Reported
-----------------------------------------------
A 79-year-old woman has died from West Nile virus infection, putting
Colorado's death toll from the mosquito-borne epidemic at 8, the highest in
the United States, officials said on Fri 22 Aug 2003. The 8 deaths are
among 638 human cases of West Nile virus infection reported in Colorado in
2003. So far all the deaths in Colorado in 2003 have been among elderly women.
On Thu 21 Aug 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
presented Colorado officials with a $500 000 check to fight the epidemic.
The disease was imported into the United States in 1999 and arrived in
Colorado in 2002. The 2nd year of the disease tends to be much tougher
because birds, which are infected and spread the disease, have not yet
developed an immunity.

Wyoming: 2 West Nile Virus Deaths; 30 New Cases Identified in State
--------------------------------------------------
An elderly man and woman in Platte County were the first 2 people in
Wyoming to be killed by West Nile virus, the state Department of Health
announced on Fri 22 Aug 2003. The Department also said 30 new West Nile
cases had been confirmed by the state Public Health Laboratory, bringing
the total number of human cases in Wyoming in 2003 to 89.
[In the CDC-ArboNET report for Fri 29 Aug 2003, reproduced below, the
number of confirmed cases in Wyoming is given as 31, with no deaths. - Mod.CP]

North Dakota: Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection Cases Reach 36
---------------------------------------------------------------------
State health officials say the number of confirmed cases of West Nile virus
infection in humans has risen to 36 in North Dakota. The Health Department
says the number has increased by 20 since Wed 20 Aug 2003. One death has
been attributed to West Nile virus infection in North Dakota so far in
2003. The 83-year-old man resided in La Verne, California, and died on 13
Aug 2003. He had been camping in North Dakota. West Nile virus infection
affected 17 people in North Dakota during the summer of 2002, including 2
who died. It also affected hundreds of horses. So far in 2003, it has been
found in 27 horses.

Arizona: 1st Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection Travel Related
--------------------------------------------------
State health officials today reported an increase in West Nile virus
activity, including the first case of an Arizona resident contracting the
virus in 2003. The adult male, a resident of Graham County, likely
contracted the disease while visiting Colorado or Wyoming, states with
considerable West Nile virus activity.
Also, a 3rd horse has tested positive for West Nile virus in Arizona. The
equine case was reported in Navajo County, approximately halfway between
Winslow and Joseph City. This case represents the first West Nile
virus-positive report for Navajo County. The first 2 equine cases were
reported in Apache County, in the Nazlini and Many Farms areas.
2 more mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile virus in Cochise
County. These new samples were collected in the San Simon area, where West
Nile virus was first detected in a mosquito pool earlier in August 2003. In
addition, 3 mosquito pools from Yuma County and 2 mosquito pools from
Graham County were confirmed positive today for West Nile virus.
To bolster the state's West Nile virus surveillance efforts, the Arizona
Department of Health Services has issued an emergency order making West
Nile virus a reportable disease. Under the order, a physician or an
administrator of a health care facility is required to submit a
communicable disease report of a case or a suspect case of West Nile within
24 hours of diagnosis to the local health agency. Additionally, clinical
laboratories are required to report to the Department.

United States: West Nile Virus Activity; Thu 21 to Wed 27 Aug 2003
---------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET as of 3 a.m., Mountain Daylight Time, Wed 27 Aug 2003.
Weekly update
-------------
During the reporting week of 21 to 27 Aug 2993, a total of 727 human cases
of WNV infection were reported from 26 states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming), including 7 fatal cases from 5 states
(Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, and South Dakota). During the
same period, WNV infections were reported in 817 dead birds, 207 horses, 5
unidentified species, and 683 mosquito pools.
Cumulative totals - Human
-------------------------
During 2003, a total of 1442 human cases of WNV infection have been
reported from Colorado (n = 635), South Dakota (n = 204), Nebraska (n =
190), Texas (n = 106), New Mexico (n = 41), Wyoming (n = 31), Louisiana (n

[The single human case reported in Arizona is considered by the state
authorities to be travel-related; see (4) above.
It is striking that so far there has been a dearth of reports of human and
equine cases (and to a lesser extent, dead birds) from the northeastern
states (see the USGS maps), the original focus of the West Nile virus
outbreak. The states reporting the highest number of cases are at the
current periphery of the outbreak (Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, Texas,
Louisiana, et al., and in Canada the prairie provinces). Some western
states are reporting a high number of human cases on the basis of detection
of virus in asymptomatic blood donors. This suggests that West Nile virus
infection of the human population is considerably more extensive than the
detection of symptomatic cases would suggest.
One interpretation of these observations might be that the spread of West
Nile virus across North America has left behind a human population
possessing a certain degree of immunity. If the same reasoning applies to
the avian population, this might also influence the vector and as a
consequence influence the pattern of the outbreak. In this respect, it is
interesting that data published recently on antibody levels in resident and
migratory avian species in the UK -- where there has been no confirmed case
of human West Nile virus infection -- suggest that there is widespread
non-lethal West Nile virus infection of birds in southern Britain. An
alternate view might be that the current distribution of human and equine
cases reflects the north-south migratory movement of birds in North
America. - Mod.CP]
