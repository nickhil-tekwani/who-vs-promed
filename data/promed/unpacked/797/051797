Five people have been sickened by _E. coli_ after eating at Mama Nita's Binalot restaurant in southeast Edmonton, Alberta Health Services said on Thu 29 Mar 2018.

While the health authority has yet to pinpoint the source of the bacterium, officials are warning anyone who has dined at the restaurant since 15 Mar 2018 to see a doctor if they have symptoms and also to mention that they may have been exposed to _E. coli_.

The 5 sick patrons all ate at the restaurant within the same time frame but were not part of the same group and did not have the same meals, AHS medical officer of health Dr. Jasmine Hasselback said. "We don't have any other linkages, so we are still asking a lot of questions," she said.

Health inspectors visited Mama Nita's on Tue 27 Mar 2018, and the operators are cooperating, Hasselback said. The restaurant has remained open during the investigation. AHS restaurant inspection records show Mama Nita's has been cited for 8 violations during the last 2 years, including improperly leaving meat at room temperature, dirty cloths and sponges in the kitchen, and a lack of hand-washing materials.

However, Hasselback said every restaurant tends to have room for improvement, and Mama Nita's has been generally compliant with regulations. "They do have what we would consider reasonable standards that are being met," she said. "Of course, as this evolves, (closing the establishment) is always an action that can be taken. But at this time, I do not believe there is sufficient risk that has not been appropriately mitigated to justify closing the restaurant."

Lab tests confirmed the 5 patrons were infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7, which can cause diarrhea that may be bloody. In a small proportion of cases, the bacterium can lead to severe symptoms such as kidney failure. In this case, none of the 5 patients has required a hospital stay or shown signs of complications, AHS said.

_E. coli_ infections are typically caused by consuming food or drink contaminated with human or animal feces, or by direct contact with infected people or animals. Symptoms can occur up to 10 days after eating contaminated food and usually go away on their own within 10 days.

Hasselback said improperly cooked beef and pork are common culprits for such infections, although fresh produce can also sometimes carry the bug. She said stocks of food that were served at the time patrons got infected can't be tested, because the restaurant has used it all up.

Public health officials are now working with staff to improve their hand hygiene, re-educate workers on food safety, and monitor food-handling processes, she said. As well, Mama Nita's staff have been asked to submit stool samples to determine whether a worker has been carrying the bacterium. A spokesperson for the restaurant could not be reached for comment.
