[According to the Saudi MOH website, there have been 396 laboratory-confirmed infections with MERS-CoV, including 111 deaths in Saudi Arabia. In today's (3 May 2014) update, there is a correction to the figures reported in the 25 Apr 2014 update, adding 2 additional deaths.

The daily summaries on the MOH website contain graphic representations of the numbers of cases by type of health facility, gender distribution, age distribution and pre-existing health conditions (co-morbidities vs. without any known co-morbidities). There is also a map showing the geographic distribution of cases reported in each daily summary update. Readers can see these assessments by going to the source URLs provided with each specific report.

Summarizing the 25 newly laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals, they include information on a total of 7 asymptomatic individuals who were found to be MERS-CoV infected as part of contact tracing activities. Of these 25 newly laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals, none are specifically mentioned to be health care workers (HCWs), although social media discussions have mentioned that 2 of these individuals were/are HCWs: 17 of the 25 cases were hospitalized in public hospitals, 3 in private hospitals and 5 were being followed under "home isolation." 14 of the 25 had known pre-existing co-morbidities, while 11 did not and were considered healthy. Of the 25 newly confirmed infections, 4 were admitted to hospitals for illness related to their co-morbidities and later developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection, and an additional 2 were specifically mentioned to have had contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals.

There are still many questions on the natural history and epidemiology of MERS-CoV infections. It would be of interest to know

- what proportion of earlier reported asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individuals remained asymptomatic throughout the accepted incubation period, and

- what proportion of the asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individuals developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV clinical disease later on during the accepted incubation period.

As mentioned previously, information on the natural history of MERS-CoV infection is sparse at this time.

- Are asymptomatic infected individuals shedding infective doses of virus and serving as efficient transmitters of the virus to their contacts?

- Is transmission occurring through droplet and airborne infection alone, or are there fomites on surfaces that serve as transmission routes?

- Are camel products (raw meat, milk, urine) related to routes of transmission (are there high viral loads in these products) or

- Are aerosolized nasal and oropharyngeal secretions the route of transmission?

The list of questions is much longer than the few mentioned above....
