Re: CDC report:
>Since Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in May,
1993, 177 U.S. case-patients from 29 states have been laboratory confirmed
by CDC and have been added to the national HPS registry. Of these 177, 39
were identified retrospectively, with onset of illness prior to May, 1993....
[I asked Brian Hjelle to comment on how the case count from Latin America
compares. He indicated that he believes there have been more than 130 in
Argentina since the 1980s, close to 30 from Chile, and at least 34 from
Paraguay, plus more in Brazil and Uruguay and possibly one in Bolivia. This
would bring the total to over 200, but PAHO would have the correct numbers.
He contributed the commentary below - Mod.JW
The US cases continue to occur sporadically. The sole US outbreak occurred
in the Four Corners region in 1993-94, and was attributed to increased
precipitation caused by two successive El Ninos in 1991-92 and 1992-93. Any
effects of the current El Nino on US rodent populations would not be
expected to be manifest before spring. In South America the effects of El
Nino on rodent populations are apparent much more immediately.
Since the US cases are sporadic and occur over a huge geographic area, most
are treated by physicians with little or no prior experience with the
syndrome. The diagnosis of HPS is often delayed until late in the course of
disease, too late to arrange proper triage and treatment. What is needed is
a rapid diagnostic test that can be used by the clinics and hospitals to
which the patients are first referred. Only then can patients be referred
early in their course of disease to hospitals with state-of-the-art
intensive care units or to those approved for the placebo-controlled
ribavirin clinical trial. Although it is clear that an accurate and simple
test could be manufactured, there is none on the immediate horizon.
Despite the continued difficulty in identifying HPS early in the course of
disease, the case-fatality ratio is improving. An increasing fraction of
patients are being identified who never require mechanical ventilation.
These changes are almost certainly due to improved recognition of
clinically mild presentations compared to the 1993-1995 period.
In contrast to US cases, South American cases are much more likely to be
clustered in families. Thus there continue to be familial clusters in
Argentina and Chile, but none of the recent clusters can be clearly be
linked to interpersonal transmission, as was observed in the 1996-97 summer
outbreak in Argentina.
