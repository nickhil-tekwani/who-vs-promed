[Before anyone is tempted to cast retrospective aspersions on the UK
Government veterinarians, as this journalist does, just stop and think -
there but for the grace of God go I. Nothing is ever as clear at the time
as it is later. For clarity I have run two Telegraph articles together, and
removed redundancies and wild statements. - MHJ]

The Ministry of Agriculture has always said the first case was confirmed in
November 1986 in Kent by the Central Veterinary Laboratory. But Government
experts had discovered the disease more than a year earlier, one of a
number of oversights detailed in a four part BBC2 series, Mad Cows and
Englishmen, starting on Sunday. [This is being shown in the USA starting
this coming Wednesday.]
A post mortem report by Carol Richardson, from the Central Veterinary
Laboratory, dated Sept 19 1985, reveals how she had seen spongiform
encephalopathy in brain tissue from a Fresian [cow] from Peter Stent's farm
near Midhurst, West Sussex. She said seven others had earlier been lost
with "nervous" symptoms. A vet, David Bee, had seen the first cases before
Christmas 1984.
The events began on Dec 22, 1984, when David Bee, a vet in Petersfield,
Hants, was contacted by Peter Stent, a farmer, after one of his dairy cows
began behaving strangely and did not respond to treatment.
"She'd lost weight. She was looking unwell and her back was up in the air,"
said Mr Bee. On routine visits to the Pitsham Farm in West Sussex, he found
it "really spooky" when he noticed that the problem was spreading to other
cows. The original cow was by then worse, showing head tremor. It died the
next February [1985]. The vet followed a number of leads without success,
dubbing it "Pitsham Farm Syndrome". By then, Mr Stent had lost nine cows
and had become desperate, taking the 10th victim to the local ministry
laboratory.[Veterinary Investigation Centre, Winchester]
The head was sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge,
Surrey, where its brain was examined by Ms Richardson. She said: "My
specialisation is foetal pathology but in September 1985 I acted as a duty
pathologist." She can still remember that it was a "nice sunny day" when,
on Sept 19, 1985, she looked into a microscope and saw tiny holes, or
vacuolations, in stained sections of the cow brain, a feature that she had
seen many times before in sheep affected by scrapie.
"What was exciting was that this was in a cow," she said. "This was the
first time I had seen these lesions in a cow." She took the slides to a
colleague. "He agreed with me that it was a case of bovine scrapie, which
he had never seen before." Her colleague thought that the senior
neuropathologist, Dr Gerald Wells, had seen similar cases. Dr Wells was
away that day. However, his corrections to her post mortem report
reinforced her diagnosis. He changed her diagnosis from "mild" to
"moderate" vacuolation, on first examining the pathology slides. He told
the programme that he did not make the connection with the sheep spongiform
disease. The problem was put down to toxic poisoning. No reference to this
outbreak was [later] made by Dr Wells and his colleagues in Weybridge when
they published the first description of the symptoms and pathology of an
outbreak in Ashford at the end of October 1987 in the Veterinary Record.
[Soon after this initial case] Ms Richardson went on maternity leave,
assuming that the [Stent] matter was being investigated and believed that
Dr Wells had already seen similar cases. But at a Christmas party, after Dr
Wells reported the first official case in November 1986, she was told that
she had seen the first case of BSE. In July 1988, Ms Richardson left the
Central Veterinary Laboratory.
No reference to this outbreak was made by Dr Gerald Wells and colleagues at
the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Surrey when they published the first
description of the symptoms and pathology of the Kent case in Oct 1987 in
The Veterinary Record.
A letter to the laboratory from the Veterinary Investigation Centre near
Winchester [see Wilesmith's letter above] in June 1987 also referred to the
Carol Richardson case and to another from the same farm a year later.
The first case officially noted followed a report from Colin Whitaker, a
vet from Ashford [Kent], puzzled by strange behaviour in the dairy herd at
Plurenden Manor Farm that dated back to April 1985. When Mr Whitaker
described the cases to a meeting in London, Mr Bee realised that it was the
same disease that had been diagnosed as cow scrapie by Carol Richardson.
Dr Wells had even reviewed and amended her "cow scrapie" report, first
within a few days of it being written and then in June, 1987. But he made
no reference to it in his Veterinary Record paper, even though her report
referred to "neuronal vacuolation" in the midbrain and brain stem that is
typical of scrapie in sheep and the disease we now call BSE. With
hindsight, he told the BBC2 programme, the Stent cases were the first
investigated but he said he lacked information to put the findings into
context.
Nine months later a nyala antelope died of spongiform disease. The findings
were reported but it took the chief veterinary officer 18 months to clear
the article [for publication].
In recent research, Prof Roy Anderson of Oxford University found evidence
that people were exposed to the disease as early as 1980. Up to 54,000
infected animals were slaughtered for human consumption between 1980 and
1985.
The new evidence on the first case will be submitted to the BSE public
inquiry, which began on Jan 27 and will report in March. Ms Richardson, 56,
has two sons and a daughter. She now lives near Woking with her husband,
John, and 10-year-old daughter. She continues to eat beef, and said: "I
insist now that we have only British beef." ***
[First, I must declare an interest ... on January 1st 1967 I became a
member of the CVL Department of Pathology & Epidemiology; they were
pathology, I was epidemiology. Ever since I have always judged other
pathologists by my then colleagues, Jack Done, Lionel Markson, Stanley
Terleki, David Harding, Tony Wrathall, Carol Richardson, & Ray Bradley and
found the world wanting; well, maybe Bob Barlow's group at the Mordun could
match us if the sun was shining up there.
Secondly, I have known of this early case for a number of years, as I
presume have others. It was there in the department records with the tissue
blocks.
Thirdly, how do you judge the start of an _epidemic_ of a new disease? One
case does not an epidemic make. For example, who remembers "Rocking Horse"
lambs, well described by Rowlands at Bangor VIC in the 1950s literature,
never seen since. There has to be the recognition of a pattern of excess
cases.
Fourthly, the background. In the "old days" there were VICs at Wye (Kent)
and at Weybridge but the latter had been shut down by 1984; Weybridge VIC
was responsible for West Sussex & Surrey, and Wye for Kent & East Sussex.
The Weybridge VIC was within the CVL buildings and worked intimately with
the CVL departments and staff. Early studies, when I was designing VIDA,
showed that farm proximity to a VIC ensured submission of samples and the
closer the farm the larger the tissue submitted and in better condition. If
a condition was not a notified disease it didn't have to be reported to the
local DVO by the farmer or his veterinarian; note above that Stent's vet
had been struggling, apparently alone, with this disease from December 1984
until September 1985. If there were other cases seen by other VICs, the
disease coding within VIDA II made them invisible if the disease did not
have a specific code other than "999" for "all other conditions". A
subcoding system has never been developed to pick up unusual conditions;
the original VIDA used the exact but clumsy SNVDO system, which delayed
reporting. Thus, analysis of VIDA reports would not have thrown up any
other cases even if they had been seen at other VICs doing their own
histopathology.
