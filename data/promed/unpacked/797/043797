European regulators cleared Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE's COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12-15, preparing the way for mass inoculations of younger teenagers across the continent. The green light from the European Medicines Agency [EMA] gives Europe, whose immunization campaign was initially fraught with difficulties, the 1st vaccine in its arsenal for younger adolescents. The shot was already cleared for people as young as 16.

"It's an important step in the fight against the pandemic," Marco Caveleri, the regulator's head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, said on Friday [28 May 2021]. The UK also added to its arsenal on Friday [28 May 2021]. It cleared a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, the 1st single-dose shot to be authorized in Britain against the disease.

At the EMA, Caveleri said while trials raised no major concerns about usage on younger teens, the vaccine will have to be monitored once deployed in case of any rare adverse effects. The dose for 12-15-year-olds will be the same as that given to adults, and it will be up to individual countries to decide whether to use it on that age group.

Germany, Europe's largest economy, has already outlined plans to inoculate younger teens and will expand immunizations to those 12 and older starting 7 Jun [2021]. Europe follows US regulators, who authorized the vaccine for young teens earlier this month [May 2021]. President Joe Biden has since asked states to make shots available immediately to help children return to schools and summer camps safely.

New York-based Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech said in March [2021] that their 2-shot Comirnaty-branded vaccine was 100% effective in the 12-15 age group in a final-stage trial. The shot produced antibodies exceeding the level in vaccinated young adults and didn't result in any new or worrisome side effects.

The 27-nation EU is relying on Pfizer and BioNTech to help it accelerate an immunization campaign that still lags behind the UK and US, even after gaining ground in recent weeks. The bloc has committed to buying another 1.8 billion doses from the partners through 2023, some of which will be used for children.

"Now we have data that show the vaccine is safe also in the age of 12-15 years," Cavaleri said. "It will be up to each individual member state to decide if and when to use the vaccine in adolescents in the future."

He added that he expects Moderna Inc. to seek authorization to use its shot for teens soon. On the timing of possible approval for CureVac NV's vaccine, he said the EMA is awaiting the results of trials before it can give a more precise timeframe.

[1B] COVID vaccine in teens
Date: Thu 27 May 2021

https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/92821?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2021-0528&eun=g1462072d0r&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Top%20Cat%20HeC%20%202021-05-28&utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition


Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine was safe and effective in adolescents, with non-inferior immunogenicity compared with a sample of younger adults, according to the 1st data on the vaccine in this population published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Among adolescents ages 12-15 without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, observed vaccine efficacy was 100% at 7 days following the 2nd dose (95% CI 75.3%-100%), with 16 cases in the placebo group and zero in the vaccine group, reported Alejandra Gurtman, MD, of Pfizer in Pearl River, New York, and colleagues.

Moreover, the safety profile was similar to that seen in younger adults, with participants reporting transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity, including injection site pain, fatigue, and headache, the authors wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine [see below]. Immunogenicity was non-inferior among the adolescents compared with a sample of individuals ages 16-25, the team added.

The company previously shared top-line numbers via press release in March [2021], but said the plan was to submit the data to a peer-reviewed journal. The FDA expanded the scope of emergency-use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents as young as age 12 earlier this month [May 2021].

The phase III trial consisted of 2264 adolescents ages 12-15 who were healthy or had stable preexisting disease, including HIV and hepatitis B or C. They were assigned 1:1 to receive either 30 micrograms of vaccine or saline placebo, 21 days apart. After vaccination, participants were instructed to keep a symptom diary for 7 days following each dose.

From 15 Oct 2020 - 12 Jan 2021, there were 1131 participants who received vaccine and 1129 who received placebo. A little over half of the participants were boys, and 86% were white. Some participants (5%) had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and were excluded from the primary analysis (n=1983). However, when they were factored in, vaccine efficacy was still 100% (95% CI 78.1%-100%), with 18 cases in the placebo group and zero in the vaccine group.

After the 1st dose, there were 3 cases of COVID-19 within 11 days in the vaccine group compared with 12 in the placebo group, for a vaccine efficacy of 75%, albeit with wide confidence intervals (95% CI 7.6%-95.5%).

Examining safety, the authors compared a subset of adolescents ages 12-15 with individuals ages 16-25. Headache and fatigue were the most common systemic adverse events, with a lower proportion of adolescents reporting severe headache or severe fatigue than the older group. Slightly more adolescents than young adults reported a fever after the 2nd dose (20% vs 17%, respectively) and use of antipyretic agents (37% vs 32%).

Fewer severe adverse events were reported in adolescents than in young adults (0.6% vs 1.7%, respectively), though a higher proportion reported lymphadenopathy (0.8% vs 0.2%). There were no thromboses, hypersensitivity adverse events, or vaccine-related anaphylaxis, and none of the severe adverse events were judged to be related to the vaccine. There were no deaths.

Limitations noted by the authors included the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the adolescent cohort, though they added that all adolescents ages 12-15 were from the US, whereas individuals ages 16-25 were recruited globally. The researchers said they could not examine the effects of other adolescent vaccines on COVID-19 vaccination, nor did they determine whether this vaccine prevents asymptomatic infection or transmission of the virus in this population.

"Abstract
Background
Until very recently, vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had not been authorized for emergency use in persons younger than 16 years of age. Safe, effective vaccines are needed to protect this population, facilitate in-person learning and socialization, and contribute to herd immunity.

"Methods
In this ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial, we randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 injections, 21 days apart, of 30 micrograms of BNT162b2 or placebo. Noninferiority of the immune response to BNT162b2 in 12-15-year-old participants as compared with that in 16-25-year-old participants was an immunogenicity objective. Safety (reactogenicity and adverse events) and efficacy against confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; onset, greater than or equal to 7 days after dose 2) in the 12-15-year-old cohort were assessed.

"Results
Overall, 2260 adolescents 12-15 years of age received injections; 1131 received BNT162b2, and 1129 received placebo. As has been found in other age groups, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety and side-effect profile, with mainly transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity (predominantly injection-site pain [in 79-86% of participants], fatigue [in 60-66%], and headache [in 55-65%]); there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events and few overall severe adverse events. The geometric mean ratio of SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers after dose 2 in 12-15-year-old participants relative to 16-25-year-old participants was 1.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-2.10), which met the noninferiority criterion of a lower boundary of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval greater than 0.67 and indicated a greater response in the 12-15-year-old cohort. Among participants without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, no COVID-19 cases with an onset of 7 or more days after dose 2 were noted among BNT162b2 recipients, and 16 cases occurred among placebo recipients. The observed vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 75.3-100).

"Conclusions
The BNT162b2 vaccine in 12-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against COVID-19. - Mod.LK]

Moderna, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRNA), a biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics and vaccines, today [Tue 25 May 2021] announced that the Phase 2/3 study of its COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) in adolescents has met its primary immunogenicity endpoint, successfully bridging immune responses to the adult vaccination. In the study, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in participants who had received 2 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine using the primary definition. In addition, a vaccine efficacy of 93% in seronegative participants was observed starting 14 days after the 1st dose using the secondary CDC case definition of COVID-19, which tested for milder disease. This study, known as the TeenCOVE study, enrolled more than 3700 participants ages 12 to less than 18 years in the US. The company plans to submit these data to regulators globally in early June [2021].

"We are encouraged that mRNA-1273 was highly effective at preventing COVID-19 in adolescents. It is particularly exciting to see that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection," said Stephane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. "We will submit these results to the US FDA and regulators globally in early June [2021] and request authorization. We remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic."

In this Phase 2/3 study, 3732 adolescent participants ages 12 to less than 18 years were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to 2 100 microgram doses of mRNA-1273 or placebo. The primary endpoint of non-inferior immunogenicity versus the Phase 3 adult study comparator group was met. After 2 doses, no cases of COVID-19 were observed in the vaccine group using the case definition from the adult Phase 3 COVE study, compared to 4 cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100% starting 14 days after the 2nd dose. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescents, a secondary case definition based on the CDC definition of COVID-19 was also evaluated to include cases presenting with milder symptoms. Using the CDC definition, which requires only one COVID-19 symptom and a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, a vaccine efficacy of 93% after the 1st dose was observed.

mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with the Phase 3 COVE study in adults. No significant safety concerns have been identified to date. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common solicited local adverse event was injection site pain. The most common solicited systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose of mRNA-1273 were headache, fatigue, myalgia and chills.

Safety data continues to accrue, and the study continues to be monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. All participants will be monitored for 12 months after their 2nd injection to assess long-term protection and safety. Consequently, these data are subject to change based on ongoing data collection. The company plans to submit data from the TeenCOVE study to a peer-reviewed publication.

[2] Immunity
Date: Wed 26 May 2021

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/health/coronavirus-immunity-vaccines.html


Immunity to the coronavirus lasts at least a year, possibly a lifetime, improving over time especially after vaccination, according to 2 new studies. The findings may help put to rest lingering fears that protection against the virus will be short-lived.

Together, the studies suggest that most people who have recovered from COVID-19 and who were later immunized will not need boosters. Vaccinated people who were never infected most likely will need the shots, however, as will a minority who were infected but did not produce a robust immune response.

Both reports looked at people who had been exposed to the coronavirus about a year earlier. Cells that retain a memory of the virus persist in the bone marrow and may churn out antibodies whenever needed, according to one of the studies, published on Monday [24 May 2021] in the journal Nature [Ref.: Turner JS, Kim W, Kalaidina E, et al.: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans. Nature. 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03647-4].

The other study, posted online at BioRxiv, a site for biology research, found that these so-called memory B cells continue to mature and strengthen for at least 12 months after the initial infection [Ref.: Wang Z, Muecksch F, Schaefer-Babajew D, et al.: Vaccination boosts naturally enhanced neutralizing breadth to SARS-CoV-2 one year after infection. BioRxiv. 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443175].

"The papers are consistent with the growing body of literature that suggests that immunity elicited by infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 appears to be long-lived," said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research.

The studies may soothe fears that immunity to the virus is transient, as is the case with coronaviruses that cause common colds. But those viruses change significantly every few years, Dr. Hensley said. "The reason we get infected with common coronaviruses repetitively throughout life might have much more to do with variation of these viruses rather than immunity," he said.

In fact, memory B cells produced in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced with vaccination are so potent that they thwart even variants of the virus, negating the need for boosters, according to Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York who led the study on memory maturation.

"People who were infected and get vaccinated really have a terrific response, a terrific set of antibodies, because they continue to evolve their antibodies," Dr. Nussenzweig said. "I expect that they will last for a long time."

The result may not apply to protection derived from vaccines alone, because immune memory is likely to be organized differently after immunization, compared with that following natural infection.

That means people who have not had COVID-19 and have been immunized may eventually need a booster shot, Dr. Nussenzweig said. "That's the kind of thing that we will know very, very soon," he said.

Upon first encountering a virus, B cells rapidly proliferate and produce antibodies in large amounts. Once the acute infection is resolved, a small number of the cells take up residence in the bone marrow, steadily pumping out modest levels of antibodies.

To look at memory B cells specific to the new coronavirus, researchers led by Ali Ellebedy of Washington University in St. Louis analyzed blood from 77 people at 3-month intervals, starting about a month after their infection with the coronavirus. Only 6 of the 77 had been hospitalized for COVID-19; the rest had mild symptoms.

Antibody levels in these individuals dropped rapidly 4 months after infection and continued to decline slowly for months afterward, results that are in line with those from other studies.

Some scientists have interpreted this decrease as a sign of waning immunity, but it is exactly what's expected, other experts said. If blood contained high quantities of antibodies to every pathogen the body had ever encountered, it would quickly transform into a thick sludge. Instead, blood levels of antibodies fall sharply following acute infection, while memory B cells remain quiescent in the bone marrow, ready to take action when needed.

Dr. Ellebedy's team obtained bone marrow samples from 19 people roughly 7 months after they had been infected. Fifteen had detectable memory B cells, but 4 did not, suggesting that some people might carry very few of the cells or none at all.

"It tells me that even if you got infected, it doesn't mean that you have a super immune response," Dr. Ellebedy said. The findings reinforce the idea that people who have recovered from COVID-19 should be vaccinated, he said.

Five of the participants in Dr. Ellebedy's study donated bone marrow samples 7 or 8 months after they were initially infected and again 4 months later. He and his colleagues found that the number of memory B cells remained stable over that time. The results are particularly noteworthy because it is difficult to get bone marrow samples, said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the work.

A landmark study in 2007 showed that antibodies in theory could survive decades, perhaps even well beyond the average life span, hinting at the long-term presence of memory B cells [Amanna IJ, Carlson NE, Slifka MK. Duration of Humoral Immunity to Common Viral and Vaccine Antigens. N Engl J Med. 2007; 357: 1903-1915; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa066092]. But the new study offered a rare proof of their existence, Dr. Gommerman said.

Dr. Nussenzweig's team looked at how memory B cells mature over time. The researchers analyzed blood from 63 people who had recovered from COVID-19 about a year earlier. The vast majority of the participants had mild symptoms, and 26 had also received at least one dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

So-called neutralizing antibodies, needed to prevent reinfection with the virus, remained unchanged between 6 and 12 months, while related but less important antibodies slowly disappeared, the team found.

As memory B cells continued to evolve, the antibodies they produced developed the ability to neutralize an even broader group of variants. This ongoing maturation may result from a small piece of the virus that is sequestered by the immune system, for target practice, so to speak.

A year after infection, neutralizing activity in the participants who had not been vaccinated was lower against all forms of the virus, with the greatest loss seen against the variant first identified in South Africa.

Vaccination significantly amplified antibody levels, confirming results from other studies; the shots also ramped up the body's neutralizing ability by about 50-fold.

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said on Sunday [23 May 2021] that he would not get a coronavirus vaccine because he had been infected in March of last year [2020] and was therefore immune. But there is no guarantee that such immunity will be powerful enough to protect him for years, particularly given the emergence of variants of the coronavirus that can partially sidestep the body's defenses.

The results of Dr. Nussenzweig's study suggest that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have later been vaccinated will continue to have extremely high levels of protection against emerging variants, even without receiving a vaccine booster down the line.

"It kind of looks exactly like what we would hope a good memory B cell response would look like," said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in the new research.

The experts all agreed that immunity is likely to play out very differently in people who have never had COVID-19. Fighting a live virus is different from responding to a single viral protein introduced by a vaccine. And in those who had COVID-19, the initial immune response had time to mature over 6-12 months before being challenged by the vaccine.

"Those kinetics are different than someone who got immunized and then gets immunized again 3 weeks later," Dr. Pepper said. "That's not to say that they might not have as broad a response, but it could be very different."
