Even as the Animal Husbandry Department is carrying out a drive to vaccinate cattle to check the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), officials say so far there have been no reports of sheep and goats being affected.

Sheep and goats, which are among the cloven-hoofed animals susceptible to the viral disease, are consumed in large numbers during Ayudha Puja and Bakrid [local terminology for the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice / Eid Al Adha]. Buffaloes and bullocks, which are over 12 years old, are also sacrificed during Bakrid.

Additional Director of Animal Husbandry Nagaraj Shetty said the vaccination drive had been extended to cover sheep and goats also as a precautionary measure.

"So far, there is no evidence of sheep and goats being affected by the disease. But, as a precautionary measure, we are vaccinating them also in areas where cattle were badly affected," he said.

Mr Shetty sought to clarify that the disease was not a public health hazard. "Neither does it spread to human beings nor will consumption of an afflicted animal's meat cause any health hazard," he said. According to a recent count, the total population of sheep and goats in Karnataka was 96 lakh and 62 lakh (9.6 and 6.2 million] respectively, officials said.

Meanwhile, the number of cattle affected by FMD in the State since 1 Sep 2013 has gone up to 18 828, and so far 2396 heads of cattle have died of the disease.

Blisters inside the mouth and on the feet, fever, and excessive secretion of saliva are among the symptoms of the disease.

Meanwhile, Karnataka Mutton Merchants' Association president Mujeeb Khuraishi said there was no concern among people about the disease. Sheep and goats brought from different parts of Karnataka are being sold at various venues in the city.

Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is assuming proportions of an epidemic in Krishnagiri district [Tamil Nadu] with more than 50 cows succumbing to it in less than week near Hosur taluk. While more than 30 cows including calves died in Zuzuvadi, a town on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, the remaining fatalities happened in Uthanapalli [Tamil Nadu], a source from the animal husbandry department said.

"Negligence on the part of farmers to have the cattle vaccinated and delay in starting the seasonal vaccination are said to have contributed to the outbreak," said Dr S Rajendran, regional joint director of animal husbandry department, Krishnagiri district. "The name of the virus which attacked the cattle is _Aphtae epizooticae_ 'O' type. Our diagnosis centre at Ranipet in Vellore district [Tamil Nadu] confirmed it," he added.

[The reported absence of clinical cases among sheep and goats in Karnataka (item [1] above) does not exclude their possible role as subclinical reservoir and potential disseminators of the virus; serological tests may provide the information on their status. The infectivity and/or pathogenicity of FMD virus to various animal species are known to vary for different virus strains, even within the same serotype.

The information provided by Dr S Rajendran (item [2] above) about the serotyping of the causative agent in Tamil Nadu as serotype O, is of significant epidemiological importance. ProMED-mail's request for information on the serotype circulating in Karnataka has not been met yet; it may be assumed that the FMDV circulating there is similar to the one in neighbouring Tamil Nadu (see map at http://healthmap.org/r/1-eG); but assumptions are not a satisfactory means for epidemiological assessments. At least 3 FMDV serotypes are circulating within the Indian subcontinent (A, O, and Asia1).

Ideally, samples should be submitted to an international reference laboratory for serotyping (Karnataka) and further genotyping (both states), and for the identification of reference strains assisting the national authorities in the selection of the most relevant vaccine strains against the causative agent(s) involved.

Reportedly, FAO is currently concluding the preparation of a post-vaccination monitoring (PVM) system, in order to provide guidelines to countries to measure their FMD vaccination effectiveness. The PVM system is said to be launched by the end of 2013. - Mod.AS]
