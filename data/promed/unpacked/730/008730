A study of the evolution of A(H3N2) influenza viruses since 1968 shows that the current virus has a low propensity to bind to human receptor analog sites, which correlates with the marked reduction in A(H3N2) disease impact in the last 10 years, UK researchers reported yesterday [10 Dec 2012] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [abstract reproduced in part 2 below - Mod.CP]. The team used surface biolayer interferometry to measure virus binding to human and avian receptor analogs since the 1968 H3N2 pandemic. They noted that by 2001, the avidity of human H3 viruses for avian receptors had declined 4-fold, and since then, the affinity for human receptors also has decreased significantly. They conclude that this loss of affinity for human receptors "correlates with the marked reduction in A(H3N2) virus disease impact" in the last decade.

Evolution of the receptor binding properties of the influenza A(H3N2) hemagglutinin. By Yi Pu Lina, and 13 others.

Abstract
-------
"The hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A(H3N2) virus responsible for the 1968 influenza pandemic derived from an avian virus. On introduction into humans, its receptor binding properties had changed from a preference for avian receptors (a2,3-linked sialic acid) to a preference for human receptors (a2,6-linked sialic acid). By 2001, the avidity of human H3 viruses for avian receptors had declined, and since then, the affinity for human receptors has also decreased significantly. These changes in receptor binding, which correlate with increased difficulties in virus propagation in vitro and in antigenic analysis, have been assessed by virus hemagglutination of erythrocytes from different species and quantified by measuring virus binding to receptor analogs using surface biolayer interferometry. Crystal structures of HA-receptor analog complexes formed with HAs from viruses isolated in 2004 and 2005 reveal significant differences in the conformation of the 220-loop of HA1 relative to the 1968 structure, resulting in altered interactions between the HA and the receptor analog that explain the changes in receptor affinity. Site-specific mutagenesis shows the HA1 Asp-225 --Asn substitution to be the key determinant of the decreased receptor binding in viruses circulating since 2005. Our results indicate that the evolution of human influenza A(H3N2) viruses since 1968 has produced a virus with a low propensity to bind human receptor analogs, and this loss of avidity correlates with the marked reduction in A(H3N2) virus disease impact in the last 10 years."

In their discussion, the authors review the biological consequences of receptor binding variation as follows: "There are potentially important consequences of changes in receptor binding properties for virus isolation, for antigenic characterization, and for vaccine production. Viruses with decreased affinity for cellular receptors are under increased selection pressure when propagated in tissue culture cells and in hens' eggs for vaccine production. Indeed, the reduced avidity of the HA for the receptor is likely to be a key factor that promotes the observed ability of the virus neuraminidase to substitute for the HA in receptor binding by viruses propagated in certain cell lines. Difficulties with antigenic characterization derive largely from differences in the behavior of viruses in the hemagglutination assays that are central to antigenic analyses, leading to the need to use guinea pig erythrocytes in standard hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays for recent H3N2 viruses. Biologically, the most important consequence of amino acid substitutions that result in decreased affinity for receptors is their effect on the efficiency of infection and transmission. Despite the changes in receptor binding that have been observed, and the widespread immunity to H3N2 viruses generally, these viruses continue to circulate and have predominated in North America in the 2010/2011 influenza season and in the 2011/2012 season in Europe. Nevertheless, it is striking that the severity of infections has declined since the major epidemics of 1968-1970, 1975-1976, 1989-1990, 1994-1995, and 1999-2000, and this may be linked to the marked reduction in receptor binding affinity in the recent years of this 44-year-long pandemic.

[These findings do not conflict with the generally held belief that human epidemic influenza viruses may arise by a change in their receptor binding properties such that the virus acquires a preference for human receptors (a2,6-linked sialic acid) in place of a preference for avian receptors (a2,3-linked sialic acid). In the case of the 1968 epidemic A(H3N2) influenza virus, however, this does not appear to have been a stable development, and, over subsequent seasons, preference for human-type receptors has progressively declined. Definition of the evolutionary forces mediating these changes in receptor-binding properties of epidemic viruses will be an essential component in the analyses and prediction of influenza virus epidemics.

The practical consequences for vaccine production and antigen analyses associated with this decline in human (and avian) receptor affinities are considerable. - Mod.CP]
