A new human death from avian influenza was reported by the Egyptian
Ministry of Health, bringing to 38 the number of fatalities from
avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection since the beginning of the
outbreak in Egypt in 2006.

The victim was an 11-year-old girl resident in Luxor Governorate,
which is located 660 km south of Cairo. Abderrahmane Chahine, a
Ministry of Health spokesman, reported that the girl had developed
acute pneumonia.

The same source added that a total of 115 people, distributed
throughout the country, had contracted avian A/(H5N1) virus infection
during 2010, 11 of whom had died. Egypt, with 38 fatal human cases
identified since March 2006, remains the country most affected by
avian influenza outside of Asia.

The poultry industry in Egypt, which employs a million people
directly or indirectly, has suffered serious economic loses,
estimated at 3 million dollars [USD?].

Avian influenza is a contagious disease caused by a virus that
normally infects birds, and less commonly pigs. Avian influenza
A/(H5N1) virus is highly species-specific but has, on rare occasions,
infected humans.
