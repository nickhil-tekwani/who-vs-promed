As of 5 Feb 2008, the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH) had reported
13 probable cases of chikungunya fever in a localized area of
Singapore. A lack of recent travel among cases and clustering of
cases in a small geographic area suggests that there has been local
transmission of chikungunya virus through mosquitoes in Singapore.

Travelers to Singapore should be aware of the symptoms of chikungunya
fever and should take steps to avoid mosquito bites. [The details of
mosquito bite avoidance are given in the CDC notice at the URL above. - Mod.TY]

[This report mentions 2 additional cases since the last ProMED-mail
update from Singapore cited below. This suggests that transmission
continued through January 2008. The previous post mentioned the
vigorous action being taken to eliminate _Aedes_ chikungunya virus
vector mosquito breeding sites. One hopes that these are the last
cases to occur in this small outbreak.
