The Ministry of Health said yesterday [29 Aug 2018] that 2 people have died of cholera in Algeria as 62 cases of disease have been identified since the start of August 2018. According to a ministry statement, 62 cases had been confirmed as of [Tue 28 Aug 2018] with another 173 suspected cases.

"All preventive measures have been taken with a view to pre-empting the spread of the disease," the statement read. Since cases of the disease first appeared in mid-August [2018], the Algerian health authorities have been trying to determine its source. The Health Ministry had earlier attributed its appearance to contaminated water in Tipaza state, west of the capital. This was denied by local authorities. Cholera, which has not been seen in Algeria for more than 2 decades, is an infectious disease that causes severe diarrhea. It is potentially fatal if the sufferer does not receive proper medical treatment.
