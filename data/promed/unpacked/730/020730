[According to the media after the outbreaks occurred, the local governments (in Guangxi and Shaanxi) worked hard to dispose of the epidemic effectively according to the relevant preplan and technical regulation of prevention and treatment and culling and decontaminating of the affected population. At present, both outbreaks have been effectively controlled, (see http://www.tech-food.com/news/detail/n1383103.htm and http://www.tech-food.com/news/detail/n1383104.htm; information is in Chinese).

The information below was published by the World Organisation for Animal Health in the most recent "OIE Situation Report for Avian Influenza" (latest update on 25 Jan 2018), available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport_AI_January2018_01.pdf:

"HPAI H5N6 viruses 1st emerged in China in 2013 and have been reported by 7 Asian countries. The Asian lineage H5N6 causes severe clinical signs in poultry and associated mortality. The outbreaks in these countries have led to significant destruction of poultry with more than 29 million birds destroyed for control measures by the veterinary authorities. This group of H5N6 viruses has also been associated with human infection, including a number of deaths. A total of 19 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 6 deaths, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014.

Low pathogenic (LP) H7N9 virus was 1st detected in poultry in China in 2013 and continues to circulate in several provinces of the country. Since that time, the virus has also caused sporadic human infections and poses a concern to public health. As of January 2018, more than 1600 human infections have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). Live bird markets remain the main source of the virus spreading among poultry and from poultry to humans. Until now, 5 H7N9 influenza epidemic waves have occurred in China.

In February 2017, the LP H7N9 virus mutated to become highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 virus in poultry. The mutated HP strain spread into other provinces of China in poultry and caused an increase in the number of human infections in the 5th wave.

The Chinese government conducted extensive surveillance in all provinces to understand the extent of LP and HP H7N9 distribution. There has been closure of live bird markets and farms in affected provinces and stamping out of positive birds. Poultry movement control in affected provinces and biosecurity measures were increased. To limit the spread of infection, the Chinese government launched a nationwide vaccination programme in late 2017 in the country."
