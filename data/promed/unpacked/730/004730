The mosquito-borne Ross River virus has reached alarming proportions in New
South Wales, prompting the Health Department to issue a warning to all
people living and travelling in rural areas.
A record 1,585 cases were reported last year, compared with 1,076 for 1996.
The fever has advanced across NSW at a rapid rate. In 1995 only 242 cases
were reported.
The Health Department's infectious disease expert, Dr Jeremy McAnulty, said
that last year the virus reached the outskirts of Sydney for the first time.
Disease-carrying mosquitoes were found in Sydney's north, south and west -
as close as Gosford, the Illawarra and Nepean areas - but Dr McAnulty was
skeptical of the virus ever infiltrating Sydney itself. This is because it
is transmitted by mosquitoes which become infected through contact with
wild native animals in rural areas. "I don't know if it will ever advance
into the city. What happened last year may only occur every few years," he
said.
Dr McAnulty said the sudden jump in reported cases came from a combination
of greater awareness among the public and general practitioners but the
disease also ebbed and flowed in a natural cycle.

[I think of a virus of "alarming proportions" as one about 2.54 cm in
diameter, otherwise I guess they mean the numbers of cases has reached
alarming proportions. Although this newspaper report suggests that Ross
River virus "has reached alarming proportions in NSW", it also indicates
that public awareness may have led to the increases in numbers of reported
cases. What is needed are apparent:inapparent infection rates. If Richard
Russell would care to comment on this report we would appreciate it. -
