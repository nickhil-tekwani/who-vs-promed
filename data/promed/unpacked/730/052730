On Saturday [23 Oct 2010], 9 people stopped breathing. The number of
people who died in the grip of the disease has gone up to 347. The
ages of the people who died of the fever were 8 months and 2, 12, 35,
45, 50 (2 individuals) and 60 years. No [health] team reached the
village. In the district, 167 fever victims came to the hospital on
Saturday 16 [Oct 2010]. [They] were found suffering from malaria.

[The number of fatal cases in this area has increased from 180 on 4
Oct 2010 to 347 in the above report, nearly 3 weeks later. Local
residents were quoted in the above report as complaining about the
lack of health care personnel in the village area. This report is the
1st indication that malaria may be involved in at least some of these
fever cases. However, it seems curious that a malaria diagnosis was
not made earlier when the outbreak began. Previous reports mentioned
a virus disease as the cause of the so called "mystery fevers." There
still appears to be no diagnosis of the etiologies of these cases.
The cases in the above report are in the same area as the previous
outbreak reports.
