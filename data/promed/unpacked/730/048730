Chronic wasting disease [CWD] update from Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism
----------------------------------------------------------------------
So far 3 positives detected during 2012 deer seasons, one being in the Norton County focus in the southwest corner of the county, one north of Cedar Bluff Reservoir in Trego County, and one east of Hays, Kansas in Ellis County.

The Ellis County detection is the 1st for that county. All positives this past season 2012 were 3.5 or older white-tailed bucks harvested with archery equipment in November [2012].

[Readers are encouraged to see the original website at the source URL above. It has an excellent map of the counties and where the various CWD cases have been found. Certainly we have a slight expansion of territory of the disease, as Ellis county is added to the group that now have positive animals.

The state of Kansas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1nEr. A Kansas County map can be seen at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml. - Mod.TG]
