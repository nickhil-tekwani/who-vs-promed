A 64-year-old farmer in east China's Zhejiang Province has been confirmed to have contracted H7N9 avian influenza virus infection, bringing the total number of [human] avian influenza cases in China to 4 this autumn, local health authorities said on Saturday [9 Nov 2013].

The farmer from Jiaxing City was confirmed as having the disease on Mon 4 Nov 2013 after she began showing symptoms on 30 Oct 2013. She is now in a serious condition, according to the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department.

This case follows 2 others also in Zhejiang Province confirmed on 15 and 23 Oct 2013, and another in southern Guangdong Province confirmed on 5 Nov 2013.

China had reported 134 cases by the end of August [2013], with 45 fatalities, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission. No new cases were reported on the Chinese mainland in September [2013].

[As yet little information is available about either of the 2 new cases in Zhejiang province, other than that the most recent case patient is a female farmer. It is apparent that the H7N9 virus still lingers in the environment despite the apparent eradication of the disease by control of poultry markets and poultry sales to the general public.

It seems unlikely that seasonal factors are involved in the reappearance of the H7N9 virus as normal seasonal influenza outbreaks have so far not occurred in China. More information is awaited.
