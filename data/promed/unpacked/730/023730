change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be
discarded after further investigation and follow-up.

The number of new cases since last WHO update includes new cases reported
for 7, 8, and 9 Jun 2003, when these reports have been received. 4.
Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by the
national public health authorities.

China today reported no new probable cases of SARS. Since 6 Jun 2003, China
has reported one new probable case of the disease.

Taiwan reported 4 new probable SARS cases today, in a hospital on the
outskirts of Taipei. All cases arose in previously identified contacts of
cases, and are being isolated and quarantined. Together with local health
authorities, WHO epidemiologists are investigating the cause of this latest
hospital cluster.

There is one new probable case of SARS in Hong Kong. This is the 25th
consecutive day on which the number of cases has fallen below 5 since 16
May 2003. Hong Kong also reported one SARS death today.

Situation report on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 9 Jun 2003
--------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:

There is one new confirmed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
today (9 Jun 2003). This is the 25th consecutive day on which the number of
cases has fallen below 5 since 16 May 2003. There is no case involving
healthcare workers today.

The number of patients recovered and discharged from hospital is 1365. Of
them, one was discharged today. The number of SARS patients in intensive
care units is 19. These cases are part of the 66 cases under treatment in
hospitals. 34 are recovering patients in convalescence and in preparation
for discharge.

One patient died, bringing the total number of deaths attributable to SARS
to 288. The deceased was a 34-year-old male.

Meanwhile, temperature checks for all passengers at the airport, ports, and
border points continue to be implemented to watch for travellers displaying
symptoms of SARS. In addition, all incoming travellers are required to
complete a health declaration. 5 passengers were screened out at these
points yesterday. After undergoing further medical checks, 3 were cleared
of SARS symptoms and continued their journey, and 2 others were referred to
hospitals for observation.

All household contacts of confirmed or suspected SARS patients are required
to undergo home confinement for monitoring and treatment up to a maximum of
10 days. So far, a total of 1262 persons (from 493 households) had been
covered, of whom 34 had been found to have SARS.

The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with SARS since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:

Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths
(change in past 24 hours presented in parentheses with minus for decrease)

Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 386 (0)/ 359
(0)/ (n/a)
Patients, family members & visitors: 1367 (1)/ 1006 (1)/ (n/a)

Total: 1753 (1)/ 1365 (1)/ 288 (1)

Total no. in hospital: 100 (-1)
Recovering patients in convalescence: 34
Cases under treatment: 66 (including 19 patients in Intensive Care Unit)

Suspected cases: 4

An unexplained cluster of respiratory illnesses at a hospital east of
Toronto has Ontario's SARS containment team worried about the possibility
of a new outbreak of the disease. 15 dialysis patients of the Whitby site
of the Lakeridge Health Centre have pneumonia or respiratory symptoms and
are under investigation as possible SARS patients, Dr. James Young,
Ontario's commissioner of public security, said Monday. In addition, "there
have been some staff reports of illness today which we are looking into,"
said Dr. Donna Reynolds, from the Durham Region public health
department. The ages of those who are sick range from 28 into their 80s.

"We will not know whether they are SARS or not until we have seen them go
through this clinical course over the next 10 days," said Dr. David Ross,
Lakeridge's SARS consultant and chief respirologist. "They are all in
isolation." The first person became sick 1 Jun 2003. By Thursday [5 Jun
2003], as more patients fell ill, management of the facility ordered staff
to don full gown and glove protection. On Friday [6 Jun 2003], the local
public health authorities were called. By Saturday [7 Jun 2003], officials
realized they had "around 10" people who were ill.

Dr. Don Atkinson, the chief of staff, said the first person to come down
with a respiratory illness had received dialysis at one of the hospital's
27 satellite sites, so it wasn't immediately apparent there might be a
problem. Atkinson added that they cannot, at this point, link the first
patient to the other 14.

Young, who only learned of the possible cluster on Saturday, said doctors
are performing tests to see whether there might be another cause for the
illnesses. But in the meantime, all are being treated like SARS cases. They
are in respiratory isolation; public health is tracing their contacts and
ordering them into quarantine.

The hospital has been effectively moved to a Level 3 designation,
indicating the highest level of SARS contamination. That designation puts
all sorts of restrictions on admissions and transfers of patients as well
as the ability of staff to work at other facilities.

Lakeridge officials told an afternoon news conference that 2 brothers --
not linked to the Whitby cluster -- arrived at their Oshawa site 9 days ago
and were being treated for SARS. They're in critical and deteriorating
condition. The pair had visited their ailing mother at North York General
Hospital during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome at that
facility. But there is no known link between those 2 cases and the
unexplained illnesses in Whitby.

Efforts are under way to determine how the patients could have contracted
SARS, if indeed they have the disease. No epidemiologic or "epi" link to
known SARS cases has yet been identified for the group. An epi link is
needed to officially diagnose a probable or suspect case of SARS. But the
experience in Toronto's second SARS outbreak showed officials the early
lack of an epi link is no guarantee a case isn't SARS. The current
outbreak was sparked after officials at North York General Hospital, who
were alerted to suspicious pneumonias by worried nurses, decided the
patients couldn't be suffering from SARS because they couldn't discover a
link to prior cases. As a consequence, the disease festered among patients
in the orthopedic ward for weeks before eventually infecting staff.
Infected patients transferred from the facility took the disease to several
other hospitals in Toronto.

[As of 9 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8421 probable cases
of SARS with 784 deaths reported from 29 countries. Since the last WHO
update there have been 21 new cases of SARS reported. Canada has reported
11 new cases, Taiwan 4 new cases, Hong Kong 3 new cases, and one each from
China, Thailand, and the United States.

In the above newswire, there is a discussion on a new cluster of febrile
respiratory illness in a health care facility. At present it is a
suspected outbreak of SARS and has led to implementation of infection
control procedures that assume this outbreak is due to SARS. We await
official follow-up as to whether another etiology for this outbreak is
identified or whether this is another health care environment-related SARS
outbreak in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]
