EFSA evaluates wheat disease fungus
-----------------------------------
EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] has prepared a scientific report
about the karnal bunt fungus _Tilletia indica_, which is currently not
present in Europe. Conclusions are that _T. indica_ can enter through
imported wheat and that all grain from areas where the fungus occurs
must be tested both at harvest and before shipment and must be found
free from spores.

The spores of _T. indica_ are very resistant to adverse environmental
conditions and can survive in soil for several years. Once
established, karnal bunt is very difficult to eradicate. Infected
wheat has an unpleasant fishy smell and severely affected grain cannot
be used for flour.

The advice follows a request from the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) to review current EU control measures on wheat
grain imports. USDA put forward a mathematical model based on the
assumption that a minimum of 150 000 spores per hectare are needed for
karnal bunt to develop. In the US, the disease occurs in areas that
export wheat to the EU, but the number of spores in grain was said not
to be high enough to pose a risk.

EFSA reports that there is no published evidence to show that a
minimum number of spores are needed to trigger the disease in new
areas; that the value given was based on a misunderstanding of a
theoretical paper; that there are no experimental data which support
the existence of an infection threshold; and that the rationale for
the USDA proposal is not scientifically substantiated.

[The fungus _Tilletia indica_ causes karnal bunt (also called Indian
or partial bunt), a serious disease of bread wheat (_Triticum
aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), and triticale (wheat/rye
hybrids). The disease was first noticed in northern India in 1930 near
the town of Karnal. Today it is widespread in some countries in Asia
and the Middle East and is also present in parts of the Americas and
in South Africa. Disease development is favoured by cool, humid
conditions.

Symptoms vary with climate and are difficult to detect in the field
because of the irregular distribution of infected kernels. They may
include reduction in the length of ears and number of spikelets, brown
blotches on kernels, premature grain drop, and stunting of plants. All
or part of the grain is replaced with a powdery mass of dark spores
that emit a strong, fishy odour. Grain containing more than 3 percent
bunted kernels is generally considered unfit for human consumption.

Harvesting shatters infected grains releasing the spores and leaving
behind a broken, hollow shell. Spores can spread over long distances
by wind and survive in the soil, on stored seed, or on contaminated
equipment for up to 5 years. Disease management may include cultural
and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread, use of clean seed,
preventative foliar fungicides, and change to alternative crops not
susceptible to karnal bunt (such as barley).

Economic losses are mainly due to lower grain quality, costs of
quarantine measures, and loss of international trade. Most countries
regulate karnal bunt as a quarantine pest covering import of grain,
agricultural machinery, feed meals, seeds, and agrochemicals that may
have been handled in the same transportation system as infected wheat.

The original EFSA report (see link below) explains that the threshold
of 150 000 spores/ha was arrived at by scaling up a supposed value of
15 teliospores/square meter to result in one affected kernel. It is
stated that this extrapolation is scientifically not permissible since
a single teliospore on germination can produce more than a 100 primary
sporidia, which in turn produce secondary sporidia which infect the
plant. Hence, introduction of a single spore could pose the risk of an
epidemic under circumstances favourable for the pathogen.

The related _T. tritici_ causes common bunt of wheat, and _T.
barclayana_ causes black smut of rice.
