10 victims of food poisoning from the consumption of fugu fish on 10 Sep 2013 are all out of the hospital, announced the Regional Health Agency, Indian Ocean [La Reunion] on Friday [20 Sep 2013]. "To date, patients have returned to their homes," said the Regional Health Agency, Indian Ocean.

Results confirm that the fish was from the pufferfish family, which is banned from all fish markets. The tests were performed by the Agency for Marine Research and Development (ARVAM in French) from leftovers. The results of these tests confirm the presence of tetrodotoxin in the ingested food. The fish that caused the food poisoning are indeed from the pufferfish family (globe fish, Fugu, "ball" or "bouftangue" in Reunion), as confirmed by the photo taken by the fisherman. This type of fish contains tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin that can be fatal. This toxin is concentrated mainly in the liver, viscera, skin and gonads of this type of fish. Poisoning usually occurs within minutes after ingestion.

According to ARVAM, other past tetrodotoxin poisonings have been identified in Reunion:

- In 1959, 13 patients, 12 hospitalized (fish caught in Reunion)
- In 1972, 7 patients (2 deaths), (fish caught in St. Paul)
- In 1980: 2 patients
- In 1989, one patient

Pufferfish are poisonous fish that are on the banned list for marketing by a decree dated 24 Dec 2009. Accordingly, consumption of these fish should be avoided.

[Tetrodotoxin, a very potent toxin, selectively blocks the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of excitable tissues and neuronal transmission in skeletal muscles. In humans, paresthesias begin 10-45 minutes after ingestion, usually as tingling of the tongue and inner surface of the mouth. Other common symptoms include vomiting, lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of doom, and weakness. Paralysis spreads, and death can occur within 6-24 hours, often due to paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Other signs include salivation, muscle twitching, diaphoresis [excessive sweating], pleuritic chest pain, dysphagia [difficulty in swallowing], aphonia [loss of the voice], and convulsions. Severe poisoning is indicated by hypotension, bradycardia [slow heartbeat], depressed corneal reflexes, and fixed dilated pupils. There is no specific antidote, and treatment is often supportive.

The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours.

There are a number of different species of puffer fish or blow fish, each of which produces a different concentration of the toxin.

Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of pufferfish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. But the flesh of many pufferfish may not usually be dangerously toxic.

Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin and anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family _Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas sp._, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species.
