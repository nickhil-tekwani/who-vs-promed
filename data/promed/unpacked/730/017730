A tick-borne disease has killed 31 people this year [2017] so far, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) on Thursday [14 Sep 2017].

The KDCD noted the number of deaths from severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) has increased sharply from last year's [2016] 19. Given that ticks remain active until November, more people may fall victim to the virus.

The number of people who have tested positive for the virus was 139 as of 31 Aug [2017]. It is also expected to surpass last year's [2016] total (165).

Notably, the number of patients increased to 18 and 17 from 9 and 8 in South Chungcheong Province and Jeju Island, respectively.

SFTS has a fatality rate as high as 30 percent. The disease is most commonly found in Central Asia and China and is known to be transmitted through bites from virus-carrying ticks.

After an incubation period of 6 to 14 days, SFTS starts to cause symptoms such as fever, drowsiness, vomiting, diarrhea and organ failure.

There is currently no effective medicine to treat the disease, and the best policy against it is to avoid being bitten by ticks.

In a statement, the KDCD advised people to wear long-sleeved shirts for extended outdoor activities and take a shower afterward.

[The number of SFTS cases in South Korea has been increasing this summer [2017]. SFTS virus is endemic in East Asia, including Korea. The virus is transmitted by the scrub or bush tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, which was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago. With no vaccine available, avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure available.

SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Characterization of the virus responsible for SFTS was described 1st in 2011: Yu XJ, et al. Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China. N Engl J Med. 2011 Apr 21;364(16):1523-32 (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010095).
