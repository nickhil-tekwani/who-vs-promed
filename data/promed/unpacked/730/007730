As of noon today (20 Aug 2015), there have been a total of:
1128 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
485 deaths,
592 recoveries, and
51 currently active cases (including 3 on home isolation).

In the past 24 hours there have been:
10 newly confirmed cases,
2 newly reported deaths, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

[reported case fatality rate is 43.0 percent]

Information on newly confirmed cases (10 cases)
All 10 cases were reported in Riyadh
1- A 63-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

2- A 60-year-old Saudi female non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

3- A 64-year-old Saudi female non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

4- A 60-year-old Saudi female non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

5- A 35-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker, reported as a fatality at time of initial report. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

6- A 34-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

7- A 59-year-old Saudi female healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

8- An 87-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

9- A 76-year-old Saudi female non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

10- A 40-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other known cases is currently under review.

Information on newly reported fatalities (2 cases)
Both fatalities were reported in Riyadh
1- A 71-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker with a history of co-morbidities. [Most likely reported as a newly confirmed case on 18 Aug 2015 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. At the time of initial report he had a positive history of contact with other known MERS-CoV infected case(s). - Mod.MPP]

2- A 35-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker with a history of co-morbidities and reported as a newly confirmed case today [20 Aug 2015].

[It seems the same statement applies here from previous posts -- "the outbreak in Riyadh continues," with 10 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in the past 24 hours. With the addition of these new cases and deaths (2 newly reported deaths) the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now up to 1128, including 485 deaths.

Since the beginning of August 2015, there have been a total of 71 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, of which 68 (95.8) percent were reported from Riyadh. Information on dates of onset have not been reported on the daily reports (but are usually included in the follow-up WHO Disease Outbreak News reports) so it is difficult to assess the true epidemic curve of this outbreak at present to see if there were specific likely periods of high risk exposure (perhaps to one or more identified superspreaders). The press release available on the MOH website on 17 Aug 2015 when the outbreak was discussed mentions that the cases involved individuals "who visited the Emergency Medicine departments in addition to 4 cases among healthcare practitioners during the period June 2015 through [14 Aug 2015]" (see MERS-CoV (108): Saudi Arabia, RFI 20150817.3584526), suggesting that there was continual exposure during this period. Going back through cases reported since the beginning of June 2015, there was a case reported from Riyadh on 5 Jun 2015, followed by one reported on 14, 28, 29 Jun and 1 Jul 2015, 2 Jul and then 21 Jul 2015 at which time the cases were reported more frequently and I've previously presumed heralded the start of this major outbreak. It will be very interesting to learn more of the epidemiologic assessment of this ongoing outbreak to see what more may be learned about the epidemiology.

[2] Saudi Arabia, more cases, ER & OPD closed - media report
Date: 20 Aug 2015

http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/793936


There are more cases of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Riyadh -- the center of a sharp rise in infections and deaths this week -- than announced by the Health Ministry, a local doctor has reportedly said.

However, Hanan Al-Balkhi, executive director of preventive medicine and infection control at the Ministry of National Guard, said that only the Health Ministry was allowed to announce the number of cases.

She was quoted as saying by a local publication that medical tests run recently showed positive results among several patients and health workers at the National Guard Hospital in Riyadh.

A top-level emergency has now been declared at the hospital to deal with the crisis, according to media reports.

"The procedures for emergency cases at the 3rd level include closure of the emergency department at the National Guard Hospital and transferring patients, who do not have the virus, to other hospitals. All emergency departments and outpatient clinics are closed," she said.

"The congestion of patients and visitors at the emergency department caused the wild spread of the virus. The number of patients is more than the emergency department's 145 beds can handle," she said.

[The above media report suggests that there are potentially more cases of MERS-CoV infection related to this outbreak that have not as yet been reported -- an observation that I've heard from other sources as well over the past several days. But during crises, there is a tendency for rumors to abound, including those pointing fingers at government authorities with accusations of "cover-ups." Remembering the media reports surrounding the early days of the 2nd and then 3rd generation cases in the South Korean outbreak where there were similar such media reports. Transparency on the part of health authorities helps to reduce these types of rumors, but even with cellophane wrapping paper (clear and transparent) there will always be some rumors spreading.

The above media report does further clarify the location of the high risk exposures -- "congestion of patients and visitors at the emergency department.... the number of patients is more than the emergency department's 145 beds can handle". A very similar description to the emergency room at the Seoul Samsung Hospital. So perhaps the organism (the MERS-CoV) is unchanged, as is healthcare behavior (both delivery as well as seeking) in many locations, and the MERS-CoV finds its niche for rapid transmission in the healthcare environment. - Mod.MPP]

As of 6 AM KST today (20 Aug 2015), the situation remains unchanged:
There have been a total of:
186 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
36 deaths
140 recoveries and
10 currently ill patients under treatment

Of the 10 patients under treatment
9 are PCR negative for MERS-CoV
3 are in critical condition

[No news is good news ... in the sense that the situation in South Korea is stable, without additional cases. One wonders why one individual remains PCR positive for such a prolonged period of time. Is it one of the patients described to be in critical/unstable condition, or is it someone who is stable clinically, but persists in shedding the virus, and therefore maybe a source for "silent shedding" if in the community. Food for thought ... perhaps one of our Korean colleagues might have some information on this.

Abstract
As of [15 Jul 2015], the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare had reported 186 case-patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea. For 159 case-patients with known outcomes and complete case histories, we found that older age and preexisting concurrent health conditions were risk factors for death.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[An interesting presentation of secondary data analyses worth reading. According to the authors, "The model estimated that odds of dying were 7 times higher for persons with concurrent health conditions than for persons without these conditions (odds ratio 7.14, 95 percent confidence interval (CI) 2.27-22.41). Furthermore, for every 1-year increase in age, odds of dying increased by 12 percent (odds ratio 1.12, 95 percent CI 1.07-1.17)....

"A total of 16 (64 percent) case-patients with MERS in South Korea who had concurrent health conditions died, compared with 19 (14 percent) case-patients without concurrent health conditions. This finding is comparable to that in a MERS study in Saudi Arabia, which reported a 60 percent CFR for a study population in which 45 (96 percent) patients had concurrent health conditions (8) [reference available at source URL]. Although only 25 (16 percent) case-patients had documented concurrent health conditions, the MERS outbreak in South Korean during 2015 has been largely nosocomial in nature. This finding suggests that observed differences between average CFRs in South Korea and Saudi Arabia might be driven in part by differential rates of concurrent health conditions for susceptible persons."

This last conclusion may be spot on, as the overwhelming majority of fatalities in Saudi Arabia have been reported in individuals with "co-morbidities." It would be interesting to see if the authors can do a similar/comparative study on data available from the Saudi MOH and WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]
