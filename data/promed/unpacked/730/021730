Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage

- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)

- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing

- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 3 new confirmed and 67 new suspected cases in week 26 (28 Jun-4 Jul 2021), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (10-16 Feb 2020). There were no deaths among the confirmed cases for week 26 of 2021. Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 26).

The report above confirms that, so far this year (2021), Edo, Ondo, Taraba states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected remained the same at 14, and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case remained the same at 58. Nigeria is now in the period of case decline. The peak is not as high so far this year (2021) as in previous years, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 4 years and will be the case again for the year 2021 but at a lower level.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta. One hopes that this is why there are fewer cases this year (2021).

_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

One hopes that the public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY

[2] Vaccine trial
Date: Mon 28 Jun 2021

The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) was awarded EUR 22.8 million [USD 27.1 million] by the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to conduct a Phase IIb clinical trial of IAVI's Lassa fever vaccine candidate among adults and children in Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. The vaccine candidate uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector, which is now registered for use in 8 African countries.

This joint award supports an international collaboration across Africa, Europe, and North America, called the "Lassa Fever Vaccine Efficacy and Prevention for West Africa" (LEAP4WA), which will also strengthen the research capacity of investigational sites where Lassa fever outbreaks and disease occur frequently. The LEAP4WA consortium consists of the following members: IAVI Inc., USA; IAVI Stichting, Netherlands; Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, USA; Ministry of Health and Sanitation/Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone; Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, UK; University of Liberia, Liberia; Epicentre, France; and Henry M. Jackson Foundation Medical Research International Ltd/Gte (HJFMRI), Nigeria. In Nigeria, HJFMRI will conduct the study at its Clinical Research Center (CRC) supported by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.

Other supported WRAIR Lassa projects being implemented at the CRC and other sites across Nigeria include a Lassa incidence study in collaboration with the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), a Lassa seroprevalence study, and a potential opportunity for a CEPI-funded Phase IIa Lassa vaccine study through a WRAIR/IAVI collaboration.

When infected with Lassa fever virus, patients exhibit a high fever accompanied by bleeding, sore throat, vomiting, and body pains. The zoonotic virus, which rapidly spreads through bodily fluids, is transmitted to man by an infected multi-mammate rat (_Mastomys natalensis_). The illness was first reported in the Lassa community in Borno State, Nigeria, when 2 missionary nurses died from an unusual febrile illness. Since then, outbreaks continue to be reported in Nigeria, and the disease, which is gradually becoming endemic in many parts of West Africa, is now being transported to overseas country like the USA and UK.

Despite these outbreaks, there is as yet no Lassa fever vaccine. An estimated 300 000 to 500 000 Lassa fever cases are diagnosed annually, resulting in approximately 5000 deaths. The World Health Organization has identified Lassa fever as one of the top emerging pathogens likely to cause severe outbreaks in the near future. In 2018, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported the largest ever number of cases in Nigeria, with over 600 confirmed cases and over 170 deaths. As of May 2021, 14 states have recorded at least one confirmed case and over 2000 suspected cases this year, with the majority of cases emanating from Edo and Ondo states.

CRC was established in 2014, initially supporting Phase II Ebola vaccine trials funded by Glaxo Smith Kline and Janssen. Since that time, its rapidly expanding research efforts have covered a broad range of infectious diseases. Of note, current research also includes 2 COVID-19 studies. Site preparations are ongoing for an imminent Phase III SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine trial sponsored by Sanofi Pasteur. Under a collaborative grant application between HJFMRI and ACEGID, the CRC was selected for an Africa Centre for Disease Control grant to potentially conduct a study entitled "Assessing the Effect of SARS-CoV-2 Variants on Vaccine-induced and Naturally-acquired Immune Responses in Nigeria" (SARS-CoVAN Project).

[It is encouraging to see the Lassa fever virus vaccine ready to enter a phase IIb trial that will determine its safety and immunogenicity. If a phase III trial is required, that will take a long time and many millions of US dollar equivalents. As noted in the Nigeria CDC update above, further trials in Nigeria could focus on the 3 states that have the majority of cases. The Lassa fever virus candidate vaccine uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector, a vaccine vector that is being used successfully against Ebola virus. One hopes that the Lassa fever virus vaccine trial is successful. - Mod.TY]
