Globally, influenza activity continued to increase in the northern hemisphere with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating so far this season [2014-15]. Antigenic characterization of most recent A(H3N2) viruses so far indicated differences from the A(H3N2) virus used in the influenza vaccines for the northern hemisphere in 2014-2015. The tested influenza A(H3N2) viruses so far did show sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors.

- In North America, the influenza season was ongoing with influenza activity still increasing in most areas. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus.
- In Europe, influenza activity was still low, but the season seemed to have started. In eastern Asia, influenza activity increased with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating.
- In northern and western Africa, influenza activity increased with influenza B virus predominant.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity increased in some countries of the Caribbean, decreased in Central America and was low in the tropical countries of South America.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity increased slightly but remained low, with influenza B predominating.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at low levels, though ILI activity remained high in several Pacific Islands.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 9 Jan 2015 13:00 UTC), during weeks 51 to 52 (14 Dec 2014 to 27 Dec 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 80 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 96 535 specimens. 23 421 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 22 129 (94.5 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1292 (5.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 163 (1.7 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 9211 (98.3 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 423 (97.9 percent) belonged to the B Yamagata lineage and 9 (2.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Note: Global epidemiology and surveillance updates are periodically collected from data reported by national authorities or organizations responsible for reporting this data.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
------------------------------------------
North America

In the countries in the North America, the influenza season is ongoing with sharp increased activity in most countries and with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating. In Canada, although influenza-like illness (ILI) activity was below expected rates, the influenza detections increased sharply in the last few weeks to 29.1 percent, and widespread ILI/influenza activity was reported in 8 regions. The rate of antiviral prescriptions more than doubled from the previous week. Influenza A(H3N2) continued to be the most common detected influenza virus. Of the laboratory confirmed influenza virus detections, 97 percent were influenza A; 99.8 percent of the subtyped influenza A viruses were influenza A(H3N2). Among cases with reported ages, 56 percent were aged 65 years or older. Hospitalizations due to influenza increased, again with influenza A(H3N2) dominating. The majority (85 percent) of adult hospitalizations were among adults 65 years of age or older. The number of RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] detections increased as well. RSV and was the 2nd most frequently detected virus after influenza. In the United States of America (USA), the influenza detection rate continued to increase (30.4 percent positivity). ILI activity was rapidly increasing to 5.9 percent, which is at the level of the peak ILI activity seen in 2012-2013. All 10 regions were reporting ILI levels at or above regional-specific baseline levels, and 29 states reported high ILI activity.

The pneumonia and influenza mortality from the 122 cities reporting systems was 6.8 percent, just below the epidemic threshold of 6.9 percent. The overall hospitalization rate was 12.6 per 100 000 population, with the highest rate among adults aged 65 years or older and 94 percent of hospitalized adults had at least one reported underlying medical condition. Of 7289 influenza positive specimens, 96.6 percent were influenza A, and 3.4 percent were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses subtyped, 99 percent were influenza A(H3N2). Influenza viral characterization data indicated that 68.3 percent of the influenza A(H3N2) viruses collected and analyzed in the USA from 1 Oct through 21 Dec 2014 were antigenically different (drifted) from the A(H3N2) vaccine virus currently in the northern hemisphere influenza vaccine, but most were similar to the A(H3N2) vaccine virus strain selected for the 2015 southern hemisphere influenza vaccine. The RSV detection rate also increased. In the USA, all recently circulating influenza viruses that have been tested have been susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications. In Mexico, acute respiratory infections (ARI) activity increased and remained consistent with seasonal patterns, and influenza detections increased slightly.

Europe

In Europe, influenza activity remained low, but the season seemed to have started. Of the 649 specimens tested in the last week of 2014 from sentinel ILI and ARI patients from 25 countries, 85 samples (13 percent) from 15 countries tested positive for influenza virus. Influenza activity increased, mainly in the northwestern countries. The predominant influenza virus subtype circulating has been A(H3N2). Similar to the findings in the USA, viral characterization data in Europe showed that a proportion of the A(H3N2) viruses has drifted from the H3N2 vaccine virus. All 75 influenza A(H3N2) and 17 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested this season for neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility were sensitive to Oseltamivir and Zanamivir.

Northern Africa

In northern Africa, influenza detections continued to increase in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with influenza B virus dominating. Libya reported some severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Western and Central Asia region

In the central Asian region, influenza activity remained low, except for Uzbekistan, where an increased influenza A(H3N2) activity was reported. In western Asia, Bahrain and Qatar did report some influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity.

In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity increased. In north China, influenza activity continued to rise, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. ILI activity increased to 4.1 percent, following the seasonal trend. It was slightly higher but similar to the same week in the years 2010-2013, where it ranged between 2.7 and 3.9 percent. In Japan, influenza activity increased, with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. In Mongolia, ILI activity continued to rise and exceed the upper tolerance limit but with no indication of increased laboratory-confirmed influenza detections positive for influenza by subtype in eastern Asia.

Countries in the tropical zone
----------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall in this region, influenza activity was low. In Cuba, influenza A(H3N2) detections started to decrease in the last few weeks. In Central America, influenza activity has decreased after a wave of influenza A(H3N2) activity, but RSV activity remains high. Tropical countries in South America reported low ILI, SARI and laboratory-confirmed influenza activity.

Central African tropical region

In Africa, influenza detections were reported from a few countries. Cote d'Ivoire reported mainly influenza B detections, while the United Republic of Tanzania reported mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections. In Madagascar and Zambia, influenza activity caused by both influenza A and influenza B viruses was decreasing.

Tropical Asia
-----------
In most southern Asian and Southeastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low. Influenza activity was at an inter-seasonal level in the southern hemisphere countries, except for some Pacific Islands, where high activity was reported in American Samoa, Niue, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.

Footnote: The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet(reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

No novel antigenic variants of the familiar current A and B-type seasonal influenza viruses have made an appearance, nor have there been isolations of mutants showing resistance to the currently available neuraminidase activity inhibitors. It is likely, therefore, that the currently employed vaccine will be reasonably protective. Respiratory syncytial has become predominant in some Caribbean countries wherever influenza has declined. - Mod.CP]
