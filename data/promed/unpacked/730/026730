A man [father of the family], 62, has lost 3 members of his family while he and his son's fiancée are battling for life after being infected in Kozhikode district's Changaroth village between 5-19 May [2018] from what was then termed as a mystery disease.

The infection, which since then is believed to have caused 12 deaths in Kerala, has been identified as Nipah virus infection, a rare disease that spreads from animals and has never been reported in the state before.

The father, who on Monday [21 May 2018] was also confirmed to have been infected with the Nipah virus, has lost his sons, 28 and 26, and his brother 's wife 50. A nurse, who treated them at a government hospital, has died as well.

[The father], a collections agent at a small educational institute, is on life-support with fever and Nipah symptoms. He lost one son to a road accident 2 years ago.

Among those being treated for Nipah virus in the state is a woman, 19, the fiancée of the man's eldest son, a civil engineer who was about to leave for a job in Qatar. The young man succumbed to the infection on 19 May [2018].

"The father had asked his son to clean the well before he left the country, which he did with the help of his brothers. Little did they know what fate awaited them," said one of their relatives, who runs a small grocery shop in the neighbourhood.

The bats living in Moosa's well have been identified as the source of the outbreak by the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the well has been sealed, along with many others in the neighbourhood.

Fruit bats are considered to be natural hosts of the virus.

Bats are common in this part of Kerala and have never before been identified as a source of infection. Changaroth residents said bats usually seek small cracks and wedges inside wells to beat the summer heat. Some people cover their wells with nets to keep them out, but most don't bother.

The infection appears to have spared the father's wife and another son, who have shown no symptoms of the disease but have been kept under observation for 2 weeks, according to World Health Organization protocol.

[This unfortunate situation is the 1st reported outbreak of Nipah virus infection in Kerala state, although cases have occurred in West Bengal state as recently as last year (2017).

The implication of Nipah virus in bats recovered from the well is surprising. The species of bats in which the virus was found is not indicated. The reservoirs of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and presumably in India, are giant fruit bats ("flying foxes" in the genus _Pteropus_). These bats roost in large trees and not in wells. Either the positive bats recovered from the well are another species not in the genus _Pteropus_ or are giant fruit bats with very different roosting behavior. It would be helpful to know whether the virus was confirmed present in the bats by laboratory testing or presumed positive by association with the human cases. - Mod.TY

The number of deaths due to Nipah virus rose to 11 with the reporting of 2 more deaths here on Tuesday [22 May 2018]. These 2 persons -- one, 45 years old, from Koorachundu and the other, 52, from Chokiyad -- died here on Tuesday morning [22 May 2018].

The 1st one got the infection from Perambra taluk hospital where he had gone for treatment at the time when 3 deceased persons from the same family of Changaroth underwent treatment. With the reporting of 2 more cases, the total number of Nipah virus confirmed cases rose to 13 on the day, including 11 deaths. The remaining 2 persons have been undergoing treatment at private hospitals.

Health Minister KK Shailaja here on Tuesday [22 May 2018] said that of the 18 samples sent for testing, Nipah virus infection was confirmed in 12 samples, which include 10 confirmed Nipah virus deaths from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. It is the 1st time that Nipah virus deaths have been reported in Malappuram district.

The samples were collected from a nurse of Perambra Taluk hospital, who died on 21 May 2018, and the other one, 40, hailing from Kootalida, and another, 48, hailing from Kolathur. Sindhu and a 3rd, hailing from Malappuram, died on 20 May [2018], while another 2 persons on 21 May [2018] were tested positive.

Earlier, 3 persons in a family hailing from Soopikkada in Changaroth died of Nipha virus infection. Of this, lab testing was conducted on the samples taken from 2 deceased people from the same family who died on 18 and 19 May 2018. A son, 26, hailing from the same family, died on 5 May [2018] with symptoms of Nipah virus. The health department swung into action soon after the reporting of the 2nd death of the other son from the same family on 18 May 2018 after the private hospital alerted the health department.

Health minister KK Shailaja said that a total of 14 persons have been admitted to the Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital. "Of the 14, 2 of them have been admitted to the ICU of the Institute of Chest Diseases and 9 to the geriatric ward of the Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital. Another 3 nurses of Perambra EMS Cooperative hospital have been kept under observation at the Kozhikode medical college hospital," said the minister.

Health minister KK Shailaja said that better treatment faculties have already been made available at the Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital to meet the demands of the people. The minister also advised the public not to panic as the disease was spread among people who have come in direct contact with the infected patients.

[The number of Nipah virus infections in this case cluster is increasing. Apparently, some are nosocomial infections rather than zoonotic ones acquired from bats. One hopes that barrier nursing with the use of personal protective equipment is now in place to prevent further hospital-based infections. - Mod.TY
