Artesunate now available for treatment of severe malaria in the United States
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of today, intravenous (IV) artesunate is
available for treatment of severe malaria in the
United States through an Investigational New Drug
(IND) Protocol at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). Artesunate is in the class
of medications known as artemisinins, which are
derivatives from the "quing hao" or sweet
wormwood plant (Artemisia annua). This is the
first artemisinin to be available in the United
States. Only CDC's Drug Service and Quarantine
Stations will be permitted to release the medication for use.
Approximately 1400 cases of malaria are diagnosed
in the United States each year; approximately 5
to 10 percent of them are cases of severe
malaria. Until now, intravenous quinidine
gluconate was the only parenteral drug available
in the United States for the treatment of severe
malaria. However, quinidine has cardiotoxic
effects and has become less and less available in
US hospitals with the advent of newer antiarrhythmic drugs.
Walter Reed Army Institute for Research (WRAIR)
has agreed to provide a supply of this medication
to the CDC for release to hospitals in the United
States with malaria patients who need IV
treatment because of severe disease, high
parasitemia, or inability to take oral
medications, and who either do not have timely
access to intravenous quinidine, do not tolerate
quinidine, have contraindications to quinidine,
or in whom quinidine treatment has proven ineffective.
The drug will be provided to hospitals free of
charge upon request and on an emergency basis, by
the CDC Drug Service or by one of the CDC
Quarantine Stations located around the country.
Physicians who receive the drug will be requested
to notify CDC of any adverse event following administration of the drug.
To enroll a patient with severe malaria in this
treatment protocol, contact the CDC Malaria
Hotline: 770-488-7788 (M-F, 8am-4:30pm, eastern
time) or after hours, call: 770-488-7100 and
request to speak with a CDC Malaria Branch clinician.

[Artemisinins are indicated in severe malaria;
i.e., infections with parasitemia of 5 percent or
above or when complicated with, for instance,
severe anemia, renal failure and cerebral
symptoms. The standard treatment of complicated
malaria is intravenous qunine, but artemisinins
are indicated if resistance to quinine is
suspected. There are some studies indicating that
artemisinins given intravenously clear parasites
more rapidly than intravenous quinine, thus
providing a therapeutic benefit in very severe cases. � Mod.EP]
