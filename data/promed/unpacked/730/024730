Imported frozen raspberries cause a series of norovirus outbreaks in
Denmark, 2005
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 6 point source outbreaks of norovirus infection from June to
September 2005 in Denmark have now been linked to frozen raspberries
imported from Poland. This number includes 2 outbreaks reported on
previously (1). All outbreaks occurred in institutions or commercial
catering settings (Table). A cold dish prepared from frozen raspberries
which had not been heated had been served one day before the start of each
outbreak. In the first 5 outbreaks, frozen raspberry pieces had been used,
which could be traced to the same large batch imported to Denmark from
Poland in spring 2005. With more than 1000 people affected in total, this
batch has caused the largest number of foodborne infections attributable to
a single vehicle in Denmark in many years.
Table of outbreaks of norovirus infection caused by contaminated frozen
raspberries, Denmark 2005
--------------------------------------------------
Place/ Start date / Cases / Microbiology
(1) Aalborg hospital (Jutland) / 21 May / about 450 patients and staff /
norovirus GG II.7
(2) Nursing home, Greater Copenhagen / 30 May / about 70 residents and
staff / clinically norovirus (by Kaplan criteria (2)) *
(3) Meals-on-wheels service, Copenhagen area / 2 June / about 400 clients /
norovirus GG II.4
(4) Private function at a restaurant, Sj�and / 7 August / about 40
participants / norovirus GG II.b
(5) Nursing home, Greater Copenhagen / 16 August / about 50 residents and
staff / norovirus GG II.7
(6) Clothing company, Jutland / 7 September / 33 employees / norovirus
(typing results pending)
* stool samples for norovirus testing were not available, because the
outbreak was reported after a delay of 5 weeks
Frozen raspberry pieces were first identified as the likely outbreak
vehicle through case control studies done during the first outbreak, which
occurred in Aalborg hospital at the end of May 2005. After being informed
of this result by the food authorities, the importer withdrew the
incriminated batch of frozen raspberry pieces from the market. Delays in
the implementation of the withdrawal resulted in a 2nd large outbreak among
elderly clients of a meals-on-wheels service in early June. An estimated
400 people (median age 85 years, range 41-102) were affected and at least
23 required hospital admission.
Cohort studies and microbiological investigations of the 2 outbreaks in
August provided evidence that the withdrawal had not been effectively
implemented, even by then. The findings prompted a public warning by the
Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) against the use of frozen
raspberry pieces from this particular imported batch by a press release
with a link to their homepage, where details about the product were
provided (3). The withdrawal process is also the subject of discussion by
the Danish parliamentary committee overseeing the food and agricultural
policies. As far as is known, the implicated raspberry pieces have only
been sold to commercial and institutional caterers (in bags of 2.5 kg) and
not to the general public.
The latest outbreak in September 2005 occurred after consumption of a dish
prepared with whole frozen raspberries, supplied by a different Polish
producer to a different Danish importer. A cohort study among all employees
of the affected company in Jutland showed that having eaten
hindbaerkoldskal (a traditional Danish cold dish made from buttermilk,
fromage frais, sugar and vanilla sugar with raspberries added) in the
company canteen, was associated with illness with a risk ratio of 12.2 (95
per cent CI 3.2-47). The attack rate was 82 per cent among the exposed, and
31 of 33 patients recalled eating the raspberry dish (preliminary data).
Other food items (pineapple, chicken burger, tomatoes), which were
associated with illness in the univariable analysis, showed no significant
association in the multivariable analysis. A sample of the frozen
raspberries is currently being tested for norovirus. Theoretically, one of
the other ingredients of the hindbaerkoldskal could have caused the
outbreak, although, of all the ingredients, only frozen raspberries have
previously been reported as a vehicle of norovirus outbreaks (in Finland
1998 (4), Sweden 2001 (5), France 2005 (6)). The DVFA immediately issued a
press release with information about the incriminated raspberry batch (7).
Stool samples were available from patients in 5 of the outbreaks. Positive
results for norovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays confirmed the
cause of all 5 outbreaks. Surprisingly, different types of norovirus were
found: genogroup (GG) II.4 and GG II.b in one outbreak each, and GG II.7 in
2 outbreaks, whereas all samples from any given outbreak showed an
identical norovirus strain. All bacteriological stool tests were negative.
Enquiries into the origin of the raspberries provided some clues as to why
several different norovirus strains were found: what arrived in Denmark as
one large batch of frozen raspberries was composed of raspberries
originally grown on several different small-scale farms in Poland. The
raspberries were purchased during summer 2004 by a Polish company, which
froze and packed them in 2.5-kg plastic bags, before exporting them.
Contamination with norovirus may have occurred at farm level by
faecally-contaminated irrigation water, during harvesting by infected farm
workers and/or during processing and freezing by infected workers at
company level. Our hypothesis is that several independent contamination
events took place; this would explain the heterogeneous distribution of
norovirus strains in the shipment to Denmark. We have asked the Polish food
authorities to investigate, whether the frozen raspberry pieces and the
whole frozen raspberries originate from the same farms or processing company.
The Danish findings, including information about the exporters, were
reported to the European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), the
Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF,
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/rapidalert/index_en.htm>) and the
Foodborne Viruses in Europe network (FBVE,
<http://www.eufoodborneviruses.co.uk>).
As a short-term measure to prevent further outbreaks, it seems advisable to
heat frozen raspberries before consumption. For a more causal prevention,
the cultivation and production process of raspberries should be scrutinised.
As Polish frozen raspberries are known to be exported to several European
countries, it would be extremely surprising, if Denmark were the only
country where there were recent outbreaks due to frozen raspberries. The
authors would be very interested in information about norovirus outbreaks
associated with frozen raspberries or other berries from other countries.

According to researchers, one out of every 10 imported oysters screened in
Hong Kong showed evidence of contamination with norovirus -- the term for
Norwalk-like caliciviruses that cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. Senior
investigator Dr Wilina W L Lim told Reuters Health, "it appears that
oysters may be an important vehicle for introducing novel strains of
norovirus."
Outbreaks of gastric illness caused by norovirus are often linked to eating
oysters, and contamination appears to be widespread, noted Lim, at the
Public Health Laboratory Center, Kowloon, and colleagues in the Journal of
Medical Virology.
They found that 10.5 per cent of 507 samples of oysters from 11 countries
tested on arrival were positive for norovirus genetic material. In
particular, oysters from 6 countries were contaminated, while those from
the remaining 5 countries were not -- but the team does not say what those
countries were. A wide variety of virus strains was found, including 2
novel types.
"Given the popularity of consuming raw oysters in many countries, oysters
may serve (as) a vehicle for the dissemination of new norovirus strains,"
Lim's group concludes. Norovirus screening was also conducted following 13
outbreaks of oyster-associated gastroenteritis in hotels or restaurants in
Hong Kong. Norovirus sequences were detected in at least one oyster in 6
outbreaks. However, only in one outbreak was there a match between the
strains isolated from patients and those found in the oysters.
