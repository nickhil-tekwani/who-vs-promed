- The wheat blast outbreak in Bangladesh [ProMED-mail post 20160411.4150953] was not caused by a mutated rice blast strain. We found that the strains isolated from Bangladesh grouped very tightly with all known wheat blast strains from Brazil and not with any known rice blast strains.

- The wheat blast strains in Bangladesh are genetically very similar to wheat blast strains previously identified in Brazil. The genetically most similar strains were collected in Brazilian wheat fields and on associated weeds _Eleusine indica_ (goose grass) and _Cenchrus echinatus_ [burr grass] collected in Brazil.

- One of the genetically closest strains known from Brazil is PY0925. An additional Brazilian wheat blast strain, 205, is slightly more distant to the Bangladesh blast strains.

- The high similarity among the wheat blast strains from Bangladesh and Brazil suggests that wheat blast was introduced into Bangladesh from Brazil. Many fungal diseases can be transmitted via grains and previous research indicated that wheat blast can be seed-transmitted. A transmission of the disease from Brazil is plausible because Bangladesh is one of the largest Asian importers of wheat and Brazil is one of the major suppliers of wheat to Bangladesh.

- Other Asian countries that received wheat from Brazil, including Thailand, Philippines, and Viet Nam, should increase surveillance efforts to learn if wheat blast has entered into their wheat fields.

[Both wheat and rice blast are caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_, previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice. Over 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related fungal strains, each of which generally appear to affect only a limited number of host species. Further work is needed regarding genotypic differentiation related to host range, including differences between the wheat and rice pathovars. Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. Wheat blast is now considered an emerging disease and a threat to global food security.

Blast symptoms on wheat (and barley) may be confused with fusarium head blight (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives and link below) and include bleaching of ears, shriveled kernels, and no seed production at all for severe infections. Yield losses seem to average 40 to 50 per cent, but cases of 100 per cent losses have also been reported, and wheat production in some affected areas has ceased. Rice blast symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. Plants may be killed and yield losses are severe.

Humid and warm conditions favour disease development, but the life cycle of the fungus is still unknown. Spread of the rice pathogen occurs with infected plant material (including seed), mechanical means (including human and insect activity), water, and wind. It is likely that the wheat pathogen is spread in similar ways. Disease management of rice blast may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. Available wheat cultivars lack resistance to wheat blast and only limited tolerance can be found. Resistance breeding is difficult because the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. In Bolivia, a new strain of wheat blast is emerging which has broken resistance of wheat cultivars currently used in that country (see link below).

Initially, wheat blast was thought to be caused by a fungal strain which crossed from rice to wheat, but it is now considered more likely to originate from local wild grasses (for example, ProMED-mail post 20120430.1117921). This would suggest that genetic events leading to a change in host range from grasses to wheat have previously occurred separately in different locations and, therefore, may potentially occur again in other regions.

However, the results reported above show that the emergence of wheat blast in Bangladesh, and with it its 1st appearance in South Asia (ProMED-mail post 20160411.4150953), is due to introduction of the fungus with grain from Brazil. Similarly, recent sequencing studies have shown that rice blast strains in northern India are closely related to strains from the main origin of seed and food grain (ProMED-mail post 20160407.4145967). These recent findings stress again the importance of strict quarantine measures and biosecurity protocols for the international movement of any kind of plant material.
