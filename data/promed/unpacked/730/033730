The city [Winnipeg] is in the midst of its worst outbreak of syphilis this century. Officials with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority (WRHA) issued a bulletin to health-care providers across the city on [Fri 204 Oct 2014] revealing there have been 60 cases reported in the 1st 10 months of 2014 -- the fastest-spreading and highest number ever recorded in the Winnipeg Health Region. 8 to 10 cases are being reported per month, up from only 1 or 2 between 2007 and 2012.

"Most cases are being diagnosed in men who have sex with men," the bulletin reads. "About 1/3 of cases are HIV-positive and cases are spread evenly throughout all community areas in Winnipeg. "Cases have also been reported in all other" regional health authorities. The numbers are enough for the WRHA to declare the uptick in new cases an outbreak.

Patients testing positive for the infection must fill out a questionnaire that, among other things, asks about their sexual history. Health officials have also held information sessions and purchased advertising warning of the outbreak on social media sites.

Joss Reimer, medical officer of health for the WRHA, said about half of the new cases are admitting to having anonymous sex with partners they've met on hookup sites like Grindr and Squirt.

The rise in numbers isn't unique to Winnipeg. Reimer said other major Canadian cities have also seen a rise in syphilis cases in recent years. So have other health regions in Manitoba, albeit not at the same rate as Winnipeg, she said.

Symptoms of syphilis, which is spread by direct sexual contact with infectious lesions that usually develop on or near the genitals, include painless genital or oral ulcers, and progressing to include a rash all over the body and abnormal lymph nodes.

Reimer said the high number of cases involving HIV-positive patients may be a sign of people knowing they shouldn't have unprotected intercourse, but mistakenly believing they can engage in unprotected oral sex without consequence.

The infection is easily curable if caught early, Reimer said, noting it could take as little as one round of antibiotics to eliminate it. The danger is in those who don't treat it. The infection can lie dormant in a person's body for years, but eventually cause such things as dementia if left unchecked. The best way to avoid trouble isn't complicated, Reimer said. If you're sexually active, use protection and ask your doctor for testing for sexually transmitted infections on a regular basis. "Make it a part of your health routine to be tested regularly," she said.

[In many countries, the increased incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

Winnipeg, with a population of 663 617, is the capital and largest city of the Canadian province of Manitoba (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg).
