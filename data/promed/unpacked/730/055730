The Regional Ministerial Secretariat reported that the Public Health Institute (ISP) confirmed a case of human brucellosis in La Araucania.

The case is that of a 44-year-old man, living in Temuco, who in October 2011 consulted the health services for headaches. Over the following months he developed various symptoms such as fever, profuse sweating, chills, abdominal pain, and weight loss. He was admitted to the Hospital Dr Hernan Enriquez Aravena, Temuco after the diagnosis of brucellosis was made.

Dr Claudio Armstrong, deputy health authority, detailed that the affected man "is an employee of a meat processing plant in the region. The bacterial strain _Brucella abortus_ (a bacterium transmitted mainly from cattle) was isolated by the ISP so we have the definitive diagnosis and the infection was most likely acquired within the meat processing plant."

This is the 2nd case detected in the region in 5 years. The last fatality from brucellosis occurred in 1990. According to statistics from the Health Service, in all of Chile 16 cases were reported in 2009 and 4 in 2010.

[Brucellosis (http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was first described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses so that recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is vital. - Mod.LL
