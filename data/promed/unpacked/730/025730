The disease that has killed more than 6 million bats in North America hasn't spared Georgia.

Since white-nose syndrome was 1st found here in 2013, the number of bats has plummeted by about 90 percent in caves and mines the Georgia Department of Natural Resources [DNR] surveys each winter.

"They're just gone," said Katrina Morris, lead bat researcher for DNR's Nongame Conservation Section.

The surveys help gauge the impact of white-nose syndrome, or WNS, in the state. Nongame Conservation checked 20 hibernacula or refuges this winter, all but 2 of them in north Georgia.

Morris' report notes that:
- 16 (out of 20) either tested positive for the fungus that causes white-nose, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ (Pd), or showed signs of being infected.
- In the 10 caves checked annually since at least 2014, bat counts are down overall by 92 percent.
- Except for gray bats, no other bats of the genus _Myotis_ were seen. While counts of bats in this genus are always low in north Georgia caves, this was the 1st time researchers found none, Morris said.

First documented in North America in New York in 2007, white-nose has spread through the eastern U.S. and into Canada. The disease took a 1300-mile leap from Minnesota to Washington in March [2016], when a sick bat near Seattle tested positive. In Georgia, white-nose is confirmed or suspected in 11 counties. White-nose poses no known risk to humans.

The fungus Pd results in bats being awakened too often from hibernation or less intense torpor, and using fat reserves needed for hibernation long before winter is over.

Death rates of 90-100 percent have been seen at some hibernacula. Causes of death vary from starvation to stressed immune systems.

One of the 1st sites in Georgia documented with white-nose is also one of the most telling examples of the fallout. Counts at Sitton's Cave, a popular grotto at Cloudland Canyon State Park in northwest Georgia, have shrunk from more than 1700 bats in 2013 to 62 this year, a 96 percent decline.

Morris said that unlike at some affected hibernacula in the North, where dead or dying bats are found in the snow near entrances, in Georgia "we don't usually see piles of dead bats. We see missing bats."

There is good news. Some bats are surviving for years at affected sites, and some species, including the federally endangered gray bat, don't appear to be developing white-nose, though they carry the fungus.

Also, scientists are working to combat white-nose, including an effort involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Georgia State University researchers testing a bacterium aimed at inhibiting growth of the fungus.

DNR is following a response plan that outlines steps for raising awareness of the disease, combating its spread, reporting and analyzing bats, and managing related natural resources. Learn more at http://www.georgiawildlife.com/WNS.

Why Bats Matter
---------------
The loss of bats can contribute to widespread ecological effects. Bats help:
- Control insects: A little brown bat can eat its weight in insects in a night; 1 million bats can consume nearly 700 tons a year.
- Enrich cave ecosystems
- Feed other animals: Wildlife varying from owls to raccoons prey on bats.
- Pollinate plants and disperse seeds: More than 300 species of fruit, including mangoes, depend on bats for pollination.
- Benefit science: Research on bats has led to developments in sonar, vaccines and other areas.
- Serve as indicator species: Population changes can indicate broader ecological issues such as the loss of forest habitat.
