The Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) has urged farmers to fully welcome the National Cocoa Rehabilitation Program as they prepare to clear cocoa affected with swollen shoot. Their checks have revealed that out of a total of 1.9 million hectares [about 4.7 million acres] of cocoa farms surveyed, 315 800 hectares [about 780 000 acres] have been affected by the swollen shoot virus disease. The Western North Region alone had 214 500 hectares [about 530 000 acres] of affected farms.

Cocobod have advised landowners and cocoa farmers to allow their infected trees to be cut down and replanted with high-yielding, early-bearing, and disease-tolerant seedlings for increased and sustainable yield. [They] have reviewed upwards the compensation for landowners and farmers who agree to cut and replant their swollen shoot virus-affected cocoa under the on-going National Cocoa Rehabilitation Programme.

The cost of cutting the infected trees and replanting will be borne by the government and Cocobod. In addition, plantain suckers and seedlings [of] economic trees will be supplied at no cost to the affected farmers.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa (CSSD) caused by species of genus _Badnavirus_ can lead to severe crop losses. The viruses are thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viruses or strains and may include leaf banding; severe effects on shoots and roots resulting in serious dieback or even death of the tree; or no symptoms at all. The viruses are spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Transmission with pollen and via true seed is considered unlikely, but spread on seed surfaces cannot be excluded so far.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control and native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Keeping replanted trees from becoming reinfected would be challenging under local conditions, thus ongoing breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties (as mentioned above) are crucial. Cross protection against severe viral strains by mild strains is also being trialled (see link below).

A westward spread of CSSD in Ghana led to a serious outbreak with more severe symptoms in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) and the possibility of the involvement of a new viral strain was considered. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast signed an agreement to tackle the disease and subsequently molecular work has increased. The 3 badnaviruses currently recognised as cause of the disease are _Cacao swollen shoot virus_, _Cacao swollen shoot CD virus_, and _Cacao swollen shoot Togo A virus_. Additional proposed species Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) and Cacao red vein-banding virus (CRVBV) were isolated from field samples (ProMED-mail post 20171025.5404488 and links below). CRVV is suspected to be the causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype of CSSD.

Additional virus sequences were constructed by _in silico_ analysis of field samples collected in West Africa (ProMED-mail post 20180409.5734172). Whether these are associated with intact virus particles and thus represent actual infectious viruses involved in CSSD _in vivo_ will need to be verified by pathogenicity and epidemiology studies. Of all currently known CSSD-associated viruses, pathogenicity studies to prove infectivity in the host (according to Koch's Postulates) have so far only been carried out with a single inoculum of cloned CSSV.
