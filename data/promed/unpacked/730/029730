Common Virus Linked With Severe Bowel Disease
---------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: A common virus may be the cause of many hard-to-treat cases of
inflammatory bowel disease, researchers in Italy report. More than one third
of patients in a new study who had colitis that did not respond to steroids
were infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), the investigators found. A form of
inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, causes the large intestine
to become inflamed and ulcerated, leading to bloody diarrhoea, abdominal
cramps and fever. Colitis can also occur in patients with Crohn's disease, a
chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall.
More than half of the population is infected with CMV, [a large DNA virus
belonging to the Subfamily _Betaherpesvirinae_ of the Family
_Herpesviridae_]. The virus rarely causes problems in adults with healthy
immune systems, although it can cause symptoms in people with weakened
immune systems, such as those infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
Previous reports have linked CMV infection to relapses of inflammatory bowel
disease, especially in cases that are resistant to the steroids used to
treat the illness. But the rate of CMV infection among patients with
inflammatory bowel disease is uncertain, according to Dr. Mario Cottone and
colleagues at the University of Palermo. To see how common CMV infection is
among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, Cottone's team studied 55
patients with ulcerative colitis and 7 with Crohn's disease. In 30 per cent
of the patients, steroid therapy did not clear up symptoms.
To test for CMV infection, the researchers performed rectal biopsies in the
patients whose symptoms were resistant to steroids. CMV was present in 7 out
of 19 (36 percent) of these patients, the authors report in the March issue
of The American Journal of Gastroenterology. A total of 5 of the 7 patients
with CMV responded well to antiviral treatment, the report indicates. In all
5 cases, the virus was no longer detectable after treatment. [The antiviral
ganciclovir was used in 3 cases, and foscarnet in the other 2 cases. -
Mod.CP]. However, one of the 2 patients who did not respond to antiviral
treatment had to have surgery to treat colitis.
The study demonstrates that CMV infection frequently occurs in severe cases
of inflammatory bowel disease that do not respond to steroid therapy.
Cottone's team concludes that cytomegalovirus infection is a frequent cause
of severe refractory colitis and that rectal biopsy should always be
performed in severe steroid-resistant colitis.
