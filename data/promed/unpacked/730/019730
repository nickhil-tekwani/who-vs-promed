Four Redmond School District (RSD) students have been diagnosed with whooping cough, also known as pertussis, prompting letters to parents from district schools, advising of possible exposure and symptoms to watch for.

School district spokesman Rainier Butler said [Wed 18 Apr 2018] that Deschutes County Public Health had advised of the cases and "recommended with notify all RSD families about possible exposure, symptoms and prevention."

Family Choice Urgent Care physician Dr. Terri Mucha said [Wed 18 Apr 2018] that for the most part, immunizations have gotten rid of the disease. "Whooping cough is caused by the pertussis bacteria, so antibiotics do treat it. It can be serious in the young kids or the elderly," Mucha said. "It is something that is part of our childhood immunization, so it is something we have successfully eradicated for a while now."

Lane County Public Health has confirmed 10 cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, at Sheldon High School in Eugene [Oregon].

Dr. Patrick Luedtke with Lane County Public Health says pertussis can spread quickly among those who are not vaccinated. Luedtke: "We are not the best vaccinated state and Lane County is not the best vaccinated of Oregon's 36 counties, so we are clearly at risk. So this is a preventive measure to say, it's out there, go get protected, and practice respiratory etiquette."

Last week Burnett County Health Department sent a letter to Siren School about a pertussis outbreak in Polk County. "Polk County Health Department is actively investigating an outbreak of pertussis that started with the first reported case on [28 Mar 2018]," said Anna Treague, nurse for Public Health in the letter. "There are currently 12 lab-confirmed or epi-linked cases in this outbreak. All of the cases are high school students in the St. Croix Falls school district in Polk County. All have been fully immunized with pertussis containing vaccines."

Siren School nurse Karen Vanek, said on [Tue 1 May 2018] that there were still no cases of pertussis in Siren School [Burnett County].

"Polk County is working closely with the school district in an effort to distribute information to parents and to assist in isolating symptomatic students who may need testing or who are awaiting test results," Treague said. "Some close contacts may attend other schools in Polk County or neighboring counties. We will be notified if we have contacts or suspect cases in our county."

The best way to prevent whooping cough is to get vaccinated for it. Children need 5 doses of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine. The series of shots is given at ages 2, 4, 6 and 15 months with a booster between the ages of 4 and 6. Teenagers should get the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine around age 11 or 12. Pregnant women are advised to get one Tdap dose during [each of their pregnancies] and other adults should also get the vaccine once in their life.

The Bureau of Communicable Diseases also suggests keeping babies and other high-risk people away from people who are sick.

People with questions can contact Burnett County Public Health at 715-349-7600.

A spokesperson for Spartanburg District Five Schools said a total of 4 students have been diagnosed with whooping cough, although the Department of Health and Environmental Control said only 3 cases had been confirmed.

Melissa Robinette said the ill students attend Abner Creek Elementary and Beech Springs Intermediate School. Robinette said DHEC sent a letter to parents on [Mon 7 May 2018] warning them about signs of whooping cough and what to look for.

Students are required to have the vaccine, called the Tdap vaccine, before beginning school in South Carolina and must have a booster shot before entering the seventh grade, Robinette said. "However, South Carolina is one of many states that allows exemptions to vaccinations for religious reasons," Robinette stated.
