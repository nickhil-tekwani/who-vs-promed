New Dengue Fever Cases Reported in Maui
---------------------------------------
A total of 14 new dengue fever cases has been confirmed by federal
health officials in Hawaii's first outbreak of the mosquito-borne
disease in more than 50 years. Last week, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention confirmed that 4 people had contracted dengue
fever, which is rarely fatal. All 4 have since recovered.
The 18 cases reported so far have been confined to the remote Hana and
Nahiku areas of East Maui, said Dr. David Sasaki of the State
Department of Health. More cases are suspected and awaiting
confirmation by the CDC, he said.
Dengue fever causes severe headaches, fever, and rashes. The more
serious dengue hemorrhagic fever has a fatality rate of 5%, according
to the CDC. There is no vaccine or specific treatment.
Dengue fever had been reported previously in Hawaii, but by people who
had contracted the disease elsewhere. None of the newly confirmed
cases involved people who had recently traveled away from Maui, Sasaki
said.
State health officials say the best way to fight the disease is to
eradicate the mosquitoes that carry it. They have sprayed areas where
dengue fever has occurred, and encouraged residents to eliminate
standing water, which acts as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.
