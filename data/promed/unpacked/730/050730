Outbreak update -- Cholera in Yemen, 24 May 2020
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen reported 2489 suspected cases and one associated death during epidemiological week 21 (18-24 May) of 2020, with 16% of the cases reported as severe. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases from 1 Jan 2018 to 17 May 2020 is 1 368 325 with 1566 associated deaths (CFR 0.11%). Children under 5 represent 23% of the total suspected cases during 2020. The outbreak has affected 22 of the 23 governorates and 293 of the 333 districts of Yemen.

Suspected cholera cases at the country level started to be increasingly reported from week 8 of 2019 [18-24 Feb 2019] and the trend continued until week 14 [1-7 Apr 2019] when the number of cases reached more than 29 500, the highest number of cases reported so far. The number of suspected cases fluctuated over the following period with the trend now considered as decreasing during the past 3 weeks based on the average number of cases calculated between weeks 19 and 21 [6-26 May 2019].

The governorates reporting the highest number of suspected cases of cholera during 2020 are Al Hudaydah (21 612), Sana'a (20 620), Taizz (17 190), Ibb (13 350), Al Bayda (12 294), Amanat Al Asimah (10 869), Hajjah (9724), and Dhamar (9271).

Of a total of 935 samples tested at the central public health laboratories since January 2020, 76 have been confirmed as cholera-positive by culture. During this reporting period the governorates reporting the highest number of positive cultures were Taizz (49), Al Hudaydah (6), and Amran (5).

WHO continues to provide leadership and support for activities with health authorities and partners to respond to this ongoing cholera outbreak including case management; surveillance and laboratory investigations; hotspot mapping and oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign planning; water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH); and risk communication.

[Cholera has been a major problem in this war torn country for a number of years. Given the quite low case fatality rate, it is certainly likely that many of the cases are due to other gastrointestinal pathogens other than _Vibrio cholera_. - Mod.LL

[2] Cholera - Somalia

More than 500 people have succumbed to cholera and acute diarrhea and left tens of thousands of others sick in Somalia since January 2020, the United Nations said Thursday [4 Jun 2020]. The UN's health agency said the epidemic had left more than 25 000 people sick, warning that number was likely to double by the end of June 2020.

WHO put the number of deaths since the beginning of the year [2020] from the epidemic at 524, while the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said 533 people had died. The case fatality rate, which measures the severity of an epidemic by defining the proportion of fatal cases within a specific timeframe, is currently 2.1 per cent -- more than double the emergency threshold of 1 per cent. OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said the situation was particularly alarming in the Middle Juba and Bakool regions, where the case fatality rates have surged to 14.1 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively.

The epidemic comes as the Horn of Africa country of 12 million people faces the threat of its 3rd famine in 25 years of civil war and anarchy.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
