EU extends US poultry ban due to Newcastle disease
--------------------------------------------------
The European Union (EU) has extended its ban on poultry imports from the
United States as the highly contagious Newcastle disease [NCD] spreads
across more US state borders, the EU executive said on Thu 24 Apr 2003.
All live poultry imports including hatching eggs, fresh poultry meat, and
poultry products were now stopped from El Paso and Hudspeth counties in the
US state of Texas and the counties of Dona Ana, Luna, and Otero in
neighbouring New Mexico [for background on the inclusion of New Mexico, see
ref 20030423.0987 - Mod.AS].
The confirmation of an outbreak of the virus in Texas on 11 Apr 2003 had
prompted the 15-nation block to extend its ban, the European Commission
said. At the end of January 2003 the EU blocked poultry imports from
California, Nevada, and Arizona after outbreaks of the disease in those
states. The extended ban will now apply until 1 Aug 2003.
NCD can wipe out poultry populations and affects the birds' respiratory,
nervous, and digestive systems. It spreads primarily through direct contact
between healthy birds and the bodily discharges of infected birds. The
virus is fatal for fowl but harmless to humans. The last US outbreak was in
1971.
