Harare City Council's battle with waterborne diseases continues unabated with a fresh outbreak reported in Mbare's Matapi flats at the weekend [22-23 Oct 2017], raising fears that the disease could blow out of control if it is not contained before the onset of the rainy season.

The latest outbreak, confirmed by council spokesperson Michael Chideme yesterday, 22 Oct 207, has been blamed on water shortages, raw sewer spillages and uncollected garbage in the city's populous high-density suburb. "There is typhoid scare in the Mbare suburb and our medical team is on the ground attending to the suspected cases," Chideme said. He referred further questions to council's health services director Prosper Chonzi, who was not immediately available for comment.

When NewsDay visited Matapi Clinic, patients with suspected symptoms of typhoid were frequenting the health centre after almost every 10 minutes. At least 6 people are reported to have succumbed to typhoid and other related diseases since 2016 in Harare from some 83 cases recorded. There were a total of 2531 suspected typhoid cases throughout the country. Over 4000 people died of cholera in 2008 and since then, Harare has continued to struggle with bouts of tropical disease outbreaks. Harare's old sewerage reticulation system was installed by the Rhodesian government over 50 years ago and was initially meant to cater for a far smaller population than the estimated four million inhabitants currently in the capital.

Meanwhile, local health institutions were recently urged to switch to antimicrobials such as ceftriaxone and azithromycin to treat typhoid amid reports of an emerging antimicrobial resistance strain of the tropical disease to first line drugs such as ciprofloxacin.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL

The article's mention of ciprofloxacin resistance raises the concern of whether the H58 strain reported from Kenya earlier this year (2017), which carries plasmids encoding quinolone resistance, could be involved in this Harare outbreak. - Mod.LXL
