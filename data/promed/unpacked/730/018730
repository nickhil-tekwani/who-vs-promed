In New Caledonia, 63 cases of leptospirosis have already been identified since January [2022]. 55 patients had to be hospitalized, including 20 in intensive care. Rat disease [leptospirosis] occurs every year during the rainy season.

In case of fatigue, high fever, muscle, joint, and abdominal pain, consult a doctor as soon as possible. Last year [2021], 4 people died of leptospirosis. Since the beginning of the year [2022], 63 cases of contamination [infection] with this bacterium, called rat disease, have been identified, of which 87% [55 of 63 cases] have led to hospitalization.

New Caledonia is not spared by this serious, sometimes fatal disease. Last year [2021], [there were] 229 cases. "It is a disease that is found more frequently at the beginning of the year. This disease must be diagnosed early enough, so that it can be treated as quickly as possible," explains Stéphane Chabaud, leptospirosis nurse.

"The time between when we are exposed and when we develop clinical signs [the incubation period] varies, roughly, from one to 3 weeks. At the start of the disease, the signs can resemble other diseases, such as dengue and COVID-19. If we wait, jaundice may appear," adds Dr Anne Pfannstiel, prevention doctor at Dass-NC (Directorate of the health and social agency).

"We have a resurgence of cases, usually in the 1st half of the year. In 1999, we had 19 deaths due to leptospirosis," she continues. In 2 months in 2022, 63 cases have been recorded. "It's huge, with 22 children affected. 2/3 of the cases concern the North Province," specifies the doctor. The province of the Loyalty Islands is, on the contrary, spared. Since January [2022], the youngest patient reported is 6 years old and the oldest is 71 years old. The greatest caution is therefore recommended, especially since this disease can be avoided.

New Caledonia (pop., 271 407 in 2019), a French overseas territory, is an archipelago, located east of Australia, north of New Zealand, south of the Equator, and just west of Fiji and Vanuatu; it includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, and smaller islands and is divided into 3 provinces -- the North and South Provinces are on the main island, while the Loyalty Islands Province is a series of islands east of the main island (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or freshwater contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Heavy rainfall affected New Caledonia from Tropical Cyclone Dovi on 10 Feb 2022 (https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/461257/tropical-cyclone-dovi-causes-major-flooding-in-vanuatu). Warnings for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were again issued in Grande Terre for the eastern coast and for the south-western coast in mid-February 2022 (https://reliefweb.int/report/new-caledonia-france/new-caledonia-flood-gdacs-meteo-new-caledonia-media-echo-daily-flash-14). According to the news report above, 2/3 of the cases of leptospirosis were reported in the North Province, which is said to usually receive the most rain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_New_Caledonia). - Mod.ML
