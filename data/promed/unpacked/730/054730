https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/south-india-n440k-covid-variant-15-times-lethal-replaced-by-double-mutant-uk-variants-data-1798771-2021-05-04


Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging across the globe, continuing to threaten efforts to stem the world's worst virus outbreak. The variants with N440K spike substitution have been detected in several parts of India, which has been hit by the 2nd wave of the pandemic.

Scientists at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) have found that lineages with N440K are not the dominant ones in the 2nd wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India. It was CCMB that had discovered the new coronavirus variant N440K. Experts have also said that the new prevalent variant, N440K, is at least 15 times more lethal than the earlier ones. They said it may even be stronger than the [B1.617 and B1.618 variants from India].

While N440K was indeed a mutation of concern in South India during and after the 1st wave, current data show that it is slowly being replaced by new variants of concern (VoCs), such as B.1.617 (dubbed a double-mutant variant) and B.1.1.7 (variant identified in the UK).

When comparing the data from Maharashtra, researchers found that the increase of B.1.617 variant was in February [2021] rather than in March 2021, and again a reduction in the proportion of lineages with N440K was observed. "The timing of the increase in B.1.617 coincides well with the 2nd waves seen in the respective states," finds Divya Tej Sowpati of CCMB.

According to him, in Maharashtra, one of the worst-affected states in the country, the 2nd wave started almost a month and half earlier than in the 4 southern states, along with the explosion of B.1.617 at the expense of lineages with the mutation N440K. "In Kerala, though not much data [are] available on GISAID, we can see from https://genescov2.genomes.in that B.1.1.7 is increasing at present, whereas N440K is present in less than 20% of the genomes," he further added.

Earlier, CCMB scientists had found that the N440K variant produced 10 times higher infectious viral titers than a prevalent A2a strain, and over 1000-fold higher titers than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 cells. However, this may not be a matter of concern because how a virus behaves in cell culture under controlled settings [without] competition may not be the same [as] in a complicated pandemic scenario.

Earlier, by June 2020, a variant with D614G substitution had become the predominant strain. Later, new variants were identified across the world, such as the B.1.1.7 lineage (UK), P.1 lineage (Brazil), and B.1.351 (South Africa).

A selection from the COVID scientific literature
------------------------------------------------
- Immune response differences to vaccines and COVID: A pre-peer-reviewed study compared immune responses in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and people vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. The immune response in infected people involved strong interferon activity that was absent in vaccinated people; interferon is a type of antiviral inflammation that leads to more potential cell damage. The T and B cells in vaccinated people were also more likely to be memory cells, which are capable of responding against future infections but do not contribute to active inflammation. See: Ivanova EN, Devlin JC, Buus TB, et al. Discrete immune response signature to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination versus infection. medRxiv. Epub 21 Apr 2021. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255677

- Household COVID risk and in-person schooling: A survey-based study finds an increased risk of COVID among people living with a child attending school in person. However, schools that had COVID mitigation strategies like symptom screening, teacher masking, and limitation of extracurricular activities drastically reduced this risk. See: Lessler J, Grabowski MK, Grantz KH, et al. Household COVID-19 risk and in-person schooling. Science. Epub 29 Apr 2021. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/28/science.abh2939

- Autoimmune reactivity in COVID patients with neurological symptoms: A study characterized antibodies produced within the central nervous system of some COVID patients who had neurological symptoms (such as dizziness, confusion, seizure, and weakness). The results show that a significant subset of these antibodies have autoimmunity. This means that some COVID patients may experience neurological symptoms from newly generated antibodies that attack their own neural tissue. See: Song E, Barley CM, Chow RD, et al. Divergent and self-reactive immune responses in the CNS of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Cell Rep Med. Epub 27 Apr 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100288

- Association of BMI and COVID outcomes: A study of almost 7 million individuals in the UK finds that body mass index (BMI) is strongly associated with COVID outcomes. For people with BMI greater than 23, there is a direct increase in the risk of severe COVID (leading to intensive care use and death) as BMI increases. This association holds regardless of the presence of other medical conditions and is more pronounced in people younger than 40 years old and those of Black ethnicity. See: Gao M, Piernas C, Astbury NM, et al. Associations between body-mass index and COVID-19 severity in 6.9 million people in England: a prospective, community-based, cohort study. Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. Epub 28 Apr 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(21)00089-9

- COVID drug discovery platform: Researchers have developed an experimental platform for testing COVID drugs. The platform involves lung organoids (artificially grown lung tissues that resemble an organ) made of human lung cells that have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. The resulting inflammation response can be harnessed in experiments on COVID disease progression and potential therapies. See: Mulay A, Konda B, Garcia G Jr, et al. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human lung epithelium for COVID-19 modeling and drug discovery. Cell Rep. Epub 13 Apr 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109055

- Immune protection elicited by Pfizer vaccine according to age: A study compared the immune protection elicited by the Pfizer COVID vaccine in people under 60 and people over 80 years old. The majority of the 179 individuals in both age-groups were able to make neutralizing antibodies, however, neutralizing antibody levels were significantly lower in elderly patients. After the 2nd dose, one-third of the elderly group had no detectable neutralizing antibodies, whereas only 2% of the younger group had no detectable neutralizing antibodies. This underscores the importance of continuing the use of interventions such as mask wearing to protect elderly individuals. See: Mueller L, Andree M, Moskorz W, et al. Age-dependent immune response to the Biontech/Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. Clin Infect Dis. Epub 27 Apr 2021. https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab381

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/covid-forecasters-warn-india-deaths-may-double-in-coming-weeks


The coronavirus wave that plunged India into the world's biggest health crisis has the potential to worsen in the coming weeks, with some research models projecting that the death toll could more than double from current levels. A team at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore used a mathematical model to predict about 404 000 deaths will occur by 11 Jun 2021 if current trends continue. A model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington forecasts 1 018 879 deaths by the end of July [2021].

While coronavirus cases can be hard to predict, particularly in a sprawling nation like India, the forecasts reflect the urgent need for India to step up public health measures like testing and social distancing. Even if the worst estimates are avoided, India could suffer the world's biggest COVID-19 death toll. The USA currently has the largest number of fatalities at around 578 000.

India added 357 229 new cases on Tuesday [4 May 2021], taking its total outbreak past 20 million infections and overall death toll to 222 408. In recent weeks, the scenes on the ground, with long lines outside crematoriums and hospitals turning away ambulances, have painted a picture of a nation overwhelmed by the crisis.

"The next 4-6 weeks are going to be very, very difficult for India," said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University School of Public Health. "The challenge is going to be to do things now that will make sure it is 4 weeks, not 6 or 8, and that we minimize how bad things will get. But in no way is India anywhere near out of the woods."

A spokesperson for the health ministry couldn't immediately be reached. The ministry said on Monday [3 May 2021] that in about a dozen states, including Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, there are early signs that the number of daily new infections are starting to plateau.

A prolonged crisis has the potential to dent the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as slow or reverse India's recovery from last year's [2020] economic recession. Bloomberg Economics lowered its growth projection for the year ending March 2022 to 10.7% from 12.6%, and even these numbers are flattered by a low base as activity ground to a halt due to a strict lockdown last year.

For public health researchers, a key concern is the relative dearth of coronavirus testing, which many scientists believe is causing a sharp undercounting of cases. "It could honestly get a lot worse, which is hard to imagine given how staggering the impacts have already been when you see 400 000 new cases each day and you know that that's probably an underestimation," said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.

The main metric that officials are watching is the test positivity rate, which is the percentage of people with positive test results. The overall positivity rate is 20% in India now, and in some parts of the country it tops 40%, a shockingly high number that indicates as many as three-fourths of infections are being missed, said Jha.

The World Health Organization considers anything above 5% too high, saying that governments should implement social distancing measures until positivity rates are below that level for at least 2 weeks. "Despite scaling up testing considerably, it's still not enough to capture all the infected people," said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, speaking on Bloomberg TV. "So the numbers, while very high, are likely an underestimate of the true numbers of infections," she said. "It's a grim situation."

The goal is to run enough tests [to prevent] a large number of infected people [from] going undiagnosed. If only the sickest patients are tested, many people with milder disease or no symptoms may continue to unwittingly spread the disease. "There are reports of tests being considerably delayed and of patients delaying having to go to hospital as much as they can, given the stresses on the health system," said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, who also works on modeling outbreaks. "We don't know enough about COVID-19 spread away from the major cities, in the rural heartland of India, although reports from there suggest that the situation is dire."

The US government, as part of a package of supplies for India, pledged last week to send one million rapid tests to India. There are several other things that could be done quickly to try to help staunch the outbreak. High on the list is wearing masks, a crucial element for disease control, said Catherine Blish, an infectious disease specialist and global health expert at Stanford Medicine in California. Major cities in India already require people to wear masks, but such rules can be harder to implement in crowded slums and rural areas. Several states have introduced lockdowns, although prime minister Modi has resisted a national effort after one imposed by him last year [2020] fueled a humanitarian crisis with migrant workers fleeing the cities on foot and in some cases bringing the virus with them.

The Indian Institute of Science has estimated that with a 15-day lockdown, deaths could be lower at 300 000, falling to 285 000 with a 30-day lockdown. [IHME] estimates a lower death toll of around 940 000 by the end of July [2021] with universal mask wearing.

Vaccines will be the big way to remove risks, although it will take time to get there, public health experts say. It takes several weeks for immunity to build after someone has been vaccinated. The process is even longer with those that require 2 shots, stretching the process out to 6 weeks to 2 months.

"The vaccines are working," said Kim Mulholland, an Australian pediatrician and leader of the infection and immunity group at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne. "They just haven't got the capacity." Ultimately, cases will come down, it's just a matter of when, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, and an adviser to US president Joe Biden.

Scientists still don't have a good understanding of why COVID-19 comes in sudden, roller-coaster-like changes, he said. "It will eventually burn itself through the population," Osterholm said. "Within several weeks to a month and a half, you will see this peak come back down, and it's likely to come down quickly."
