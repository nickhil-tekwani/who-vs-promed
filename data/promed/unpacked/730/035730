Turkey: Risk of Human Infection Now Over; 9 discharged from
Hospital
-----------------------------------------------
The incubation period for the avian flu found in Turkey last
weekend is now over, so the danger to humans from the
infected birds has passed, Turkish officials said on Sat 15
Oct 2005.
Avian flu H5N1 in Turkey has been identified as the same
virus that killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003 and
forced the slaughter of millions of birds. "The incubation
period is over because the disease emerged last week [2nd
week October 2005] ... if it were to infect anybody, it
would have already done that," CNN Turk television quoted
the Health Ministry's parasitic diseases director Ramazan
Uzun as saying. Uzun said there was no risk to human and
animal health in the Manyas district, which is one of the
country's largest migrating bird sanctuaries and where a
farm tested positive for avian flu. The Turkish government
had taken all the necessary measures against the disease,
Uzun said.
The deputy governor in charge of Manyas, Halil Yavuz, said
the district would be in quarantine until 29 Oct 2005 and
this period of time would not be extended.
9 people kept under observation at a hospital in western
Turkey for possible bird flu have been allowed to go home
after tests did not detect an infection. "The 9 people were
sent from hospital after their blood tests showed that they
were not infected," the official told Reuters. Blood tests
were taken from the 2 families in the western town of
Turgutlu after 40 of their pigeons died in 15 days. Some of
the dead birds had also been sent away for testing.
The agriculture ministry reported on Saturday [15 Oct 2005]
that the death of wild pigeons in Istanbul was not related
to avian flu. "The laboratory tests and examinations show
that the cause of death among the wild pigeons was not avian
influenza," the ministry said in a statement faxed to
Reuters.
Turkish officials have said the country faces no general
public health threat and have appealed for calm. But the
country's top veterinarian, Mustafa Altuntas, urged caution
and said the country would be at risk from migratory birds
that will return from Africa in spring. "The regions with
wetlands are the places that need the utmost caution,"
Altuntas said in a news conference.
The European Commission said on Friday [14 Oct 20005] it
would send medical specialists to Turkey after Ankara
requested assistance from the Commission.
