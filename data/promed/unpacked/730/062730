Association
Many studies have shown an association of infection with _Chlamydia
pneumoniae_ and atherosclerosis. However, most are cross-sectional and only
one or two are prospective. The association has been established by both
serological methods as by detection of the agent in vascular tissues. The
major problem with both techniques is the lack of a gold standard. For
antibody determinations the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) is considered the
gold standard, but only a few laboratories have checked their specificity
according to the Seattle guidelines. Cross reactions and differences in
reading immunofluorescence are the main reasons that results of various
studies are difficult to compare with each other. Currently there is no
gold standard for detection of _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ in vascular tissue.
Reported results vary between 0% and 100%. What will be the true
prevalence? All reports use different methods. However, it seems reasonable
to assume that viable _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ is rare in vascular tissue.
Also, _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ has been associated with many classical risk
factors for coronary heart disease. At this moment, hard data are extremely
difficult to extract.
Animal models
Studies in animal models now show that _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ disseminates
to atherosclerotic lesions after intranasal infection. Also, repeated
infections are capable of introducing atherosclerotic like lesions.
Treating animals with macrolides prevents these atherosclerotic changes.
These results have to be interpreted cautiously: in many animal models many
compounds are capable of introducing atherosclerosis, _Chlamydia
pneumoniae_ is just another one. In vitro studies _Chlamydia pneumoniae_
infects epithelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Macrophages
turn into foam cells after infection with _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ without
the use of the scavenger receptor. Data so far reported is indeed
consistent with an active role of _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ in atherogenesis.
Antimicrobial therapy
So far, three studies have been published describing the use of
antimicrobial agents. One reports on effect on occurrence of myocardial
infarction of macrolides and a decline in titer to _Chlamydia pneumoniae_.
The second reports an effect on angina pectoris without reference to
_Chlamydia pneumoniae_. The third reports no effect on "chronic infection".
These studies should be considered promising, but many questions remain. It
will not be possible to treat patients every six months with antibiotics
simply because of resistance problems. Currently no test is available to
measure activity of _Chlamydia pneumoniae_. Thus, no test is available to
measure the effect of treatment on _Chlamydia pneumoniae_. At this moment
there is no rational to treat patients with antibiotics, unless as part of
a well designed controlled study. However, first gold standards will need
to be defined, next, new tests need to be developed to measure activity of
_Chlamydia pneumoniae_, then finally, antibiotic trials can be designed.
