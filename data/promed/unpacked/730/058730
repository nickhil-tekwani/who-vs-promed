The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is monitoring an outbreak of at least 6 cases of shigellosis in individuals experiencing homelessness since [30 Sep 2021]. The cases were found after the individuals were hospitalized. They are expected to recover.

The County has notified the City of San Diego and will work with the city and potential exposure sites and homeless service providers to ensure good hygienic precautions, identify any additional cases and connect ill individuals to treatment and housing. A health advisory to local providers also has also been issued.

"Shigellosis is not usually serious, but in the wrong circumstances it can spread, and we want to ensure this vulnerable population is kept safe," said Seema Shah, M.D., medical director of HHSA's Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch.

Shigellosis is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or sometimes person-to-person such as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In 2020, the County identified 243 total cases; to date in 2021, the County has identified 220.

Although only a small number of organisms can make a person sick, casual contact is not the main way shigellosis bacteria are spread. Typical symptoms include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps.

The infection is diagnosed with stool testing. Most people will recover fully without antibacterial treatment, though individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease. If you have symptoms that resemble shigellosis, contact your primary care physician for assistance.

[This cluster parallels the beginning of the hepatitis A epidemic occurring in many states in the USA which began in the homeless in San Diego county (Hepatitis A - USA (46): (CA) fatal Archive Number: 20171017.5386460).

Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
