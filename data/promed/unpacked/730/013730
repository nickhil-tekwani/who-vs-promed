A total of 4 people in 3 states developed sepsis after receiving bacteria-contaminated platelet transfusions between May and October last year [2018], according to a US government report released Thursday [13 Jun 2019]. One of the 4 patients died.

The source of the bacterial contamination of the platelets isn't clear. An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] found that the bacteria were closely related, and the contamination might be from a common source. An investigation is underway.

Sepsis, a medical emergency, occurs when an existing infection triggers an extreme response and chain reaction throughout the body, possibly leading to tissue damage, organ failure and death.

Platelets, small cell structures essential to blood clotting, can be collected from donors and transferred to a patient as an intravenous transfusion. When collecting platelets for a transfusion, a donor's blood is drawn into an apheresis cell separator machine, which extracts platelets and returns the rest of the blood into the donor, according to the American Red Cross.

Approximately one in every 5000 platelet collections in the USA is contaminated with bacteria, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.

The contaminants found in the platelet transfusions that caused sepsis were _Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii_ complex (ACBC) and _Staphylococcus saprophyticus_, both typical causes of healthcare-associated infections, the CDC reported. Taking samples from each patient, the CDC analyzed the bacterial DNA and discovered close relationships, which suggest a common source of contamination.

All of the collection sets used with the apheresis machines came from the same manufacturer, while 2 of 3 sets were traced to the same lot, the CDC reported without disclosing the name of the manufacturer. The investigation has not identified the contamination source.

Bacterial contamination of platelets is rare (approximately one in 5000 platelet units) but poses serious risk to platelet transfusion recipients. Sepsis resulting from bacterial contamination of platelets can occur even with implementation of bacterial mitigation strategies. Whole genome sequencing indicated a potential common source of bacterial contamination among 4 cases of septic transfusion reactions occurring in 3 states. Clinicians need to monitor for sepsis after platelet transfusions even after implementation of bacterial mitigation strategies and immediately report adverse reactions to platelet suppliers and hemovigilance systems.

During May-October 2018, 4 patients from 3 states experienced sepsis after transfusion of apheresis platelets contaminated with _Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii_ complex (ACBC) and _Staphylococcus saprophyticus_; one patient died. ACBC isolates from patients' blood, transfused platelet residuals, and 2 environmental samples were closely related by whole genome sequencing. _S. saprophyticus_ isolates from 2 patients' blood, 3 transfused platelet residuals, and one hospital environmental sample formed 2 whole genome sequencing clusters. This whole genome sequencing analysis indicated a potential common source of bacterial contamination; investigation into the contamination source continues. All platelet donations were collected using apheresis cell separator machines and collection sets from the same manufacturer; 2 of 3 collection sets were from the same lot. One implicated platelet unit had been treated with pathogen-inactivation technology, and 2 had tested negative with a rapid bacterial detection device after negative primary culture. Because platelets are usually stored at room temperature, bacteria in contaminated platelet units can proliferate to clinically relevant levels by the time of transfusion. Clinicians should monitor for sepsis after platelet transfusions even after implementation of bacterial contamination mitigation strategies. Recognizing adverse transfusion reactions and reporting to the platelet supplier and hemovigilance systems is crucial for public health practitioners to detect and prevent sepsis associated with contaminated platelets.

[Transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis is a recognized risk and occurs in at least one of 100 000 recipients, resulting in a fatal outcome in one in 500 000 recipients (https://www.cdc.gov/bloodsafety/bbp/bacterial-contamination-of-platelets.html). Bacterial contamination of platelet components is thought to occur because platelets are stored at room temperature for up to 5 days, whereas other blood components are refrigerated or frozen. Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., _Staphylococcus_ spp.) found on skin are the most frequent contaminants; less commonly, gram-negative bacteria (e.g., _Serratia_, _Enterobacter_, or _Salmonella_) have been contaminants of platelet units. Gram-negative contamination has been attributed to donor bacteremia or contamination, for example, of blood collection bags, during manufacturing or packaging processes (https://www.cdc.gov/mmWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5407a2.htm).

_Acinetobacter_ are aerobic gram-negative coccobacilli commonly found in soil and water and readily survive in a hospital environment. Outbreaks of _Acinetobacter_ infections usually occur in healthcare settings, especially in critically ill patients in intensive care units, where they are recovered from various sites in the patients' environment, including bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. Of the many _Acinetobacter_ species, _A. baumannii_ accounts for about 80% of reported infections. Resistance of _Acinetobacter_ to multiple commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections caused by these organisms. _Staphylococcus saprophyticus_ is a coagulase-negative gram-positive _Staphylococcus_ sp. and is a cause of community-acquired, usually uncomplicated, urinary tract infections (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429511/).

In the 2018 outbreak reported above, whole genome sequencing analysis indicated an unidentified potential common source of bacterial contamination among the 4 cases of septic transfusion reactions, and investigation into the contamination source is said to continue. - Mod.ML
