A 4th person has died from eating a soup made with poisonous mushrooms earlier this month [November 2012] at senior care facility in Northern California, authorities said Tuesday [27 Nov 2012].

The Placer County Sheriff's Department identified a 92-year-old woman. 3 others at the 6-bed Gold Age Villa care facility in Loomis died from eating the mushrooms in what sheriff's investigators characterize as an accident. "This is an ongoing tragedy, an unfortunate accident," said Dena Erwin, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office.

All of the victims were sickened 8 Nov 2012, including the caretaker who made the soup after picking mushrooms in the backyard of the facility.

The other people who have died were an 86-year-old woman, a 73-year-old woman, and a 90-year-old man.

California's Department of Social Services is investigating the incident, though sheriff's investigators have said the caretaker who made the soup did not know that the mushrooms were poisonous.

The most recent death occurred at a nursing home, where the victim was transferred from a Sacramento-area hospital.

Vomiting and diarrhea associated with mushroom poisoning can take 12 hours or longer to develop, which often makes it difficult to diagnose, said Dr Kent R Olson, medical director of the San Francisco division of the California Poison Control System.

The loss of fluids can cause kidney failure, but the poisons attack the liver and stop the organ from producing normal proteins. The victim usually falls into a coma, and the liver eventually shuts down and dies.

Fall begins the season for highly sought-after wild chanterelle mushrooms in Northern California, and for the amanita species of mushroom that include what are known as "death cap" and "death angel" varieties.

Mushroom experts said that young poisonous North American amanitas found in the San Francisco Bay Area can often look like an edible version of a wild mushroom popular in Asia.

California recorded 1700 cases of mushroom-related illnesses from 2009 to 2010, including 2 deaths.

[The death cap mushroom is known worldwide to cause intoxication and death. The death cap is _Amanita phalloides_ (see picture at http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/Fungus/Death%20Cap/deathca2.jpg). It is generally mistaken for a non-toxic variety. Alternatively it is collected by someone not trained in the subtle differences of mushrooms; someone believing it is a mushroom that has hallucinogenic properties; someone applying some myth, such as it cannot be toxic because it is growing on wood, or in the sun, or other such mushroom nonsense.

Amanitas contain toxins known as amatoxins which are cyclopeptides. This ring of amino acids inhibits production of some proteins, especially in liver and kidney cells. Clinical signs generally begin 5-24 hours post ingestion. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. These initial symptoms may resolve briefly, but without treatment there is severe liver and kidney damage and even organ failure which results in coma and death.

In some cases clinical signs and symptoms may not begin for 1-2 days. These signs mimic the flu or other gastrointestinal upset. Consequently treatment is delayed and diagnosis can be difficult.

Early treatment may include fluids, antibiotics, and use of liver supportive agents such as the extract of milk thistle which contains the flavonoids silymarin/silybin/silibinin. These flavonoids have been demonstrated to inhibit amatoxin.

The milk thistle flavonoids success with amatoxin has not been able to be duplicated with other toxins, such as aflatoxin that also affect the liver, but are not related to mushroom toxins.
