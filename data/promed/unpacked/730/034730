Norwalk-like Virus Affects Staff and Visitors at Alpine Resort
-------------------------------------------------
A virulent virus has infected a large number of people at the
Hermitage Aoraki Mount Cook Alpine Village. Hermitage general manager
Denis Callesen said health officials believed a Norwalk-like virus
(i.e., a calicivirus belonging to the genus _Norovirus_) had spread
to staff and guests at the hotel after being [brought in] by a group
that arrived on Sun 20 Oct 2002. Mr Callesen declined to say how many
were in the group or what country the group was from. He said the
virus spread extensively because it had a very [short] incubation
period [and] people did not know they were carrying it. One staff
member fell ill with the virus, which causes severe vomiting and
diarrhoea on Mon 21 Oct 2002, 8 fell ill on Tuesday, and another 8 on
Wednesday. Yesterday 30 staff were off work.
Mr Callesen said staff were taking 48 hours off to ensure they were
clear of the virus before returning to work. There were only 4 new
cases today. The 272-room hotel has 150 staff. He confirmed some
guests had cancelled reservations but would not say how many. There
are 100 are booked for this evening. "It is starting to affect our
operation," Mr Callesen told NZPA. He said it was not unusual for
overseas visitors to spread viruses at this time of year, as some had
come from countries where winter was just starting and new viruses
that New Zealand had not experienced yet were spreading.

[It is doubtful that "winter vomiting diseases" can be considered
seasonal. There have been outbreaks of this disease in the Northern
Hemisphere, mainly but not exclusively in health-care settings,
throughout summer and autumn. The assumption that the disease was
introduced by guests implies that New Zealand is currently free of
this form of gastroenteritis. Further information regarding the viral
gastroenteritis situation in New Zealand would be appreciated. -
