1st report of _Beet necrotic yellow vein_ virus in South Africa
---------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2014 and 2015 production seasons, hairy roots, root stunting, and yellowing of leaves were observed on red table beet (_Beta vulgaris_) in commercial fields of one farm in Western Cape province.

Root samples were collected from symptomatic plants and tested (electron microscopy, RT-PCR, sequencing). Results confirmed the presence of _Beet necrotic yellow vein virus_ (BNYVV, EPPO A2 List - rhizomania) in diseased roots.

Resting spores of the fungus-like vector, _Polymyxa betae_, were observed in root epidermal cells. In addition, seeds of 4 cultivars of red table beet were planted in bags with soil collected from the contaminated fields, and both _P. betae_ and BNYVV could be found in resulting plant roots.

It is stressed that surveys should be carried out in beet-growing regions of South Africa and that measures should be taken to prevent the spread of BNYVV.

[Rhizomania is one of the most serious diseases of sugar beet worldwide. It is caused by _Beet necrotic yellow vein virus_ (BNYVV; genus _Benyvirus_) which is spread by the fungus-like root parasite _Polymyxa betae_. Symptoms include excessive production of roots, distortion and discolouration of roots, as well as chlorosis and distortion of leaves. Root size and sugar yield are severely reduced.

The vector, and with it the virus, is easily spread with contaminated soil to new fields. It survives for decades in the soil as cysts which can release zoospores carrying infectious virus when water becomes available. Disease management includes cultural practices and genetic resistance. BNYVV has been included on the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
