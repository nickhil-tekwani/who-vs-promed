Dead Crow Suggests Over-wintering of West Nile Virus in Canada
------------------------------------------------
The discovery of the first West Nile-infected crow in Canada this
year all but proves the virus survives the Canadian winter, Health
Canada acknowledged yesterday. This raises the stakes in efforts to
contain West Nile virus, as it means future Canadian outbreaks will
arise locally from an ever-present source.
The crow was found dead last week at a busy intersection in
Newmarket, north of Toronto. It was sent for testing, which was
positive but has not yet been confirmed. "It's a bigger risk if the
virus can overwinter and stay within the province," said Dr. Harvey
Artsob, chief of the health department's viral zoonotics and special
pathogens division. "If it couldn't, then it has to be reintroduced
every year, say by migrating birds or from down south."
The crow's death comes almost a month earlier than the first avian
case of last year. In 2001, it was not until August that a bird
tested positive, marking West Nile's introduction to Canada. Human
cases normally arise in late July or August, once the virus has
spread to the species of mosquitoes that prey on humans.
A positive result so early after the spring thaw does not suggest
this year's cases among humans will occur earlier; it still depends
on prolonged warm weather. But it is good evidence that the virus is
"seeded" in hibernating mosquito populations all across Ontario, Dr.
Artsob said. The crow was among the first few to be tested, he said,
which suggests it is not an oddity, but that the virus is present in
other crows, waiting to be found. Reports are not available from
other monitoring programs in regions where West Nile has recently
been introduced, such as the northern United States, Manitoba, and
Quebec, because they have not yet started testing for the year.
Manitoba, for example, will start on the first of May.
"It's just an opinion, but I think if they were looking [for West
Nile virus-infected crows] in some of these areas, they would be
finding them," Dr. Artsob said. Dr. Michael Drebot, Health Canada's
head of viral zoonosis, said one way the West Nile virus can survive
the winter is in _Culex pipiens_ mosquitoes, which prey on birds but
not humans, and which hibernate as adults on the walls of dank places
like sewers and drainage ditches. "As daylight hours increase and
temperatures rise during the spring, these mosquitoes emerge from the
sewers and look for a blood meal," he said. This species does not
prey on humans, but humans are put at risk when other mosquito
species prey on infected birds and then on humans. "We still think it
takes quite a while for the virus to build up in nature, and get into
other species of mosquitoes that feed on humans," Dr. Artsob said.
Hanif Kassam, medical officer of health for York Region, where the
crow was found, said the discovery "puts our plan in action." The
region is a part of Health Canada's coordinated effort to track West
Nile-infected birds.
Most people who become infected with West Nile show no symptoms at
all; most others who are healthy experience an illness akin to the
flu, including fever, headache, and body aches. Health Canada advises
that the elderly, the very young, and those with weakened immune
systems are at risk of the more dangerous complications of
encephalitis or meningitis, the swelling of the brain or its lining.
Clinical evidence gathered since the 2002 epidemic, however, suggests
that healthy, middle-aged people will suffer some of the most
debilitating and long-lasting effects of the next outbreak. Patients
who have survived the initial onslaught of the disease have often
developed "acute flaccid paralysis," or a weakening of limbs as the
virus attacks a region of the brain stem.
