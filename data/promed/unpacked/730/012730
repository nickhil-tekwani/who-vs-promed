Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication --- Nigeria, 2005-2006
-----------------------------------------------
Only 4 countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria,
and Pakistan) have never experienced interruption
of poliovirus transmission (1--3). Nigeria had
the largest number of cases in 2006, accounting
for 1129 (56 percent) of the 2002 cases reported
globally. However, major innovations to the
national polio-eradication program in Nigeria
were initiated in 2006. These innovations, if
sustained, should advance the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative. Nigeria (2006 population:
140 million) experienced a resurgence in wild
poliovirus (WPV) transmission during 2003--2004
after a loss of public confidence in oral polio
vaccine (OPV) and suspension of supplementary
immunization activities (SIAs) in certain
northern states (4). Subsequently, WPV spread
within Nigeria and into 19 polio-free countries
(1,5,6). Even after national SIAs recommenced,
limited acceptance and ongoing operational
problems resulted in low vaccination coverage and
continued poliovirus transmission. The number of
confirmed polio cases in Nigeria attributed to
both WPV type 1 (WPV1) and type 3 (WPV3)
increased from 782 in 2004 to 830 in 2005 and to
1129 in 2006 (as of [23 Mar 2007]). To increase
the effectiveness of polio-eradication measures
and community acceptance of vaccination, in 2006,
health authorities in Nigeria introduced
monovalent type 1 OPV (mOPV1) vaccine and changed
the way SIAs were implemented. This report
summarizes these new approaches and overall
progress toward polio eradication in Nigeria during 2005--2006.
MMWR Editorial Note:
Although SIAs were resumed in all areas in
Nigeria in mid-2004, they did not sufficiently
curtail the resurgence of WPV transmission that
began in 2003--2004. The number of cases in
northern states increased substantially in late
2005 and early 2006, particularly WPV1 cases. In
December 2005, the Nigerian government mandated
the National Programme on Immunization to
accelerate polio eradication and enhance routine
vaccination. The introduction of mOPV1 in March
2006 and improved community acceptance in
response to the introduction of IPDs
[immunization plus days] in May 2006 have been
associated with a decrease in WPV1 monthly
incidence; in 2006, only 22 percent of 851 WPV1
cases occurred in the 2nd half of the year. An
increase in population immunity against
poliovirus infection also is indicated by the
decrease in the proportion of non-polio AFP
[acute flaccid paralysis] cases in children who
have received zero doses since the introduction of IPDs in May 2006.
In 2006, polio-eradication measures were
concentrated in the 10 states with the most
intense transmission of WPV. Because
approximately 50 percent of the target population
remains under-vaccinated in high-incidence
states, further improvements in immunization
levels are needed to interrupt poliovirus
transmission. The continued involvement of
traditional and religious community leaders will
be essential to increase both SIA and routine vaccination coverage.
Although the sensitivity of AFP surveillance and
the number of reported cases increased in 2006
compared with 2005, WPV was found in fewer
states. Genetic sequence analysis suggests that
several genetic virus clusters have been
eliminated in 2006; however, by the end of the
year, numerous independent chains of transmission persisted.
Compared with tOPV [trivalent oral polio
vaccine], mOPV1 is more effective, dose for dose,
in immunizing children against WPV1; a single
dose of mOPV1 has been estimated as the
equivalent of 3 doses of tOPV in terms of
seroconversion against WPV1 (8). Thus, in 2006,
the Nigerian Polio Program decided to target
preferentially WPV1 circulation using mOPV1 for
most SIAs. Because of its greater
transmissibility, WPV1 poses a greater threat of
wide geographic spread compared with WPV3, as was
observed during the 2003--2004 polio outbreak in
Nigeria and neighboring countries. Use of tOPV in
IPDs in northern states in November 2006 and
early 2007 should curtail WPV3 transmission.
For 2007, priority has been given to further
improving IPD planning and supervision in the
highest-risk LGAs [local government areas] in the
high-incidence states. Communication and
health-education activities will continue to be
modified and strengthened according to findings
from program monitoring and evaluation. These
measures are expected to increase the impact of
SIAs during the WPV low-transmission season and
of SIAs scheduled for the remainder of the year.
Nigeria achieved some key milestones in 2006
toward improving child survival. The Nigerian
government and its immunization partners are
committed to interrupting WPV transmission in
Nigeria and to building sustainable means of
enhancing child health. Continuation and
expansion of IPDs and use of mOPV1 is needed to
interrupt WPV1 transmission in Nigeria; periodic
use of tOPV will continue to reduce WPV3 circulation.

Advance notification of 3 new cases was received
(type 1), all from Equateur province. Case
investigations are ongoing. DR Congo's most
recent reported case had onset of paralysis on 10 Jan 2007.
DR Congo's most recent SIAs [supplementary
immunization activities] were held on 8-10 Mar
[2007]. The next SIAs are scheduled to start on [5 Apr 2007].

Advance notification of a new case was received
(type 1), from Togdher province. Somalia's most
recent, reported case had onset of paralysis on 23 Jan 2007.
Somalia has not had a case outside of Togdher province since July 2006.
Somalia's most recent SNIDs [Sub-national
Immunization Days] were held on 20 Feb 2007. In
spite of very challenging security conditions,
staggered SIAs [supplementary immunization
activities] were implemented in the northern
zones of the country, supported by a large number
of WHO staff, particularly in Togdher. The next
SNIDs are scheduled for 25 Mar 2007.

One new case was reported in the past week from
2007 (type 3), from Balochistan, right across the
border with northern Sindh. Pakistan's most
recent case had onset of paralysis on 24 Feb 2007.
A number of key advocacy activities are taking
place throughout Pakistan. On 16 Mar 2007, for
example, a high-level meeting of eminent
religious scholars was held in North West
Frontier Province (NWFP). Representing a network
of thousands of village imams and political
leaders across Pakistan and neighboring
Afghanistan, the scholars pledged their support
for polio eradication, vowing to implement a
number of key activities, including issuing an
appeal to all mosque imams to support polio teams in their villages.
Pakistan's next Sub-national Immunization Days
(SNIDs) will be held on 27-29 Mar 2007 in Balochistan, Punjab, NWFP and Sindh.

[For the most recent data on reported cases of
polio see the Polio Eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>.
As of 20 Mar 2007, there have been 61 reported
cases since 1 Jan 2007, with 54 (89 percent)
coming from endemic countries. For the same
period last year (2006), there had been 91 cases
reported, with 73 of the cases (80 percent)
coming from endemic countries. Countries
reporting cases this year (2007) are: Pakistan
(6), India (21), Nigeria (27), Somalia (4), DR Congo (2) and Niger (1).
In the past several weeks there were newswire
reports coming out of Pakistan and Afghanistan
suggesting that a similar situation to that seen
in Nigeria in 2004 was occurring: "Loss of public
confidence resulted from rumors regarding OPV
safety, including false allegations that the
vaccine could cause sterility or acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome in vaccine recipients"
(taken from the MMWR article in the above
posting; for information on the situation in Pakistan, see
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/10b1c6e33262a379ffcfe18e8c26bddd.hm>

for information on the problem in Afghanistan, see:
<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=70721>).
One hopes that this current threat to the
eradication effort will not result in a
resurgence of WPV activity in the region. - Mod.MPP]
