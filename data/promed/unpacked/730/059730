A toxic algae is killing fish along Norway's southwestern coast, where about
400 tons of fish, mostly salmon, have been wiped out so far, officials said
Tuesday. Two research vessels are taking samples to identify the [cause],
which kills fish by [apparently] clogging their gills and damaging their
ability to breathe, said Olav Lekve of the Norwegian Fisheries Directorate.
"We think it might be an algae called _Heterosigma_, which is known in
Chile, Canada and elsewhere but has not been found before in Norway," he
said by telephone from the west coast city of Bergen. "It has a weak toxin
that destroys the fish's respiratory system."
He said 400 to 500 tons of fish have died at nine fish-breeding stations due
to the algae, but wild fish seem unaffected. "Wild fish can flee, while
those in fish-farming pens cannot," Lekve said.

Salmon farmers in Norway, the top world producer of the fish, were
watching on Thursday for a poisonous algae that has killed thousands of
salmon on the country's southern tip.
Olav Lekve, a spokesman for the Directorate of Fisheries, was cited as
saying the Directorate was monitoring waters in the Bokna fjord and near the
port of Stavanger for signs that the _Chattonella verruculosa_ algae was
spreading up the west coast where most farms are located.
The yellowish-brown algae, never before monitored in northern European seas
but which has been registered in Japan, has killed 350 tonnes of farmed
Norwegian salmon so far. The last major outbreak of algae in Norway was in
1989 off the west coast when 850 tonnes of salmon were lost to the algae
_Prymnesium Parvum_.

[Apparently algal toxins can pass through a pen killing all the fish at one
time, while infections will spread through producing a more drawn out kill.
