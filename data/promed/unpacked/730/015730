Yellow fever associated death of 14 year old triggers sanitary alert in region
----------------
Health Authorities confirmed the death of a 14 year old due to yellow fever
in this area and non-official sources claim that there are 2 more cases [in
the area]. The Regional Institute of Health of Apure announced that the
death occurred in a resident of Arichuna in the municipality of San Fernando.
Evelin Faneite, physician in the Directorate of Epidemiology of Insalud,
assured that there have not been additional cases reported up through the
present.
This death has triggered an alarm in Apure. Since 1973 there have not been
any deaths reported due to yellow fever. They have only had a single focus
in the state of Apure, described epidemiologically and called the "Focus of
San Camilo" in Alto Apure, specifically in Guasdualito, a zone where they
have been expecting the appearance of cases.
According to Faneite, a report of a single case there is important. The
disease can be transmitted by the same mosquito as dengue fever, and the
latter (dengue fever) has been prevalent this year in the state (Apure has
reported 1705 cases of dengue with one death since the beginning of 2005).
In response to this, there will be free vaccinations available in the State
in all health facilities, with collaboration of the Family Foundation
(Fumbaifa), an institute which has a sentinel post in it's quarters.
The mayor of San Fernando, Armando Arevalo Soto, indicated that the yellow
fever vaccination operations which will be held by the alcaldia (head of
the municipality) with Insalud, have received 2872 doses of vaccine during
the end of last week and are expecting 600 additional doses during the
course of the coming week. The vaccination activities in San Fernando will
finish at the end of October.
