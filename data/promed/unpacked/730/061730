Anthrax outbreak kills 52 animals in Manitoba
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax has killed 49 cows, 2 goats, and a horse in
Manitoba's Interlake region, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
confirmed to CTV.ca on Tuesday [7 Aug 2007]. A total of 2 goats and a horse
also died as a result of ingesting infected spores that were unearthed with
heavy rainfall. Test results confirming that the deaths were from anthrax
came back over the weekend [4-5 Aug 2007].
The CFIA was 1st notified of the outbreak on 20 Jul 2007 when a farm in the
Armstrong community in the region reported that cattle had died. A total of
9 more farms in Armstrong and 4 farms in the neighbouring Rockwood
community reported losses soon after. The last death was on 3 Aug 2007.
"Samples are usually sent to the provincial lab for testing, then to the
CFIA for confirmation, that's why there's a delay in reporting," said CFIA
spokeswoman Robin Locke. "But the CFIA starts implementing control measures
right away."
Infected spores -- remnants of bison, cattle and other animals that graze
-- are commonly found throughout all the Prairie provinces. Manitoba has
had an outbreak almost every year since the year 2000. Stephens said that
could be due to its widely varying environmental conditions, from heavy
downpours to hot and dry periods, all potentially causing the spores to
surface.
According to Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives, vaccinating
cattle isn't necessarily cost effective. "An appropriate vaccination for
anthrax is available for cattle but it is generally not cost-effective
because of the sporadic nature of the disease from year to year," the
government agency says on its website. "Vaccination is only advised in
those herds where there has been a recent history of anthrax in the
immediate area where the cattle are raised."

[Vaccination for anthrax not cost effective? I wonder whether the owners of
the 14 ranches would agree with that statement now. Anthrax is not a
miasmic disease. It does not suddenly appear from nowhere. Frankly this
sounds very much like a rerun of the Saskatchewan Melfort scenario when the
marginal farmers there were also flooded and then overcome by a disease
which they had not concerned themselves with before ... remember that the
Melfort farmers were poor and normally could not afford veterinary medical
assistance. Dead animals were regretted but ignored. Subject to correction
I suspect that these "inter-lake" farmers are of a similar ilk. And that it
took some 52 animals to die before they had a diagnosis indicates that they
had no idea what was happening, and it had probably been happening quietly
for many years.
The trick with limiting the extent of anthrax outbreaks is to make sure
that unexpected deaths are rapidly reported and investigated, and if
anthrax is suspected to initiate the necessary control procedures promptly.
Manitoba now has another 14 farms where they must vaccinate their stock for
the next 10 years, because of the unavoidable ground contamination that
goes with delayed diagnosis. And from experience elsewhere, including
southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the neighbours around each affected
farm would be wise to also vaccinate their stock for the next 5 years.
