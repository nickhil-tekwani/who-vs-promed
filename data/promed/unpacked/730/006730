Cholera outbreak resurfaces in parts of Eastern Cape
-----------------------------
Cholera has broken out in some parts of Transkei in the Eastern Cape. 3
people have reportedly died from the disease. 7 others have been hospitalized.
The villages that have been affected by the latest outbreak include Mampupe
near Port St Johns. It is believed that revellers who attended a
traditional feast carried the disease to Ngcingane village in Umtata. The
source of the cholera at Gxulu near Libode and Tina falls in Qumbu has not
been determined yet.
Lack of ablution facilities as well as clean drinking water in some areas
contributes to the outbreak. It has been estimated that about 150 000
people in the OR Tambo Municipal District have no proper toilets. The
municipalities have teamed up with the departments of Health and Water
Affairs to closely monitor and bring the disease under control.

13 cholera cases reported in north Malaysia
---------------------------------------
Disease control and prevention efforts have been stepped up in Malaysia's
northeast state of Penang after 13 people were confirmed to be suffering
from cholera since 5 Dec 2002.
The state Health, Welfare and Caring Community Committee chairman K.
Rajapathy told reporters in Penang
Monday that these people, aged 22-63, sought treatment at Penang Hospital
for diarrhea and vomiting, and tests in the hospital showed they had cholera.
The public must help in containing the disease, Rajapathy said, urging the
public to maintain personal hygiene, refrain from eating at dirty food
outlets, eat cooked food, and drink only boiled water.
Rajapathy said the state's 425 food outlets had their food tested while 138
others were checked for cleanliness.
From these, 5 were ordered to be closed for the lack of hygiene while 387
food outlet operators received prophylactic shots [vaccine? - Mod.LL].
Rajapathy reminded the public to keep their house compounds clean and to
wash their hands before and after performing any task. Those suffering from
diarrhea and vomiting were advised to seek treatment immediately.
In 1996, 1061 cholera cases were reported in Penang in the span of 3 months.
