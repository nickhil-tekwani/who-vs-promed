In a recent posting the moderator said that "any systematic studies of
invasive Group A streptococcal infection (GAS) would be helpful". Please
see <http://www.tdh.state.tx.us/phpep/dpn/issues/dpn60n07.pdf> for a
write-up from the Texas Department of Health epidemiologists about an
upswing of invasive GAS in parts of Texas in previous years. As with the
Swedish study, the T1 strain was often found associated with necrotising
fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
Although 2000 was not a bad year statewide for invasive GAS, I investigated
my first case in the Dallas-area last September, a preschool child who died
from STSS. The incident underscored for me the rapid and overwhelming
nature of these infections, and the understandable fear they raise among
parents.

[The Texas Department of Health document cited above is worth viewing. It
shows a statistically significant increase in observed cases compared with
expected cases for a 6 week period during the winter of 1999/2000 for 2
defined regions of Texas. Other interesting data are also presented. - Mod.ES
