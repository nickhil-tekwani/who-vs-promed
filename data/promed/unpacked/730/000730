Yobe state cholera outbreak situation report no. 46: 4 Nov 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- 3 new cases were reported on 4 Nov 2018 from 2 LGA [local government areas] (Gulani and Damaturu)
- 3 additional samples were collected and tested using RDT [rapid diagnostic test]. All the 3 samples were positive
- 0 deaths were reported.

The total number of suspected cholera cases reported in Yobe state is 1744 with 61 associated deaths (CFR 3.50%). In the state, 569 cases have been reported in Gulani LGA, 485 cases in Gujba LGA, and 442 cases in Damaturu LGA. In Fune LGA, 181 cases were reported and 67 cases were reported in Potiskum LGA.

Out of 97 samples collected and tested using cholera RDTs, 82 (84.5%) were positive and 15 (15%) were negative. Again, 9 (47%) out of 19 samples cultured were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_. However, the 9 positive samples were taken to national reference laboratory for quality checks and further analysis samples and _V. cholerae_ O1 (Inaba) serotype was isolated in 4 out of the 9 samples.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al, (1) it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
