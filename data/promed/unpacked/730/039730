Anthrax outbreak in Umbria region
---------------------------------
1. Developed in a farm of about 400 cattle near Perugia (Umbria)
2. One bovine of about 4 years old died.
3. PCR analysis was positive (pXO1, pXO2, and chromosome) IZS
[Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale/Zooprophylactic Experimental
Institute] Umbria and Marche [regions]
4. The suspect was confirmed by the Anthrax Reference Institute of
Italy-IZS Puglia and Basilicata [regions]
5. Now the Anthrax Reference Institute of Italy is working to
genotype the strain
6. Probably it was introduced by food because the animals live inside
a cowshed and don't graze.

Less frequent and certainly more dangerous are outbreaks of anthrax
from an introduced source, such as, infectious episodes affecting
animals living in fixed stalling and which contract anthrax through
eating feed, usually forages, coming from risk areas that happen to
be contaminated. Usually these events are beyond the traditional
(grazing) parameters that characterize this disease, and can occur in
areas considered free of anthrax and at any time of year.

[I gather from Antonio that the local veterinary authorities are
attempting to trace the source of this infection. This continues a
current trend of anthrax outbreaks in northern Italy to be related to
purchased feed or imported feed supplements.
