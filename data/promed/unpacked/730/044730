The source of information about seagulls spreading the disease was
Invermay. The fact that they are planning to include this in their research
project indicates they believe it to be a real factor.
As for the vaccine, the information IS confused. When I last spoke to
Schering Plough, they were not sure whether the current formulation would
be effective or not, if administered properly at the right time, rather
than at a time when the animals are already immuno-compromised as they are
at present.
There are apparently several shared antigens which should in theory provide
some protection against _S. brandenburg_, but in practice that appears not
to be the case - or maybe [only some protection.
According to the chap from the manufacturers who was on the radio this
morning, they now believe there is enough information from the field to
suggest that modifications will have to be made to it to cover _S.
brandenburg_. That may not be done in time for next season. Meanwhile, some
vets are continuing to suggest to farmers that vaccination "can't hurt", so
some are trying that, with mixed results as I understand.
By the way, the opening comment in the Christchurch Press article about the
disease spreading to Canterbury was entirely the reporter's own
construction. I had said we thought the Canterbury event was a reoccurrence
of last year's infection. I called the reporter and his chief reporter to
correct that, and have stressed this point in every other media interview.
