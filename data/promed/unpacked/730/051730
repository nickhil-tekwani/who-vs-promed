Rift Valley fever (RVF), a rare zoonotic viral disease, has claimed
155 lives in Kenya and caused huge losses of income in Kenya's
pastoralist communities. The outbreak of the disease has exacerbated
an already precarious food insecurity and livelihoods situation,
following the massive floods in Kenya and neighboring countries at
the end of 2006. A large number of animals were lost to the disease.
While Rift Valley fever is unfortunately familiar to farmers in
Kenya, Tanzania and other countries in the region, not much is known
about the virus causing the disease. It is transmitted primarily to
humans through contact with infected animal matter such as blood or
other fluids, as well as animal organs. Consumption of raw milk from
an infected animal, an important element in the diet of many nomadic
pastoralists in Kenya, is also thought to lead to infection. RVF is
also spread by livestock through mosquito bites. The infected
mosquito eggs are often laid around river banks and can stay dormant
for years until they get submerged. The eggs then hatch to mosquitoes
that spread the virus.
In Kenya, RVF has been well known for over 60 years. As early as
1913, a disease fitting the description of RVF was blamed for the
loss of sheep in the Rift Valley in Kenya. So far, there is no cure,
and doctors are only able to treat the symptoms. About one per cent
of people contracting RVF develop the disease in a severe form;
approximately half of those die. The last large outbreak was in 1997,
following heavy rains blamed on El Nino, when some 27 500 people were
infected, and 170 died in Garissa District.
This time around, the 1st case of RVF was reported in Gurufa, Garissa
on 7 Dec 2006. Almost simultaneously, outbreaks were reported in a
number of other districts, including Ijara, Wajir, Tana River and
Isiolo, all of which had suffered from the extensive flooding in
Kenya's North Eastern Province.
Nearly 700 suspected cases of RVF were recorded in Kenya, according
to the Ministry of Health, with 155 deaths. The worst affected
districts were Garissa, Ijara and Wajir districts in North Eastern
Province, Tana River and Kilifi districts in Coast Province, and
Kirinyaga and Maragwa districts in Central Province.
The outbreak lead to a government-imposed ban on the slaughter of
livestock in the affected areas, which led to the closure of key
livestock markets, as well as a ban on movement and slaughter of
animals. This accentuated the precarious situation of pastoralists'
welfare, particularly in North Eastern Province. The ban on the
slaughter of animals has now been lifted in Garissa, Ijara, Mandera
and Wajir districts in North Eastern Province. However, the animal
quarantine is in force awaiting review through a veterinary
department investigation.
At the peak of the RVF outbreak, the Kenya Red Cross Society was
engaged in social mobilization activities targeting health workers
and the affected communities. Access to affected areas in Garissa
posed the greatest challenge due to flooding in the area. With the
assistance of Emergency Response Units (ERUs) from sister societies
around the world and other partners, the Kenya Red Cross assisted in
the establishment of Special Wards in Garissa Provincial Hospital and
Ngao Sub-District Hospital in Garsen.
The ward in Ngao Sub-District Hospital was established with support
from the Japanese and Australian Red Cross and MSF-Spain. The Kenya
Red Cross also worked with the MoH to institute timely and effective
care to suspected and/or confirmed RVF cases. The Medical ERUs helped
to train medical personnel working in local health facilities on
universal precautions, early case detection and referral.
Significant government vaccination campaigns targeting 1.5 million
livestock (cattle, sheep and goats), as well as other preventive
activity is ongoing in 33 districts where RVF cases have been
reported. Other interventions include supportive case management;
enhanced surveillance; community mobilization/public health education
and veterinary intervention, like the ban on slaughtering of animals
currently in force in the Marigat and Makutano parts of Baringo.
Vector control is also ongoing through the spraying of high risk
animals with synthetic pyrethroid.
According to the World Health Organization, RVF can be prevented by a
sustained program of animal vaccination. Live, attenuated and killed
vaccines have been developed for veterinary use. The live vaccine
requires only one dose and produces long-lived immunity, but the
presently-available vaccine may cause abortion if given to pregnant
animals. The killed vaccines do not cause these unwanted effects, but
multiple doses must be given to produce protective immunity. This may
prove problematic in endemic areas.
The available vaccine is only for use with livestock. In humans, an
inactivated vaccine has been developed. This vaccine is not licensed
and is not commercially available, but has been used experimentally
to protect veterinary and laboratory personnel at high risk of
exposure to RVF. Other candidate vaccines are under investigation.
In neighboring Tanzania, the National Society has organized a one-day
seminar on RVF in the capital city of Dodoma with participation of
local authorities, Tanzanian Red Cross volunteers and representatives
of local townships and villages. Following the seminar, the
volunteers went back into villages to educate local communities on
this epidemic.
A total of 90 people in Dodoma were infected, and 19 of those lost
their lives. The total number of RVF deaths in Tanzania now stands at
33. The majority of Dodoma residents are livestock keepers, and the
deaths of large numbers of livestock simply mean a dwindling of
people's economic resources, Mr. Yunus Rugaiyamu, the Regional
Administrative Secretary, lamented and added that "we must cooperate
and work together in order to get rid of this killer disease in our region."
The number of Tanzanian regions with suspected cases of RVF has
continued to rise, now standing at 8: Arusha, Manyara, Tanga,
Kilimanjaro, Dodoma, Morogoro, Singida and Iringa. In Dar es Salaam,
Regional Commissioner Mr. A Kandoro has announced a tentative ban on
the sale of meat grilled at roadside stalls (kebabs) and urged the
community to watch their eating manners as a precautionary measure,
while leading authorities asked everyone to raise their level of
alertness against the disease's entry into the city.
Responding to the outbreaks, the Tanzanian Red Cross has distributed
100 mosquito nets, 200 blankets and 2 tents through the Regional
Medical Officer in Dodoma to be used at established treatment camps,
while another 100 mosquito nets will be distributed by Dodoma Red
Cross to RVF-affected families. The Society also provided 4000
leaflets to give health education to the local communities.

Rift Valley Fever (RVF) patients admitted to health facilities in
Dodoma region have dropped to 35 from 137 last month [April 2007],
indicating significant gains in controlling the killer disease, which
has wreaked havoc on the meat industry here, the Regional
Commissioner (RC), Mr William Lukuvi, has said.
Addressing a May Day rally at the Jamhuri Stadium here yesterday [1
May 2007], Mr Lukuvi said by yesterday morning the Dodoma Regional
Hospital had 20 RVF patients, Mirembe Hospital 11, Mvumi Mission
Hospital had 2 and Kongwa and Mpwapwa district hospitals had one
each. The disease has killed more than 50 people in the region.
However, the RC cautioned against eating meat from sick or dead cows,
warning traders to sell only meat certified by health and veterinary
officers. Some patients have been in coma since last February [2007],
he warned.
The RC also said that business at the Dodoma abattoir was picking up
"slowly." He said the abattoir, with capacity to slaughter 200 cows a
day, handled only 6 yesterday [1 May 2007]. Business at the facility
had virtually stopped.

[According to these reports, the number of recorded human cases of
RVF in Kenya now totals 700, including 155 fatalities, and 90,
including 19 fatalities, in the Dodoma region of Tanzania. Overall,
there have been 33 RVF deaths in Tanzania. The most recent data from
the Dodoma region of Tanzania suggests that the outbreak is abating.

[Dr Glyn Davies wrote in ProMED, Rift Valley fever, Eastern Africa
(25): Tanzania (Dodoma), WHO 20070324.1024: "There may have been
alterations to the [epizootic] curve, which have followed the
effective transmission of virulent RVF virus caused by the widespread
vaccination programs. These may have involved hundreds of thousands
of animals, which would not have been otherwise affected...
Vaccination with the Smithburn MLVV (modified live virus vaccine)
strain or any other vaccine is totally contraindicated at any time
when active virus transmission is taking place... Vaccination of
animal populations during periods when RVF virus is actively being
transmitted by vectors will serve to propagate the virus very
effectively by needle passage. The virus is readily transmitted by
infected needles from animal to animal."
And the more animals that are infected, the greater the chances of
mosquito-borne transmission to humans. - Mod.JW]
