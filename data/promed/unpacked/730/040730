An Orange County, CA bakery was closed after 30 people fell ill after eating Rosca de Reyes, a fruit cake traditionally eaten on 6 Jan 2015, known as Three Kings Day or Epiphany. The cake was distributed countywide by Cholula's Bakery in Santa Ana to nearly a dozen different locations.

Those affected complained of dizziness, palpitations and numbness. "I had never felt so terrified, like I didn't even know what was going on with me," said one person from Santa Ana who was affected. Paramedics rushed her to the hospital because she felt dizzy, numb and her heart was racing. "I was hallucinating... I almost felt like I was not in my body," she said.

Helene Calvet, deputy health counselor for the Orange County Health Agency, says the symptoms are not contagious. "Some people had symptoms as soon as 20 minutes after eating the bread; we don't think it's like a infectious agent so we're looking at other agents," Calvet said.

The Orange County Health Department and Santa Ana police officers spent Wednesday morning, 7 Jan 2015, at the bakery. Health officials closed the store and suspended its permit, citing traces of cockroach infestation. The owner of Cholula's Bakery refused to speak to Eyewitness News.

The cake was sold at the following markets in southern California on Monday and Tuesday [5-6 Jan 2015]:
Cholula's Bakery Santa Ana; El Nopal Mercado San Juan Capistrano; La Bodega Ranch Orange, CA; La Bodega Ranch Fullerton; Santa Ana Marquet Santa Ana; Tony's Liquor San Juan Capistrano; Gonzalez Marquet Placentia; Taqueria Mocorito Restaurant Anaheim; Taco Boy Anaheim; Brianna's Ice Cream Anaheim; La Bodega Ranch Market Long Beach.

The Orange County Health Department is not treating this as a criminal investigation, but retailers and consumers were told to throw out any Rosca de Reyes from Cholula's Bakery.

[Clearly, the cause of the symptoms here were not from an infection per se, with such a short incubation period. Heavy metal intoxication related usually to fluids that have been stored in metal containers or static in pipes causing leaching of certain metals into the fluid has a very short incubation period of 5-20 minutes but causes prominent nausea and vomiting, not hallucinations.

The following information (http://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/foods-that-make-you-hallucinate) lists 5 foods associated with hallucinations:

"1. Chile Peppers
Homer Simpson, while not a real person per se, hallucinated his way to a spirit journey with a Johnny Cash-voiced coyote guide after just a taste of Police Chief Wiggums's Guatemalan Insanity Peppers. And NPR producer Marshall Terry, who is a real person, definitely got a little weird in the head after tasting the HP22B pepper, a firecracker submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records and grown by a South Carolina named Ed Currie. Foods that only have code names are probably best avoided, but Terry took the plunge in the interest of broadcast journalism, and ended up rolling on the floor talking about how he had "that feeling in your hands." There isn't much literature available on why eating hot peppers would lead to head trips, but 2 things seem to be going on. 1st, there's the endorphin rush from the pain caused by the hotness of the chile; this is what any of us civilian pepper-eaters experience from normal hot sauce, and why burningly spicy things feel so good. But beyond that, it's worth noting that hot peppers are in the same botanical family as potatoes, tobacco, and deadly nightshade. Tobacco's mental effects might be mild, but overdosing on the fruits of potatoes (rarely seen, but they do have fruit if you let the stalks grow and flower) and nightshade plants makes you hallucinate, then die. Capsaicin might be the best-known chemical in hot peppers, but odds are some other potent molecules are in the mix as well.

2. Nutmeg
This might seem like an old wives' tale (or an old bored teenager's tale, to be precise), but nutmeg is actually psychoactive, in the right doses. It takes somewhere between 5 and 15 grams of grated nutmeg, about 2 tablespoons or 2 whole seeds, to have any effect, and even then it only kicks in 3-6 hours later. Reports on psychonaut forums indicate that the nutmeg high varies, from "kinda mix between stoned and drunk" to "high as balls...can't really focus...red eyes...possible nausea," with recommendations to "make sure you have like 36 hours put off from ingestion until you have to do anything. lol." The biggest challenge seems to be choking down enough nutmeg to do anything (oh, and not overdosing while anxiously waiting for its effects to kick in; it can be deadly), but something like our pumpkin-nutmeg milkshake would probably do the trick. Just use 60 times the recommended amount of nutmeg. Or actually, maybe: don't.

3. Fish
But not just any fish; we're talking premium sea bream. Ichthyoallyeinotoxism, which you might know better as "Hallucinogenic Fish Poisoning," comes from eating certain fish that either produce hallucinogenic toxins themselves or just store them up from eating lots of algae with the stuff. Ancient Romans were known to eat Mediterranean sea bream for recreational tripping purposes back in the day, and the fish is known in Arabic as "the fish that makes dreams." Sea bream is really not that exotic of a fish (we even have a great recipe for it!), but every once in a while, especially if you eat its head, the after-effects can get a little weird.

A case report published in Clinical Toxicology describes a "40-year-old executive" vacationing in Cannes who, 2 hours after eating baked bream, started to feel a little sick. Things got worse overnight, with the expected symptoms of food poisoning, until the next day, when he started seeing hallucinations of "aggressive and screaming animals" and "giant arthropods around his car." The same report also describes a 90-year-old man in St. Tropez who cooked the bream himself and started hearing "human screams and bird squealing." In both cases, the hellish symptoms cleared up after a few days, and the men went back to their normal lives (though possibly with an aversion to sea bream).

4. Rye Bread
Well, moldy rye bread. One of the most common grain fungi is called ergot, and it contains a chemical called ergotamine, which is used to make lysergic acid, not LSD itself, but one of the precursor chemicals, which can have similarly trippy effects. As you might remember from around Halloween time last year [2014], there's a chance that ergot-related hallucinations contributed to the mass hysteria of the Salem Witch Trials. Outbreaks of ergot poisoning, which also cause intense convulsions, "gangrenous symptoms," and death, have dropped off since the 19th century, and the last big one happened in a French village in 1951. You shouldn't try any of these at home, but this one is seriously bad news, so lay off the moldy rye. Please.

5. Caffeine
A British study from 2009 found that people who drink three cups of coffee a day (or the equivalent amount of caffeine, whatever the vector) were more likely to hallucinate. Now, before you start shouting "I told you so!" at the demon that lives in your coffee mug, keep in mind that the researchers were working with the idea that hallucinations and psychotic experiences "exist on a continuum stretching into the healthy population." We all hear or see things sometimes, or "feel the presence" of a ghost, and so on, but the study found that coffee was linked to hearing or seeing things a little more than just sometimes. The researchers came up with 2 hypotheses for this: the caffeine could be upping levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, which can freak the brain out to the point of light hallucination, or it could just be that those with a propensity for some mild hallucination self-medicate with caffeine as a coping mechanism."

It is not likely that these foods were involved. Nutmeg is often used in baking but as is stated above, seems to have a longer incubation period. The source of the symptoms is unclear at this time, although atropine-like alkaloids are contained in the nightshade plant (_Atropa belladonna_).

Roscon de reyes or rosca de reyes, translated as kings' ring, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosca_de_reyes) is a Spanish and Latin American king's cake pastry traditionally eaten to celebrate Epiphany. In Catalonia, it is known as tortell. Although the name indicates that it should be round, the rosca de reyes generally has an oval shape due to the need to make cakes larger than 30 cm (12 inches) across for larger parties. Recipes vary from country to country. For decoration, figs, quinces, cherries or dried and candied fruits are used.

It is traditionally eaten on 6 January, during the celebration of the Dia de Reyes (literally "Kings' Day"), which commemorates the arrival of the 3 Magi or Wise Men. In most of Spain, Spanish America, and sometimes, Hispanic communities in the USA, this is the day when children traditionally get presents, which are attributed to the 3 Wise Men (and not Santa Claus or Father Christmas). In Mexico, before children go to bed, they leave their shoes outside filled with hay or dried grass for the animals the Wise Men ride, along with a note.

The tradition of placing a trinket (a figurine of the Christ child) in the cake is very old. The baby Jesus hidden in the bread represents the flight of the Holy Family, fleeing from King Herod's Massacre of the Innocents. Whoever finds the baby Jesus figurine is blessed and must take the figurine to the nearest church on 2 February (Candlemas Day, Dia de la Candelaria). In Mexican culture, this person has the responsibility of hosting a dinner and provide tamales and atole (a traditional hot corn and masa based beverage) to the guests. In US communities with large Mexican and Mexican-American populations such as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, Dallas and Chicago, the celebration includes the Mexican hominy stew pozole, which is made for all one's neighbors.

In Spain, roscones bought in pastry shops have a small figure hidden inside, either of a baby Jesus or little toys for children, as well as the more traditional dry fava bean. Whoever finds the figure is crowned "king" or "queen" of the celebration, whereas whoever finds the bean has to pay for the next year's roscon or Epiphany party.

In France, a similar pastry known as a galette de rois (made with puff pastry and almond cream) is eaten on Epiphany, and in the US, the formerly French and Spanish city of New Orleans continues this tradition later in the year with their Kings' Cake, a rich yeasted bread decorated with colored sugar and eaten before Mardi Gras. - Mod.LL
