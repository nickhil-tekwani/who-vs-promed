[The following sources provide regularly updated information on
clinical aspects of infection with the novel 2009 strain of A (H1N1)
virus infection - Mod.CP]

Novel H1N1 Influenza
--------------------
Information on the novel H1N1 influenza investigation is posted daily
to the CDC website at

Novel H1N1 Influenza: Resources for Clinicians - CDC (1 Jun 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This page is designed to give clinicians access to the latest
guidelines and information on the evolving novel H1N1 influenza
investigation.

Recent Research Results: 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus - USDA - 2 May 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
USDA's Agricultural Research Service researchers tested serum samples
from pigs previously infected with U.S. swine influenza viruses or
vaccinated with commercial vaccines to determine whether U.S.
commercial swine herds are susceptible to the new swine origin (S/O)
H1N1 influenza virus. They found that there was limited cross
reactivity against the new S/O H1N1 influenza virus.

[2] Cruise ships

An Australian cruise ship has been turned away from New Caledonia amid
fears of swine flu. The Dawn Princess cruise liner was prevented from
stopping after up to 5 people on board started showing flu-like
symptoms. Swabs have been taken from the sick passengers and sent to
Sydney for testing.

Dr Jeremy McAnulty from New South Wales Health says the ship has not
been to any swine flu infected countries, but they are still being
cautious. "We've learnt a lot from cruise ships and transmission of
diseases over the last few years, but also particularly in the past
week or so," he said. "We're working to identify people who may have
had infections on board to help determine whether it was swine flu or
something else." The ship is now heading back to Sydney and will
arrive on Friday [5 Jun 2009].

Today [2 Jun 2009], the number of confirmed cases of swine flu in
Australia has risen to about 500, with Victoria's tally now at 395.
Cruise ships have been in the spotlight since late last month [May
2009], when about 3000 passengers and crew on board the Dawn Princess
were not allowed to leave the ship [on its return to] Sydney because 4
passengers displayed mild flu symptoms. The passengers and crew were
then allowed to disembark but told to remain in home isolation until
the all clear was given.

Then cases of swine flu appeared on the P&O cruise ship Pacific Dawn,
which docked in Sydney yesterday [1 Jun 2009]. The 1800 passengers on
the ship were cleared of swine flu and were allowed to disembark,
although 3 crew members were confirmed to have the virus. Passengers
on the ship's previous cruise were found to have swine flu. Yesterday
[1 Jun 2009], the chief executive of Carnival Cruises, which runs P&O,
said passengers might be screened before they boarded the ship for its
next cruise to the South Pacific.

[Passengers disembarking from cruise ships clearly could be a risk
factor for introduction of the novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus
into island communities previously free of infection. For the cruise
ship passengers, on the other hand, the presence of a few infected
individuals so far has not had the dire consequences accompanying
outbreaks of norovirus infection on board cruise ships. It would be
interesting to know whether the age spectrum of the passengers has
affected the spread of infection among them and the crew, since older
age groups seem to have been less vulnerable to the swine-derived A
(H1N1) strain infection than younger age groups. - Mod.CP]
