Deputy Jose Luis Martinez Melendez warned that a disease similar to
mad cow disease is affecting hundreds of livestock in the highlands
[San Luis Potosi] and it could spread to other parts of the state if
the authorities do not intervene in time.

Martinez Melendez said that so far the type of [disease] that is
affecting the livestock has not been determined, but [the
presentation] is similar to what had presented some time ago and was
known as "mad cow disease."

[This is unlikely to be bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,
also known as mad cow disease. BSE has not been reported previously in
Mexico, but this article states the disease is affecting hundreds of
animals. BSE has not been known to affect hundreds of animals all at
once. It also states it has presented some time ago.

It is more likely to be rabies, perhaps transmitted by vampire bats.


While it has not been specifically indicated previously, there are
plants that affect the purkinje brain cells, and can cause the bovine
to be belligerent, stagger, fall and repeat the process. This
moderator is unsure if the plant, _Solanum dimadiatum_ is found in
this particular region of Mexico.

We look forward to an accurate diagnosis. â Mod.TG]

[More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.
