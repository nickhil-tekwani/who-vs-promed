Antimicrobial resistance surveillance
Denmark
---------
The second report of the Danish Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and
Research Programme (DANMAP) on human and animal antibiotic consumption,
and antibiotic resistance in bacteria from humans, animals, and
foodstuffs was recently summarised in EPI-NEWS. DANMAP has been running
for three years and was set up at the request of the Danish ministers of
Agriculture and Fisheries, and Health in 1995.
Antibiotic consumption in the primary care sector declined from 12.8
defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 population in 1994 to 11.3 DDD/1000
in 1997. Consumption of the broad spectrum quinolones and cephalosporins
fell by 39% and 13%, respectively, from 1994 to 1997, but rose by 2.9%
and 9.5%, respectively, in the first nine months of 1998. Distribution
of the use of different types of antibiotics has helped to avoid
resistance problems.
Antibiotic use in animals, for treatment or as a growth promoter, rose
in 1997.
Only one enterococcal isolate was shown to have acquired vancomycin
resistance. Resistance levels in _Escherichia coli_ were generally low
and no differences were found between strains isolated from people with
different occupations. Thirty-one per cent were resistant to
sulphonamide, 19% to ampicillin, and less than 1% to gentamicin or
quinolones. Four indicator bacteria are used: _Enterococcus faecium_,
_E. faecalia_,
coagulase-negative staphylococci, and _E. coli_. Isolates are collected
from army recruits, nurses, slaughterhouse workers, and pig farmers.
Scotland
---------
A similar scheme was set up in Scotland at the end of 1998. The pilot
system for the Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance in Scotland (SARS)
had received one or more weeks' data from 13 of the 24 participating
laboratories by 8 January 1999.
Large numbers of 4-quinolone resistant Enterobacteriaceae were reported
and reports of isolates of resistant enterococci and expanded spectrum
beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae were higher than expected.

Antibiotic resistance common in bacilli infecting European ICU patients
A multinational team reports high rates of antibiotic resistance among
aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from intensive care patients in
Europe.
Dr. Hakan Hanberger and colleagues performed antibiotic susceptibility
tests on gram-negative bacilli isolated from intensive care patients in
Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The researchers tested 9166
gram-negative strains collected from 7308 patients between June 1994 and
June 1995.
Isolates from Portuguese ICUs had the highest percentage of decreased
antibiotic susceptibility "...across all species and drugs," while
isolates from Swedish ICUs had the lowest, Dr. Hanberger and his team
report.
Isolates of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, Enterobacter species,
Acinetobacter species and _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ were most
highly resistant in all countries.
Amikacin and imipenem were the most effective of all the agents tested.
"The high levels of decreased susceptibility among most species of
gram-negative bacilli to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin,
piperacillin-tazobactam, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin in Belgium,
Portugal, France, and Spain further limits use of these drugs for
empirical monotherapy," Dr. Hanberger and his team say.
Infection control measures can limit the spread of multiresistant
bacteria, Dr. Hanberger and his team stress in the 6 Jan 1999 issue of
The Journal of the American Medical Association. Hospitals also should
adopt "...an active program for online antibiotic resistance
surveillance of common drugs...to constantly evaluate antibiotic
administration and pharmacy formulary options," they say. "These
measures have the potential to minimize morbidity and mortality
associated with infections caused by multiresistant bacteria in
critically ill patients."
