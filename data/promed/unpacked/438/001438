Japanese encephalitis (JE) continues in Assam, with one more person succumbing to the disease in Dibrugarh on Wednesday [8 Aug 2018], thus taking the death toll in the state to 66 this year [2018]. So far, 324 individuals have tested positive to the disease, and another 874 persons have been diagnosed with acute encephalitic syndrome (AES) this year.

A report appearing in The Times of India stated that with all efforts to control the spread of JE having proved futile so far, the Assam Health Department is now hoping that the "gradual decrease in temperature" will bring an end to the JE virus.

The report further quoted U Phangsu, state nodal officer of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, as saying on Friday [10 Aug 2018] that "JE claimed the life of a person in Dibrugarh on Wednesday [8 Aug 2018], taking the death toll to 66. We are taking no chances and have sounded an alert to all district health services to remain vigilant for any JE case that may arise and take necessary measures to provide all possible medical facilities. The medical staffs in all hospitals have been directed to attend to such patients with utmost care."

JE is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). While most infections result in little or no symptoms, occasional inflammation of the brain occurs, and symptoms may include vomiting, headache, fever, confusion and seizures. This occurs after 5 to 15 days after infection.

[The cases of JE deaths and confirmed cases have reached 66 deaths and 324 confirmed cases.

Assam state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus, with cases occurring every year. The above report mentions that 874 cases of AES have occurred so far this year (2018). As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES have been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_).

It is odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination in the report above, which would be more effective at preventing JE cases than fogging of residences or environmental spraying. The _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit JE virus breed in extensive wetlands, including rice paddies. Long-lasting insecticidal nets and insecticide-treated bed nets may also reduce numbers of JE virus vector mosquitoes in houses.
