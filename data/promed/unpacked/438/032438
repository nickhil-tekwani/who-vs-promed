New bird flu cases in Thai provinces: deadly virus detected in the north;
culling under way to contain outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
Thailand has reported new outbreaks of bird flu in 2 northern provinces,
bringing the total number of affected areas to 4.
Just days after more recurrences of the deadly virus were reported near the
capital, bird flu cases were discovered in the Sukhothai and Uttaradit
provinces, said Mr. Yukol Limlamthong, director-general of Thailand's
Livestock Department. "Bird flu is confirmed in both places, and we have
already told OIE," he said, referring to the World Organisation for Animal
Health.
Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said about 200
chickens had died on each of several farms in the northern provinces, but
did not say how many farms were hit. A further 1000 chickens had been
killed in an attempt to contain the outbreaks.
Chicken deaths on small farms in the north-eastern province of Mukdahan
were also being investigated as possible bird flu infections, and the
results would be known within the next 2 days, Mr. Yukol said.
Sukhothai is about 360 km north of Bangkok. Uttaradit is about 420 km north
of the capital.
The Thai authorities have tried to play down the latest outbreaks, after
the previous bird flu crisis devastated its billion-dollar poultry industry
and left 8 people dead. On Fri 9 Jul 2004, Thai officials also contradicted
an assertion by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra that the latest outbreak
was brought into the country by open-billed storks. Meeting senior zoo and
forestry officials, and university veterinarians, on Fri 9 Jul 2004,
Natural Resources and Environment Minister Suvit Khunkitti said there had
been no reports of storks being infected or killed by the disease since
April 2004. His remark was at odds with Mr. Thaksin's assertion that the
storks had brought in the disease, the Bangkok Post reported. However, Mr.
Suvit said the ministry would "carry out certain measures" to deal with
open-billed storks. The ministry would devise action plans to cope with
possible bird flu transmission from migratory birds, he said.
On Wed 7 Jul 2004, Thailand confirmed outbreaks in central Ayutthaya and
Pathum Thani provinces of the same deadly strain of avian influenza that
forced the culling of about 100 million chickens in Asia earlier in 2004.
The virus spread to people, killing 8 in Thailand and 16 in Viet Nam.
On Tue 6 Jul 2004, a day earlier, China announced a new outbreak of bird
flu, its 1st report of the avian illness since it declared it had
eradicated the disease nearly 4 months ago.
On Thu 8 2004, Chinese doctors said they had ended clinical observation of
37 people who came into contact with chickens at the site of an outbreak of
bird flu. "As no abnormal symptoms were reported during the observation,
the local health department decided to release the 37," the Xinhua news
agency reported.
China culled more than 20 000 chickens last week [1st week July 2004] in
Anhui province to isolate the new outbreak, and the government said the
disease had been contained.
