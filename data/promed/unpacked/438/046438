Correction: US Army Bases not Affected by the Undiagnosed Disease Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
Jennifer Nuzzo (Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center) and others have pointed out an error in the ProMED-mail post
entitled: "Undiagnosed disease, US Army Bases - Germany (Hesse)" (archived
as 20040224.0582).
In fact, the report from Expatica and the Allgemeine Zeitung report cited
in the Moderator's comment refer to the same circumstances, which involve
only German Army Forces.

&story_id=4888>
No US Army bases are affected in this disease outbreak. We regret the
confusion and thank all those who have alerted us to this error. Apart from
the error in the heading, we believe the rest of the report to be accurate.
