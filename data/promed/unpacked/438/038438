Avian flu-exposed birds destroyed
--------------------------------------------------
CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Nearly 14 000 chickens exposed to avian influenza have been
destroyed, state agriculture officials said Saturday.

The birds from [a] Hardy County farm were killed Friday night in an effort to
keep the disease from spreading and effectively crippling West Virginia's $200
million dollar poultry industry.

The move came after Agriculture Commissioner Gus Douglass declared a state of
emergency and banned public poultry displays and the movement of live birds and
chicken manure. Douglass also banned the public display, sale or mingling of
live eggs at fairs and festivals.

The birds were gassed on the [affected] farm, and the carcasses were taken to
[a] nearby protein conversion plant, a high-temperature cooking operation
sterilizing raw material. The remains were taken to a Tucker County landfill as
a precaution.

"We have conducted tests on all poultry operations within a 2-mile radius of the
quarantined farm and preliminary results are expected back Monday, but it will
take 1 full week for confirmation," said Bill Bissett, state Department of
Agriculture spokesman. "We hope this is just a one-time event and not a
precursor to anything."

Douglass met Saturday with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials and
representatives from the Eastern Panhandle's 2 main poultry companies, to
discuss the situation.

Bissett said a portion of the state's animal health lab has been moved from
Charleston to Moorefield to expedite testing. "The Virginia labs we were using
are max'd out because of their situation and we want more rapid results," he
said.

The Virginia outbreak has resulted in the quarantine of 140 farms and the
destruction of more than 3 million birds. The flu also has been found in North
Carolina.

Poultry is West Virginia's No. 1 agriculture industry, employing more than 5000.

Meanwhile, the quarantine on the [affected farm] which was put in place Thursday
after the birds tested positive, has been lifted. But Bissett said no farm
equipment can leave the property even though everything has been disinfected and
no birds can be brought in. The family must change clothes when leaving and
returning to their home, and their vehicles are sprayed down at the farm's
entrance. West Virginia Poultry Association President Dennis Funk has said he'd
like to see the state help the [affected farm] and, if the disease spreads,
other affected poultry farmers.

State officials have been in contact with the USDA about creating a program to
reimburse poultry farmers for destroyed birds.
