Re: Avian influenza - Eastern Asia (144): Hong Kong, conf.
-----------------------------------------------
Paragraph 2 [of the cited AP news item] implies that this H5N1 virus is the
same as the virus that has killed 32 people in Viet Nam and Thailand this
year [2004]. In fact, we don't know at this time whether this virus is
genetically the same as the one isolated from Viet Nam and Thailand. The
genetic characterization is still in progress. However, the H5N1 virus
isolated from a grey heron at the same location in early November 2004 was
genetically different from the Viet Nam/Thai isolates, and there is no
evidence for this virus infecting humans.
In paragraph 3, the moderator's comments do not fully reflect why local
farms have been protected. [For readers' convenience, the 3rd paragraph
included original news-item text followed by a moderator's remark. The
original text read: "All 20 poultry farms within 5 km (3 miles) were
inspected by health officials, and birds there showed no symptoms of avian
flu, the government said in a statement." The moderator's comment was:
"This might reflect the efficacy of the heterologous (H5N2) vaccine,
compulsorily used in Hong Kong within the application of a DIVA
(Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy, which allows
serological surveillance for the presence of the H5N1 virus strain."]
The protection of local farms relies on major enhancements in biosecurity
relating to local farms, including bird-proofing as well as the use of H5N2
vaccination as an additional insurance measure to prevent infection if an
incursion of H5N1 virus occurs.
There are over 60 individual biosecurity measures in place on the farms (or
relating to movements of birds, people or materials to and from farms) that
now form part of the license conditions for chicken farms in Hong Kong.
With the vaccination program, a DIVA strategy is in place that involves the
inclusion of 60 individually identified unvaccinated sentinel birds within
every batch of vaccinated chickens on farms. The sentinel birds are checked
and tested serologically within 5 days of sale of each batch to confirm the
absence of infection in the vaccinated flock.

[1st-hand information from scientists directly involved in diagnosis and
control of infectious diseases is clearly preferable to indirect or
anecdotal mass-media sources. Drs. Trevor and Wont's 1st-hand,
authoritative explanatory notes regarding the biosecurity measures
prevailing in Hong-Kong are warmly welcomed. Theirs is a significant
contribution to the necessary knowledge on the situation in this crossroads
of vectors and disease agents. In previous ProMED-mail postings, the need
for lacking details was indicated (e.g. 20040421.1108, 20040423.1128).
It would be interesting to note whether the virus isolated from a grey
heron at the same location in early November 2004 is genetically related to
other isolates from local and distant areas, and from other species,
domestic or wild. Readers are referred to Dr. Ellis's (and colleagues)
recent paper, Investigation of outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza in waterfowl and wild birds in Hong Kong in late 2002: Avian
Pathology (October 2004) 33(5), 492-505.
We would be glad to update our subscribers about the genetic
characterization of the last grey heron isolate as soon as it becomes
available. - Mod.AS]
