As of 29 Mar 2019, 3 confirmed cases of EHV have been identified, and the associated premises and exposed horses on the premises have been placed under quarantine by the State Veterinarian. EHV-1 has been confirmed in all 3 cases by lab testing.

Two of the 3 cases have had no travel history since initial exposure or any travel history at all. Trace outs of potential contacts are being pursued for the 3rd case. Two of the cases are in Maricopa County and one case is in Yavapai County.

The Office of the State Veterinarian advises owners to practice sound biosecurity principles. Do not commingle your horse with unfamiliar horses, do not share common waterers or feeders, do not share tack or grooming supplies, and do not share stall cleaning equipment. Separation of horses at events by at least 20-30 feet is encouraged, and do not under any circumstances allow nose-to-nose contact. If the event is optional, you may consider voluntarily withdrawing yourselves from competition to be extra cautious. Finally, please make sure your horse's vaccinations are up to date. Spread of disease becomes more and more difficult with a greater percentage of the population being protected through vaccination.

If you have any questions, reach out to our State Veterinarian's Office.

Equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease linked to equine herpes virus (EHV-1), was confirmed in a Montgomery County reining Quarter Horse on 9 Apr 2019.

The positive horse attended a reining event in Ardmore, Oklahoma the week of 8 Mar 2019. Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) staff have been in contact with the Oklahoma State Veterinarian to ensure event participants were notified and enhanced biosecurity measures are taken.

Since the Oklahoma event, the horse has not traveled to any other event and is under the care of a Brazos County veterinary hospital. The horse was quarantined after showing signs of ataxia and other neurologic signs consistent with EHM.

While the risk of exposure to the virus was likely low at the event, owners of horses potentially exposed are encouraged to take precautions. Exposed horses should be isolated and have their temperatures monitored 2x daily for at least 14 days after last known exposure. If an exposed horse develops a fever or other signs consistent with EHM, diagnostic tests may be performed. Owners should work with their veterinary practitioners to establish appropriate monitoring and diagnostic plans for any potentially exposed horse(s). For more information on biosecurity measures you can take to keep your horses healthy, visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_BiosecurityEquine.pdf.

One of the most common clinical signs of EHV-1 is fever, which often precedes the development of other signs. Respiratory signs include coughing and nasal discharge. Neurologic signs associated with EHM are highly variable, but often the hindquarters are most severely affected. Horses with EHM may appear weak and uncoordinated; urine dribbling and loss of tail tone may also be seen. Severely affected horses may become unable to rise. For more information on EHM, visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_EquineHerpesMyeloencephalopathy.pdf.

It is important to remember that these signs are not specific to EHM, and diagnostic testing is required to confirm EHV-1 infection. Many horses exposed to EHV-1 never develop clinical signs. If you suspect that your horse has been exposed to EHV-1, contact your local veterinarian.

The equine industry is encouraged to obtain the latest information on this outbreak and other disease events across the country by visiting the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) website: http://www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts/outbreaks. Additional Texas EHM cases will be posted on the EDCC.

[If your animal is not vaccinated against this disease, please do so. You cannot be too cautious with this disease, and it can be a killer.

EHV is a very nasty disease. Owners need to step up their biosecurity and get a notebook to document each animal's temperature twice daily. Treatment (which may be only supportive care) at the earliest moment may be important to the life of your animal. That earliest possible moment may be the 1st hint of a rise in body temperature. Do not blow off a tiny rise in temperature as ambient temperature. Be safe and treat early. Get your veterinarian involved at the earliest possible moment. Consider whether that competition, show, trail ride, or whatever is so important that you would endanger your animal. This disease is nasty and shows no mercy. A few horses recover, but it is a very few, and there are no guarantees yours may be in those very few recoveries. - Mod.TG
