Laurel Park canceled racing for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday [26-28 Mar 2021] after the Maryland Jockey Club was informed Thursday [25 Mar 2021] evening by Maryland State Veterinarian Dr. Michael Odian that a horse at Pimlico has tested positive for the equine herpesvirus (EHV-1). The horse had been isolated for 72 hours prior to the positive test. In a statement issued by the Maryland Jockey Club Friday afternoon [26 Mar 2021], the suspension of live racing at Laurel Park has now been extended through 4 Apr [2021].

The news would have impacted fields for the races which were already set for this weekend, thus forcing the cancellation. The decision was made in conjunction with the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen, the release said.

"This is a stressful situation, and we are working our way through it," said Craig Fravel, TSG Chief Executive Officer of Racing Operations. "It's not in our DNA to cancel racing, but we live a world where caution is the better part of valor. We continue to appreciate everyone's cooperation during this time."

In a release issued by the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association Friday [26 Mar 2021], "There are currently 26 horses that tested positive for EHV-1, and all of them are being housed in 3 barns at the former Bowie Training Center. Because those barns are spaced well apart, each is being treated as a separate quarantine zone. Another 11 horses are suspected, but not confirmed, of having the virus."

It continued, "When 4 barns at Laurel were first quarantined 8 Mar [2021], officials employed a 14-day quarantine and protocol that required 2 negative test results, according to Maryland State Veterinarian Dr. Odian. Currently, it is now a 21-day quarantine and protocol that calls for only symptomatic horses or those with a temperature of 101.5 deg F [38.6 deg C] or higher to be tested. Depending on the results of 37 tests scheduled to be run 26 Mar [2021], the earliest the quarantine could be lifted at Laurel is 17 Apr [2021]. At Pimlico, the date is 12 Apr [2021] if there are no further positives. The release of horses from Bowie will be on a barn-by-barn basis."

Laurel is currently racing a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday schedule. They were forced to cancel Saturday and Sunday, 13-14 Feb [2021], due to winter weather and Friday, 12 Mar [2021], racing due to EHV-1 concerns.

As reported in our previous GT Alert (https://www.gtlaw.com/es/insights/2021/3/florida-enacts-limited-quarantine-movement-restrictions-horses-given-ehv-1-outbreak), equine herpesvirus (EHV) cases are currently on the rise in the United States following a recent European outbreak. New EHV cases are being reported in Florida and Kentucky, 2 epicenters of the American equestrian world. EHV-1, the strain at issue in these recent outbreaks, is highly contagious and can lead to death among horses. Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease associated with EHV-1, is also often lethal.

Although the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not recently updated its advice on how best to combat and contain EHV, recommendations from past outbreaks provide key guidance on keeping your equines safe and stopping the virus's spread. Moreover, the USDA's guidance closely tracks restrictive measures recommended by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF). Both EHV-1 and EHM spread easily, mainly via direct horse-to-horse contact, but also indirectly through contact with shared barn equipment, such as contaminated human hands or clothing, horse equipment or tack, horse trailers, rags or other grooming equipment, or feed or water buckets.

EHV-1 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets expelled from an infected equine. The virus can remain airborne for short distances, meaning the air around a horse shedding the virus may itself be contaminated. In order to slow the spread of EHV-1 and EHM, horse owners should pay close attention to their animals' signs and symptoms, particularly following travel to, travel from, or boarding on premises with a known case of EHV-1 or EHM. Signs of infection are as follows:

- EHV-1: The USDA defines a "suspect EHV-1" case as "an exposed horse becoming febrile (rectal temperature greater than 101.5 deg F [38.6 deg C]) during the monitoring period." A case of EHV-1 can only be confirmed after laboratory testing.

- EHM: The USDA defines a "suspect EHM case" as "an exposed horse exhibiting signs of central nervous system dysfunction, including most commonly posterior incoordination, weakness, recumbency with inability to rise, or bladder atony." Other less common signs of central nervous system dysfunction include ataxia, loss of tail tone, lethargy, circling, head pressing, and head tilt. EHM cases are typically confirmed by a positive nasal swab or blood test, or, sadly, in postmortem testing following cases of sudden death.

If your horse has been exposed to EHV, the USDA recommends swift action, beginning with biosecurity and strict isolation of horses with suspect or confirmed cases of the virus:

- Immediately stop horse movement to and from the premises;
- Immediately quarantine sick horses in a separate building, paddock, or isolation facility;
- Immediately consult a veterinarian or animal health officials to determine local notification requirements, including whether you need to report confirmed cases, suspect cases, or clinical signs to your state's State Veterinarian.
- Collect samples from exposed horses to send to the nearest available laboratory for EHV-1 testing;
- Monitor exposed horses for fever and/or neurologic signs for at least 7 days, and log temperature data for each monitored animal;
- Discontinue or reduce strenuous training or exercise for exposed horses;
- Regularly sanitize communal barn equipment; and
- Refrain from sharing equipment among horses on the premises.

Protective measures should not be limited to sick horses. The USDA recommends herd and pasture mates should also be kept isolated and have their temperatures monitored daily. To ensure accurate temperature readings, these horses should not be administered any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are known to mask fever in horses. The USDA presents 2 isolation options for herd mates, depending on the feasibility of daily testing:

Option 1, testing: Clinical cases and herd mates isolated for at least 21 days past resolution of clinical signs, then conduct a releasing test on all horses on the premises; or

Option 2, no testing: Clinical cases and heard mates isolated for at least 28 days past resolution of clinical signs.

For more information and a valuable collection of resources on EHV-1 and EHM, please visit the USDA's equine herpesvirus (EHV) site at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/ehv/equine-herpesvirus (last updated 2 Jun 2020).

[Horses with EHV/EHM are sick animals. They need care. Just like us, they will not be at their best, even several days before caretakers may note overt signs of illness. Monitoring temperatures twice daily is a way to catch this disease early as well as to get the horse early rest to start recovery.

With official guidelines being harmonized between USDA and USEF, then one still wonders when a vaccine can be developed. - Mod.TG
