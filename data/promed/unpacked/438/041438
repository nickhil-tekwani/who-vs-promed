African swine fever outbreak in the Arkhangelsk Oblast [region]
---------------------------------------------------------------
The All-Russia Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and
Microbiology tested pathological material taken from pigs found dead
in a private holding in the closed administrative-territorial unit of
Mirny, Plesetsky Rayon, Arkhangelsk Oblast.

ASFV [African swine fever virus] genetic material was detected. At
the moment of the outbreak the total pig population in the holding was
65 and among them 48 animals died. The animals were fed with swills
from the military unit and children's pre-school institution. The
Rosselkhoznadzor specialists for the Republic of Karelia, the
Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, and State Veterinary
Service of the Arkhangelsk Oblast are working in the area of the
outbreak. At the moment, the measures aimed at prevention and
eradication of African swine fever are being taken in full, the routes
of infectious agent introduction are being investigated.

[Arkhangelsk is the 3rd north-Russian oblast found to be
ASF-infected, following Leningrad and Murmansk. Spread by food and
waste of swine origin was suspected in all 3 oblasts. Suspected case
in a 4th northern oblast, Kaliningrad, was eventually not confirmed.

Russia has submitted to the OIE, on 8 Apr 2011, follow-up report no
54 informing the recent introductions of ASF into Murmansk and
Arkhangelsk. See, with interactive map, at

An interactive map showing all 129 ASF foci throughout Russia since
the start of the epizootic in September 2009, is available at
