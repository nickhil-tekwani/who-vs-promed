A 44-year-old man died of a hantavirus infection, despite a negative rapid test done in the Hernán Henríquez Aravena Hospital.

The deceased person had his residence in Tumaco but worked in the Aysen region. According to the confirmation by the Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat [SEREMI], he presented the 1st symptoms on 9 Feb [2018] but went to a health assistance center 2 days later. Later, he was admitted to the regional hospital in Tumaco where the hantavirus rapid detection test was done, with negative results. Later, a PCR test was done that was positive.

The PCR is a blood test to determine the level of C reactive protein that is used to identify inflammation and infections in the body, because a little after an infection or inflammation begins, the liver liberates protein C in the blood.

Despite receiving specialized attention, the man finally died on the morning of 15 Feb [2018].

Samples were sent to the Laboratory of Molecular Virology of the Universidad Austral de Chile, where a hantavirus infection was finally confirmed.

The Epidemiology and Zoonoses teams of the Araucania and Aysen SEREMIs are currently carrying out related epidemiological investigations, visiting places where, presumably, the infection could have resulted. [The investigations are] taking into account that the patient worked in the Aysen region but during his days off traveled to Temuco.

If the investigations determine that the infection occurred in La Araucania, this would be the 2nd hantavirus [infection] case in 2018.

During 2017, 16 hantavirus [infection] cases were registered in our region, 4 of whom died.

[The final and definitive diagnosis of a hantavirus infection was made in the regional reference laboratory. It is not clear why the rapid test done in the hospital while the patient was still alive but had hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome was hantavirus negative. The specific situation under which this individual acquired his hantavirus infection is not confirmed but is under investigation by the 2 regional SEREMIs. He likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the 2 regions, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person, and, if it is, it is only through very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY

This Friday [16 Feb 2018], the Secretariat of Health reported a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] diagnosed in a patient who was hospitalized last week in a private clinic who had symptoms related to this disease and who worked in the countryside in the La Celina area.

"When there is a patient hospitalized in a private clinic with symptoms related to [a] hantavirus [infection], Argentine hemorrhagic fever and leptospirosis, samples are taken and sent for tests," stated the Secretary of Health, Guillermo Sancho.

"Finally, the alert was given to the office of Vector Control, the Office of Sanitation of the Ministry of Health, and the Department of Urban Zoonoses located in Avellaneda," added the physician from San Pedro who was consulted by La Opinión.

"This case was positive for [a] hantavirus [infection]. We [have been] working with Bromatology of the IV Sanitary Region for several days," it was stated. There were surveys in the field where the patient worked where they counted the workers in relation to the vaccine administration against Argentine hemorrhagic fever [caused by Junin virus].

Health and Bromatology personnel, along with veterinarian Gonzalo Suarez, who is in the lead, were in the field again this Friday [16 Feb 2018]. "We spoke with the people and the boss about prevention, took bleach, gloves, masks, and rodenticide bait," Sancho said, and stated, "there is no person with similar symptoms."

The patient, who was taken to a more complex [treatment] center in the La Plata area, was in intensive therapy but now is in a common ward. "He responded quickly and well," stated Sancho, who added: "We want to take information to the people, especially in the countryside and islands, about preventive measures, because there is no vaccine against hantaviruses."

"Hantaviruses cause a serious, acute virus disease. Field mice (mainly the long-tailed) transmit it to people, shedding virus in saliva, feces and urine," states the National Ministry of Health.

Hantaviruses are transmitted through inhalation, the most frequent cause, and occurs when we breathe in open or closed areas (storage sheds, gardens, pastures) where there are feces or urine from infected rodents that shed the virus, contaminating the environment. Also, [transmission can occur] by direct contact, touching live or dead rodents or the feces or urine of these rodents, or through bites by infected rodents.

The symptoms are similar to influenza: fever, muscle pain, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting and, sometimes, abdominal pain and diarrhea. After a few days, some individuals may have respiratory difficulty that can become worse, causing what is known as "hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome," which is infrequent but can lead to death if not treated in time.

For prevention, it is recommended that one not live together with rodents and in contact with their secretions; avoid [situations where] rodents enter or make their nests in houses; close openings in doors, walls and plumbing, maintain cleanliness with bleach, locate gardens and firewood at least 30 meters [ca. 100 feet] from the house, and cut weeds in a radius of 30 meters around the house.

Ventilate for at least 30 minutes before entering places that have been closed (houses, sheds); cover the mouth and nose with a damp handkerchief before entering; clean up (floors, tables, drawers, cupboards) with one part bleach for every 10 of water (leave on these surfaces for 30 minutes before rinsing); wet the floor before sweeping in order to not raise dust.

When camping, do it far from weeds and trash dumps, do not sleep directly on the ground and consume potable water.

If you encounter a live rodent: use rodenticides or traps to capture them (do not try to touch or hit them). If you encounter a dead rodent: spray it with bleach together with everything with which [the rodent] could have been in contact and wait for 30 minutes. Later, pick it up with gloves and bury it more than 30 cm [1 foot] deep or burn it.

[The specific symptoms that this patient had were not specified, nor was the test used to establish a hantavirus infection diagnosis. As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the case. However, a previous report in 2017 (Hantavirus - Americas (16): Chile (LR), Argentina (BA), USA (PA) 20170220.4850930) indicated that the hantavirus involved in Buenos Aires province was Buenos Aires hantavirus. In that previous case, of the 3 subtypes of Andes lineage virus, Lechiguanas and Plata were discarded, and Buenos Aires was matched by the Molecular Biology Service of the Carlos Malbran Institute. The case above might have been due to infection by the Buenos Aires virus.

Although the long-tailed mouse was mentioned as the rodent host in the report above, the rodent host of this virus has not been determined. The long-tailed mouse (pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), is the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus that is found in the Andean region of Argentina and Chile, much further west than Buenos Aires province.

The Ministry of Health (MINSA) has confirmed 2 hantavirus cases in Los Santos province. These involve a 22-year-old youth and a 49-year-old man who are in intensive care in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas connected to a ventilator. The 22-year-old patient is from the El Bebedero area of Tonosi, and the 49-year-old is a resident of El Cacao in Tonosi.

Carlos Muñoz, a MINSA epidemiologist, stated that in January 2018 and in the 1st 15 days of February 2018, 5 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been reported, 4 in Tonosi and one in Guarare, and of these, 2 for hantavirus fever and 3 with cardiopulmonary syndrome, with deaths in the last week of January [2018].

Of these statistics, currently there are 3 people in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital, one with [hantavirus] fever and 2 others in a delicate state connected to a ventilator.

MINSA stated that they are making house-to-house visits, especially in lower areas in the Tonosi Valley where most of the cases have occurred.

2017 ended with 23 cases, 16 with [hantavirus] fever and 7 with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

[There are frequent cases of infections by hantaviruses in Los Santos province. The situation in which the men acquired their infections is not mentioned. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva.
