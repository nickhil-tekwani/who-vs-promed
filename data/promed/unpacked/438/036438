An unprecedented number of Andean condors were found dead in western Argentina this week [week of Sun 21 Jan 2018], threatening a symbolic bird whose numbers are dwindling in parts of South America.

The bodies of 34 condors, 20 males and 14 females, were reported to environmental authorities in Mendoza province, and toxicology tests suggested they had been poisoned, the province said in a statement.

Luis Jacome, director of the Andean Condor Conservation Project in Buenos Aires, said condor deaths from eating poisoned carcasses have become more common as a result of what authorities suspect is an effort to kill predators of cattle.

"This is reflecting the bad practices of ranchers in terms of toxic bait," he said in an interview on [Thu 25 Jan 2018].

Sheep, goats and a puma were also found dead on [Mon 22 Jan 2018] in the same area, near the town of Los Molles.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the Andean condor a nearly threatened species, estimating South America has around 10 000 of the birds. They are more common in southern South America and are now very rare in Ecuador and Venezuela.

Vanesa Astore, executive director of the Condor Conservation project, said condors take a long time to mature and are slow to breed, making the poisoning of adults particularly devastating. One of the largest flying birds in the world, condors can live for about 70 years.

"This really puts conservationists on alert," she said. "It could lead to the extinction of the species."

[A picture of the sad finding can be accessed here http://bucket3.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/58/2616158h688.jpg. The carcasses were found piled in a lump and were partially burned. It is hypothesized that they died after ingesting bait laced with poison, intended for pumas and foxes. This is a dangerous practice carried out by livestock farmers to kill those predators. The results of the post mortem exams and tests are expected next week [week of Sun 28 Jan 2018].

Andean condors (_Vultur gryphus_) are scavengers. They do not kill to eat. The Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world. For a picture go to http://cdn.natgeotv.com.au/subject-andean%20condor.jpg?v=27&azure=false&scale=both&width=1920&height=960&mode=crop.

Since 2012, The Peregrine Fund has been monitoring the condor population. As of 2014 there were some 50 Andean Condors surviving in the wild in Ecuador, and of these as many as 30 roosts in the high cliffs of Antisanilla. The species was listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, and in Ecuador the Andean Condor is Critically Endangered in 2012-2014 and is likely still on the threatened or critically endangered list. Also it is the national bird of Ecuador. In 2013 there were 20 Andean Condors found dead in the mountain range between Chili and Argentina. At that time there were discovered several other mammals deceased in the region too. As Moderator PB points out, these birds are scavengers so if the larger mammals were killed by poison, then if the Condors consumed the mammals they could be the victims of what is known as secondary or relay toxicity. In several states in the USA, similar situations between mammals and scavengers have happened. In many cases the toxin has been some type of rodenticide. The rodenticide may have put out to prevent rodent critters from consuming crops, or may have been put out with the malicious intent of killing of a predator animal (cougar?) that was possibly killing livestock. The deceased animals can often be tested for the specific type of toxin at a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. - Mod.TG]
