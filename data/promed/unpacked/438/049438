Dr. Essam Fayed, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, announced that livestock will be vaccinated free of charge all over the country against foot and mouth disease [FMD] in order to mitigate the suffering of small farmers keeping livestock.

The Minister of Agriculture added that a total of 36 million Egyptian pounds [USD 4 600 000] will be disbursed to cover the costs of the vaccination campaign.

He appealed to livestock owners to rush to points dedicated for vaccination either in veterinary units or gathering points to be announced by the General Authority for Veterinary Services [GOVS].

For his part, Dr. Ibrahim Mahrous, GOVS chairman, said that the vaccination points will have the required quantities of FMD vaccine and be open around the clock.

He pointed out that the immunization will be implemented within a radius of 10 kilometers [ca. 6 mi] around FMD foci.

He finally stressed that currently, FMD clinical cases are being treated and the diseased animals isolated from healthy congeners as a control measure.

[An apparently important vaccination campaign against FMD is to be launched soon throughout Egypt, in response to disease outbreaks. Ring vaccination is envisaged with a radius of 10 kilometers around detected FMD foci.

No information is provided on the present status of FMD in Egypt.

ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information from authorized sources, including on the identity of the virus serotype(s) in circulation. - Mod.AB
