Laboratory tests confirmed 2 new hantavirus [infection] cases of residents in Chitré and Ocú districts according to the epidemiology department of the Herrera Health Region.

The Ministry of Health (MINSA) stated that the cases were identified this past weekend [24-25 Dec 2022]. One is a 47 year old man resident of Chitré district who was treated and hospitalized in a private medical center in the Capital, and is currently under ambulatory management and in a stable condition.

The other case is a 34 year old female resident of La Huaca community in Los Llanos unit of Ocú district, who presented with symptoms compatible with those of hantavirus fever which was confirmed after laboratory tests were done. The patient remains hospitalized in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Rios Hospital in Chitré and is in a stable condition.

In both cases, field investigations were carried out and necessary recommendations were offered in order to avoid other infections, among others the correct storage of hay bales, animal feed, and grain. Also, vector control technicians placed traps around the houses and in sites frequented by the patients in order to confirm the presence of the mouse that transmits the disease.

During 2022, Herrera province has had a total of 7 cases of hantavirus [infections], so it is recommended that the population take extreme cleaning measures in the premises of their residences and surroundings in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

Other preventive measures recommended are:
- store grain in bags and closed plastic containers placed on platforms and separated from the walls;
- slace firewood or other useful materials at a distance from the house, in dry areas, aired and on platforms;
- drain the residual water on the patios and keep them clean;
- keep the kitchen area clean and utensils covered in containers in order to avoid contact with rodents;
- open doors and windows for 60 minutes before cleaning areas that have been closed for a long time; and
- dampen the floor with water in order to avoid raising dust.

[These are the 6th and 7th cases of hantavirus infection in Herrera province this year (2022). There were 5 reported cases of hantavirus infections earlier this year (2022) (see Hantavirus - Americas (38): Panama (HE) Chile 20221212.8707220). The virus is endemic in the province and cases are reported there frequently.

Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that, based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
