Egyptian Children Face Mumps Outbreak
-------------------------------------
More than 100 children have been affected by a mumps outbreak in Marashda [official name Al MarƒÅshidah located in Qina governorate], Egypt, with 43 cases and 70 infections reported. Officials at the Ministry of Health insist that this is not a serious outbreak. However, many children are not attending school out of fear of infection.

Mumps is caused by mumps virus and is spread when a person comes into contact with infected droplets of saliva or mucus, usually through coughing, sneezing, or sharing dishes. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, and fatigue, along with serious complications such as inflammation of the brain and deafness.

Egyptian officials are working to provide treatment for infected youth. However, vaccination is considered the best strategy for avoiding mumps infection. The vaccination for mumps is a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, (MMR). It is recommended that children receive 2 doses: one at age 12-15 months and another at age 4-6 years. The 1st MMR vaccine became available in 1967 and has reduced mumps prevalence by 99 percent.

This outbreak has occurred alongside news that Egypt is facing a nationwide vaccine shortage. Administrative delays have prevented the health ministry from replacing expired vaccines. While vaccines are available in private clinics, their costs make them unattainable to most patients. "The longer the government fails to immunize these children, the more vulnerable to disease they are," explained Eman Masoud, head of the Pediatrics Section at Abul Riesh University Hospital in Cairo.

Experts recommend that people experiencing symptoms of mumps contact a provider immediately and avoid situations where they might infect others, such as in a clinic waiting room.

[It is likely that this large outbreak of mumps virus infection is a consequence of disruption of the routine programme of immunisation of children with the combined MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine due to a temporary shortage of vaccine in Egypt.

Mumps virus was isolated in 1945, and an inactivated vaccine was developed in 1948. This vaccine produced only short-lasting immunity, and its use was discontinued in the mid-1970s. Most vaccines contain the Jeryl Lynn strain of live attenuated mumps virus vaccine. Mumps vaccine produces an inapparent, or mild, noncommunicable infection. More than 97 percent of recipients of a single dose develop measurable antibody. Seroconversion rates are similar for single antigen mumps vaccine or the combined MMR vaccine. A study in the United Kingdom documented vaccine effectiveness of 88 percent with 2 doses. The duration of vaccine-induced immunity is believed to be greater than 25 years, and is probably lifelong in most vaccine recipients. - Mod.CP
