An outbreak of strangles at a Tipton County, Tennessee boarding farm has led to 3 confirmed cases, 5 suspected cases and a total of 40 horses potentially exposed to the bacterial disease. The horses were diagnosed by a local veterinarian, according to the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC), and the farm is under voluntary quarantine.

Strangles spreads rapidly, producing large outbreaks in herds not previously exposed or vaccinated.

Also called equine distemper, the infection known as strangles typically begins 10 to 12 days after exposure to _Streptococcus equi_ bacteria. First the horse experiences a high fever, depression, appetite loss and enlargement of the lymph nodes between the jawbones. Copious amounts of thick, yellow pus begin draining from the nostrils, and before 3 weeks are up, the abscessed nodes at the throat may burst open to drain.

The disease's descriptive name comes from the "strangling" noise produced as severely affected horses struggle to draw breaths into their obstructed airways. Aside from observing the obvious physical signs in diagnosis, veterinarians can run cultures of the nasal drainage to see if it contains the streptococcal organism.

Exposure often occurs when a new horse, who's shedding the _S. equi_ bacterium without visible signs of sickness, is introduced into a herd. The organisms spread from horse to horse through direct contact, such as touching muzzles, environmental contamination and shared equipment, such as feed buckets and bridles. Strangles spreads rapidly, producing large outbreaks in herds not previously exposed or vaccinated. The infection is especially aggressive in populations of foals and young horses.

Most horses recover, but fatalities do occur, primarily from secondary pneumonia taking hold in debilitated or immune-compromised animals. And every now and again, _S. equi_ infect lymph nodes deeper within the body, producing a more dangerous condition called bastard strangles.
