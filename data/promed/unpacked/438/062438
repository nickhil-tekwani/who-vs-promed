[A 29-year-old] bird flu patient from the Sukoharjo district in
Central Java, died at Dr Moewardi Hospital in Solo (Central Java) on
Thursday morning [5 Apr 2007] after having been treated for several
days. Hospital spokesperson, Titik Lestary, said on Thursday that the
patient, a bird flu suspect, died at 3 a.m. local time.
"To make sure that [the patient] is bird flu positive, his blood
sample has been sent to the laboratory in Jakarta but he died before
we obtained the result of laboratory test," Titik Lestary said. She
added that the body had been handed over to his family for burial at
his home village.
Meanwhile, Dr Suradi, Chairman of Bird Flu Management Team at Dr
Moewardi Hospital, said [the patient] was admitted to the hospital on
Fri 30 Mar 2007. But on Tuesday afternoon [3 Apr 2007] he was
transferred to a special isolation room for bird flu patients after
his condition got worse and made his breathing difficult.
Earlier, on 28 Mar 2007, a [39-year-old] bird flu patient, from Jetis
village in Mojokerto district, East Java, also died at Dr Soetomo
Hospital in Surabaya. Dr Soetomo Hospital spokesman, Teguh
Sylvaranto, said [the patient] died of H5N1 virus infection, and
liver and kidney failure. According to Dr Teguh Sylvaranto, this was
the 2nd bird flu patient, who died at Dr Soetomo Hospital after the
death of [another patient], also from Mojokerto, a week earlier.
He pointed out that of 11 bird flu suspects who had been treated in
the hospital, 4 were tested [for H5N1] and the [results] were
negative.
There are at least 93 confirmed human cases of bird flu in Indonesia,
72 of them fatal. [According to the most recent statement from WHO
(World Health Organization), as of 2 Apr 2007, the number of
laboratory confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Indonesia
is 81, with 63 fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Data from the WHO said worldwide there were 274 confirmed human cases
of avian influenza A virus infection, 167 of which were fatal. [As of
2 Apr 2007 the WHO states that the global total of laboratory
confirmed human cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection is 288,
with 170 fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Meanwhile, Indonesia has agreed to resume sending bird flu samples to
laboratories overseas after a 2-day meeting on the issue organized by
WHO. According to Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari, Indonesia
expected a guarantee that the samples would not be used to develop
commercial bird flu vaccines. "We will resume sharing bird flu
samples with the World Health Organization immediately," the health
minister said.

[2] Kuwait - Bangladeshi cullers test negative
Date: Thu 5 Apr 2007

<http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070405/wl_mideast_afp/healthflukuwait_070405125622;_ylt=A0WTUe.IFBVGSUYBMQyTvyIi?>

The 4 Bangladeshi workers who had initially tested positive for avian
H5N1 influenza virus infection in Kuwait, have been cleared of the
disease after further tests, the Kuwaiti health minister said on Thu
[5 Apr 2007]. "We are happy to declare that the results of the tests
... in the referenced laboratory in Egypt have been negative,"
Minister of Health, Maasouma al-Mubarak, told reporters after the
latest tests by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
On Wed [4 Apr 2007], the 4 workers who had been culling infected
chickens in Kuwait tested positive in preliminary tests, but the
Ministry of Health sent specimens to the WHO reference laboratory in
Egypt for confirmation. They would have been the first cases of bird
flu affecting humans in Arab nations of the Gulf, had the cases been
confirmed. The 4 workers were admitted to Kuwait's infectious
diseases hospital with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday [3 Apr 2007]. The
men have been isolated in a special ward and were still at the
hospital on Wednesday [4 Apr 2007].
Since the outbreak of bird flu in Kuwait, 22 people have been
admitted to hospital on suspicion of being infected, but later
discharged after confirming they were healthy. The Bangladeshis were
part of government teams culling and burying hundreds of thousands of
chickens in Wafra, south of Kuwait City, on the Saudi border.
Kuwait has culled about 1.7 million birds, most of them egg-laying
chickens in 4 commercial poultry farms, since confirming in February
[200] an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus that is
dangerous to humans.
A total of 106 cases of the strain have so far been confirmed in birds.
In November 2005, the Gulf state announced the 1st case of a bird
infected with the H5N1 strain -- a flamingo at a seaside villa.

[As predicted by the Moderator, the 4 Bangladeshis employed in Kuwait
in culling operations have not contracted avian influenza. It is
likely that greater awareness of risk of infection, and the
availability of antiviral drugs and protective clothing are
sufficient to provide adequate protection. - Mod.CP]
