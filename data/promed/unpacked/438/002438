According to the regional Department of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], a resident of the village of Smolino Kovrovsko in the Vladimir region contracted rabies after being bitten by his domestic cat at the end of February [2014]. Recently, the 50-year-old man owner of the animal was hospitalized in intensive care unit with a diagnosis of rabies. He had not undertaken any measures to protect himself [after being bitten].

According to the office of Rospotrebnadzor, when the man was bitten by this animal, he was referred for medical aid to the local medical assistant, but he was not vaccinated. After a few days the cat started to demonstrate inadequate behavior. The owner called the local vet who euthanized the cat.

For some reason the cat's behavior did not arouse suspicions in the owner. The vet also did not take any measures.

The 1st symptoms of the disease appeared in the owner of the animal at the end of March 2013. The ambulance doctors diagnosed ILI [influenza-like illness]. On 5 Apr 2014 the patient's condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of rabies

Now quarantine measures have been applied in Smolino village. Employees of Rospotrebnadzor believe that the cat could have contracted the virus from a fox. 2 domestic dogs, bitten by foxes died in the area in the last 2 months.

Rospotrebnadzor states that effective treatments for rabies does not exist. The only way to protect from the disease is a prompt course of vaccination after exposure.

[Cases of rabies in humans in the Vladimir region have now been registered for the 2nd year in a row. In February 2013, a 43-year-old man died from rabies in another district in the Vladimir region. He was bitten by a raccoon dog and referred for medical aid only after he developed clinical manifestations of the disease. A total of 6 cases of human rabies were diagnosed in Russia last year (2013). - Mod.NP

Though the virus was not recovered from the cat, it should be possible to obtain it from this Smolino villager and type it. And frankly, cats prefer to have no interactions with a fox, healthy or rabid, as it is usually lethal for the cat. If it had been bitten by a fox and escaped the trauma would have been obvious. It is more usual for cats to get infected from sick rabid bats. A rabid bat is a choice plaything for a cat. - Mod.MHJ
