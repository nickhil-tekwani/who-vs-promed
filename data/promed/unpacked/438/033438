[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) was 1st described in Norway in 1984, and outbreaks occur periodically in Norway and Chile. It is mainly a disease of Atlantic salmons (_Salmo salar_) caused by an ortomixovirus and in general affects fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry.
