H7N9 kills one in Shanghai
-----------------------
The H7N9 bird flu killed one person in Shanghai on Friday [10 May 2013], local health authorities said on Saturday, bringing the nationwide death toll to 33.

An 83-year-old woman surnamed died Friday evening in a local hospital one month after her infection was confirmed, the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission announced. As of 5 p.m. Saturday, Shanghai has confirmed 33 H7N9 cases. Four of them are being treated in hospital, 15 have recovered and 14 others died.

Since China confirmed the first human infections with the bird flu virus in late March, the country has so far reported 130 [now 132] confirmed H7N9 cases, including 33 deaths.

Shanghai Ends H7N9 Bird Flu Emergency Measures
------------------------------------------
Shanghai, one of the cities hit hardest by an outbreak of H7N9 in China this spring, will end its emergency response measures following the absence of new cases [in Shanghai] in the past 20 days, the state-published Shanghai Daily reported today. The city, one of Asia's most important business hubs, reported 33 [human] cases of H7N9 bird flu, 13 of whom died.

Live poultry markets in Shanghai that were shut on April 6 in a move to control the spread of the flu will remain closed, the newspaper said.

The outbreak has reportedly caused more than $1 billion of losses to China's poultry industry as demand for chicken meat plunged. Same-store sales at the KFC fried-chicken chain fell 29% in April. However, shares among China-listed chicken processors have been rebounding on hopes that the worst is over. Shenzhen-traded shares in New Hope Liuhe , controlled by billionaire Liu Yonghao, climbed 1.5% on Friday. China KFC supplier in Dachan (Asia) climbed 3.8% in Hong Kong on Friday, and KFC parent Yum! rose 1.9% in New York last night.

[3] Fall-off in cases

Cases of A(H7N9) are on the decline say Chinese Health Officials
------------------------------------------------------
The number of new cases of the H7N9 bird flu is dropping, health officials said today (Fri 10 Mat 2013). While the outbreak is still ongoing, new cases are being reported less frequently in May than in April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

As of 8 May 2013 , there were 131 total cases of H7N9 bird flu, and 32 of these patients have died. [As of today the figures are now 132 cases and 33 deathts. - Mod.CP]. In the first week of April, 21 new cases of the illness were reported in total, with multiple cases reported each day in that week. In contrast, health officials were notified of just four additional cases between May 2 and May 7. The World Health Organization is now releasing updates about new
H7N9 cases just once a week, instead of daily.

The reason for the drop-off is not clear. It could be due in part to efforts to reduce exposure to the virus throughclosing live bird markets, the CDC said. But it could also be the result of the changing seasons. Just like human influenza viruses, bird flu viruses follow seasonal patterns as well -- for instance, the bird flu virus H5N1 is known to be more active in the winter than the summer. The pattern of H7N9 remains to be seen, but it's possible that cases may pick up in colder months, the CDC said.

Right now, there are no reports of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus. No cases of H7N9 have been seen in the United States, and currently, the risk to people living in the U.S. is low, the CDC said. Even if a case of H7N9 is reported in the United States, it would not necessarily raise the public's risk. (The risk would rise if the transmission pattern of the virus changes -- for instance, if it begins to spread between people, the CDC said.) If a person in the United States is found to have H7N9, he or she would be isolated, and people that the patient came into contact with would be tested for illness.

The CDC is in the process of developing a H7N9 flu vaccine in case it's needed. It typically takes six months to produce large quantities of flu vaccine, but health officials have not decided yet whether to mass-produce the H7N9 vaccine [which does not yet exist. - Mod.CP].

Major Challenges in Providing an Effective and Timely Pandemic Vaccine for Influenza A(H7N9)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(By: Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH; Katie S. Ballering, PhD; Nicholas S. Kelley, PhD)

The emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans has public health authorities around the world on high alert for the potential development of a human influenza pandemic.1 As of May 8, 2013, authorities had identified 131 confirmed cases and 32 deaths among residents of 8 provinces and 2 municipalities in China.2

Three primary scenarios exist for how this A(H7N9) virus outbreak will unfold. First, the virus could disappear in the animal reservoir, ending new human cases. Second, the virus could persist in the animal reservoir, resulting in sporadic human infections. Third, the virus could, through mutation or reassortment, become readily transmissible between humans, resulting in a global pandemic.

The arsenal of public health tools to reduce morbidity and mortality from an influenza pandemic is limited. Options include vaccines, antiviral drugs, and interventions such as respiratory protection and social distancing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Influenza vaccination is the most important intervention in reducing the impact of influenza, and a key component of the WHO response and preparedness efforts for influenza of pandemic potential, including avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H9N2) and A(H7N9)."3 However, seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines have significant limitations,4 including limited vaccine effectiveness, the inability to identify reliable correlates of protection, and the need to distribute large quantities of vaccine early in the pandemic course.

Estimated Effectiveness Of A(H7N9) Vaccines
--------------------------------------
Data for seasonal influenza vaccines and the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines provide a basis for estimating potential effectiveness of A(H7N9) vaccines. Inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines have a pooled efficacy estimate of 59%, primarily for younger adults.4 A paucity of evidence exists for demonstrating protection in adults aged 65 years or older, particularly with influenza A vaccines. The pooled efficacy of live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) is 83% in children aged 6 months to 7 years, but currently available data do not support effectiveness in the population aged 8 years or older.4

The median effectiveness reported in 6 studies of adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic vaccines was 72% (range, 60%-93%).4 In a study of unadjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine conducted in the United States, effectiveness was 56% (95% CI, 23%-75%).4 For these studies, most participants were younger than 50 years, with approximately half younger than 18 years.

There is no reason to believe that a yet-to-be-developed pandemic A(H7N9) vaccine will perform any better than existing seasonal vaccines or the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines, particularly with regard to vaccine efficacy in persons older than 65 years. To date, the median age of H7N9 cases is 60 years. If a pandemic occurs and this epidemiologic pattern persists, a pandemic A(H7N9) vaccine, even if it includes an adjuvant, will likely have limited to modest effects on the overall morbidity and mortality from the novel strain.

Determining And Measuring Correlates Of Protection For A(H7N9) Vaccines
---------------------------------------------------------------
In the United States, vaccine dose for inactivated pandemic vaccines is determined by the amount of hemagglutinin head antigen needed to achieve a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 1:40 in at least 70% of children and adults younger than 65 years or, alternatively, the amount of antigen needed to demonstrate that 40% of recipients have a 4-fold or greater increase in HI.5 Even though HI titers have been used for decades as a correlate of protection for influenza vaccines, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) noted that "prospectively designed studies to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines have not identified a specific HI antibody titer associated with protection against culture-confirmed influenza illness."5 LAIVs do not have a recognized correlate of protection, which will create challenges for interpreting immunogenicity of candidate H7N9 vaccines.

The limited data available suggest that for an H7N9 vaccine to provide protection, it will likely require significantly more antigen than seasonal vaccines, will likely require an adjuvant, or both. Two phase 1 clinical studies of an inactivated H7 vaccine have been conducted to date.6- 7 In one study using an unadjuvanted H7N7 vaccine, only 8 of 22 recipients receiving 2 doses of 90-μg vaccines had at least a 4-fold HI increase; none achieved a 1:40 titer.6 In another study of an H7N1 vaccine with adjuvant, none of 13 recipients receiving 2 doses of a 24-μg adjuvanted vaccine had a 1:40 titer.7 A single phase 1 study of an H7N3 LAIV demonstrated safety and most participants had a measurable immune response, although a recognized correlate of protection for LAIV has not been identified.8 Previous studies with H5N1 vaccines required 2 90-μg doses for 50% of adults to develop 1:40 HI titers; however, an adjuvanted vaccine using 3.8 μg showed improved results.
