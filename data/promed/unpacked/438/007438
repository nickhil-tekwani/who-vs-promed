ProMED-mail is the highly-effective worldwide network of many thousands of
participants, including international, regional and national agencies,
universities, medical, public health, veterinary, biology and food science
departments and individual professional practitioners in these fields.
In a world in which disease can be transported rapidly across the globe, and
where "no man is an island" is truer today than ever before, the information
exchange and especially the early warning exchange that ProMED-mail
provides, makes it an invaluable asset. I have certainly found it so, both
in receiving information posted by other subscribers and in contributing
information on foodborne diseases.
It is a non-profit, non-government organization with tax-free charitable
status, and I strongly commend it for every kind of support.
