[On Thu 31 May 2007, the local newspaper Pioneer quoted a local
official as saying that] a change in the bird flu virus strain H5N1
has diminished the effectiveness of vaccines against the disease among poultry.
[Avian influenza] vaccines are produced according to the gene type Z
found in bird flu virus strain H5N1 in 2003, when Viet Nam was 1st
hit by the disease, but another gene type called G was detected in
2005, said Nguyen Tien Dung, head of the Ultra-Virus Department of
the Veterinary Institute under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development. The types Z and G genes are not very similar, so the
vaccines are more effective [against] type Z, and less effective
[against] type G, he said, noting that the 1st infected poultry with
the type G gene in Viet Nam were mainly smuggled.
According to the ministry's Department of Animal Health, Viet Nam is
strengthening bird flu vaccination among fowls nationwide, using
vaccines imported mainly from China and the Netherlands.
Avian influenza, which first struck Viet Nam in December 2003, has
hit 12 Vietnamese cities and provinces, namely Quang Ninh, Son La,
Nam Dinh, Hai Phong, Bac Giang, Ninh Binh, Bac Ninh, Ha Nam, and Vinh
Phuc in the northern region, Nghe An in the central region, and Can
Tho and Dong Thap in the southern region. [See administrative map of

Avian influenza has killed hundreds of ducks in 2 farms in northern
and southern Viet Nam in the past 2 days, the Agriculture Ministry
said on Thursday [31 May 2007].
On Tuesday [29 May 2007], 115 ducks died at a farm in the southern
Mekong delta city of Can Tho and 150 ducks died in the northern
province of Quang Ninh on Wednesday [30 May 2007]. Tests confirmed
the H5N1 virus in both cases, the Animal Health Department said. The
2 flocks had not been vaccinated against bird flu and animal health
workers slaughtered the remaining 685 ducks there. The number of
birds killed by the virus and slaughtered this month [May 2007], is
more than 50 000 nationwide.
Quang Ninh province and Can Tho city are among the 12 localities that
reported bird flu outbreaks in poultry this month [May 2007], at the
beginning of summer, which is unusual as experts say the virus
thrives best in cool temperatures.
On Wednesday [30 May 2007], Agriculture Minister, Cao Duc Phat, said
the country was on the brink of another bird flu epidemic in poultry
after [rapid spread over the past month of] the H5N1 virus.
Last week [22 May 2007], the Southeast Asian country reported its 1st
human case of H5N1 virus infection in a year and a half, a
30-year-old man in a province neighbouring Hanoi. Doctors treating
the man in Hanoi's Bach Mai hospital said his condition was improving
and that he was now able to breathe without a respirator.
Bird flu has killed 42 people in Viet Nam since it re-surfaced in
Asia in late 2003. The virus struck both people and birds in Viet Nam
in 2005, but only infected poultry last year [2006], and early this
year [2007, before the 30-year-old became infected.]
Globally the virus has infected 309 people in 12 countries, with 187
fatalities, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

[The virus seems to be spreading among unvaccinated birds; problems
affecting the effectiveness of the vaccination project have been
described in ProMED-mail postings 20070515.1543 and 20070519.1593.
Viet Nam's last (7th) OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
follow-up report on HPAI H5N1 was submitted on 24 May 2007 (see

A new update is expected. - Mod.AS]
