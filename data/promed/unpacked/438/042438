According to a March 2014 University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) bulletin, the lab is seeing a statistically significant increase in positive _Lawsonia intracellularis_ test results as compared to recent years.

Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is an emerging disease of horses that has been reported worldwide. EPE is caused by _L. intracellularis_, a gram-negative bacterium that invades intestinal crypt cells, primarily in the small intestine, and causes thickening of the intestinal lining. This thickening leads to the clinical signs associated with EPE, including anorexia, weight loss, fever, lethargy, depression, and peripheral/ventral edema (fluid swelling), with colic and diarrhea seen occasionally. A thickened small intestinal wall observed by a veterinarian via abdominal ultrasound, although not reliably observed, is highly suggestive of EPE. Clinical EPE is typically found in weanlings and young yearlings, with only a few reports of older horses being affected.

_Lawsonia intracellularis_ infections have been reported in a number of species, including pigs and laboratory animals, but not humans. EPE is significant not just because of the clinical aspects of the disease, but also because of its economic importance.

Veterinarians can confirm a diagnosis using PCR (polymerase chain reaction, a biochemical technology in molecular biology) on feces. Because the disease's epidemiology is not well-understood, practitioners have not yet determined effective prevention methods. The University of California, Davis is testing a swine vaccine for safety and efficacy. The UKVDL can assist in diagnosing an _L. intracellularis_ infection by performing PCR tests, which are run daily with a 1-2 day turnaround. Samples sent to the laboratory should be 5 grams of intestinal scraping; fecal specimen; fecal swab; and/or scraping of mucosa of harvested tissue. Specimens should be submitted in screw-cap tubes. The cost is USD 35 in-state and USD 52 out-of-state, plus a USD 10 accession fee.

[Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is an emerging intestinal disease in horses that primarily affects weanling foals 4 to 7 months of age. It was 1st reported in horses in 1982, and since 1996 many more reports of sporadic cases in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa, South America and Australia have been described. The disease can cause a variety of nonspecific clinical signs, including decreased appetite, depression, weight loss, diarrhea, fever, edema and poor body condition.

EPE is caused by a bacterial pathogen, _Lawsonia intracellularis_, that affects a wide range of animals including pigs, hamsters, rabbits, fox, deer, ferrets, ostriches and nonhuman primates. The organism invades the intestinal epithelial cells and results in hyperplasia, an abnormal increase in the number of cells within the organ, which causes the organ to become enlarged. While a wide range of host species can be infected by this pathogen, the clinical features among the hosts appear to be very similar.

EPE is usually manifested in foals between 2 and 8 months of age and in North America is often seen between the months of August and January. Lethargy, lack of appetite, fever, peripheral edema (abdomen, sheath, throatlatch and distal limbs), weight loss, colic and diarrhea are among the most common clinical findings. Although diarrhea is commonly seen in affected foals and can vary from cow pie to watery, some foals may have normal fecal character.

Foals with EPE may also have concurrent health problems such as respiratory tract infections, gastric ulcerations and intestinal parasites. The clinical signs of EPE may resemble those of more common gastrointestinal disorders such as parasitism, bacterial infections (_Clostridium difficile_, _Salmonella sp_., _Rhodococcus equi_), rotavirus, coronavirus, ulcerations, sand accumulation and intestinal obstruction. As with pigs, EPE is often subclinical in foals, that is, it does not produce the clinical signs either because infection is in the early stages or because it is a mild case. It is unknown whether subclinical infection is associated with growth retardation or unthriftiness.

A definitive diagnosis of EPE can be challenging and relies on a combination of several factors:
- The presence of low total blood protein levels (hypoproteinemia)
- Exclusion of common intestinal diseases
- Thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall as seen through abdominal ultrasonography
- Serum antibody testing
- Molecular (PCR) detection of _Lawsonia intracellularis_ in feces

The most consistent laboratory finding has been a decrease in the levels of total blood protein and albumin. Total protein is generally less than 5.0 g/dl (normal reference range 5.8-7.7 g/dl) and albumin is usually less than 2.0 g/dl (normal reference range 2.7-4.2 g/dl). In a recent case reported in the scientific literature, low levels of albumin were the only consistent abnormalities of 57 affected foals. Affected foals may also demonstrate nonspecific blood abnormalities such as anemia or hemoconcentration.

It is important to treat affected animals early, before lesions (commonly seen in the ileum) become advanced, resulting in marked weight loss and critically low serum protein values (hypoproteinemia). Treatment of horses with EPE involves the use of antimicrobials such as macrolides alone or in combination with rifampin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, or doxycycline administered for 3 weeks

The choice of antimicrobial in the treatment of EPE should take into account the risk of disturbing gastrointestinal flora or inducing renal toxicity. This is especially a concern when treating older foals with severely depressed levels of serum albumin.

Supportive care such as intravenous fluids, plasma transfusion, parenteral nutrients and anti-ulcer drugs are commonly used to treat affected foals.

Concurrent medical conditions should also be addressed. Although it may take weeks for the low serum protein values to resolve, rapid clinical improvement following treatment can be expected.

Prevention strategies have been best described in pigs using in-feed antimicrobials and a commercially available vaccine against _L. intracellularis_. Work at UC Davis has shown that a detectable antibody-mediated response was measured in foals that received an avirulent live _L. intracellularis_ vaccine. However, the protection offered by this vaccine needs further investigation.
