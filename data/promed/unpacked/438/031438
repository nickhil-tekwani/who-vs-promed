>> Whereas the Ecuador/Northern Peru cluster is coherent, is the Bolivian
distribution only in that country or are similar infections noted in
northern Chile & Argentina? - Mod.MHJ<<
The distribution of the plague in the Bolivian territory is reduced to the
tropical and semi-tropical valleys. The provinces of Franz Tamayo and Sud
Yungas are wet tropical valleys near, or at the [southern Peruvian border,
while Valle Grande is a dry semi-tropical Valley near the middle of the
country. These provinces have weather and geographic conditions very
similar to north and northeastern Peru and southern Ecuador. That's
probably a reason for not noticing similar infections in the northern
Argentina and Chile, where these conditions are radically different.

[This might argue that there may be a second affected area in southern Peru,
adjoining the affected northern Bolivian tropical/semitropical territories.
If I remember correctly this area was severely afflicted by Shining Path
activities. - Mod.MHJ
