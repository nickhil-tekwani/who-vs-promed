The Department of Health [DOH] in Bicol region has declared a malaria
epidemic in Camarines Norte province after recording 182 cases there.

DOH officials said that while most of the cases were in Jose
Panganiban town, the epidemic was declared province-wide to prepare
local health officials against the spread of the disease.

The DOH Bicol is closely monitoring malaria cases in areas near the
border of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, specifically in the towns
of Sipocot and Lupi, to prevent further spread of the disease,
according to an article posted Saturday [24 Jul 2010] on the ReliefWeb
site
<http://reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/MCOI-87MFVS?OpenDocument&rc=3&cc=phl>

Incidentally, the DOH and the World Health Organization (WHO) have
already declared as malaria-free some of the region's provinces --
these are: Albay, Sorsogon, Catanduanes, and Masbate.

Further assessment and validation is being done in Camarines Sur for
it to be declared malaria-free.

DOH Bicol Malaria Prevention and Control Program coordinator Camilo
Aquino said the DOH team dispatched to Jose Panganiban found out that
most victims were children and elderly. At least 20 percent were
members of a tribal community.

Health officials lamented more victims barely recovered or [not]
treated totally as health workers had difficulty in administering
treatment. In many cases, patients would refuse to follow procedures,
like the schedule of taking medicines.

Aquino said malaria is a disease caused by the parasite _Plasmodium_,
transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The parasites multiply in the
liver and infect red blood cells. Symptoms include fever, headache,
and vomiting -- they usually appear 10 to 15 days after infection.
