Tests confirm farm birds in Stavropol Territory infected with H5N1
-----------------------------------------------
Tests conducted by a laboratory of the Animal Protection Institute in
the city of Vladimir have confirmed that birds in the Bogoslovskaya
poultry farm in the Stavropol Territory were infected with the
dangerous H5N1 bird flu virus, the territorial Agriculture Ministry
told Itar-Tass on Saturday [11 Mar 2006]. [Map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/70/Bogoslovskiy.html>].
More than 70 000 chickens out of 120 000 in the Bogoslovskaya farm
have died; the rest have been killed. Farm work has been halted. The
area and its roads have been disinfected.
The farm is the 5th bird flu outbreak site in the Stavropol
Territory. The other 4 were reported in the Izobilnensky, Shpakovsky
and Neftekumsky districts and near Kislovodsk. All the outbreaks in
poultry yards were promptly brought under control and prevented from
spreading.
However, a sharp fall in demand for poultry products has been
reported, and farmers' losses amount to millions of rubles, the
ministry noted.
Daily chicken sales decreased by 10 times at most markets in the
territory. [Does this mean that the initial decrease has 10-fold
increased?! Clarification is needed. - Mod.AS]
In an attempt to rectify the situation, the prices were reduced
substantially, but people bought even less, thinking that low-quality
products were on sale.

[A similar newswire has been provided by Pablo Nart.
Russia's last (5th) update on HPAI was sent to the OIE on 27 Dec 2005
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_38.HTM#Sec4>.
It presented a summarizing table of all 62 outbreaks in 10 regions
that had been recorded until that date. Stavropol, in south Russia
between the Black and the Caspian seas, was not included at that
time; see
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/TABA18_52RUS1.PDF>.
According to news media, Stavropol initially suffered avian influenza
in the last week of February 2006 (see 20060301.0649). An official
update is anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[2] Russia, mass vaccination, poultry

Russia Starts Mass Vaccination Of Poultry To Fight H5N1
-----------------------------------------------
Russian authorities have commenced the mass vaccination of the whole
country's poultry stock, a massive undertaking in the world's largest
country (by geographical size).
[In] southern Russia, where vaccination programs got off the ground
early, tens of millions of poultry have already been vaccinated.
According to sources in Russia, almost one million heads of poultry
have died as a result of bird flu infection and measures to control
its spread.
In Western Europe, the EU has allowed France and Holland to vaccinate
their poultry livestock.
Many experts say that vaccinating birds does not stop the spread of
the H5N1 virus. All it does is protect the bird that received the
shot (jab), but that bird can still be a carrier of the virus and
infect other birds and possibly humans.
The greatest disadvantage with mass vaccination is that you then
don't know how widespread the virus is in your country.
Another problem with vaccination is its price, it is very expensive
(to carry out a national program).
So far, it is still difficult for a human to catch bird flu from a
bird. Hundreds of millions of birds have died of H5N1 infection since
2003, but only about 95 humans have died. If the virus mutates
(evolves), it could pick up the ability to spread from
human-to-human. If it managed to do this and to hold on to its
virulence (potency, ability to kill), we could be facing a serious
global flu pandemic.
Another concern is how easily a sick bird can infect a cat. Until
recently, experts were sure cats could not catch bird flu easily.
However, there are now some doubts, and further research is being
demanded.

Greece says 4 more swans have deadly bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Greece on Saturday [11 Mar 2006] confirmed 4 more cases of the lethal
H5N1 strain of bird flu in swans found dead near its northern
borders, bringing to 30 its total number of wild fowl known to have
been infected. "(They) were confirmed today [11 Mar 2006] by the EU
lab in London," the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement, adding
that protective measures had already been in place. [As indicated in
20060220.0550, DEFRA began, since 20 Feb 2006, to publish a table
entitled "Avian Influenza Update from VLA." The table, updated on a
daily basis, was meant to provide information on the samples received
for diagnosis at the AI reference lab (VLA-CRL) in Weybridge and
their tests results. That excellent service is not available any
longer. - Mod.AS]
There have been no cases of bird flu identified in Greek farm
poultry, but sales have plummeted, and the government has announced
measures, including state-guaranteed loans, to help farmers.
Wildlife experts say Greece had a high number of migratory birds this
winter [2006] forced south by an unusually severe winter in northern
Europe.

Poland finds 2nd nucleus of H5 avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Poland's 2nd nucleus of H5 bird flu has been uncovered in a western
town near the German border, the country's chief veterinary officer
said on Saturday [11 Mar 2006].
"The H5 bird flu virus has been diagnosed in a dead swan found near a
water-pumping station in the town of Kostrzyn on the Odra river,"
Krzysztof Jazdzewski told a news conference.
Emergency procedures have been put into effect, with a restricted
3-km (2 mile) area under special surveillance as well as a 10-km
endangered zone, which overlaps into Germany.
Special patrols have begun counting poultry and policing compliance
with a ban on free-ranging birds in the surrounding countryside, and
disinfectant mats have been laid out on roads leading out of town.
Jazdzewski said the Community Reference Laboratory in Weybridge near
London had confirmed that the swans found a week earlier in the
northern city of Torun had been infected with the deadly H5N1 virus.
The Kostrzyn pumping station lies at the edge of the Mouth of the
Warta National Park, one of Europe's largest wetland nesting areas of
migratory waterfowl. [Map at

[5] Hong Kong, precaution re. cats

Roundup: HK scientists urge checks on sick cats for bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
A cat was sent to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (SPCA) in Hong Kong on Wednesday [8 Mar 2006]. It is the only
cat surrendered to the society since reports surfaced of H5N1 virus
infecting cats in Germany, Austria SPCA spokeswoman Rebecca Ngan said
on Thursday [9 Mar 2006].
According to Ngan, the cat brought home a dead bird from the garden
one day, and the owner was pretty scared about that, so she
surrendered the cat. The cat is in good health now, Ngan said.
On Wednesday [8 Mar 2006], Hong Kong scientists urged checks on dead
and sick cats so as to prevent the transmission of H5N1 virus to
humans.
Several cats in Austria and Germany were found with the dangerous
H5N1 virus later, and Dutch scientists have evidence that cats can
spread the virus to one another in the laboratory. Meanwhile, Thai
scientists have found that dogs and cats there also could be carrying
the virus.
University of Hong Kong chair professor of microbiology Yuen
Kwok-yung warned Wednesday [8 Mar 2006] the cat cases showed that
these mammals are vulnerable. He said cats that strayed in villages
in the New Territories of Hong Kong had a higher chance of contact
with bird carcasses, which increased their risk of bird flu.
"Dead or sick cats, which are wandering around in villages outside
people's homes, should be collected for testing," he said.
The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said
Wednesday [8 Mar 2006] night that up till now, there is no evidence
that cats could transmit H5N1 to humans. "A recent report from the
World Health Organization indicates that the confirmation of H5N1
infection in cats is not considered likely to enhance the present
risk to human health," a spokesman said. But he advised cat owners
not to allow their pets to eat wild birds.
Paul Chan, a professor of microbiology from the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, said people should not ignore the occurrence of the virus
in felines.
"The infection of cats is not a brand new finding, but there is some
data to suggest that birds can be infected without symptoms. So if
these cats are infected without symptoms, and if they can spread the
virus, this can lead to a very different situation," Chan said.
"We are not sure if (the virus) can spread between cats, but we
better assume it can," he added.

[There are several good reasons for prescribing the maintenance of
domestic cats exclusively inside the home: health-wise (human health,
as well as the cats' own health) and environmental (some wildlife
species, mainly small birds, have been shown to be seriously
endangered by stray and free-roaming released owned cats). Avian
influenza is now added to the factors supporting the prevention of
cat straying; banning the release of owned cats deserves serious
consideration.
