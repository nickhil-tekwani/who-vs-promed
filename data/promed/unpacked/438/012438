Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus - China (Guangdong province)
----------------------
Between 30 Dec 2015 and 2 Jan 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus.

Details of the cases
------------
The 1st case is a 26-year-old female from Baoan District, Shenzhen City, with onset date of 24 Dec [2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital on 27 Dec [2015] and is now in critical condition.

The 2nd case is a 40-year-old female from Duanzhou District, Zhaoqing City, with onset date of 22 Dec [2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital on 28 Dec [2015] and is now in critical condition.

Public health response
-----------
The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: making every effort to treat the patient; collecting and testing the specimens of the patient, carrying out viral isolation and whole genome sequencing and comparison; conducting epidemiological investigation; tracing, managing and observing the close contacts of the patient; strengthening surveillance of unexplained pneumonia and routine sentinel surveillance of influenza; strengthening the etiological surveillance of influenza/avian influenza virus.

WHO risk assessment
---------
WHO continues to closely monitor the influenza A(H5N6) situation and conduct risk assessments. So far, the overall risk associated with avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses has not changed.

WHO advice
-------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

[2] Live poultry market - media report

Health authorities in Zhaoqing have 64 people who had close contact with the patient under observation and are monitoring 5 poultry market workers.

The live poultry trade in a market in Zhaoqing was suspended for 1 week, with all poultry slaughtered and the area disinfected, said the official.

Gene analysis of a sample from the Shenzhen patient indicated her infection was from contact with live poultry or a related environment, said an expert with the Shenzhen Municipal Disease Control and Prevention Center.

People should reduce the chance of coming into contact with live poultry to prevent such infection, said the expert.

The world's 1st human H5N6 infection was reported in May 2014 in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
