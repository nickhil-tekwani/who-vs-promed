[In addition to the 2 large clusters of West Nile virus (WNV) infections in animals during the current disease season, which started in early July 2019, 3 other smaller events in animals have been reported: in Brandenburg (4 outbreaks), Berlin (3) and Hamburg (1). The total number of the German West Nile fever outbreaks in animals, since the start of the current disease season and as of 25 Sep 2019, is 37, with 1 in July, 11 in August and 25 in September.

The 1st case of WNV infection in a horse in Germany (Brandenburg) took place 21 Sep 2018 (https://www.fli.de/en/news/short-messages/short-message/first-case-of-west-nile-virus-infection-in-a-horse-in-germany/). Recently, the 1st human infection in Germany has been reported. In this respect, my colleague, Mod.MHJ, remarks: "The delay [12 months] before human cases were found confirms that horses make good sentinels for arboviruses". - Mod.AS
