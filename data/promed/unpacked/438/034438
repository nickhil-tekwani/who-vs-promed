Hong Kong: Genotype of the SARS coronavirus from the Amoy Gardens outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
[The following is the summary of a Research Letter in the current
issue of the Lancet, in which the authors conclude that the different
features of the hospital-based outbreak and the Amoy Gardens outbreak
are the result of extraneous factors rather than differences in virus
genotype. - Mod.CP]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a global health concern.
In Hong Kong, 2 major outbreaks, one hospital-based and the other in
the Amoy Gardens apartments, were identified. The frequency of
diarrhoea, admission to intensive care, and mortality differed
significantly between the 2 outbreaks. We carried out genomic
sequencing for viral isolates from 5 Amoy Gardens patients. The virus
sequence was identical in 4 of these 5 patients. The sequence data
from one hospital case and the 4 identical community cases had only 3
nucleotide differences. Alterations in the SARS coronavirus genome
are unlikely to have caused the distinctive clinical features of the
Amoy Gardens patients, and these results highlight the importance of
non-viral genomic factors in this outbreak.
