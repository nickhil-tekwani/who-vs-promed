A colony that contains nearly half of the black-footed ferrets in the
country and which biologists say is critical to the long-term health
of the species has been struck by plague, which may have killed a
third of the 300 animals.

A much-publicized endangered species in the 1970s that had dwindled
to 18 animals, the black-footed ferret had struggled to make a
comeback and had been doing relatively well for decades. But plague,
always a threat to the ferrets and their main prey, prairie dogs, has
struck with a vengeance this year [2008], partly because of the wet spring.

The ferrets are an easy target for the bacteria. "They are
exquisitely sensitive to the plague," said Travis Livieri, a wildlife
biologist here who is trying to save the colony. "They don't just get
sick, they die. No ifs, ands or buts." Humans can catch plague, but
it is easily treated with antibiotics.

Mr. Livieri is working with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service's
black-footed ferret recovery team, the Forest Service and some
volunteers to try to save the colony at Conata Basin by dusting
prairie dog burrows with flea powder that kills the plague-carrying
insects. Mr. Livieri is also working on a vaccination program,
prowling the prairie all night to capture ferrets for injections.

Plague thrives in wet years, and this has been one of the wettest in
the region in years. A combination of insecticide and vaccines can be
very effective, said Dr. Dean Biggins, a research biologist with the
United States Geological Survey, who has studied plague and ferrets.
He said he had seen a plague outbreak hit a line of dusted burrows
and stop cold. "There's no question they can be protected," he said.
"It's not whether we can do it, but are we willing because of cost
and labor? It might have to be done every year or 2."

For now, the race is on to protect the heart of the ferret
population. Mr. Livieri, often working by himself, drives from his
home in Wellington, CO, 6 hours away, and spends a week or 2 at a
time scouring the prairie all night in hopes of injecting all of the ferrets.

Treating ferrets, though, is only half of the equation. Enough
prairie dogs need to survive the plague to keep the ferrets from
starving to death. One ferret eats 125 to 150 prairie dogs a year.

The landscape is pockmarked with burrows. Some have been marked with
a streak of white dust to kill fleas, and then pinned with a small
orange flag. Ferrets dwell in the prairie dog burrows among their
prey, kill the prairie dogs at night and devour them underground.

On a recent night, glowing eyes were common, but not the right kind.
At around 2 a.m., Mr. Livieri and others see their 1st shining ferret
eyes. Mr. Livieri turns his truck and rumbles quickly to the burrow,
and a tiny masked ferret peers up at him. He places a long slender
trap in the hole and drives away. The ferret, which turns out to be a
young female, crawls into it.

Mr. Livieri returns, and the trap is removed. Briskly, to minimize
handling, plague vaccine is injected into the animal's rump, hair dye
is swabbed on her neck to indicate she has received her 1st
injection, she is sprayed with flea spray and released into her hole.
She turns and looks back up at her captor.

This is the 30th ferret of the estimated 150 that remain here that
need to be captured and treated. Each animal must be caught a 2nd
time for a booster.

"You feel helpless when a disease like this comes in and threatens
everything you worked for," Mr. Livieri said. "That's why I am going
to be out here spotlighting, doing what I can."

The vaccine sounds a little labor intensive but if it saves the
ferrets it will be worth it. It also appears that Mr. Livieri has
worked some 13 years with this colony so the loss of the ferrets
would be a personal loss as well. - Mod.TG]
