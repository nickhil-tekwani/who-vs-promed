I apologize for bothering you with such a minor detail, but I have been
receiving e-mails about yesterdays' posting on an imported case from Senegal.
The text in brackets was added by the moderator. Even the most competent and
thorough health professionals sometimes make minor mistakes, and this seems
to have happened: I wrote hematemesis and the moderator added [coughing up
blood]. Of course this was a small lapse of attention and the proper term
would have been [vomiting blood]. Please make this minor change on your
internet posting asap.
I also make mistakes: please also add -- if possible -- that the lab
diagnosis was performed at the National Reference Center for Viral
Hemorrhagic Fever, a WHO collaborating center. This is important to us at the
national level.
