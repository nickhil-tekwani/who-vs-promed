US researchers reported yesterday [20 Oct 2013] that giving mice a flu vaccine and simultaneously treating them with rapamycin, an immune-suppressing drug, caused them to generate antibodies that were protective against other flu strains, including H5N1 and H7N9. The authors, from St Jude Children's Research Center in Memphis and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, reported their findings in Nature Immunology [Nature Immunology (2013) Published online 20 Oct 2013, http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ni.2741.html].

The researchers infected groups of mice with an H3N2 flu strain by way of vaccination and treated them with rapamycin or a placebo for 28 days, starting the day before vaccination. When the mice were later exposed to an H5N1 virus, the rapamycin group had a much higher survival rate than the placebo group. In addition, rapamycin-treated mice had significantly higher survival when later exposed to H7N9 and H1N1 viruses, according to the report.

Further, when the team transferred serum from vaccinated to unvaccinated mice, the unvaccinated mice were also protected from later H5N1 infection, which indicated that protection came from antibodies rather than from other immune system components, according to a St Jude press release ["Research offers new insight in quest for single vaccine against multiple influenza strains;" St Jude Children's Research Hospital http://www.stjude.org/mcgargill-influenzachildrens.].

"Rapamycin inhibits the kinase mTOR, which is involved in cell survival and proliferation. TOR disrupted generation of the antibodies that target specific regions of the HA [hemagglutinin] proteins that are unique to each flu strain," leading to a more diverse set of antibodies, the team says.

Previous research has indicated that memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells play a role in broadening the immune response against flu viruses, but the team found that CD8+ T cells were not required for enhanced protection in rapamycin-treated mice, the release states. "The findings highlight a novel way to generate antibodies that recognize and target proteins shared by most influenza A strains rather than those unique to each strain," it says.

Title: The kinase mTOR modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus. By Rachael Keating and 14 others.

Abstract: "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses pose a continuing global threat. Current vaccines will not protect against newly evolved pandemic viruses. The creation of "universal" vaccines has been unsuccessful because the immunological mechanisms that promote heterosubtypic immunity are incompletely defined. We found here that rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the kinase mTOR, promoted cross-strain protection against lethal infection with influenza virus of various subtypes when administered during immunization with influenza virus subtype H3N2. Rapamycin reduced the formation of germinal centers and inhibited class switching in B cells, which yielded a unique repertoire of antibodies that mediated heterosubtypic protection. Our data established a requirement for the mTORC1 complex in B cell class switching and demonstrated that rapamycin skewed the antibody response away from high-affinity variant epitopes and targeted more conserved elements of hemagglutinin. Our findings have implications for the design of a vaccine against influenza virus.

[The study led by St Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists highlights a new approach for developing a universal influenza vaccine that could protect against multiple flu strains, including pandemic strains. An immune suppressing drug, rapamycin, was used in mice to shift the immune response following flu vaccination to favor production of antibodies that broadly target flu viruses. The result was a more diverse antibody response to the vaccination that expanded protection to include pandemic strains not targeted by the initial vaccine virus. This research highlights a novel way to generate antibodies that recognize and target proteins shared by most influenza A strains rather than those unique to each strain.

Current influenza vaccines emphasize production of highly specific antibodies. They target and bind tightly to strain-specific regions of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins on the virus. That approach requires developing and administering a new flu vaccine each year to keep up with changes in those unique and highly variable HA and NA proteins. This new experimental approach protected mice vaccinated against the H3N2 influenza A flu strain, which causes mild disease, from the more dangerous H5N1 and H7N9 strains. Furthermore, when antibody-rich serum was transferred from vaccinated to unvaccinated mice, the unvaccinated animals were also protected from later H5N1 infection, an indication that the protection came from antibodies rather than from other immune system components.

In these experiments, the loss of the mTOR kinase delayed the formation of the immune structure identified as a germinal centre where antibodies are reshaped through a process called class switching. The process hones their focus and primes them to target flu viruses based on the unique, rather than shared, surface proteins. This finding was surprising because previous research had highlighted a likely role for white blood cells known as CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cells for broadening the immune response against different flu strains. Unlike antibodies, T cells recognize flu viruses based on shared internal proteins. These experiments have direct relevance to the design of cross-reactive human vaccine. - Mod.CP]
