New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (RHD-2011-MB-001) Winnipeg, Manitoba
Date of start of the outbreak 29 Mar 2011
Outbreak status Resolved (30 Mar 2011)
Epidemiological unit Not applicable
Affected animals
Species Rabbits
Susceptible 3
Cases 1
Deaths 1
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population: The infected animal is a pet rabbit that was
kept in an apartment in the city of Winnipeg with 2 other pet rabbits.
The infected animal was purchased in a pet store in the spring of
2010. The 3 rabbits have no access to outdoors and no contact with
other domestic or wild rabbits. This is a non-commercial pet related
event.

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: In late March 2011 a neutered male domestic
pet rabbit, over one year in age, displayed lethargy for a short
period of time. Yellow matter was observed on its fur. On 30 Mar 2011
it was presented to a local veterinary clinic where it was diagnosed
with liver failure and died during treatment. The body was forwarded
to the Manitoba Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives
(MAFRI) laboratory. Findings included jaundice, hepatic necrosis, some
haemorrhages, moderate meningoencephalitis, and mild nephritis. Fixed
and fresh liver was sent to the CFIA National Center for Foreign
Animal Diseases (NCFAD) to rule out rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD)
virus. The body was cremated.

On 14 and 15 Apr 2011 the NCFAD reported positive results for RHD
virus by conventional RT-PCR and the finding of a Calicivirus-like
agent by electron microscopy. The nucleotide sequence had the closest
match in Genbank with an RHD virus isolate from China from 2006. On 20
and 21 Apr 2011, histopathology confirmed lesions consistent with RHD
and positive staining for RHD virus antigens was shown by
immunohistochemistry.

Rabbits were inoculated with material from the MAFRI submission on 26
Apr 2011. All inoculated rabbits were strongly positive for RHD virus
by conventional RT-PCR. Histopathology on tissue from the inoculated
rabbits showed lesions consistent with RHD. Immunohistochemistry on
liver, spleen and kidney from inoculated rabbits showed positive
immunoreactivity for RHD virus and electron microscopy of a liver
homogenate was positive for Calicivirus-like particles. Sequencing of
the PCR amplicons from liver material from the 3 inoculated rabbits
was 100% identical with one another as well as the original amplicon
from the submitted rabbit.

The infected rabbit was kept in an apartment with 2 other pet rabbits
for more than one year before he got sick. They had no contact with
commercial or wild rabbits.

After confirmation of the diagnosis on the index case, the 2 other
pet rabbits were inspected and tested by the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA) with negative results (RT-PCR on blood and cELISA for
antibodies -- results released on 6 May 2011. As of today, these 2
rabbits remain clinically healthy.

The apartment owners had cleaned and disinfected the cage and the
contact areas of the infected rabbit. CFIA considers this event in a
non-commercial rabbit as resolved.

Control measures: Measures applied - Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of
affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

Canada's National Center for Foreign Animal Diseases (NCFAD) has
reported positive results for rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) virus
by conventional RT-PCR and the finding of a Calicivirus-like agent by
electron microscopy.

On 30 Mar 2011 a domestic neutered male rabbit presented at a local
veterinary clinic with lethargy and a yellow matter was observed on
its fur. It was diagnosed with liver failure and died during
treatment. The body was forwarded to the Manitoba Ministry of
Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives (MAFRI) laboratory.

Findings included jaundice, hepatic necrosis, some hemorrhages,
moderate meningoencephalitis and mild nephritis. A liver sample was
sent to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and NCFAD to rule
out RHD virus.

The positive sample's nucleotide sequence had the closest match in
Genbank with an RHD virus isolate from China from 2006. On 20 and 21
Apr 2011, histopathology confirmed lesions consistent with RHD and
positive staining for RHD virus antigens was shown by
immunohistochemistry.

A total of 3 test rabbits were inoculated with material from the
MAFRI submission on 26 Apr 2011. All inoculated rabbits were strongly
positive for RHD virus by conventional RT-PCR. Histopathology on
tissue from the inoculated rabbits showed lesions consistent with
RHD.

Immunohistochemistry on liver, spleen and kidney from inoculated
rabbits showed positive immunoreactivity for RHD virus and electron
microscopy of a liver homogenate was positive for Calicivirus-like
particles. Sequencing of the PCR amplicons from liver material from
the 3 inoculated rabbits was 100 percent identical with one another as
well as the original amplicon from the submitted pet rabbit.

The infected pet was kept in an apartment with 2 other pet rabbits
for more than a year before becoming ill. None of the pet rabbits had
contact with commercial or wild rabbits.

After confirmation of the diagnosis on the index case, the 2 other
pet rabbits were inspected and tested by the CFIA with negative
results (RT-PCR on blood and cELISA for antibodies) which were
released on 6 May 2011. Presently, these 2 pet rabbits remain
clinically healthy. The apartment owners cleaned and disinfected the
cage and the contact areas of the infected rabbit.

CFIA considers this event in a non-commercial rabbit as resolved.

[Many thanks to Pamela Alley for providing us with up to date
information on the current outbreak.

The most interesting question this case poses is the question of
source. The testing appears to conclusively indicate rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus as the cause of death but where did it come
from? It appears that these are pet rabbits kept in an apartment and
only one got infected while the others remained healthy. Although this
virus can be spread by multiple means such as fomites, food or frozen
carcasses, it is hard to imagine a means of spread such that only one
rabbit came in contact with the virus and the others remained healthy.
Good shoe leather epidemiology might be able to uncover the source of
the outbreak and teach us a good lesson about how diseases can emerge
in unexpected places and sector of our animal populations.

Below is some information from the Minnesota, 2010, outbreak
summarizing the clinical disease and its previous occurrence in North
America.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is also known as rabbit calicivirus. The
disease is a high mortality one and spreads very easily and rapidly.
It can be transmitted by contact with infected rabbits, rabbit
products and fomites such as cages, bedding, food and water. It can
also remain viable for months in frozen rabbit meat and decomposing
carcasses.

The disease is endemic in wild rabbits in Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and Cuba with 40 countries having experienced outbreaks. It
1st was recognized in China in 1984. It caused problems in the Western
Hemisphere in Mexico in 1988 in association with a shipment of
imported frozen rabbits from China found traced to a supermarket in
Mexico City. This certainly helps make the case for how a global food
supply promotes the emergence of diseases. Mexico has worked hard to
successfully eradicate the disease. Another, more insidious method for
spreading the disease to previous uninfected places was the
intentional illegal introduction of the virus in wild rabbit in New
Zealand by farmers hoping to dampen their numbers and control the
pests.

The 1st outbreak in the North America was in Iowa in April 2000.
Subsequent U.S. outbreaks have occurred in Utah, Illinois, New York
and Indiana. - Mod.PC]
