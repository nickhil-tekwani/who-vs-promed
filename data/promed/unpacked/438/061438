West Virginia's state veterinarian says the riskiest time of year for horses contracting West Nile virus [WNV] is fast approaching. Jewell Plumley says vaccination is advisable, and horses should receive a booster at the end of August or early September since most of West Virginia's cases are in the early fall. Once a horse is infected, there's no cure.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control, more than 500 people have contracted the disease this year [2012], none in West Virginia. However, 116 water pools containing mosquitoes have turned up positive for West Nile.

The disease is spread by mosquitoes, so controlling them is the key to controlling West Nile.

West Virginia health officials are investigating the state's 1st probable case of West Nile virus this year [2012].

Officials with the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department say tests have shown a man in his 40s has tested positive in initial screenings for the disease. He is currently being treated at an area hospital for encephalitis. West Nile is a mosquito-borne disease that causes encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.

The Charleston Daily Mail reports (http://dailymail.com/News/Kanawha/201208210085) that confirmation of the disease may take weeks but health officials wanted to let the public know about it.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 43 states have reported West Nile virus infections in people, birds, or mosquitoes so far this year [2012]. And 26 people have died from the disease.

{Because WNV has become endemic in the continental USA and southern Canada, one can expect scattered human cases every year. However, this year (2012) has seen an unusual number of human cases, both as clusters and as individual cases as the one above. - Mod.TY]
