Officials with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health report seeing an increase in listeriosis cases in December [2018], prompting a warning for high-risk groups.

According to an official notice Friday [21 Dec 2018] (computer translated), 6 cases were reported this month [December 2018] when the country typically sees 1-2 cases a month.

Four of the 6 patients reported in December [2018] are from Hedmark and Oppland. Health officials are working to identify if there is a common food source linked to the increase in cases.

Listeriosis is usually transmitted through food, especially long-life foods that are refrigerated and eaten without further heat treatment. Many of these food products are popular as Christmas foods and can be found at many Christmas parties.

People in the risk groups for listeriosis (i.e., pregnant women, persons with impaired immune systems, and the elderly with impaired general condition) should, as usual, avoid food products that may pose a risk to _Listeria_ infection, says consultant Hans Blystad at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

Examples of such food products are
- Rakfisk;
- Products made from unpasteurized milk; and
- Soft and semi-soft cheeses, such as brie, camembert, and other molds, whether or not they are made from pasteurized milk.

Consumption of food contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.

In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within 2 months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the healthcare provider about eating the contaminated food.

[Hedmark is a county in southeastern Norway, bordering Sweden to the east and Oppland to the west. Hedmark is one of the less urbanized areas in Norway; about half of the inhabitants live on rural land (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedmark). Hedmark and Oppland are the only Norwegian counties with no coastline. A map of Norwegian counties can be found at https://bluerose.karenlmyers.org/wp/scandinavia/norway/.

Because _Listeria monocytogenes_, a Gram-positive bacterium that causes listeriosis, can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, _Listeria_-contaminated refrigerated, ready-to-eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold-cut meats (e.g., ham), are recognized as potential sources for listeriosis. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other frequent sources of listeriosis. However, the source in some outbreaks has been contamination with _Listeria_ only after pasteurization.

Serotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95% of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf). Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 6 ill people, if they match, will establish that we are dealing with a common-source outbreak, and genotyping isolates from potential sources will establish transmission pathways, if they match the clinical isolates. - Mod.ML
