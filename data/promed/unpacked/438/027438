Several confirmed cases of whooping cough have been reported in Harnett County. Rebecca Campbell, the school nurse at Western Harnett High School, alerted parents to the outbreak. According to an announcement sent out Monday [9 Dec 2019] night, there are several confirmed cases of the highly contagious infection.

Students who have been directly exposed in class or on the school bus were sent home with a letter explaining what steps to take if they develop symptoms, which include a deep cough that could last for weeks or months. The illness is most dangerous for small children or those with weakened immune symptoms.

Concerned Harnett County residents should contact their physicians or the county health department at (910) 893-7550.

Local cases of pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough, have popped up in Oak Park in higher numbers this year [2019] than any year in the previous decade. According to Michael Charley, public health director of the Oak Park Health Department, as of 16 Dec [2019], there are 10 confirmed cases in Oak Park, which has averaged 3.1 cases per year between 2008 and 2018.

Within public schools, according to Charley, District 200 has 5 confirmed cases (4 students and one teacher), and District 97 has 2 confirmed cases, both students. In River Forest, District 90 has 3 confirmed cases of pertussis as of 16 Dec [2019]: 2 at Roosevelt Middle School and one at Willard School. It could not be confirmed at time of publication whether the confirmed cases in D200, D97, or D90 were in vaccinated or unvaccinated children.

In 10 Dec and 16 Dec [2019] memos to D90 parents, the steps the district was taking to help prevent further infections were outlined, and information from the Cook County Department of Public Health was forwarded.

"Please be assured that all of the district's nurses are aware of this situation and are monitoring the situation," read the memo. "Our nurses are following the recommended protocols of the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."

The custodial staff at all D90 locations have been intensifying disinfection of classrooms, bathrooms, desks, door handles, and other common areas throughout the school.

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, pertussis diagnoses have been on the rise since the early 1980s. The CDC has identified several explanations for this, including "increased awareness, improved diagnostic tests, better reporting, more circulation of the bacteria, and waning immunity."

Additionally, according to the CDC, there is evidence that the bacteria that causes pertussis is "changing at a genetic level," though studies suggest that the current vaccines are still effective even as the bacteria transforms.

However, the currently used pertussis vaccines may be less effective than those used prior to the 1990s, which could account, in part, for pertussis cases being on the rise since the 1980s. The vaccines currently given, DTaP and Tdap, are acellular vaccines, which contain only some organic material from _Bordetella pertussis_, the bacteria that causes the disease. These vaccines may not provide protection as effective as DTP, a whole-cell vaccine, which contains the entire inactivated _B. pertussis_ organism.

In the 1990s, according to the CDC, doctors in the United States switched from DTP, the whole-cell vaccine, to DTaP and Tdap, the acellular vaccines, because they had less major and minor side effects. But this change may have left Americans slightly less protected against the disease. According to the CDC website, "Acellular pertussis vaccines may not prevent colonization (carrying the bacteria in your body without getting sick) or spread of the bacteria." Additionally, waning immunity to the vaccine can leave even vaccinated people less protected than they might believe.

According to the 10 Dec [2019] Cook County Department of Public Health's memo regarding the Roosevelt Middle School student with pertussis, required vaccinations for the illness should be given at ages 2, 4, 6, and 15 months. A booster should be given between the ages of 4 and 6. However, according to the memo, "immunity begins to wane 3-5 years after the last shot. Protection can be completely gone by the time a child enters middle school."

The CDC confirms this, estimating that "in the 1st year after getting vaccinated with Tdap, it protects about 7 out of 10 people who receive it. There is a decrease in effectiveness in each following year. About 3 or 4 out of 10 people are fully protected 4 years after getting Tdap." For this reason, states the Cook County Department of Health, a Tdap booster is recommended for preteens at age 11 or 12. The department states that being up-to-date with Tdap is especially important for teens who will be around babies.

Recommendations from the CDC also include Tdap for children 7-10 years old who are not fully vaccinated with DTaP, adults 65 years and older who are in close contact with young infants, and healthcare workers. It is recommended that pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation.

Health officials have confirmed that 10 students in a Maine high school have whooping cough. There were initially 3 reported cases of pertussis at Freeport High School, then 5, and now 10, the Portland Press Herald reported. Superintendent of Schools Becky Foley notified Regional School Unit 5 of the situation Thursday [19 Dec 2019] in an email.

There are no cases at any other school in the region, and the holiday break will serve as an opportunity to prevent further spread of the illness, according to Foley's email.

Foley also urged parents to ensure that their families' vaccinations are up-to-date before school resumes session 2 Jan [2020].

There are 8 confirmed cases of whooping cough in the N.W.T.'s Tlicho region, warns the health department in a news release Friday [13 Dec 2019]. The department says that as of Friday [13 Dec 2019], the 8 lab-confirmed cases are "being controlled," and there haven't been hospitalizations. It also says the cases are "localized" but did not list the affected community or communities. "All confirmed cases have been isolated and treated," states the news release.

Whooping cough is preventable with a vaccine, according to the department. Residents can get the free vaccine from their healthcare provider.

In 2015, there were 21 confirmed cases of whooping cough in N.W.T., in the Tlicho region, Hay River, Yellowknife, and the Beaufort Delta. At the time, the office of the chief public health officer said the majority of these cases were linked to travel outside the N.W.T.
