Four residents of the Southern Siberian Buryat autonomous republic have
died of botulism, a spokesman for the republican emergency committee said
on Tuesday.
The latest outbreak of this dangerous disease affected 48 persons in the
republic, the spokesman told Itar-Tass. 24 of them, including five
children, were taken to hospitals, one in very grave condition. According
to doctors, the diseased got the infection [sic] with fish from Lake Baikal.
Botulism is an acute poisoning which results from ingestion of food
containing toxins produced by the bacillus _Clostridium botulinum_. It
affects human nervous system.
It is the second considerable outbreak of botulism in Ulan-Ude in less than
half a month, the spokesman said. The previous one took place in late
August, when two men died after eating badly cooked fish. Epidemiologists
have registered 72 cases of botulism in Buryatia this year, eight of which
were lethal.
In early August, the republican government demanded that city authorities
took measures against street fish dealers, who sell foodstuffs without
proper license. The measures were, however, very difficult to implement, as
dealers manage to flee police controls and sell fish at entrances to
residential houses.

[Botulism results from intoxication, not an infection. The toxin is
inactivated by heating to 100 degrees C for 10 minutes. Handling uncooked
food can result in absorption of toxin through broken skin. Proper
refrigeration of the fish prior to consumption may be the best solution to
this problem. - Mod.ES]
