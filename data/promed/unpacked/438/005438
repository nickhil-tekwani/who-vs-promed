[Ukraine has banned the] import of Belarusian pork because of fear of African swine fever [ASF] virus [ASFV].

This is a temporary measure, introduced since 7 May 2013, Ukraine's Deputy Chief Inspector for Veterinary Medicine has signed a corresponding decision.

Our southern neighbour [Ukraine] reacted to the media publications about animal mass deaths in Baranovichi district [Brest Province, Belarus] and the suspicion there might be ASFV. The Ukrainians hope to "find out all the circumstances" from their Belarusian colleagues in the nearest future.

However, the Interfax-West informs that the Department of Veterinary and Food Control of the Belarusian Ministry of Agriculture has refuted the information published in a series of media reports about the dissemination of dangerous infectious diseases in one of the pig complexes near Baranovichi. The officials say that the results of the laboratory studies confirm this.

[Earlier media reports included conflicting pieces of information, including a report on diagnosed PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome/blue ear disease) on farms in the affected district. The event will be regarded as suspected, additional information requested.

In February 2012 ASF was suspected in a Belarusian village in the Novogrudok Neznanova area, when mass destruction of pigs was performed. However, no official confirmation was obtained (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120305.1061612). - Mod.AS
