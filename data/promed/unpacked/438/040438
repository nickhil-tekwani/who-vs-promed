On Tuesday, researchers announced the discovery of HIV in a blood sample
taken from a man in the Belgian Congo in 1959, making it the oldest
confirmed case of human infection by the virus. David D. Ho and Tuofu Zhu
of the Aaron Diamond Research Center in New York and Andre J. Nahmias of
Emory University reported the results at the Fifth Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections as well as in this week's issue
of the journal Nature. Molecular analysis of the sample, taken in a study
on malaria resistance by Arno Motulsky at the University of Washington,
shows that the infected man probably contracted the disease approximately a
decade after the virus moved from non-human primates to human hosts. Ho and
Zhu note that comparisons between the newly discovered sample and current
human immunodeficiency viruses show a "common ancestor" virus from the late
1940s or early 1950s, placing the origin of the virus at an earlier date
than many scientists had believed. Nahmias began testing for HIV in 1,213
of Motulsky's samples shortly after antibody tests became available in
1985. After he narrowed down the samples to one--which tested positive for
HIV through every available test at the time--Ho and Zhu assessed a portion
of the sample using polymerase chain reaction to amplify DNA from the serum
sample and test conclusively for the presence of HIV. Zhu and Ho, along
with collaborators at Los Alamos National Laboratory, used mutation rates
to date the "common ancestor" virus. Although Ho said "this [finding] is
clearly not going to impact on how we take care of our patients today," he
noted the data may give researchers a better idea of HIV and other
"emerging infections" function over time.

[We do not normally post items on HIV/AIDS, but in view of the importance
of the issue, we thought you would be interested. This finding shows that
a new disease may circulate for decades in an unhealthy population without
ever being noticed against the background "noise" of other infections such
as malaria - Mod.JW]
