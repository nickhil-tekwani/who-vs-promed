[Transmission has been interrupted in Wuhan as more than 2 incubation periods have passed since the last locally transmitted case was identified. It has now been 38 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though low level local transmission was established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 24 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing and no newly confirmed cases have been reported in the past 72 hours. The appearance of an occasional locally transmitted case in Inner Mongolia is also of concern for possible low level local transmission having been established there as well. While Inner Mongolia has a large border with Mongolia, there is also a smaller border shared with the Russian Federation where there is extensive transmission ongoing.

According to the report above, a total of 82 880 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 3 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (2 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are imported -- 2 in Shanghai and 1 in Shandong. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 48 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 16751 imported cases identified.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 13 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 2 were imported cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 962, and 98 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 210 717 cases, including 28 884 deaths, up from 209 328 cases and 28 710 deaths reported on 2 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 2 and 3 May 2020 was 1389 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1900 newly confirmed cases between 1 and 2 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 74.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 37.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont are the only other provinces reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 2 provinces reported 0 newly confirmed cases, 5 additional provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 8 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until today, 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes will be on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 97 424 total cases, 6203 deaths
Date: Sun 3 May 2020 10:32 AM GST
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iran/mosques-and-schools-to-reopen-in-irans-low-risk-areas-idUSKBN22F090


Iran plans to reopen mosques and schools in areas that have been consistently free of the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] as president Hassan Rouhani's government starts to ease restrictions that were aimed at containing the outbreak. With mosques closed and religious gatherings banned since mid-March [2020] as the outbreak spread in the Middle East's worst-hit country, ordinary Iranians have turned to drive-ins for ceremonies during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

State TV and videos on social media showed people in their cars watching a religious ceremony on a big screen in a Tehran car park. "Mosques will reopen in 132 low-risk or 'white cities' and towns from Monday [4 May 2020]. Friday prayer sermons will resume in those areas as well ... However, all these steps will be taken by respecting the health protocols," Rouhani said in a televised meeting.

Iran's health ministry has divided the country into white, yellow, and red areas based on the number of infections and deaths.

The ministry said on Saturday [2 May 2020] that the trajectory of infections has started a "gradual" downward trend in Iran. On Sunday [3 May 2020] the health ministry said the country's coronavirus death toll had risen to 6203 and the total number of diagnosed cases had reached 97 424.

Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities despite warnings by some health officials of a new wave of infections. School and university closures were maintained and cultural and sports gatherings are also still banned, though Rouhani said the plan is for some schools to reopen soon. "The schools in the white and low-risk areas will reopen from [16 May 2020] ... However, we will continue to review the situation," he said.

[In the 24 hours from 2 to 3 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 96 448 to 97 424, an increase of 976 compared with 802 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (2 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6156 to 6203, an increase of 47 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 3 May 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 188 122, including 68 598 deaths, an increase from 1 160 774 cases and 67 444 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 323 883 (27.3%) cumulative case reports and 4670 (17.1%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 168 845 as of 1:30 PM on 3 May 2020, including 13 319 confirmed deaths and an additional 5387 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3721 -- 13.6%), Illinois (2994 -- 11.0% of total), Massachusetts (1824 -- 6.7%), California (1253 -- 4.6%), Pennsylvania (1133 -- 4.1%), and Maryland (989 -- 3.6%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, New Jersey, Turkey, and Brazil as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Pennsylvania, 18 Belgium, 19 Peru, and 20 Michigan. 7 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between the UK and France (it would be number 5).

The US military has confirmed 7145 cumulative cases, with 0 newly confirmed cases since 1 May 2020 (most likely weekend artefact). The Veteran Affairs reported 9329 cumulative cases and 90 new cases today (3 May 2020). There have been 2276 cases reported from federal prisons (8 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2373 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (66 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1808 cases (51 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496) Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available on the daily update website. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 838 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24 hour period from 1 to 2 May 2020, bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 217 466 [247 122] as compared with 216 582 PCR [245 567] confirmed cases on 1 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 57.94, a continual slow decrease over the past 25 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 57.94 today (2 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 217 466 [247 122] cases, approximately 118 495 (54.5%) [48.0%] -- an additional 546 cases have been hospitalized and 10 974 (5.0%) [4.4%] an additional 65 cases were admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). 9.3% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to the ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7295982,43. Catalonia, Castile and Leon, and La Rioja are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. Castile and Leon and neighboring La Rioja are located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. - Mod.MPP]

[The data provided above are from the Nigeria CDC. The 1st reported case was in an Italian returning to Lagos where he worked and was reported on 28 Feb 2020 (see COVID-19 update (20): China, global, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, imported cases, WHO 20200228.7032761). In the past 2 months there have been a total of 2558 cases including 87 deaths reported from 25 states including the FCT. Only 2 states (Cross River and Kogi) have not confirmed cases. Looking at the epi curve (https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/state/), it appears as though transmission was relatively low level until mid-April 2020, and accelerated on 29 Apr 2020. It is disconcerting that 55% of confirmed cases do not have an identifiable epidemiologic link to other known cases supporting a conclusion there is significant community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. An excellent map showing the distribution of cases by state is available in the 2 May 2020 situation report for week 18 mentioned above. - Mod.MPP
