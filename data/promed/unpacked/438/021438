1st detection of Schmallenberg virus antibodies in Romania
----------------------------------------------------------
For the last 2 years, Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been disseminating in the European ruminant population. At the beginning of 2013, SBV infection was confirmed in Hungary and Slovenia, and in June 2013 antibodies to SBV were detected in the Republic of Serbia.

As no data on the epidemiological situation of SBV in Romania had been so far available, blood samples from cattle and sheep were collected between 18 and 25 Jun 2013 in the north-western part of the country; 184 cattle and 92 sheep samples were serologically tested on 31 Jul 2013 using ID Screen Schmallenberg virus indirect (IDvet Innovative Diagnostics). The tests ware performed in the Laboratory of Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Warsaw, Poland.

A total of 169 cattle samples [out of 184] and 25 sheep samples [out of 92] (92 and 27 percent, respectively) were seropositive.

This is the 1st report of SBV infection from Romania.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr Kaba and his co-authors from Poland and Romania for the firsthand information above.

The same laboratory of the Warsaw University kindly provided, earlier, information on the 1st detection of SBV antibodies in sera of Polish and Serbian cattle. This is a commendable contribution to improved transparency in relation to SBV.

The apparently wide distribution of SBV in European livestock has become a cause for concern for exporters and particularly their clientele in SBV-free importing countries. The novel, teratogenic [causing developmental malfunctions], vector-borne orthobunyavirus SBV, affecting large and small ruminants in Europe, was initially discussed during the 80th General Session of the OIE, May 2012. The issue has been discussed again during the 81st General Session, 26-31 May 2013, in Paris, with recorded SBV-related interventions by the delegates of Russia, Ireland (speaking on behalf of the 27 EU Member States), Israel, Belarus, Somalia and Haiti. The debate included the following summarising statements:

"Dr Thiermann (President of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code Commission) accepted the proposal of the Delegate of Russia for review of the Schmallenberg virus according to the OIE criteria for disease listing.

Dr Vallat, the Director General, supported Dr Thiermann's comments. With respect to the Schmallenberg virus, Dr Vallat noted that the main point of discussion related to the impact of the virus. He informed Member Countries that the questions relating to Schmallenberg virus would be discussed as from September [2013] with a comprehensive review by experts from Europe and other regions."

The epidemiology of SBV was reviewed during the 81st Session by Dr Ben Jebara, head of OIE's information department, as recorded under article 312 of the Proceedings, titled "Emerging disease: Schmallenberg virus". He informed that 9 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and United Kingdom) reported the presence of SBV by sending an immediate notification through OIE's World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), citing "emerging disease" as the reason for their notifications. Following discussions on the subject at the 80th OIE General Session, it was stated that SBV, which had originally been considered as an emerging disease in Western Europe, no longer fulfilled the criteria for notification in the countries having already notified a great number of outbreaks. Consequently, Member Countries stopped notifying SBV through WAHIS. However, to support the OIE's expressed views on the need for clarification regarding the concept of emerging diseases and their notification requirements, 11 additional countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden) informed the OIE, by letter (instead of through WAHIS, as they should have done), of their 1st detection of SBV.

To the said total of 20 SBV-affected European countries, Serbia and now also Romania should be added.

Since SBV is not notifiable, information on its current clinical impact (abortions, AH) remains unclear. - Mod.AS
