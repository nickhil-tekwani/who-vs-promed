According to this story, scrapie has been a scourge for sheep
and goats around the world for at least 250 years, and scrapie has been
diagnosed in the USA in more than 900 flocks since the first sheep was found
with the disease in Michigan in 1947. Eight goats have been diagnosed with it.
The U.S. Agriculture Department is moving on two new fronts in an effort
eventually to eliminate scrapie from U.S. sheep flocks. There are more than
7 million sheep and lambs in this country.
This week, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced development of a new
inexpensive test for scrapie. And the department is preparing to impose new
regulations on movement of flocks to prevent the disease from spreading
across states. The test consists of snipping a sample of a sheep's third
eyelid, which harbors proteins called prions that many researchers believe
cause both scrapie in sheep and mad cow disease in cattle. Similar diseases
affect deer, elk, mink, cats, even humans.
The test is a breakthrough in part because it costs only about $25,
compared to $500 for biopsies on internal sheep organs. Without early
detection, regulations aimed at controlling scrapie often fail because the
sheep can transmit the disease within flocks long before signs appear.
Paul Rodgers, American Sheep Industry Association animal health director,
was quoted as saying, "In the past, there was really no good way to tell
for certain if a flock, county or region did or didn't have scrapie in its
sheep population."
The story adds that as the test becomes more widely available, the
Agriculture Department is contemplating an update to rules controlling the
movement of sheep and goats infected with scrapie. Current regulations do
not restrict movement of animals within a state.
Possible new regulations could include further restrictions on states that
don't impose such quarantines and on flocks considered to be at high risk.
In addition, officials are examining whether to impose a better
identification system to keep track of sheep and goats and enable
infections to be traced to the source.
Joan Arnoldi, deputy administrator for veterinary services at the USDA's
Animal Health and Plant Inspection Service, was quoted as saying, "These
changes would help protect all American livestock."
Right now, the Agriculture Department is in the fact-gathering stage, with
proposed rules the next step and a final resolution unlikely for at least a
year.
The American Sheep Industry Association is welcoming the regulations, even
if they might restrict movement of flocks. The promise of eliminating
scrapie, producers say, is worth the trouble.
