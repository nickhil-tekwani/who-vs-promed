Influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity (non-poultry including wild birds) (2017-), Ireland
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 4 Jul 2022
Confirmed: 7 Jul 2022
Reported: 15 Jul 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 25 Mar 2022
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location 1: Skellig Michael, Kerry
Started: 4 Jul 2022
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Common raven (_Corvus corax_): Corvidae-Passeriformes / - / 2 / - / - / - / -
Affected population: on [4 Jul 2022], a common raven that died in a costal location was submitted to Cork Regional Veterinary Laboratory.

Outbreak location 2: Greencastle, Donegal
Started: 12 Jul 2022
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Black guillemot (_Cepphus grille_): Alcidae-Charadriiformes / - / 1 / - / - / - / -
Affected population: on [12 Jul 2022], a guillemot that died in a costal location was submitted to Sligo Regional Veterinary Laboratory.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on [4 Jul 2022], a common raven that died in a costal location was submitted to Cork Regional Veterinary Laboratory. On [7 Jul 2022], the Irish Central Veterinary Research Laboratory confirmed the presence of avian influenza subtype H5N1 in samples taken from the bird. Pathogenicity could not be determined due to sample degradation. On [12 Jul 2022], a Guillemot that died in a costal location was submitted to Sligo Regional Veterinary Laboratory. On [15 Jul 2022], the Irish Central Veterinary Research Laboratory confirmed the presence of avian influenza subtype H5N1 in samples taken from the bird. Pathogenicity results are pending.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (national laboratory) / Common Raven/black guillemot / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 -15 Jul 2022 / Positive
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (national laboratory) / Common Raven/Black Guillemot / Gene sequencing) / 4- 8 Jul 2022 / Positive

["Highly pathogenic avian influenza situation in Ireland:
- On 8 Jul 2022, a case of avian influenza subtype H5N1 was confirmed in a wild bird (raven) which was found to have been suffering from neurological signs off the coast of Kerry
- This is the first case of avian influenza confirmed in a wild bird in Ireland since 1 Apr 2022
- Poultry owners should continue to maintain best practice biosecurity measures to prevent further outbreaks in poultry and captive birds as there remains an ongoing risk from HPAI virus potentially circulating in wild birds and in the environment.

"Current wild bird situation in the rest of Europe:
- HPAI H5N1 is currently circulating in wild birds, especially breeding seabirds around the UK's coast.
- Large die-offs of several species of colonial breeding birds associated with avian influenza have been reported recently in the Netherlands, Scotland, Iceland, Norway, France, and Greece (EFSA, 2022 https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/avian-influenza-overview-march-june-2022).
- Over 95% of cases in wild birds have been confirmed to be of subtype H5N1, with small numbers of H5N3 and H5N8 also confirmed."

Laridae (gulls, terns, and kittiwakes) play a distinct role than Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans) in AIV epidemiology. A review article (https://doi.org/10.3109/1040841X.2013.870967) on the role of Laridae in AIV dynamics concluded the following: "For physiological and ecological reasons, airborne transmission may occur more frequently in Laridae than in Anatidae, which could favor the evolution of taxon-specific strains in the two families. As Laridae generally live longer than Anatidae, they may have evolved stronger immune responses that could lead to different temporal infection patterns across the two groups. The numerous Laridae species that migrate long distances may play a major role in intercontinental AIV gene flow, given that a high proportion of North American-Eurasian reassortant AIV strains have been detected in this group. Finally, opportunistic Laridae species, which have recently colonized urban areas worldwide, are in close contact with both humans and their domestic animals, which could favor AIV exchanges even if such exchanges have rarely been reported thus far. Overall, the Laridae thus constitute an AIV host group that should not be neglected. Further research is clearly needed to clarify AIV epidemiological dynamics in aquatic birds, and it would greatly benefit from incorporating evolutionary ecology and ornithological knowledge". - Mod.PMB
