Since Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) was first recognized in May 1993,
177 U.S. case-patients from 29 states have been laboratory confirmed by CDC
and have been added to the national HPS registry. Of these 177, 39 were
identified retrospectively, with onset of illness prior to May 1993. To
date, 19 case-patients with onset of illness in 1997 have been confirmed.
Cumulative descriptive demographic statistics for the 177 confirmed U.S.
case-patients in the HPS registry:
