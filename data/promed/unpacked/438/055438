[This outbreak is in the southeastern part of Ningxia Province, very near its border with Gansu Province. According to the OIE WAHID database, Foot and Mouth Disease serotype Asia 1 was found in Ningxia Province in 2006 and 2008. In April, 2010 there was an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease serotype O, which is the same serotype being cited in this report. There have been no reports of Asia 1 since 2008.

In neighboring Gansu province, serotype Asia 1 was reported between 2005 and 2008. There were no outbreaks in 2009 and in 2010 serotype O was reported in March with 206 cases occuring on a swine farm. In April,2010 there were 2 outbreaks - one in swine and one is sheep and goats. In July, another outbreak occurred in swine and then no Foot and Mouth Disease outbreaks occurred until the current report in cattle. Again, no reports of Asia 1 serotype since 2008.

The heart of epidemiology is the detection of patterns in populations. The sample size in this case is too small and geography should be considered at the local, not provincial level in order to detect any definitive pattern. Also, vaccination patterns are critical for understanding any pattern of Foot and Mouth Disease. Nevertheless, the epidemiology of Foot and Mouth Disease often suggests a replacement pattern of the dominant circulating serotype. This is the reason that vaccination for Foot and Mouth Disease is always an ongoing challenge. One hypothesis for what is going on Ningxia and Gansu Provinces over the last several years is the replacement of the Asia 1 serotype by serotype O.
