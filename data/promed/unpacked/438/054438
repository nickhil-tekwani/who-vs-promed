New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Gifu city, Gifu
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Sep 2018
Outbreak status: resolved (13 Sep 2018)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar: _Sus scrofa_ (Suidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a dead wild boar (_Sus scrofa_) was found within the 10 km [6 mi] radius from the affected farm.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments:
1. Affected farm
- Stamping out: All pigs in the farm were culled by 10 Sep 2018.
- Disposal of dead animals: All bodies were buried by 10 Sep 2018.
- Disinfection: Disinfection for contaminated materials and tools as well as inside of the farm was completed by 11 Sep 2018
2. Monitoring and survey of farms, etc.
- Farms to be intensively monitored are the 13 farms which have epidemiological relationship with the affected farm (*). Clinical examinations, ELISA and PCR were carried out on the 13 farms, and all results were negative to classical swine fever.
(*) Epidemiological relationship with the affected farm: supplying pigs to the same slaughterhouse; using the same compost facility; visited by the same veterinarian.
3. Surveillance of wildlife (the wild boar reported in this follow up report)
Gifu prefecture started the survey from 13 Sep 2018. On 13 Sep 2018, a dead wild boar was found in the zone within 3 to 10 km radius from the affected farm (shipment restriction zone). On 14 Sep 2018 the dead wild boar was confirmed positive to CSF by sequencing at National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH).
4. Epidemiological investigation
- Since 9 Sep 2018, the National Epidemiological Investigation Team has been dispatched.
- In order to facilitate the identification of cause and route of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the disease by increasing the experts of team members, Intensified Epidemiological Investigation Team for the CSF case has been established on 12 Sep 2018. An expert for wildlife joined on 14 Sep 2018.
- NIAH published the results of gene analysis of the CSFV of the case [see further in commentary]. NIAH considered that the virus was likely to be introduced from overseas as the virus belongs to subgenotype 2.1 5.
5. Communication to producers
- On 9 Sep 2018, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries re-ordered all prefectures that any farm should comply with Biosecurity Standard and Guidelines for CSF such as adequate disinfection against invasion of CSF virus, early notification, and prevention of wild animals, etc.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; control of wildlife reservoirs; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures.

Diagnostic test results
1. Laboratory name and type: Gifu Central Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (local laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Wild boar / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 14 Sep 2018 / Positive
2. National Institute of Animal Health (OIE reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Swine / virus sequencing / 14 Sep 2018 / Positive
Wild boar / gene sequencing / 14 Sep 2018 / Positive

[1. Genotyping results of the virus from the Gifu-city CSF outbreak, obtained by Japan's National Agricultural Research Institute (Animal Health Research Division) were published Fri 14 Sep 2018.

The website includes the following commentary (in Japanese, machine translated):
The hog cholera [CSF/classical swine fever] virus is divided into 3 groups (genotypes) according to the gene sequence of a specific region of the viral gene, and further subdivided into subgroups (subgenotypes). The Gifu/2018 strain belongs to the subgenotype 2.1 group. Many CSF vaccine strains, including those applied in Japan, belong to the group of genotype 1. No viruses belonging to the 2.1 group have been detected in the past in Japan. It seemed likely that the virus had invaded from overseas.

According to the data in the included dendrogram, the current "Gifu/2018" strain presents close relationship to 2 Asian strains, namely "Mongolian/2014a" and "Chinese/2015"; the information and the dendrogram are available at http://www.naro.affrc.go.jp/publicity_report/press/laboratory/niah-neo/083106.html.

2. Based upon information published (in Japanese) by the Gifu prefecture (http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/sangyo/chikusan/kachiku-eisei/11437/CSF-hassei-taiou.html), the chronology of the event has been the following:
- On 20 Aug 2018, a Gifu municipality veterinarian visited the farm and found that some pigs were weakened and totally inappetent. The owner said that the condition had started on 16 Aug 2018. According to the website, until 3 Sep 2018, about 20 pigs had died ("little by little, not all at once"). (http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/event-calendar/c_11437/5-honbuinkaigi.data/06_5-honbuinkaigi.pdf; Japanese).
- On 3 Sep 2018, Gifu prefecture VS lab was requested to test one dead pig from the said farm. (http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/event-calendar/c_11437/1-honbuinkaigi.data/01_H30CSF_kanchikukakutei_honbuinkaigi.pdf; Japanese).
- On 13 Sep 2018, a wild boar was found dead in a nearby waterway, in Uchikoshi zone, Gifu city (http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/event-calendar/c_11437/4-honbuinkaigi.data/05_4-honbuinkaigi.pdf). It tested positive for CSF by the national lab's genetic test (<http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/event-calendar/c_11437/0915-0100-taiouzyokyo.html; Japanese).
- On 15 Sep 2018, another wild boar was found dead in a garden of a house at Obora zone in Gifu city; it tested positive for CSF by PCR by prefecture lab (http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/event-calendar/c_11437/0916-1930-taiouzyokyo.data/16_9.16_1930-inoshishi-PCR.pdf; Japanese).

According to the information above, the event on the pig farm in Gifu city, may had started about 19 days earlier than the date (3 Sep 2018) indicated in Japan's immediate notification submitted to the OIE on 9 Sep 2018.

ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above concerning the chronology of the event and the genotyping results.

3. According to a Japanese media source dated 18 Sep 2018, 2 other wild boars were found dead on 21 Aug 2018 in an area within 3 km (2 mi) from the Gifu city farm (see last sentence in http://www.poandpo.com/agrifish/hog-cholera-virus-in-japan-may-have-come-from-abroad-1892018406/). Confirmation of this information or otherwise, and any additional data on related tests, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
