For the 1st time after 5 years of hard work sending healthcare teams
to different areas of the country, physicians from Alas para la Gente
(Wings for People) Foundation detected one case of leishmaniasis, a
parasitic disease quite frequently found in the jungle. The affected
patient is an 8-year old girl.

This occurred during the recent visit by 26 health care professionals
to Tienda Nueva village (Santander). More than 1000 inhabitants from
the community benefited from this activity, which lasted for 2 days.

The child, who came accompanied by her mother, went to the outpatient
clinic because of a rash on both arms. However, the specialists
diagnosed leishmaniasis, and the case was immediately reported to the
Social Welfare Ministry. This institution has the task of not only
granting medical therapy for the patient, but also they have to
investigate how she acquired the disease.

This was just one of the many cases that physicians from Alas para la
Gente, a foundation supported by El Tiempo, took care of. Personnel
from this organization travel to remote and depressed areas of the
country at least 7 times per year delivering healthcare services and
serving many people. "Recent visits were made not only to poor areas
but to other areas affected last winter season," said Captain Camilo
Arjona, head of the foundation.

[Colombia is regarded as endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis. The
latest WHO update on leishmaniasis in South America is from 2007
(<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/DPC/CD/leish-2007.pdf>). The report
underlines that leishmaniasis is endemic and most probably
underreported in Colombia.

The Ministry of Health of Colombia reported 12 292 cases of cutaneous
leishmaniasis up to week 50, 2010, 12-18 Dec 2010,
(<http://190.27.195.165:8080/?idcategoria=83030&download=Y#>). The
annual incidence for Santander department (state or province
equivalent) is 142 per 100 000 inhabitants. The most endemic
department was Guaviare with 781 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.
