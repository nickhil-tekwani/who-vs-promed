Samples of goose meat taken from a Guangzhou market in south China's Guangdong Province have tested positive for H7N9 avian influenza.

Guangdong Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) confirmed on Sunday [5 Jan 2014] that 2 goose meat samples and one sewage water sample from 2 poultry booths in a wet market in Zengcheng, a satellite city of Guangzhou, tested positive.

"It's serious that the water sample test is positive, because it means all the birds inside coops have the possibility of being infected with H7N9 avian influenza. The longer they stay in the coops, the risk of being infected rises," said Yang Zhicong, deputy chief of the Guangzhou municipal CDCP. The city government of Guangzhou, the provincial capital, is tracking the poultry source. The market was shut down on Saturday [4 Jan 2014] for 3 days so disinfection and cleaning can take place.

Meanwhile, 17 sales people working in 9 poultry booths in the market are undergoing a week-long medical observation. So far, they have shown no signs of being infected with the bird flu, said Yang.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally only infect birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.

A total of 6 human cases of H7N9 bird flu have been confirmed in Guangdong Province since August [2013]. None are from Guangzhou.

"According to expert assessments, Guangdong faces an extremely high risk of sporadic human H7N9 infections in winter and next spring [2014]," said Zhang Yonghui, head of the provincial CDCP.

"The cases may occur at any time across the province and the Pearl River Delta region requires special attention," Zhang said.

The province has urged local agricultural and forestry authorities to strengthen daily management, tests and disinfection of live poultry markets and crack down on illegal wildlife trade.

Antiflu drugs such as Tamiflu should be used within 48 hours by those who show flu symptoms such as fever and have been in contact with poultry, said Chen Yuansheng, director of the provincial health and family planning commission.

The Chinese mainland has reported more than 140 human cases of the deadly virus since it emerged in March [2013], including 45 fatalities.

[Guangdong province borders Hong Kong; the detection of infection in the mentioned poultry market is cause for concern there. Subscribers are referred to Mod.CP's commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20131218.2123627 which addressed human infection with the H7N9 virus in Guangdong; he wrote: "It is likely that the appearance of H7N9 avian influenza cases reflects a relaxation of controls in the sale of domestic poultry imposed during the summer months."

As reported in ProMED-mail posting 20131203.2090295, Shanghai decided to suspend live poultry trading from 31 Jan 2014, the 1st day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, until 30 Apr 2014 to prevent a recurrence of the bird flu. Guangzhou, and other cities at risk, may consider following Shanghai's example.

During earlier surveillance activities in the A(H7N9) affected areas, the virus was detected in chickens, pigeons, and the environment. The birds did not show clinical signs, and the virus strain was regarded not pathogenic for the animal species above. The finding in goose meat should not be surprising; it may be assumed that the virus will infect additional poultry species.
