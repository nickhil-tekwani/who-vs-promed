The Minister of Health for Khartoum State has warned of hepatitis and HIV/AIDS transmission through medical waste. Minister Mamoun Humeida told reporters on [Thu 19 Mar 2015] that the hospitals and health clinics in Khartoum produce 10 tons of waste each day.

He acknowledged that the Ministry has failed to address recycling of the waste, in response to press reports about a human tissue found at a main street in the city. He suggested that the samples may have leaked from medical waste lorries.

He stressed that people should not touch medical waste found in the streets, which could be infected with diseases such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS.

[Visitors to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, should be aware of this official warning that discarded medical waste is not being managed in a safe and appropriate manner. A photograph accompanying this report (see source URL above) illustrates alarmingly the dire condition of parts of the capital city.

Risk of exposure to hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus contamination is mentioned specifically, although neither of these infections has been mentioned in any previous report in ProMED-mail in Khartoum, Sudan. Perhaps this may be a way of announcing their presence there. Clarification would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
