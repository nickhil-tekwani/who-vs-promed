From: Bruce A Carter <Bruce.A.Carter@usda.gov>

I work for the USDA/APHIS/VS/Center for Veterinary Biologics, Ames, Iowa. I
have not heard of any research being conducted to develop a Nipah virus
vaccine for use in swine, although I would be very interested in learning
of any research that is being conducted in that area. The USDA recently
permitted shipments of West Nile virus isolates to veterinary biologics
manufacturers with Class III Biological Safety capabilities. To my
knowledge, the only U.S. facilities where work on Nipah virus can be
conducted are Class IV facilities such as at Ft. Detrick, Maryland, and the
CDC in Atlanta.
I am guessing that if anyone is working on developing a vaccine, either
killed virulent or modified live attenuated, that the work is being
conducted in a country, such as Malaysia, where the disease has occurred.

[If the absence of other comments is an indication of lack of progress on
development of a vaccine for Niaph virus, then there is no action at this
time. Movement of this virus in countries bordering or nearby Malaysia or
discovery of the virus, or one similar to it, in a nearby country would
indicate that the time for methodical vaccine development has gone.
Imagine the impact of a Nipah-like virus in countries where the majority of
residents rely on pork as a dietary mainstay. At the least, a collaborative
project, one investigating the immunizing potential of various
paramyxovirus proteins, might be considered, soon. - Mod. CHC
