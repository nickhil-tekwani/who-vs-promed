The summer of 2022 saw a record number of tick-borne encephalitis infections. By early September [2022], more than 300 people had contracted the tick-borne meningoencephalitis virus [TBE] transmitted by the unwanted [tick]. There were fewer than 100 cases during the same period 10 years ago, reported our colleagues from the "SonntagsZeitung," which is already worth the title of "tick year" in 2022.

This disease is not to be taken lightly: if it is most often without consequence, it can sometimes cause serious neurological sequelae and cause death in 1% of cases. Especially since after infection, treatment is only symptomatic. The German-speaking Sunday newspaper thus gives the floor to [JR], a former high-level athlete, who was close to death due to this illness and who has been fighting since this summer to regain all his abilities.

In very hot years, ticks proliferate and the virus with it. In the event of a hot spring, it is estimated that one in a hundred ticks carries the [TBE] virus, while the proportion drops to one in a thousand if the same period is rather cool. But aside from these one-off effects, climate change has already compounded the problem.

While the regions at risk were still limited to certain sectors of the Plateau 10 years ago, all of Switzerland is now affected by the spread of this dangerous virus. Only Ticino and Geneva are still relatively spared. And the time when hikers who favored high altitude trails felt safe is over: you can find ticks up to 2000 meters [6500 ft] now.

If [JR] wanted to share his story in the newspaper it is because it could easily have been avoided: in the spring, he could have been vaccinated against this disease but he did not want to. "It was a huge mistake," he says today. Available in pharmacies, the vaccine, whose schedule is available in 3 doses, indeed offers very effective coverage against TBE, but the Swiss are relatively uninterested.

Barely 1/3 of the population has had recourse to the injection. "Given the danger of a bite, it's much too low," says Norbert Satz, a doctor in Zurich and tick specialist who points to "vaccine aversion" high in Switzerland. In Austria, 90% of the population is vaccinated, and the only cases of meningoencephalitis concern tourists.

[This has become an active year for tickborne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Switzerland. The Swiss government has a proactive TBE vaccination program, and the office repeated the call above for anybody who may be exposed to ticks -- for example, walkers, especially in forests -- to be vaccinated. Apparently, compliance with health authorities' recommendation for vaccination has been inadequate. The optimum time for vaccination is in winter so that walkers and hikers are protected once the good weather and riskiest period (from April to October) rolls around.

As cited earlier, according to government information, the most widespread TBE vector tick species in Switzerland is the wood tick (_Ixodes ricinus_, commonly known as the castor bean tick or sheep tick). It prefers deciduous woods with abundant undergrowth, the edge of the forest and forest paths, and waits on low-growing plants until a warm-blooded host (a person or an animal) brushes against the plant.

In a previous comment in 2017 concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr Ivo M Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased markedly, roughly about 50%, since 2000. The reason for the increase in TBE incidence in Central/Western/Northern Europe is unknown.

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
