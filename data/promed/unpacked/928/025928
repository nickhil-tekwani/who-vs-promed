Herders in the countryside of Ma'arrat Numan, in Idlib province are facing the high cost of feed and the interruption of veterinary drug supplies. This interruption of veterinary drug supplies has contributed to the spread of _Brucella_ spp., which can also cause brucellosis among humans. Power outages have also led to the deterioration of the dairy and cheese vendor industry.

As a result of the current unrest in the Syrian Arab Republic, the government's veterinary service has become significantly eroded. Vaccines are in short supply and sanctions prohibit imports. Most private companies that were producing prophylactic medications have gone out of business, because of damage to their premises and because of the difficulty to import. Due to higher prices, more Syrian Arab Republic livestock are being sold in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq.

With the virtual loss of veterinary services within the Syrian Arab Republic, livestock diseases are at risk to be transmitted to neighbouring countries, thereby posing potentially serious regional animal health problems.

[Brucellosis is endemic in much of the Middle East. Civil war-related erosion of programs for livestock health will certainly lead to increased brucellosis in the animals and subsequent spread to humans from direct livestock contact and/or ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. Given the political situation in Syria, one wonders how the diagnosis of brucellosis in people was made. - Mod.LL

Item 3 provides data not seen before; of particular concern is the information about the deterioration of the Syrian veterinary services and their disturbed activities combined with increased exports of live animals. This may have led to the spread of infectious animal diseases within Syria. One of such diseases, suspected to be circulating in Syria without
being noticed/controlled/reported, is the cattle disease Lumpy skin disease (LSD). The reported increased export of Syrian livestock to other coutnries in the region (4 are named) may explain the spread of LSD in some of them. LSD has already been reported from Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian authority. - Mod.AS
