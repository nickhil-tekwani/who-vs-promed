State health officials on Wednesday said a second batch of mosquitoes and
16 more dead crows, including one collected in Passaic County, have tested
positive for the West Nile-like virus. New Jersey still has no confirmed
cases of human infection, despite the presence of the pathogen in wild
birds and mosquitoes -- both of which are critical to the virus' life cycle.
Experts continue to stress that the threat of contracting the virus is
declining, though the mosquitoes that carry it continue to breed. It will
take a hard frost, experts say, for the pests to disappear altogether.
So far, nine samples of blood or spinal fluid submitted by New Jersey
hospitals and doctors have shown no indications of the virus. State
officials are waiting for the results of tests on at least 21 other samples.
Wednesday's update brings to 51 the number of dead birds -- all crows
except for one pigeon -- that have been found to carry the pathogen in New
Jersey. They were collected in 12 of the state's 21 counties. The most
recent birds to test positive were picked up between 27 Sep and 11 Oct
1999, McGowan said. In all, about 85 dead birds have been tested.
The second pool of mosquitoes to show traces of the virus were trapped in
Kearny on 9 Sep 1999, McGowan said. The only other pool to test positive
also came from Hudson County, in Secaucus near the Meadowlands.
Over the winter, federal health officials in New York, New Jersey, and
Connecticut will continue to monitor the presence of the virus in wild birds.
