Veterinary surgeons in the UAE are urging dog owners to have their pets vaccinated and not to socialize with other animals after reported outbreaks of the deadly canine disease distemper.

Across Dubai, many pet owners say their dogs have been diagnosed with distemper, a highly infectious and often fatal viral disease.

Some of the dogs have died, leaving owners heartbroken.

Albert Alcopora, a veterinary nurse at the British Veterinary Hospital in Dubai, said vets within their clinic were aware of cases of distemper and warned that a new strain could be in the UAE, as dogs vaccinated against the disease were being diagnosed with the disease.

While vaccinations provide a protective barrier between pets and these types of diseases, he said dog owners should avoid socializing their animals at the moment.

"The strange thing is it could be a new strain," he told Al Arabiya English. "Even vaccinated dogs are being infected.

"The best prevention to avoid the transmission of the disease through saliva and other bodily fluids is to avoid direct contact with other dogs.

"If you see signs of distemper -- symptoms such as discharge from the eye or nose -- go directly to the vet.

"However, give them warning that your dog may have distemper so they can isolate your pet so as not to infect healthy animals as it is a very nasty virus.

"Make sure your dog's vaccination is up to date and when walking your dog avoid direct contact with other dogs. Prevention is better than cure."

Symptoms include watery/pus-like eye discharge, fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, vomiting, tremors/ticks, problems with balancing or walking and seizures.

A member of staff at the DKC Veterinary Clinic in Dubai's Motor City said she was aware of cases in Dubai Hills and Damac Hills and advised dog owners to have their pet's antibody levels checked to see if they have sufficient antibodies against the disease.

"We advise booster shots and it is best not to socialize pets in areas that it may be prevalent such as dog parks," she said.

[Vaccine-based prophylaxis is generally regarded as effective in keeping canine distemper under control, worldwide. The media-reported cases in vaccinated dogs in the UAE have been preceded by several such episodes in other countries, throughout the years. Such incidents could be attributed, among others, to vaccine efficacy, vaccination techniques applied including age at primary vaccination, immunodepressive agents and the emergence of new CDV variants.

It would be useful to obtain lab confirmation and genotype results, the (estimated) morbidity rate, the age distribution of the affected animals, and vaccine data (one or more manufacturers/batches?). - Mod.AS
