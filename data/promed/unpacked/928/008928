[In Austria, the cattle population (since 1999) and the sheep and goat populations (since 2001) are officially recognized free of this pathogen. The above reported outbreak was reported by ProMED-mail on 30 Jun 2018 (see http://www.promedmail.org/post/5883595). At that time, no final identification of the pathogen as _B. melitensis_ was yet available.

A solitary outbreak of _B. melitensis_ was reported by Austria to the OIE in January 2009, affecting a small sheep holding in Steiermark. Out of 47 susceptible sheep, 2 cases were lab identified. The 2 positive animals were slaughtered, no further actions undertaken/ reported. Steiermark is located in southeastern and central Austria, bordering Slovenia on the south.

The introduction of _B. melitensis_ into a cattle farm in Austria is highly exceptional. Possible human-borne infection deserves to be excluded. According to annual reports of ECDC, sporadic exotic human cases of _B. melitensis_ have been reported from Austria several times. - Mod AS]

["Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus _Brucella_, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_.

"Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by biovars (bv.) of _Brucella abortus_. In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_. Occasionally, _B. suis_ may cause a chronic infection of the mammary gland of cattle, but it has not been reported to cause abortion or spread to other animals. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is widespread globally but several countries in northern and central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_.

"The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes. Adult male cattle may develop orchitis/epididymitis and brucellosis may be a cause of infertility in both sexes. Hygromas, usually involving leg joints, are a common manifestation of brucellosis in some tropical countries and may be the only obvious indicator of infection; the hygroma fluid is often infected with _Brucella_.

"Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.

"_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis _are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions".
