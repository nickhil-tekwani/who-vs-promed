8 killed by flooding and disease in Guyana
-------------------------------------------
A leptospirosis outbreak in a flood-stricken part of Guyana has killed at
least 3 people and affected a dozen others, authorities said Wed, 2 Feb
2005, bringing to 8 the overall death toll since the flood began 3 weeks ago.
Madan Rambarran, director of medical services at the Georgetown Public
Hospital Corp., said doctors have confirmed an outbreak of the disease.
Authorities were planning to dispense medicine to an estimated 150 000
people said to be at risk for the disease, he noted.
Meanwhile, Bernadette Theodore-Gandhi, director of the local Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) office, said a
disease surveillance system has detected cases of jaundice, a symptom of
leptospirosis.
"We're responding to the outbreak and, therefore we're working with the
Ministry of Health in terms of establishing prophylaxis for as many people
as possible who are at risk for leptospirosis," she said.
PAHO/WHO figures, however, show that one person has died of the disease and
11 others have been hospitalized, she said. 5 other people drowned in
separate incidents last month.
The densely populated Atlantic coast was flooded last month for the first
time in 100 years after unusually heavy rains, affecting the homes and
businesses of at least 300 000 people in the South American nation.

4 deaths linked to flood disease -- Health Ministry tracking 34 patients
-------------------------------------------------
Health Minister, Dr. Leslie Ramsammy, yesterday said there was a high
probability that 4 recent deaths were from leptospirosis but stressed that
the ministry was still awaiting confirmation from overseas tests.
He said health officials were also tracking 34 persons hospitalised with
symptoms of the disease, adding "we can't say definitively that these are
leptospirosis cases until we have the confirmatory tests done."
Ramsammy told the Chronicle the 4 persons who died were from Georgetown and
the East Coast Demerara and there was "a high index of suspicion" that
these deaths may have been due to the disease. He said the 34 patients
under close watch have symptoms consistent with leptospirosis and blood and
urine samples have been sent for confirmatory tests at the Caribbean
Epidemiology Research Centre (CAREC) in Trinidad and in Atlanta, USA. The
results are expected next week, he said.
[Ramsammy stated] there was "strong evidence" that the disease has affected
persons but pointed out that this was expected in the wake of the floods.
The bacteria is present in animals, including pets and cattle, and the
risks "are there when floods occur and man and animals inhabit the same
space", Ramsammy explained. He said that health teams had been on the
watch for symptoms of the disease since the floods hit heavily-populated
parts of the coast, including Georgetown, in January 2005.
"The surveillance system has worked in keeping track of suspected cases",
the Health Minister assured.
Head of the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) in Guyana, Dr.
Bernadette Theodore-Gandi, said on Wednesday that some evidence seems to
suggest that some flood-affected persons have been afflicted by leptospirosis.
She said preliminary tests conducted after a surveillance system was set up
showed that "there is some evidence that some of the cases seen are
leptospirosis", a disease spread by way of rats, the major vectors of the
disease, and other animals.
Noting that PAHO had expected the disease "to come at this time", Dr.
Theodore-Gandi told the Chronicle, "We now know through the surveillance
system that leptospirosis is here through the preliminary tests."
She said PAHO has notified the Ministry of Health of its suspicion and the
ministry will alert physicians and others of the presence of the disease.
The Ministry of Health has also been advised to provide the necessary
advisories for the benefit of the public.

[Leptospirosis is often spread to humans via water contaminated with urine
from infected animals, commonly rodents but also livestock. The
transmission may also be related to close animal contact rather than via a
water reservoir.
The 1st newswire mentions a plan to use preventative therapy to prevent
leptospirosis in the affected areas. Doxycycline can be used; a USA Army
study done in soldiers training in Panama found that 200 mg of doxycycline
taken once weekly prevented leptospirosis, symptomatic or subclinical
(serological conversion), with an efficacy of 95 percent (1). However, a
more recent report from India (2) found that that same treatment
statistically decreased clinical disease but did not prevent serologically
proven, subclinical infection. The differences between the studies may
well be the degree of risk, with the later study having a higher risk of
exposure.
