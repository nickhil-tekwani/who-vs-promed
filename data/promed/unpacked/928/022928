----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethylene glycol toxicity is all too common. The "perpetrator" could be someone who has a leaky coolant system in their car. Ironically this can occur with insufficient antifreeze. This poisoning has been documented for decades and currently poisons over 5000 US citizens per year. The glycol gives it a sweet flavor and children are often victim to this poison as are dogs and cats. It may, however, not be a malicious neighbor.

[Dr Schopler is correct. Carelessness with ethylene glycol, a leaky radiator, or carelessness of spilling the anti-freeze when filling a radiator could be the source of what killed an animal or animals. Ethylene glycol causes kidney failure, which can lead to death without rapid recognition and treatment. - Mod.TG
