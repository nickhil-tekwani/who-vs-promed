Sudan: Rift Valley fever - WHO update 3
---------------------------------------
Human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continue to occur in Sudan, with
more than 221 cases reported in the last 2 weeks. As of Wed 21 Nov 2007,
436 human RVF cases, including 161 deaths have been reported from White
Nile, Sennar, and Gazeera States. In addition 15 cases including 3 deaths
were reported in Khartoum State, but they were probably infected in the
other affected areas. Gazeera State continues to report the most human
cases, and now accounts for 271 cases and 100 deaths.

In RVF outbreaks, the vast majority of human infections result from direct
or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus
can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Human
infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes. Humans
may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or
uncooked milk or meat of infected animals.

Key public health measures include social mobilization, to help people who
come into contact with cattle, sheep, and other animals to adopt safe
handling and slaughtering practices; epidemiological measures such as
active case finding; supportive clinical measures; vector control to stop
the spread of disease, primarily between animals but also from animals to
humans; and laboratory diagnosis capacity.

The national response to the outbreak is being managed by an
inter-ministerial task force, with the participation, inter alia, of the
Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Animal Resources and
Fisheries. This task force is responsible for managing integrated action to
control the spread of the disease and to decrease the impact on human and
animal health. In support of the task force, state and federal ministers of
health met on Tue 20 Nov 2007 to discuss the response activities and called
for systematic measures to control the spread of disease in animal
populations, including controls on animal movement.

The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office and WHO headquarters continue
to support the Sudan Federal Ministry of Health in its role as part of the
national Task Force, through the provision of technical support.

Continued, integrated intensive social mobilization efforts are urgently
needed, using all locally available media, including television and radio
channels, as well as community and religious leaders, to ensure that
at-risk communities are fully aware of the measures that need to be taken
to reduce the risk of human infection.

[The number of human cases of Rift Valley fever in the White Nile, Sennar,
and Gazeera States of Sudan is 74 more than given by the Sudanese Ministry
of Health on 20 Nov 2007, and the number of fatalities has increased by 67.
These figures do not include the 15 cases and 3 deaths in Khartoum State,
thought to have originated outwith the state. The centre of the outbreak
appears to be Gazeera State, but there is still a lack of clarity regarding
the extent of the disease in livestock, the presumed source of the
outbreak, and the measures being taken to reduce the exposure of the human
population to the disease.

The location of the White Nile, Sennar, and Gazeera States can be viewed by
