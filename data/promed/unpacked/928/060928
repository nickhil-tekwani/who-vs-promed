SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- President Francisco Flores declared a
national emergency this week after an epidemic of dengue fever claimed a
17th victim.
Flores urged Salvadorans to take action to stop the epidemic's spread,
including trying to eliminate mosquito-breeding places in populated areas.
"I feel this measure will help awaken the population," Flores said.
The action came after a child under the age of 5 died early Tuesday,
becoming the epidemic's 17th victim. The country's Ministry of Health also
said officials were investigating the deaths of 3 other children to
determine if they also were killed by dengue.
Puerto Rican and U.S. scientists are in El Salvador studying the epidemic.
Dengue has infected more than 750 Salvadorans, mostly children, this year.
Last year, it killed 3 people in El Salvador.

HONDURAS DECLARES NATIONAL DENGUE FEVER ALERT
-------------------------------------------------
Tegucigalpa, Sep 14, 2000 (EFE via COMTEX) -- The number of cases of
hemorrhagic dengue fever increased to 19, Honduran Deputy Health Minister
Elliethe Giron said Thursday, announcing a national alert as an epidemic
sweeps neighboring El Salvador.
However, the 7 new cases reported in Honduras are unrelated to the epidemic
in El Salvador, Giron noted. Of the 7 new cases of hemorrhagic dengue, 6
occurred in Tegucigalpa and one in Cedros, in the interior of the country,
adding to the 12 reported last week. Among these 19 cases, only one adult
was involved, the rest were children, and none have died.
Giron did not link the growing incidence of the illness in Honduras to the
crisis situation in El Salvador, where 16 have died and officials have
reported 221 cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever and 1 875 cases of common
dengue.

[Although ProMED-mail does not normally post pieces about dengue fever in
regions of the world in which the disease is endemic, it does so when there
are outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever. In this situation, the
declaration by El Salvador's president that there is a national emergency
due to dengue fever and the rising number of deaths certainly merits
posting as does the alert for Honduras.
We would be interested to learn further details of the situations in El
Salvador and Honduras. -Man. Ed. DS
