[The following data have been extracted from the official website as of late Friday, 22 Jul 2022.]

Information on foot and mouth disease (FMD)-infected areas: 22 provinces, 263 counties/cities, 2197 subdistricts, 10 913 villages. Disease map available at https://siagapmk.crisis-center.id/peta-terdampak-pmk.

2. Vaccinated: This refers to 5 species: cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig. Most vaccinations addressed cattle, including 495 324 beef cattle and 101 966 dairy cows. The total, as of late Friday (22 Jul 2022) night, was 619 298 animals of all mentioned groups, vaccinated. A vaccination map is available at https://siagapmk.crisis-center.id/peta-pelaksanaan-vaksinasi-pmk.

3. Epidemiological data -- totals all animal groups:
Confirmed cases: 410 421
Recovered: 179 758 animals
Active cases (not yet recovered): 222 877
Slaughtered: 4783
Dead: 3003

Separate figures for each animal group are presented. The above figures are continuously updated.

[On 10 Jul 2022, the vaccination figures were 421 787 livestock (see 20220711.8704348). The vaccination coverage has yet a long way to go before further spread of FMD in Indonesia may be, it is hoped, put on hold. Earlier, Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture stated that 17 million livestock were due to be vaccinated, around 80% of the livestock population in provinces affected by the disease. The plan was to inoculate the livestock thrice: twice in 2022 and once in 2023. - Mod.AS]

[2] International impact: contaminated animal products detected in Australia

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) [virus] -- an outbreak of which could devastate the nation's livestock industry -- has been detected in [goods imported into] Australia, agriculture minister Murray Watt has announced at a news conference. Watt has revealed that a traveller from Indonesia brought viral traces of FMD on an undeclared beef product into the country's airport. Traces of FMD were also found on imported pork products from China being sold in the Melbourne central business district.

Indonesia has been grappling with the spread of FMD after it was recently detected in Bali, a popular holiday destination for Australians. Because of this, the government has ramped up the country's biosecurity measures, and travellers arriving from Indonesia will now be asked to walk across sanitation foot mats laid down at airports. The mats will contain a citric acid solution designed to dislodge dirt from the shoe's sole and cover it in the acid.

FMD is a highly contagious animal disease that affects cattle, sheep, goats and pigs but does not pose a threat to humans. However, it can be carried on animal products, including meat and leather. Humans can also carry the disease on their shoes, clothes, and even noses -- where it can survive 24 hours.

Government modelling projects that a widespread FMD outbreak in Australia would have an estimated direct economic impact of around AUD 80 billion (~USD 55 billion).

"I am advised that all products now of this kind have been seized from all linked supermarkets and a warehouse in Melbourne as well," stated Watt. "At one level, these detections are very disturbing -- that we see the viral fragments, not a live virus but viral fragments, coming in via product. At another level, these detections show that our borders are strong and our biosecurity systems are working."

[3] Australia: biosecurity measures

The federal government has invoked new biosecurity powers at Australian airports as FMD spreads through Indonesia. Biosecurity response zones will be set up at international airports, and in the coming days every traveller returning from Indonesia will be compelled to use foot mats or take other directions regarding biosecurity.

At present, individual passengers deemed to be a risk need to be asked, and have to agree, to use foot mats and have their shoes cleaned. The new measures will make this process mandatory under a 3-month trial, but will only apply to those travellers returning from Indonesia. It is the first time the rules have been used since the 2015 Biosecurity Act was introduced. Federal agriculture minister Murray Watt said the changes were the latest measure in the strongest biosecurity response in Australia's history. "We have already announced an AUD 14 million (~USD 9.7 million) assistance package to reduce the risk of FMD spreading from Bali to Australia, which included increased detection and protection here in Australia and a million vaccines for the Indonesian cattle industry," Senator Watt said.

[East Java Province ranks first in the number of active FMD cases, followed by West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) and Aceh. Updated figures for each province are available in the above (section 1) official website.

In view of the spread of the virus throughout major territories of Indonesia, the detection of FMD virus or its particles in animal products originating in Indonesia should not be a surprise. - Mod.AS
