Between [15 and 21 Nov 2019], no human cases of West Nile virus infection have been reported by EU/EEA countries and EU neighbouring countries. In the same time period, no outbreaks among equids were reported to the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS).

As no new human cases with recent disease onset have been reported in the last week, the final 2019 weekly update will be published next week [Fri 29 Nov 2019].

Since the beginning of the 2019 transmission season and as of [21 Nov 2019], EU member states and EU neighbouring countries have reported 462 human infections. EU member states reported 410 cases: Greece (223), Romania (66), Italy (53), Hungary (36), Cyprus (16), Bulgaria (5), Austria (4), Germany (4), France (2), and Slovakia (1). EU neighbouring countries reported 52 human cases in Serbia (27), Israel (10), Turkey (9) and North Macedonia (6).

To date, 50 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Greece (34), Romania (8), Italy (4), Cyprus (1), Bulgaria (1), North Macedonia (1), and Serbia (1).

During the current transmission season, 88 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Germany (30), Greece (21), France (13), Italy (8), Hungary (7), Austria (4), Spain (4) and Portugal (1). In addition, Germany has reported 53 outbreaks among birds to ADNS.

[Based on the update above, no new cases have been reported in Europe. Does this indicate that the WNV activity is winding down?

ECDC publishes weekly WNV epidemiological updates during the WNV transmission season, including the geographical distribution of human cases in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries. In addition, ECDC includes maps in its epidemiological updates highlighting areas where WNV outbreaks among equids have been reported. - Mod.UBA
