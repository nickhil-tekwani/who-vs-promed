Concerns about Occupational Cases of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome
---------------------------------------------------
[N.B. The designation "hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome" (HCPS) is
preferred by Dr. Hjelle rather than the more usual "hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome" (HPS) used by ProMED-mail and others. Dr. Hjelle introduced the
term hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome to provide a more precise and
generally applicable description of the disease condition associated with
hantavirus infection. ProMED-mail continues to use HPS merely for
consistency in archiving. - Mod.CP]
This is actually the 2nd recent case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome
(HCPS) in the United States involving graduate or postdoctoral students of
which I have become recently aware. The other case, from June 2004, was a
postdoctoral researcher from California who was involved in small mammal
collections near Quincy. Fortunately this gentleman fared far better than
did the graduate student working in West Virginia. Critical information
about the precise activities of the 2 students is still lacking, but I
think it is an opportune time to remind all principal investigators and
students alike whose work in the field and otherwise brings them in contact
with wild rodents that guidelines have been promulgated through the
collaborative efforts of CDC and University of New Mexico that specify
exactly what precautions should be taken to help reduce the risk of
occupational exposure to hantaviruses. (Ref: Mills, J. N., T. L. Yates, J.
E. Childs, R. R. Parmenter, T. G. Ksiazek, P. E. Rollin, and C. J. Peters.
1995. Guidelines for working with rodents potentially infected with
hantavirus. Journal of Mammalogy 76:716-722.) These guidelines are not
overly costly or onerous, and in fact they have been adopted widely by many
field workers.
That the workers involved were not necessarily engaged in research on the
viruses themselves offers nothing by way of protection -- it is the contact
with wild rodents that puts the worker at risk. It would be valuable to
explore ways to reach all of the at-risk communities through
their list-serves and literature to prevent recurrences of these tragic
events.

A Comment on Risk Awareness
---------------------------
Wildlife biologists need to become aware of the risks of being exposed to
hantaviruses from handling small rodents, and the relatively simple,
inexpensive preventive measures that can be taken to reduce that risk. An
educational program ought to be carried by the Wildlife Society and its
local chapters and similar professional groups to inform its members.
