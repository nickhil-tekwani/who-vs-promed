From 1998 to 2016, Montana tested more than 17 000 wild deer, elk and moose for CWD. There were no positive tests until this fall [2017].

A mule deer buck shot by a hunter 12 Nov 2017. north of Chester on the Hi-Line near the Canadian border has tested positive for chronic wasting disease, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

The deer was taken in hunting district 401 in Liberty County, in very remote country fewer than 10 miles from the state's border with Canada, said Bruce Auchly, an FWP spokesman in Great Falls.

The test results mark the 5th incident of CWD discovered in Montana wild deer this fall [2017], but the 1st in northern Montana. The other 4 deer came from south of Billings.

"This was not unexpected in that CWD is on 3 sides of us, Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Dakotas and Wyoming," Auchly said.

Until this year [2017], CWD had not been found in Montana, though the disease exists in wild deer herds in Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

A hunter shot the deer and FWP took samples. It had a radio collar on it because it was part of a study of mule deer movement in the area, Auchly said. As a result, FWP officials knew it had died when the animal stopped moving.

Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, is a progressive, fatal neurologic disease of elk, deer, moose and caribou for which there is no known cure.

The name comes from the appearance of symptomatic animals, which get very skinny and sick-looking before they die.

Montanans and those interested in hunting big game here have yet to really understand the impact CWD poses to the state's wild ungulate populations, according to an FWP response plan to CWD.

The disease moves slowly through populations.

However, left unmanaged, it could result in long-term population declines within affected herds, may affect property values and reduce interest in deer hunting and the USD 400 million in revenue generated by deer, elk and antelope hunting, according to FWP.

There is no known transmission to humans, FWP says.

However, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend not consuming meat from an animal known to be infected with CWD.

Furthermore, the CDC recommends that hunters strongly consider having their animals tested before eating the meat when hunting in areas where CWD is known to be present.

Four deer previously tested positive after being shot in Carbon County in southcentral Montana near the state's southern border with Wyoming.

One mule deer buck was killed in late October 2017, 10 miles southeast of Bridger, and a 2nd mule deer buck was killed in early November 2017, 3 miles south of Belfry.

A mule deer buck harvested southeast of Bridger and a white-tailed deer doe shot east of Joliet, also tested positive.

The initial discovery of CWD prompted FWP director Martha Williams to form an incident command team, which will be implementing the department's CWD response plan.

FWP is proposing a special 2-month mule deer hunt in Carbon County to gauge the prevalence of CWD in the area.

The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission is scheduled vote Thursday [7 Dec 2017] on the proposed hunt.

The hunt will be split into 2 sessions, 15 Dec 2017 through 14 Jan 2018 and 14 Jan 2017 to 15 Feb 2018 [Although with these dates, it seems like one long session. - Mod.TG].

FWP is in the process of putting together a team for the latest detection north of Chester, Auchly said.

It has not been determined yet if a special CWD hunt will occur north of Chester, he said.

As of 2017, CWD had been found in captive or free-ranging herds in 24 states, 3 Canadian provinces, Norway and South Korea.

It was 1st discovered in 1967 in mule deer at a research facility in Colorado. Its origin is unknown.

Shortly thereafter, it was also found in captive mule deer and elk in Ontario, Colorado, and Wyoming.

By the 1990s it was discovered in wild white-tailed and mule deer, elk, and moose in Colorado and Wyoming and among captive animals in Saskatchewan, South Dakota, Montana, and Oklahoma.

By the early 2000s, CWD was found in the wild in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Illinois and Wisconsin.

Once CWD is present in a wild population, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate, FWP said.

New York and perhaps Minnesota may be the only 2 states to have eliminated a CWD outbreak after its detection.

Both responded aggressively to what appears to have been very early and small outbreaks, FWP said.

Typically, CWD is discovered after it has been established for some time. The approximately 16-month incubation period, when an animal is infectious and shedding potentially long-lived prions into the environment, makes it difficult to detect an emerging epidemic before it is well established, FWP said.

There are currently no effective treatments or vaccines for CWD, FWP said.

Prevention is critical to the control of CWD over large landscapes.

Preventative tools include restricting the transport of carcasses from CWD-infected areas or states, banning the transport or translocation of wild elk or deer and other cervids, and requiring the responsible disposal of carcasses from infected regions, FWP said.

Many states have attempted a combination of population density reduction, disease "hot-spot" culling and reducing large aggregations of deer or elk populations to control the spread.

Some simple precautions should be taken when field dressing deer, elk or moose, according to FWP:

- Wear rubber gloves and eye protection when field dressing.

- Minimize the handling of brain and spinal tissues.

- Wash hands and instruments thoroughly after field dressing is completed.

- Avoid consuming brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes of harvested animals. (Normal field dressing coupled with boning out of a carcass will essentially remove these parts.)

[This article seems to have some contradictions. The article states:

1) The test results mark the 5th incident of CWD discovered in Montana wild deer this fall [2017], but the 1st in northern Montana.

2) Until this year [2017], CWD had not been found in Montana, though the disease exists in wild deer herds in Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

Clearly, if this is the 5th case in Montana, then it is not the 1st in the state, but it may be the 1st in a particular region of the state, in which case, this represents an expansion of the disease in the state of Montana. - Mod.TG

Chronic wasting disease was confirmed this week in a 1.5-year-old female deer from a Mecosta County deer farm. CWD is a fatal neurological disease that affects white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk and moose. The sample was submitted for testing as a part of the state's CWD surveillance program.

"The deer farmer who submitted the sample has gone above and beyond any state requirements to protect their deer from disease, and it is unknown at this time how this producer's herd became infected with CWD," said Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development State Veterinarian James Averill, DVM. "In partnership with the Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we are taking the necessary steps to protect the health and well-being of all of Michigan's deer populations."

"What we know about CWD is always evolving," said DNR state wildlife veterinarian, Kelly Straka, DVM. "As new positives are found, we learn more about how it's transmitted to determine the best way to protect both free-ranging and farmed deer."

MDARD and DNR are following the Michigan Surveillance and Response Plan for Chronic Wasting Disease of Free-Ranging and Privately Owned Cervids. The positive farm has been quarantined and, based on the plan, DNR and MDARD will take the following steps:

- Conduct trace investigations to find possible areas of spread.
- Identify deer farms within the 15-mile radius and implement individual herd plans that explain the CWD testing requirements and movement restrictions for each herd. These herds will also undergo a records audit and fence inspection.
- Partner with the USDA on the management of the herd.
- CWD is transmitted directly from one animal to another and indirectly through the environment. Infected animals may display abnormal behavior, progressive weight loss and physical debilitation. To date, there have been no reported cases of CWD infection in humans. However, as a precaution, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend that infected animals not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals.

Since May 2015, when the 1st free-ranging white-tailed CWD positive deer was found in Michigan, the DNR has tested approximately 23 000 deer. Of those tested, as of 6 Dec 2017, 30 cases of CWD have been suspected or confirmed in deer from Clinton, Ingham, Kent and Montcalm counties. This is the 1st year any free-ranging deer were found CWD positive in Montcalm or Kent counties.
