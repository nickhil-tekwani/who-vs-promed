Emergence of the M Phenotype of Erythromycin-Resistant Pneumococci in
South Africa. Carol A. Widdowson and Keith P. Klugman, South African
Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg, South Africa
Erythromycin-resistant pneumococci have been isolated in South Africa
since 1978; however, from 1987 to 1996, resistance to macrolides was
only detected in 270 (2.7%) of 9,868 blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
pneumococcal isolates, most of which were obtained from the public
sector. In South Africa, macrolide use in the public sector is estimated
at 56% of that in the private sector. Most erythromycin-resistant
strains (89%) exhibited resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin
(macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B phenotype). In the United States,
most erythromycin-resistant pneumococci exhibit the newly described M
phenotype (resistance to erythromycin alone), associated with the mefE
gene. The M phenotype in South Africa increased significantly in the
last 10 years, from 1 of 5,115 to 28 of 4,735 of blood and CSF isolates
received from 1987 to 1991 compared with 1992 to 1996 (p = 5x10-7).
These data suggest that, although macrolide resistance in pneumococci
remains low in the public sector, the mefE gene is rapidly emerging in
South Africa.
