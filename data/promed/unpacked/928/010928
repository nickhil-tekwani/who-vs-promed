I was in the process of writing a summary of the DNA fingerprinting work
that has been done on these _M. bovis_ isolates when I received your
e-mail. The summary is as follows:
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used for DNA
fingerprinting of the _Mycobacterium bovis_ isolates from a cow, four
coyotes, two raccoons, three captive white-tailed deer, and 84 free-ranging
white-tailed deer originating from the tuberculosis-affected area of
northeast Michigan. The analysis was done at the USDA, Agricultural
Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa. DNA
digested with restriction endonucleases PvuII and AluI was hybridized,
respectively, with probes specific for IS6110 and with a polymorphic
GC-rich repetitive sequence (PGRS), which is also referred to as pTBN12.
The _M. bovis_
isolates from the cow, coyotes, and raccoons each had a single copy of
IS6110 that was in the same size fragment as the majority of white-tailed
deer isolates. In addition, the RFLP patterns for DNA digested with AluI
and probed with PGRS were identical for all _M. bovis_ isolates from the
cow, coyotes, raccoons, captive white-tailed deer and free-ranging
white-tailed deer. These results suggest that these animals are infected
with a common strain of _M. bovis_.

[Many thanks to Diana for sharing these results with us. Now if someone can
come up with any observations on how raccoons come to be scavenging deer
the account will be complete. - Mod.MHJ
