From: Peter Moorhouse <peterds@gto.net.om>

Only unvaccinated cattle were affected in the Wufra outbreak that commenced
some 3 weeks ago. These cattle had been introduced onto the affected farm
from the southern suburbs of Kuwait. There has been no spread of infection.
Later, an outbreak occurred in younger animals (vaccination history not
known, but they were most probably unvaccinated) on a dairy farm with an
adjoining sheep feedlot. No spread to other groups of cattle, all of which
had been vaccinated. Serology showed high titres of FMD antibody in a
sample of sheep. Spread from sheep to cattle seems certain.
There is considerable movement of sheep in the region (e.g. Turkey/Jordan
to Saudi Arabia then into Kuwait). Currently the Kuwait/Saudi border is
closed to livestock.
Our project manager in Kuwait, David Scharp, a very good man, is strongly
of the opinion that sheep spread FMDV. Disease appears in exposed,
susceptible cattle.

[When the 1967-68 FMD epidemic finished there were some three (?Shropshire)
flocks unslaughtered in which FMD lesions had been found, and I believe
Pirbright recovered virus. The lesions can be modest and easily missed,
especially if foot-rot is prevalent. The flocks were monitored to see what
would happen. It was all on the QT [very quiet and out of public sight. I
cannot remember seeing anything published on them and presumably they were
slaughtered in due course, as per the law. From this account of Kuwait it
would seem that FMD is in constant ebb & flow in the region and the control
programme is merely that. - Mod.MHJ
