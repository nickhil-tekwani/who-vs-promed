Red sea bream iridoviral disease, Japan
---------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 8 Nov 2013 from Dr Toshiro Kawashima, CVO, Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (Final report)
Date of start of the event: 21 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 24 Oct 2013
Report date: 8 Nov 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 8 Nov 2013
Date event resolved: 29 Oct 2013
Reason for notification: Listed disease occurring in new host species
New host species: Scorpion fish (_Inimicus japonicus_)
Causal agent: Red sea bream iridovirus
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Hutami-chou, Hyogo
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Oct 2013
Outbreak status: Resolved (29 Oct 2013)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Water type: Salt water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Scorpion fish (_Inimicus japonicus_) / 1.9 percent / 1.9 percent / 20 000 / 377 / 377 / 0 / 0

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Scorpion fish (_Inimicus japonicus_) / 20 000 / 377 / 377 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Scorpion fish (_Inimicus japonicus_) / 1.89 percent / 1.89 percent / 100 percent / 1.89 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: 1. Regarding the number of animals in the outbreak, the number of cases is described as the same as the number of deaths due to the difficulty to be counted. 2. Red sea bream iridovirus occurred in scorpion fish (juvenile) cultured in indoor pool. 3. The occurrence of red sea bream iridovirus ended with the declining seawater temperature, which was about 20 deg C. According to the Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (2013), outbreaks have been seen mostly in the summer season at water temperatures of 25 deg C and above.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; Tracing back; Surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; Official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; Surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone; Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Research Institute of Aquaculture Fisheries Research Agency (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Scorpion fish (_Inimicus japonicus_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 8 Nov 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Red sea bream iridoviral disease (RSIVD) is caused by infection with red sea bream iridovirus. RSIVD is a significant cause of mortality in farmed red sea bream (_Pagrus major_) and more than 30 other species of cultured marine fish belonging mainly to the orders Perciformes and Pleuronectiformes.

The 1st outbreak of RSIVD was recorded in cultured red sea bream in Shikoku Island, Japan in 1990. Since then, the disease has caused mass mortalities in cultured fish populations in the western part of Japan, mainly among juvenile red sea bream.

Affected fish become lethargic, exhibit severe anaemia, petechiae of the gills, and enlargement of the spleen. The disease is characterised by the appearance of enlarged cells stained deeply with Giemsa solution in the histopathological observations of the spleen, heart, kidney, intestine and gill of infected fish.

The principal mode of transmission of RSIV is horizontal via the water. Vertical transmission of RSIV has not yet been investigated.

A number of general husbandry practices are used to reduce RSIVD-associated losses. These include: introducing pathogen-free fish; implementing hygiene practices on farms; and avoiding practices that can decrease water quality and/or increase stress, such as overcrowding and overfeeding.

Effective formalin-killed commercial vaccine for RSIVD is currently available for red sea bream (_Pagrus major_), striped jack (_Pseudocaranx dentex_), Malabar grouper (_Epinephelus malabaricus_) orange-spotted grouper (_Epinephelus coioides_) and other fish species belonging to the genus Seriola in Japan. Protection of fish belonging to the genus Oplegnathus by vaccination is difficult.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, Chapter 2.3.7 "Red sea bream iridoviral disease," at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.07_RSIVD.pdf.

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to red sea bream iridoviral disease are spelled out in Chapter 10.7 of OIE's Aquatic Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.7.htm.

According to information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist), 113 of 178 OIE Members have provided some information related to red sea bream iridoviral disease (this information is based on the most recent twice-yearly report sent by the countries).

Of these 113 OIE Members, the disease was reported as "never occurred" in 92, "absent" in 15, and as "demonstrated clinical disease" in 6 (Chinese Taipei [Taiwan], Hong Kong [China], Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Singapore).
