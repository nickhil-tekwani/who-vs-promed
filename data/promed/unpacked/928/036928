A man has died with meningococcal disease in Darwin, as the Northern Territory [NT] records its 2nd case of the illness this year [2022]. The man in his 30s, who died on Tuesday [9 Aug 2022], had no recent interstate or international travel, NT Health says. "We send our condolences to this man's friends and family," a spokeswoman said on Friday [12 Aug 2022].

The NT's centre for disease control is providing information and care to the man's close contacts.

The 2nd case was a woman in her 30s from Alice Springs, who was diagnosed in February [2022]. The 2 cases are unlinked.

It comes after a 14-year-old boy in Adelaide [South Australia] was diagnosed with meningococcal on Tuesday [9 Aug 2022]. There have been 9 cases of the disease in South Australia this year, compared with 6 at the same time last year [2021].

A Sydney man in his 40s died with the disease on 4 Aug 2022 after he attended the Splendour in the Grass music festival in Byron Bay [New South Wales (NSW)].There have been 15 cases of meningococcal disease reported in NSW this year.

The NT reported one meningococcal case in 2021. The disease is a rare but serious and sometimes fatal infection. Authorities warn it can develop very quickly and kill within hours.

The bacterium is present in droplets discharged from the nose and throat when coughing or sneezing. Anyone with a suspected meningococcal infection should consider their condition a medical emergency and see a doctor immediately. The main symptoms of meningococcal disease are a red or purple rash, fever, headache, stiffness, light sensitivity, nausea, diarrhoea, drowsiness and confusion.

An Adelaide teenager is in hospital in a stable condition after contracting meningococcal disease. SA [South Australia] Health says the 14-year-old boy has been found to have the B strain of the infection. Nine people who had contact with him are being given precautionary antibiotics.

There have been 9 cases of meningococcal disease in South Australia so far this year [2022] compared with 6 at the same time last year [2021].

[On 13 Aug 2022, ProMED posted a report of 3 people who developed meningococcal disease after attending Splendour in the Grass, an annual music festival held on 22-24 Jul 2022 at the North Byron Parklands in Yelgun, New South Wales (Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (06): (NS) fatal, 3 cases, festival, RFI 20220813.8705018).

It is unlikely that the man in his 30s from Darwin, Northern Territory (NT) is related to the outbreak that developed among those who attended the Splendour in the Grass music festival because the news report above reports the Darwin patient had no recent interstate or international travel, unless the Darwin patient had a very close contact who attended Splendour in the Grass. Also, we have not been told the meningococcal serogroup for the Darwin patient or the serogroup(s) infecting the 3 cases from New South Wales linked to Splendour in the Grass.

As for the 14-year-old from Adelaide, South Australia (SA) with serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease, we are not told of any recent travel or linkage with the Splendour in the Grass music festival.

More information from knowledgeable sources concerning these cases of invasive meningococcal disease in NT, SA, and NSW would be appreciated.

NT is located between the states of Western Australia to the west and Queensland to the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory). Its capital is the city of Darwin (estimated pop., 147 255 in 2019 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory). Adelaide (pop., 1.36 million residents) is the capital city of South Australia. A map of Australia showing the location of these cities can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population. - Mod.ML
