A 10 year old child died due to [a] hantavirus [infection] in Region 8,
according to confirmation by the Institute of Public Health (Instituto de
Salud Publica - ISP). The child, from a rural sector in the Pinto commune,
had been admitted last month [March 2010] in the Clinic Hospital Herminda
Martin de Chillan with serious respiratory problems and died on 29 Apr
[2010]. A week after the death, the ISP confirmed that the cause was due to
infection with the previously mentioned virus, reported Radio Biobio.

According to the latest report issued by the Ministry of Health, this is
the 14th person to die this year [2010] due to the virus [infection]. This
year [2010], the health authorities have stated [that there has been] an
increase in cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) infection.

[Nationally, 30 cases of HPS have been reported, with 10 in the Bio-Bio
region as of 21 Apr 2010 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100427.1357).
Although not mentioned specifically in this report, the hantavirus
responsible for this case is doubtless Andes virus.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_),
the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at
