Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that infects granulocytes. The usual clinical signs and symptoms include nonspecific fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Infection is usually mild or asymptomatic, but severe systemic complications can occur, leading to a need for intensive care and estimated fatality rates of 0.5 percent - 1.0 percent (1,2).

_A. phagocytophilum_ was 1st described in 1932 in Scotland as the causative agent of tick-borne fever in sheep (3). Although some clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis have been reported in Europe, mostly from Slovenia, Sweden, and Poland (4), most cases have occurred in the USA. This difference cannot be explained by the prevalence of the pathogen in ticks or human exposure to the pathogen because the 3 percent prevalence of _A. phagocytophilum_ among _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks in Europe seems to be nearly as high as that among ticks in the USA (2). The median seroprevalence rate for _A. phagocytophilum_ infection among humans in Europe is 6.2 percent, reaching up to 21 percent (2). This incongruence between seroprevalence rate and number of human cases might be associated with underdiagnosis of cases (2), a high rate of asymptomatic disease (5), or cross-reactivities in serologic tests that might lead to overestimation of the seroprevalence rate (5).

In August 2013, an immunocompetent 40-year-old man sought treatment for fever and other nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, and severe headache 3 days after becoming aware of several tick bites received while on a hiking vacation in Scotland. The man had removed the 3 tick nymphs from his legs immediately after their discovery and stored them in a plastic container; they were later sent to the Consultant Laboratory for Tick-borne Encephalitis in Berlin, Germany, for analysis. When the patient returned to Germany, 5 days after the onset of symptoms and 8 days after tick removal, a blood sample was collected (sample 1) and the bite sites were swabbed with a sterile cotton bud. By that time, the fever was gone, but malaise and other symptoms persisted. The patient began taking doxycycline, and within 2 days all symptoms subsided and the patient recovered completely.

A 2nd blood sample was collected 28 days after tick removal (sample 2). Complete blood counts and chemistry panels were performed for both samples. All values were within the reference range except that for lactate dehydrogenase (248 U/L), which was moderately increased over the baseline value of less than 245 U/L in sample 1. Values did not differ substantially between the 2 samples.

DNA from whole-blood samples and swabs was extracted (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and tested for _A. phagocytophilum_, _Babesia spp._, _Borrelia spp._, and _Rickettsia spp._. (Analytik Jena AG; Jena, Germany). DNA extracted from blood and swab samples was negative for all tested pathogens.

After the tick specimens were taxonomically identified as _I. ricinus_, DNA/RNA was extracted (blackPREP Tick DNA/RNA Kit; Analytik Jena AG) and tested for the same pathogens. All 3 ticks were negative for the pathogens except for 2 that were positive for _A. phagocytophilum_. Indirect immunofluorescence assays (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) performed on the paired serum samples revealed an increased _A. phagocytophilum_-specific IgM titer, from 20 at 5 days after symptom onset to 80 at 20 days later; the _A. phagocytophilum_-specific IgG titer rose from a high titer of 800 to greater than 3200 over this period.

The presence and 4-fold increase of specific IgM and IgG in paired serum samples confirmed the diagnosis of human granulocytic anaplasmosis in accordance with CDC criteria (6). As described previously for several cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, patient blood counts were within reference limits, but serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (7). The diagnosis was further corroborated by detection of _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA in 2 of the 3 ticks removed from the patient's skin. PCR amplification failed to detect _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA in the patient's blood, consistent with previous studies documenting frequent lack of _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA detection in whole blood and a substantial drop in PCR positivity after the acute phase of illness (8).

Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is not usually reported in Scotland like it is in the rest of Europe. The case originated from an area with long-established disease occurrence in ruminants, but the literature reports only one case of human infection in southwestern Scotland (9), about 500 km from where this infection was probably acquired. Correct diagnosis would have been difficult had the patient not conserved the ticks and contacted the Consultant Laboratory for Tick-borne Encephalitis immediately after returning to Germany. A large number of human granulocytic anaplasmosis cases might be missed because general practitioners may not be aware of the pathogen's existence or its distribution.

[It continues to be unclear why human granulocytic anaplasmosis is not more commonly diagnosed in Europe. Additionally, my colleague ML has posted regarding a similar organism described in Europe:

"Anaplasmataceae is a family of Gram negative, obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that consists of 6 genetically distinct genera: 1) _Ehrlichia_, _Anaplasma_, and _Neorickettsia_; 2) _Wolbachia_ and _Aegyptianella_, which only infect nematodes, arthropods, or birds; and 3) the newly proposed genus _Candidatus Neoehrlichia_ (http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/48/7/2630). _Candidatus_ is the term used for an interim taxonomic status of noncultivable prokaryotic organisms. _Neoehrlichia_ refers to a new _Ehrlichia_; _mikurensis_ refers to Mikura Island in southern Japan, where the organism was discovered (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1837.long).

"_Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis _ recently was discovered in ticks and wild rodents in East Asia (Japan, China, Russia) and Europe (Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Germany) (http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/48/7/2630). A closely related but distinct species, _Candidatus N. lotoris_, was found in raccoons in North America (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428872). Experimental infection with _Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis_ in rats did not elicit antibodies against _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and _Ehrlichia muris_ antigens (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1837.long), which further supports the position that _Candidatus Neoehrlichia_ is a separate genus.

"_Candidatus N. mikurensis_ has been identified by PCR amplification of its 16S rRNA gene in at least 4 humans in Europe with febrile illnesses that were associated with thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. Several of the infected patients have been immunocompromised (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20220155, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519481, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21353949). - Mod.ML"
