----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this report _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (Chagas disease) is missing from the list of possible causes of megaesophagus. This condition is commonly reported as canine Chagas disease in other regions. _T. cruzi_ and other parasitic trypanosomes have been documented in Australia (https://goo.gl/ftcZej Cambridge University Press and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751905000020).

Serologic testing for _T. cruzi_ specific antibodies is available and would provide data to determine if this organism is involved in these cases.

[Mr. Glass is correct. _Trypanosoma cruzi_ was unintentionally omitted form the list of possible causes of megaesophagus. There may well be other causes, as the list in the previous ProMED-mail posting was not intended to be a totally inclusive list. However, as trypanosomes are scattered widely with much documentation of megaesophagus, it is most appropriate to make sure this parasite is not overlooked. - Mod.TG
