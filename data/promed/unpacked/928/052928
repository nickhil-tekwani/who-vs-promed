Information received on 20 Sep 2013 from Dr Mbargou Lo, Directeur des Services veterinaires, Direction des Services veterinaires, Ministere de l'Elevage, Dakar, Senegal

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 10 Sep 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 12 Sep 2013
Report date: 20 Sep 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 20 Sep 2013
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: December 2012
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Rift Valley fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (advanced), Necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Gueumbeul, Gandon, Rao, Saint-Louis
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Sep 2013
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered
Dorcas gazelle: _Gazella dorcas_ (Bovidae) / 33 / 8 / 3 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Dorcas gazelles kept in a reserve at Gueumbeul in the region of Saint-Louis.

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dorcas gazelle: _Gazella dorcas_ (Bovidae) / 33 / 8 / 3 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Dorcas gazelle: _Gazella dorcas_ (Bovidae) / 24.24 percent / 9.09 percent / 37.5 percent / 9.09 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:
Unknown or inconclusive
Vectors
Epidemiological comment: Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne disease. The winter season, rainy, hot and humid, is the period at risk, favorable to the proliferation of vectors. The date of last detection of the disease in wild species was 2004.

Control measures
Measures applied:
No vaccination
Treatment of affected animals (antibiotic treatment)

Measures to be applied:
Control of arthropods

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Laboratory for Veterinary Research and Livestock (LNERV), Dakar (National laboratory) / Dorcas gazelle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) /12 Sep 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus _Phlebovirus_. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 "Rift Valley fever" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf.

According to Chapter 8.12 on Rift Valley fever of the OIE's Terrestrial Code, countries or zones within the historic distribution of RVF or adjacent to those that are historically infected should be subjected to surveillance.

Epidemics of RVF may occur in infected areas after flooding. They are separated by inter-epidemic periods that may last for several decades in arid areas, and, during these periods, the prevalence of infection in humans, animals, and mosquitoes can be difficult to detect. In the absence of clinical disease, the RVF status of a country or zone within the historically infected regions of the world should be determined by a surveillance programme focusing on mosquitoes and serology of susceptible mammals. The programme should concentrate on parts of the country or zone at high risk because of historical, geographic and climatic factors, ruminant and mosquito population distribution, and proximity to areas where epidemics have recently occurred http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.12.htm.

RVF is a zoonosis (a disease which primarily affects animals but causes disease in humans). Humans are highly susceptible to the RVF virus and may become infected with RVF by being bitten by infected mosquitoes, through contact with blood, other body fluids, or tissues during killing, skinning and cutting of infected animals, or by consumption of raw milk or uncooked meat from infected animals. Humans working in slaughter facilities, laboratories or hospitals are at risk of acquiring infections.

People with RVF will either show no symptoms or develop a mild illness. Signs of illness include fever, weakness, myalgia (muscle pain), back ache, dizziness, liver abnormalities, and weight loss. In some patients, the illness can progress to haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or ocular disease (inflammation of the eye, blindness). Severe complications develop in 1-4 percent of cases, though most people recover within 4-7 days. Approximately one per cent of humans infected with Rift Valley fever die of the disease http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/RVF-EN.pdf.

Information on the RVF situation in OIE Member countries found in the last 6-monthly report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist. Such information shows that during July-December 2012: Clinical disease was reported by 2 countries; Disease was reported as present but "restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s)" in 2 countries; Reported present as "Infection/Infestation in one or more zones" from one country; Reported as "infection was present (with no clinical disease)" in one country, and; Reported as "suspected" in 3 countries.

In the countries where the disease was reported for the period as "absent" (21 countries), most indicate that they have "general surveillance" and maintain "targeted surveillance" in domestic animals. However, for wild animals, only 10 countries maintain "general surveillance," and only 4 of them have "target surveillance. One of these countries was Senegal, where the disease has been indicated as absent in domestic animals since December 2012 and absent in wild animals since 2004; see HANDISTATUS http://web.oie.int/hs2/sit_mald_freq_pl.asp?c_cont=1&c_mald=9.

Information obtained from OIE's WAHID database indicates that since 2011 to date (September 2013), 141 outbreaks were reported officially in the area: Mauritania (3), Namibia (3), South Africa (134) and Senegal (1), the most recent case.
