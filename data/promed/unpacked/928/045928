[ref: Q Qiao, et al. Serological and molecular detection of viruses infecting sweet potato in China. Acta Phytopathologica Sinica 2012; 42: 10-16]
--------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 176 symptomatic samples were collected from 18 provinces of China in 2009 and 2010 and analysed by serological, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing methods.

Serological detection results indicated that _Sweet potato feathery mottle virus_ (SPFMV) was the most common, being found in 56 per cent of samples, followed by _Sweet potato virus G_ (SPVG) and _Sweet potato caulimo-like virus_ (SPCaLV) in 34 and 33.5 per cent of the samples, respectively.

PCR and nucleotide sequencing showed that at least 8 viruses including SPFMV, SPVG, _Sweet potato latent virus_ (SPLV), _Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus_ (SPCFV), _Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus_ (SPCSV), _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV), _Sweet potato vein mosaic virus_ (SPVMV) and _Sweet potato leaf curl virus_ (SPLCV) infect sweet potato in China.

_Sweet potato mild mottle virus_ (SPMMV) was not detected in the samples by serological and RT-PCR methods. It was uncertain if _Sweet potato mild speckling virus_ (SPMSV) and C-6 virus were present in the samples.

[Sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_) is a major food crop in many tropical and subtropical regions. Virus diseases are one of the main constraints for cultivation of the crop. Multiple viral infections are common in field plants with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement) resulting in dramatic increase of symptom severity.

Some of the viruses known to affect sweet potato are: _Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus_ (SPCSV, genus _Crinivirus_); _Sweet potato feathery mottle virus_ (SPFMV), _Sweet potato latent virus_, and _Sweet potato mild speckling virus_ (all genus _Potyvirus_); _Sweet potato mild mottle virus_ (genus _Ipomovirus_); _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (genus _Cucumovirus_); Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus and C-6 virus (both putative members of the genus _Carlavirus_). Co-infection of SPCSV with SPFMV results in sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) which is an important problem, for example in Africa, with a reported yield reduction of up to 60 per cent. Synergistic diseases involving some of the other viruses have also been reported, and an experimental yield increase of at least 40 per cent has been observed in tested virus-free cultivars of sweet potato. The epidemiology of the synergistic viruses and their respective vectors will necessarily be highly complex.

In addition to the viruses reported so far, further viruses (possibly including new species) can be expected to exist due to the predominantly vegetative propagation of this crop which increases the risk of a build-up of viruses. Virus-free planting material is essential but needs to be provided to farmers regularly since "clean" plants may become infected in the field.

National surveys like the one reported here are important tools. They provide valuable information for managing national agriculture to increase food security, as well as for national and international biosecurity. The data also contribute to the knowledge of individual pathogens and their epidemiology.
