Hunters in New Jersey are experiencing what West Virginia's hunters
experienced 2 years ago.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, commonly called EHD or "bluetongue,"
hit the Garden State [New Jersey] hard late this summer [2011]. [EHD
is in the same family as bluetongue disease but the diseases are
antigenically different. - Mod.TG] Enough dead deer were lying around
that local residents could easily smell the stench. Now hunters are
having to work really, really hard to find deer.

A hunt in the state's Great Dismal Swamp Wildlife Refuge yielded less
than half as many whitetails as in recent years. Sportsmen bagged just
42 deer, far less than the 121 killed last year [2010].

EHD is caused when disease-carrying insects known as midges (we call
'em gnats) [also called, no-see 'ums - Mod.TG] bite the deer. When
deer contract the disease, they usually die. Mortality rates sometimes
reach 90 percent.

West Virginia's EHD outbreak was bad, but not nearly as bad as New
Jersey's. The Mountain State [West Virginia] epizootic (epidemic among
animals) was made worse because it was followed by a severe mast
failure. [Mast is a term referring to vegetation, especially the fruit
of what ever vegetation is discussed. In the case of an oak tree it
would be acorns. - Mod.TG] Deer that survived the disease went into
the winter dramatically weakened, and a hard winter finished off many
of those that survived.

Fortunately for West Virginia's herd, the mast failure of 2009 was
followed by a bumper mast crop in 2010. Deer easily survived a
relatively mild winter and enjoyed outstanding reproduction this past
spring [2011]. Hunters should reap the benefits Monday [21 Nov 2011],
when the state's firearm season for bucks opens.

[The epizootic hemorrhagic disease situation has been ongoing for some
time. Cases began being noticed in late August 2011 and were making
the news by September. The Game and Fish department posted official
notices in October. So this is not a new situation.
