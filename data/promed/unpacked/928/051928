A farm in Finnoy in Rogaland, Norway has been quarantined after a
veterinarian notified health officials of a suspected case of foot and
mouth disease (FMD). Test samples have been taken and will be sent to
Denmark for analysis.
District veterinarian Erling Bleie has asked people to restrict unnecessary
travel to the area as a precautionary measure against spreading the disease
in case the tests are positive. As a note of hope Bleie added that he hoped
and believed the case would prove to be a false alarm.
