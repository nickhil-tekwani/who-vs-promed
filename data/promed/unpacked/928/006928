A case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed in Bariloche. The individual is a 22-year-old young man who is hospitalized in an intensive care unit and remains in stable condition.

While concern about the increasing coronavirus infections is growing, in the traditional city of Bariloche, a registered a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] set off alarms for the for local authorities.

The classical tourist district in Patagonia is the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Rio Negro [province], according to the latest report, 122 deaths, 1333 active cases, and 8007 recoveries have been registered.

In the midst of this dramatic panorama, a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed. The individual is a 22-year-old young man who is currently hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the local hospital after having registered the 1st symptoms this past 31 Dec [2020] and remains in stable condition.

Given this situation, the local health authorities carried out an epidemiological investigation to determine the place where the infection was contracted: a place near Lago Gutierrez, a camp in Camallo, and another area of Lago Mascardi are possible scenarios of the infection. The family of the young man remains in isolation for 45 days to avoid transmission of the disease [to other people].

Facing the 1st registered [case] of [a] hantavirus [infection] of the year [2021], the municipality of San Carlos de Bariloche recommended an increase in careful measures in order to avoid virus infection transmitted by the long-tailed mouse through its fecal material or urine that disseminates this viral disease.

The most common way that transmission occurs is in contaminated places, open or closed, although it can be transmitted by the bite of an [infected] rodent or by direct contact with an infected person.

The initial symptoms are similar to those of a cold, including fever, muscle pain, and abdominal pain. In any case, the most characteristic symptoms are shortness of breath similar to pneumonia that may progress to respiratory insufficiency and can cause death.

[The hantavirus responsible for this case is not mentioned. Cases of hantavirus infection have occurred before in Rio Negro province. Cases of hantavirus infection with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from various parts of Argentina in recent years. As noted in ProMED archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (in western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Marciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_); Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina; in the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba (in _O. forensi_); and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. chaoensis_). There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these cases in the province, but Andes virus is very likely. - Mod.TY
