[A map showing both outbreaks is appended to the report at the source URL. The outbreak in the Amur oblast, adjacent to China's border, is not surprising. This FMD virus strain, serotype A, topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Sea-97, has been spreading in China since early 2013. It was genotyped at the WRLFMD (see http://tinyurl.com/ppqqkuo).

A media report on the mentioned outbreaks is available at http://www.itar-tass.com/c9/791632.html (thanks to Sabine Zentis).

The outbreak in Krasnodar is of concern to neighbouring regions (the Middle East and Eastern Europe); it is the 3rd outbreak in this area. In a previous OIE notification, wild, cloven-hoofed animals were mentioned as a possible source of infection in Karachay-Cherkess, adjacent to the border with Georgia. Further information including species involved and clinical data were requested (see 20130618.1780183).

The reported absence of clinical cases among susceptible, exposed sheep, goats, and swine is interesting. Has subclinical infection been ruled out?

Spread of the same virus strain from China to Kazakhstan was suspected, but the Kazakh authorities have, so far, not published the serotyping and genotyping results of the circulating virus. The All-Russian Research Institute of Animal Health (ARRIAH) in Vladimir, Russia is the lead veterinary research facility in Russia and the designated location for FMD monitoring, research, and vaccine development. Additionally, it is an OIE Collaborating Center for FMD. ARRIAH has a collection of approximately 550 field isolates of FMD strains, many of which are from critical regions of interest, such as the Middle East, as well as countries which border Russia and/or have been part of the previous soviet block in the Caucasus region and central Asia, such as Kazakhstan. ARRIAH's impressive diagnostic and research facility is capable of identifying new FMD strains and of genotyping them, addressing domestic as well as susceptible wild species. Hopefully, results of such tests will become accessible, following the exemplary transparency applied by the world reference laboratory for FMD (Pirbright). - Mod.AS
