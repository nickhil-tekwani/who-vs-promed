Scientists: One person likely source of malaria outbreak
-------------------------------------
3 Loudoun County teenagers who contracted malaria in 2002 were sickened by
parasites with matching genetic fingerprints, making it virtually certain
that one person was the source of the infections, scientists have
determined. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta also
found that the strain of malaria-causing parasite, called _Plasmodium
vivax_, found in the 3 originated in Central or South America. Health
officials say the test results mean the rare malaria outbreak was probably
just bad luck, not a symptom of a pervasive problem.
"It's not like there were a whole bunch of people infected ... that then
infected other residents," said John Barnwell, a senior biological research
scientist with the CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases, who headed the
research. "It was a single source and a little outbreak." Scientists and
health officials say it's likely that one or more mosquitoes bit a local
resident who had returned from a trip to Latin America--or bit an immigrant
from that area--and then bit and infected the teenagers, who spent time
outdoors near eastern Loudoun's Sugarland Run neighborhood during the same
several weeks last summer.
One of the key mysteries of the outbreak was why the third patient
contracted malaria in March, 6 months after the first 2, who became ill
shortly after the time they recalled having been bitten repeatedly by
mosquitoes.
Although local officials had assumed that the 3 were exposed to malaria at
the same time, there was a possibility that the third patient was infected
over the winter, which raised the specter of malaria-carrying mosquitoes
surviving the usual kill-off caused by freezing weather.
"Knowing that teenager was infected last summer was very reassuring," said
David Goodfriend, director of Loudoun's health department. Malaria
specialists say it is possible for the parasite to essentially hide out in
a patient's liver for months before attacking, though that is unusual.
Although the teenagers were infected with a comparatively mild strain of
malaria, the illness included "4 days of fever, nausea, vomiting, malaise,
and nosebleeds" and a fever of 105 degrees for one of the patients, a CDC
study said. All were treated successfully.
The genetic findings still don't explain exactly why several pools of
mosquitoes tested positive for malaria in 2002 in Loudoun and Montgomery
counties, and whether more will be found this summer.

[ProMED reported extensively on the outbreak last autumn. It is reassuring
that the patients were infected from a single source, and it is unlikely
that malaria parasites have survived either in patients or mosquitoes over
the winter. - Mod.EP]
