Rains spawn head scab outbreak in Kansas wheat
-----------------------------------------------
Untimely rains have spawned an epidemic of the fungal disease head
scab in winter wheat fields in Kansas, reducing yields and quality
just as harvest gets under way in the state, industry experts say.

"Based on past yield loss estimates, this is going to represent a
total loss to Kansas wheat production of 1 or 2 percent," said Erick
DeWolf, a plant pathologist at Kansas State University. The last head
scab epidemic in Kansas was in 1993, and this year's outbreak is
definitely in that category, he said. Worst hit are fields in eastern
Kansas, where the incidence of the disease is between 10 and 20
percent, DeWolf said. That could mean yield losses in some of those
fields of 40 to 50 percent.

Those most affected are Neosho, Labette and Cherokee counties in
southeast Kansas, said Bill Spiegel, spokesman for Kansas Wheat. But
head scab is far less prevalent in the major wheat production
counties in the state. In south-central Kansas, the disease incidence
is between 2 and 5 percent, with more fields tending toward the upper
end of that range, he said. In central Kansas, the incidence of the
disease is similar, but more fields tend to the lower end of that
range, he said.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also known as scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Current names of the
fungi mentioned above are _Gibberella zeae_, _Fusarium poae_,
_Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_, and _Microdochium majus_.

FHB causes yield losses of up to 45 percent, reduces the grade of
harvested grain, and it may also contaminate the grain with fungal
toxins. FHB is favoured by humid conditions during flowering and
early stages of kernel development. Symptoms are premature bleaching
of infected spikelets and the production of orange, spore-bearing
structures at the base of the glumes. During wet weather, there may
be whitish, occasionally pinkish, fluffy fungal growth on infected
heads in the field. Diseased spikelets can contain visibly affected kernels.

FHB can also affect barley, oats, rye, maize and some grasses.
Pathogens affecting these hosts may be different phylogenetic species
or strains which are often limited to particular regions of the
world. Disease management includes timely fungicide applications and
crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.
