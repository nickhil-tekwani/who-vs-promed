Drug resistant strains of tuberculosis are taking hold in parts of China,
India, Africa and the former Soviet Union and threatening other nations,
the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Friday.
Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB) cases -- which are unaffected by the most
powerful anti-TB drugs isoniazid and rifampicin -- jumped in Estonia from
13.5 percent in 1997 to 18.1 percent one year later.
Cases of MDR TB have also risen at alarming rates in Latvia, Iran,
Mozambique, Uganda and in Henan and Shandong provinces in China, Tamil Nadu
State in India, and [in the Ivanovo and Tomsk Oblasts in Russia. "These
increases pose tremendous problems for national control programmes," Dr.
Mario Raviglione, of the WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme, told a news
conference.
A new WHO report on the airborne illness that kills more adults than any
other infectious disease warned that if these super deadly strains
continued to flourish in developing countries, the consequences would also
be felt in wealthier nations.
Raviglione said border screening for TB as people entered and left
countries was not the answer. The only way to solve the problem was better
control in high-prevalence nations.
