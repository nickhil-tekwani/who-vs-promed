Monkeypox Outbreak Shows Smallpox Vaccine Works
-----------------------------------------------
A 2003 outbreak of monkeypox in the United States has helped prove
that smallpox vaccinations can protect for decades, U.S. researchers
said on Monday [8 Aug 2005]. The study could help officials trying to
come up with a plan for mass-vaccination against the often deadly
smallpox virus and its relatives, should such a virus ever be used in
a biological attack.
The researchers found 3 people who were evidently infected by the
monkeypox virus, spread mostly by pet prairie dogs in the Midwest,
who never had any symptoms. The 3 had last been vaccinated against
smallpox before the jabs were discontinued. One was vaccinated 13
years ago, another 29 years ago and the third 48 years ago. "These
individuals were unaware that they had been infected, because they
were spared any recognizable disease symptoms," Mark Kenneth Slifka,
of Oregon Health & Sciences University, and colleagues wrote in their
report, published in the journal Nature Medicine [see below].
"Together, this shows that the U.S. monkeypox outbreak was larger
than previously realized and, more importantly, shows that
cross-protective antiviral immunity against West African monkeypox
can potentially be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination."
Smallpox was eradicated in 1979 after a global vaccination program.
But experts fear the virus or a related virus could be used as a
biological weapon. About half the U.S. adult population has been
vaccinated as part of routine efforts that stopped in 1972 for
civilians and 1990 for the military. Studies have shown that immunity
lasts as long as 75 years.
Now work is underway to stockpile doses of vaccine in case of an
attack, while tests are also underway to see whether perhaps some
people might be protected by their old vaccinations. But no one has
been able to do a real test of how well the vaccine protects, until
the monkeypox outbreak, traced to pet rodents imported from West
Africa, where the close relative of smallpox is well entrenched and
still common.
The team tested 44 people from Wisconsin, the epicenter of the
outbreak, which originated at a pet store in Illinois. At least 39
people were reported infected with monkeypox in Wisconsin, they said.
"We screened subjects and included in the study only those who had
close contact with monkeypox-infected individuals or
monkeypox-infected prairie dogs," they wrote. They found 3 people who
had clear evidence of infection in their blood, yet never showed any
symptoms of monkeypox. All had been previously vaccinated against
smallpox.
They also found that the monkeypox viruses spread even without direct
contact, something to be aware of should there ever be a smallpox
attack. "A common misconception of the U.S. monkeypox outbreak is
that infection requires direct contact or direct inoculation through
scratches or bites in order for infected prairie dogs to transmit
monkeypox to humans," the researchers wrote. But the virus apparently
can be carried in the air and by tiny sneezed droplets. "In one case,
a subject contracted monkeypox after an infected prairie dog was
carried into her home when she was not present. The prairie dog was
apparently not placed on the floor or furniture, and yet this
subject, who had no contact with prairie dogs or other individuals
with monkeypox, contracted the disease," they wrote.

[The report in Nature Medicine referred to above was published online
on Sun 7 Aug 2005:
<http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nm1273.html>.
The report is entitled "Multiple diagnostic techniques identify
previously vaccinated individuals with protective immunity against
monkeypox" by Erika Hammarlund and 9 others at the Vaccine and Gene
Therapy Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton,
Oregon 97006, USA. The Abstract states that "Approximately 50 percent
of the US population received smallpox vaccinations before routine
immunization ceased in 1972 for civilians and in 1990 for military
personnel. Several studies have shown long-term immunity after
smallpox vaccination, but skepticism remains as to whether this will
translate into full protection against the onset of
orthopoxvirus-induced disease. The US monkeypox outbreak of 2003
provided the opportunity to examine this issue. Using independent and
internally validated diagnostic approaches with 95 percent
sensitivity and 90 percent specificity for detecting clinical
monkeypox infection, we identified 3 previously unreported cases of
monkeypox in preimmune individuals at 13, 29 and 48 years after
smallpox vaccination. These individuals were unaware that they had
been infected because they were spared any recognizable disease
symptoms. Together, this shows that the US monkeypox outbreak was
larger than previously realized and, more importantly, shows that
cross-protective antiviral immunity against West African monkeypox
can potentially be maintained for decades after smallpox vaccination."
In similar vein, Yvette Edghill-Smith et al., in an article published
in Nature Medicine on 1 Jul 2005 (Nature Medicine 11, 740-747),
concluded from experiments using a Rhesus macaque model of infection
with monkeypox virus that: "Smallpox vaccine-induced antibodies are
necessary and sufficient for protection against monkeypox virus."
These findings are not unexpected in that vaccinia virus (i.e.
smallpox vaccine) and 21 other orthopoxviruses share the same
inventory of 90 essential genes for infection and multiplication in
cells, see: Upton, C., Slack, S., Hunter, A. L., Ehlers, A. & Roper,

essential poxvirus genome. Journal of Virology, 77, 7590 - 7600,
