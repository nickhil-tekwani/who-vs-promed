The state is warning Alaskans about the risk of eating fish not properly refrigerated or preserved. According to a state of Alaska epidemiology bulletin, 7 patients this summer [2019] were diagnosed with scombroid poisoning.

The bulletin says bacterial overgrowth causes scombrotoxin to develop when fish isn't properly cooled. The fish may have a peppery, sharp, "bubbly", or salty taste.

Symptoms of scombroid poisoning can start within 10 minutes to an hour after eating contaminated fish, according to the state. It often goes under-reported because it presents like an allergy. According to the bulletin symptoms include flushing of the face and upper body, a severe headache, palpitations, itching, blurred vision, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. The symptoms usually clear up within 12 hours but could last for a couple of days; extreme cases could require hospitalization.

Patients who the state says were treated for scombroid poisoning reported eating salmon, catfish, and single-serving foil packets of tuna. Salmon are not usually associated with scombroid poisoning; more often it is found in species like tuna, bonito, mackerel, and other saltwater darker-meat fish like mahi-mahi.

The state says to avoid scombroid toxicity fish should be quickly and consistently cooled before eating to prevent bacterial overgrowth, it cannot be destroyed by freezing, cooking, smoking, curing, or canning.

Abstract
--------
"Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families, Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (such as, tuna, mackerel, bonito), are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term, "scombroid fish poisoning", to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions cheeses, especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 h. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid, histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on insuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk."

Abstract
--------
"Scombroid poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning, is an allergy-like form of food poisoning that continues to be a major problem in seafood safety. The exact role of histamine in scombroid poisoning is not straightforward. Deviations from the expected dose-response have led to the advancement of various possible mechanisms of toxicity, none of them proven. Histamine action levels are used in regulation until more is known about the mechanism of scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning and histamine are correlated but complicated. Victims of scombroid poisoning respond well to antihistamines, and chemical analyses of fish implicated in scombroid poisoning generally reveal elevated levels of histamine. Scombroid poisoning is unique among the seafood toxins since it results from product mishandling rather than contamination from other trophic levels. Inadequate cooling following harvest promotes bacterial histamine production and can result in outbreaks of scombroid poisoning. Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning. Laboratory methods and screening methods for detecting histamine are available in abundance but need to be compared and validated to harmonize testing. Successful field testing, including dockside or on-board testing needed to augment HACCP efforts will have to integrate rapid and simplified detection methods with simplified and rapid sampling and extraction. Otherwise, time-consuming sample preparation reduces the impact of gains in detection speed on the overall analysis time."
