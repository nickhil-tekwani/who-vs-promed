Grant County Health District (GCHD) staff are investigating 3 laboratory confirmed cases and 210 people that came in contact with ill individuals with whooping cough (pertussis) in Mattawa and Quincy, WA. No one has been hospitalized.

"We are responding to a cluster of whooping cough cases among migrant farm workers near Mattawa and Quincy. Because of a large number of exposed and ill individuals in a very well-defined area, we are considering this a local outbreak," states Dr. Alexander Brzezny, Grant County Health Officer. He adds, "Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority. We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated and urge parents to vaccinate infants and children if they are not up to date." More cases related to this location are likely.

In an effort to control the spread of the disease, the Grant County Health Officer has recommended antibiotics for a defined number of individuals who have come into close contact, been housed with, or transported together with the ill individuals. Antibiotics are not recommended to the general public. The highest priority is given to those who come in contact with children under 12 months of age, to pregnant women and those with certain lung conditions. A pertussis (Tdap) shot is recommended for all who are not up to date, especially those who work, live, or have recently visited Mattawa or Quincy.

Between 3 and 7 Jul 2014, 210 patients received antibiotics. Also, a pertussis (Tdap) shot will be offered to all the workers. The vaccine reduces a chance that a person will become sick with pertussis.

In Grant County, there were 56 cases of pertussis in 2013 and 11 cases so far in 2014.

Officials with Virginia's Peninsula Health District received no reports of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, during the 1st 4 months this year [2014], but received 5 reports of the illness in the last 2 months, a state health official said Tue 8 Jul 2014.

According to Dr. Nzinga Teule-Hekima, health director for the Virginia Department of Health's Peninsula Health District, those 5 cases are still under investigation and have not been categorized as confirmed. The Peninsula Health District includes James City, York, Poquoson, Williamsburg and Newport News. Hampton has its own health department. "These are provisional reports that have to go through all these different check marks to be confirmed," Teule-Hekima explained.

The VDH reported that Virginia saw 418 cases of pertussis reported in 2013, 55 of which were located in the Peninsula Health District. In 2012, 625 cases were reported in Virginia, including 30 in the Peninsula Health District. Nationally, according to the CDC, about 24 231 cases of pertussis were reported provisionally in the USA in 2013 and 48 277 in 2012.

While a case is being investigated, Teule-Hekima said the VDH district offices will circulate letters within their specific jurisdictions, through places like schools and churches, to let people know it may be present without identifying the specific source due to privacy concerns.

"Our whole point is to protect public health and make sure that people have the information they need," she said.

One person has died, and nearly 10 times as many people have been diagnosed with whooping cough in Riverside County in 2014 compared to 2013. The number has spiked to 148 county residents infected with the contagious bacterial disease as of late June 2014. Five of those cases have been in the Coachella Valley. Only 15 Riverside County residents had been diagnosed with pertussis, or "whooping cough," at this time last year [2013], county health officials said.

"We need people in the general public to be aware it is circulating in their communities and to contact their health care provider if they're feeling sick and think it's pertussis or know they've had exposure to someone with pertussis," said Barbara Cole, director of disease control for the Riverside County Department of Public Health.

The numbers reflect a statewide epidemic putting infants, the elderly and others with compromised immune systems at risk. The state Pertussis Report for June 2014 shows there have been reported outbreaks at elementary, middle and high schools at counties throughout California, according to the California Department of Public Health. The number of cases throughout California is roughly 4558 in 2014, more than the 2532 that were reported in all of 2013. A total of 142 patients have been hospitalized, and 20 percent required intensive care.

The Vermont Health Department says Windham County is experiencing a rise in whooping cough (pertussis) cases. There was a total of 11 confirmed cases of whooping cough during the month of June 2014. Ten of the cases were among children ages 3 to 17, and one was an adult. In July 2014, 5 more suspected cases were discovered. The Health Department says all but one of the confirmed and suspected cases are from Brattleboro.

"Anyone who has a persistent cough should be evaluated by his or her health care provider," said Susan Schoenfeld, deputy state epidemiologist for infectious disease. "People with suspected or confirmed pertussis should stay away from others until 5 days of antimicrobial therapy have been completed. We ask anyone with coughing illness to stay away from infants, and we recommend that pregnant women get vaccinated to pass some protection on to their newborn."

The Health Department says cases occurred as schools were closing or had closed for the summer.

The South Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 51 pertussis cases statewide in 2014. The majority are in Lawrence County, which has 17 confirmed cases. Ziebach County has 4 confirmed cases. Pennington, Custer, Butte, and Shannon counties have 3 or fewer cases.

3/4ths of confirmed cases are children under 15, 1/4th of whom were not vaccinated, according to State Epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger.

The Department of Health is urging those who still need to be vaccinated to contact local health providers.

[It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.

A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.

During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.

In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.

An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
