Since September [2017], Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX). The monkeypox National Technical Working Group (TWG) has been monitoring cases and strengthening preparedness/response capacity.

A total of 46 suspected cases has been reported between [1 Jan and 30 Apr 2022.] Of the suspected cases, 15 were confirmed from 7 states - Adamawa (3), Lagos (3), Cross River (2), FCT (2), Kano (2), Delta (2) and Imo (1) - but no death has been recorded.

The 10 new suspected cases in April [2022] were reported from 7 states - Bayelsa (3), Lagos (2), Kano (1), FCT (1), Delta (1), Edo (1) and Ogun (1).

The 5 new positive cases in April [2022] were confirmed from 4 states - Lagos (2), FCT (1), Kano (1) and Delta (1).

From September [2017] to [30 Apr 2022], a total of 558 suspected cases have been reported from 32 states in the country.

Of the reported cases, 241 (43.2%) have been confirmed in 22 states - Rivers (52), Bayelsa (43), Lagos (33), Delta (31), Cross River (16), Edo (10), Imo (9), Akwa Ibom (7), Oyo (6), FCT (8), Enugu (4), Abia (3), Plateau (3), Adamawa (3), Nasarawa (2), Benue (2), Anambra (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Ebonyi (1), Niger (1) and Ogun (1)

[The above report provides an overview of monkeypox (MPX) cases in Nigeria over the past 5 years. As noted in the comment in a previous ProMED post (Monkeypox - Africa (01): Nigeria 20220112.8700812), the monkeypox virus continues to be transmitted to people in Nigeria. The sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases have been widely distributed involving several states in Nigeria.

There is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so the continued occurrence of cases can be expected. A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently, but deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area would be a challenge.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 10-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is comparatively low. - Mod.TY
