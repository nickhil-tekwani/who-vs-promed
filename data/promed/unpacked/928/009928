Tomatoes Blamed in Salmonella Outbreak
-------------------
Pennsylvania health authorities released results of a study Fri, 23 Jul
2004 indicating that Roma tomatoes were the likely cause of a salmonella
outbreak that has sickened more than 280 people in 5 states.
No tests have pinpointed the cause, but food histories of those who ate at
Sheetz convenience stores and got sick -- and those who ate there and
didn't get sick -- indicate that the tomatoes were the likely source, said
Richard McGarvey, a spokesman for the state Health Department.
The Food and Drug Administration said Fri, 23 Jul 2004, that 289 people
from Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia have been
sickened since 2 Jul 2004.
Hundreds of samples of tomatoes and lettuce from Sheetz have been tested.
Only tests on an unopened bag of tomatoes were positive for salmonella, but
not the strain responsible for the recent outbreak.
On Fri, 23 Jul 2004, state officials said they were testing additional food
samples, but McGarvey cautioned that it would not be not unusual if the
direct cause were not found. "What often happens is that what's been
contaminated is used up," McGarvey said.
Those who got sick ingested a strain of salmonella usually found on
produce, and all those sickened in Pennsylvania bought sandwiches from one
of at least 16 Sheetz stores, company officials have said.
"The results announced today, Fri, 23 Jul 2004, reinforce that it is safe
to eat at Sheetz," said Steve Sheetz, chairman of the Altoona-based
company, in a statement Fri night, 23 Jul 2004. He added that the company
removed the tomatoes before being asked to do so by the health department.
The supplier of the Roma tomatoes, Wheeling, W.Va.-based Coronet Foods, has
said that tests turned up no contamination at its processing plant, but
suspended purchasing and processing of the tomatoes.
