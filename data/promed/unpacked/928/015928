Local dogs get disease people can catch
---------------------------------------
5 dogs in Marin County have recently been diagnosed with a potentially
serious disease that can be transmitted to humans, according to Marin
County health officer, Dr Fred Schwartz. Schwartz said the dogs have a
bacterial disease called leptospirosis. He said it is endemic to many areas
in California, but it is unusual that 5 dogs were diagnosed with it in a 2
week period. He said the California Department of Health Services is going
to work with the county to try to determine the source of the disease.
"At this point we're mainly interested in learning some more about the 5
canine cases. Where have the dogs been? Where do they get their recreation?
This can be a serious infection," Schwartz said. According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), leptospirosis in humans can cause
symptoms such as vomiting, chills, headache, and fever. If left untreated,
it can cause kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory
distress, and in rare instances, death. The disease can also be fatal in
dogs and can cause symptoms such as lack of appetite, lethargy, and diarrhea.
Leptospirosis is transmitted through water contaminated with infected
urine. According to a CDC report, "This may happen by swallowing the
contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal
surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin."
Schwartz said that cases of leptospirosis in humans are very uncommon, and
though the state health department often becomes involved when clusters of
disease occur, it shouldn't be cause for too much alarm. "Vets are going to
see leptospirosis from time to time, and there are cases that will occur in
clusters. It doesn't always mean there's an outbreak," Schwartz said. But a
CDC report labels leptospirosis a "reemerging infectious disease in
California." The report indicates that there were 61 human cases of the
disease between 1981 and 2001. 12 of those cases occurred within the last 5
years of that period, meaning, according to the report, cases are "on the
rise". It also said that most of those who contracted leptospirosis did not
get it from their pets but from recreational activities in contaminated
fresh water.
Schwartz said that anyone whose pet is showing signs of the disease should
contact a veterinarian. He said that the best ways to avoid catching it
from a pet are frequent hand washing, avoiding direct contact with animal
secretions, and wearing gloves.

[Although this article states that leptospirosis is endemic to California
and that CDC regards it as a re-emerging disease, the presence of a cluster
like this is unusual. It is even more unusual that the source has not yet
been identified. - Mod.TG]
