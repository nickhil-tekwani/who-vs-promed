At Hafeznagar village in Shibalaya upazila of the district, 4 people, including a couple, died of an unknown disease in the last 2 weeks. The victims are a 40-year-old woman, her husband age 45 years, the woman's mother of 55 years, and a neighbour, a man 36-years-old. The neighbor and the woman died at Dhaka Community Hospital on 28 and 29 Mar [2013]. The mother died on way to Dhaka on 28 Mar [2013], while the husband died at Monno General Hospital in Manikganj on 14 Mar [2013], family sources said.

Shibalaya Upazila Health and Family Planning Officer Dr MA Halim Mollah quoted Prof Abdul Alim, head of medicine department at Dhaka Community Hospital, as saying that the woman and the neighbor died of viral encephalitis. However, Manikganj Civil Surgeon Dr Siddheswar Majumder said they are yet to identify the disease [the disease per se or the etiology of the disease?].

The man's daughter age 7 years, and the wife's son age 14, are suffering from the same disease. They are now receiving treatment at their respective houses. Dr Benazir Ahmed, Director (disease control) of the Health Directorate, arrived here yesterday [30 Mar 2013]. He will visit the 2 ailing children and talk to the family members, the civil surgeon said.

While visiting the village yesterday, the husband's brother told this correspondent that husband started vomiting on 10 Mar [2013] and took medicine from a local medicine shop. As his condition deteriorated on 13 Mar [2013], he was admitted to Shibalaya Upazila Health Complex on 13 Mar and then shifted to Monno General Hospital in Manikganj where he died on 14 Mar, the brother added.

The wife and their daughter Nargis fell sick after the husband's death. The wife's mother, who was caring for her daughter and granddaughter, also got sick. She was taken to Shibalaya Upazila Health Complex on 26 Mar [2013] and shifted to Manikganj Sadar Hospital the same day. She was referred to a hospital in Dhaka but died on the way to the capital on 28 Mar [2013].

The wife and her daughter were taken to Shibalaya Upazila Health Complex on 27 Mar [2013]. They were shifted to Dhaka Community Hospital on 28 Mar [2013] where the wife died on 29 Mar.

The neighbor was admitted to Manikganj Sadar Hospital on 26 Mar [2013] and shifted to Dhaka Community Hospital on 28 Mar. He died at the hospital the same day, said his wife.

[It is difficult to know what caused this cluster of cases. It is not clear if all were diagnosed with encephalitis or not, nor is the cause of the disease mentioned. If it is a cluster of encephalitis cases, it is too early in the season for Japanese encephalitis virus or enterovirus infections. They usually occur in northeastern India and Bangladesh June through October. Encephalitis from Nipah virus infections is well known in Bangladesh, occurs during the same season as these cases, but was not mentioned as a possible cause. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information about these cases and any new ones that might occur. - Mod.TY
