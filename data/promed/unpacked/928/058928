I suspect the disease being described is a fibromatosis due to squirrel
fibroma virus rather than a myxomatosis due to myxoma virus. Has there been
confirmation by virus isolation and characterisation? We would be very
interested if it does turn out to be myxomatosis due to myxoma virus.
Woodchucks (_Marmota monax_) are susceptible to squirrel fibroma virus and
domestic rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) can be infected experimentally,
although the lesions induced in the latter experiments were minor. As
squirrel fibroma virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes and is suspected to
be transmitted by the squirrel flea, this could be a means of transmission
to other squirrels, woodchucks, and possibly rabbits in animal shelters or
other refuges. If affected animals are held in captivity, suitable
precautions should be taken such as de-fleaing affected animals and housing
them in mosquito-proof enclosures.
