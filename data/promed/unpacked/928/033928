How Would India Handle an Ebola Outbreak?
------------------------------------------
Fri 17 Oct 2014: (WSJ) On Thu [16 Oct 2014], India's Health Ministry said it would start conducting mock drills simulating treatment for a potentially infected patient, after a meeting with state health officials to assess the country's preparedness...

The country's huge and densely-packed population, often rudimentary public healthcare system, and lack of adequate sanitation each pose challenges to the containment of a disease like Ebola, health experts say. Combined, they could make it uncontrollable.

"An outbreak in Europe or North America would quickly be brought under control. I am more worried about the many people from India who work in trade or industry in West Africa," virologist Peter Piot, the man who helped identify the Ebola virus in 1976, was quoted as saying by German news magazine Der Spiegel in an interview published in September 2014.

Around 4700 Indians live in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Another 40 000 live in Nigeria, where 8 people have died after 20 cases of Ebola were detected.

"It would only take one of them to become infected, travel to India to visit relatives during the virus' incubation period and then, once he becomes sick, go to a public hospital there," Dr. Piot, who is director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was quoted as saying in the interview. "Doctors and nurses in India, too, often don't wear protective gloves. They would immediately become infected and spread the virus."

Large cities with over-populated slums like those in India make it "virtually impossible to find those who had contact with patients, no matter how great the effort," Dr. Piot said, according to the magazine...

India's Health Ministry said Thursday [16 Oct 2014] that 3 days of training for healthcare teachers would take place in Delhi starting Sun [19 Oct 2014], including how to put on and remove protective wear safely, how to contact trace and how to collect and transport blood samples without spreading infection...

That's why in Nigeria's largest city Lagos, where the majority of the country's 20 cases were discovered, authorities urged people not to urinate or defecate in drains, dump sites and open spaces. The move is perhaps one reason why Nigeria has successfully contained the epidemic, with no new cases since 8 Sep 2014. In India, around 600 million people defecate in the open; a lack of toilets and, in some parts, a cultural preference for going outdoors would make it almost impossible for similar public health advice to have the same effect...

Around 1128 passengers are currently being tracked, mostly in the capital Delhi and the states of Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and West Bengal, the Health Ministry said Mon [13 Oct 2014]... http://wsj.com/articles/BL-IRTB-26959

[Well, does he or does he not have any Ebola antibodies? Even if only at a low level, received wisdom from other virus infections suggests that they should be adequate for a few months to prevent a fatal infection. Does anybody have data on the range of post-overt infection antibody titers in survivors of previous epidemics? - Mod.JW]

USA: Ebola protocols will now call for no skin showing
----------------------------------------------
Sun 19 Oct 2014: (AP) Revised guidance for health care workers treating Ebola patients will include using protective gear "with no skin showing," a top federal health official said Sun [19 Oct 2014].

Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said those caring for an Ebola patient in Dallas were left vulnerable because some of their skin was exposed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working on revisions to safety protocols.

End of isolation
--------------
Ebola's incubation period is 21 days, and Fauci noted that that mark was being reached on Sun [19 Oct 2014] for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital workers who 1st treated D., the Liberian man who later died of the disease. "The ones now today [19 Oct 2014] that are going to be 'off the hook' are the ones that saw him initially in the emergency room," Fauci said...

Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief executive in Dallas County, said that the protective order that has kept D.'s family isolated expires Sunday [19 Oct 2014] at midnight.

[Can anyone explain how the group of people who lived for days in an apartment so heavily contaminated by index patient D. that the entire contents had to be removed and burned have survived without getting infected? I hope they will be tested for ebolavirus antibodies. - Mod.JW]

A Texas healthcare worker who had handled a blood sample of TD, the Liberian man who died from Ebola in the US earlier this month [October 2014], has been quarantined in her room aboard the Carnival Magic cruise ship. The unnamed woman, who is a lab supervisor at Texas Health Presbyterian, is deemed by the CDC to be "low risk" and has yet to exhibit symptoms. She is also approaching the end of her 21-day maximum incubation window, after which it can be confirmed that she did not contract Ebola.

Update: Upon examination at Galveston County Health Authority, the quarantined passenger is confirmed not to have Ebola.

Ohio health officials strengthened the state's Ebola monitoring protocols on Sat [18 Oct 2014] to require that state residents who are self-monitoring after contact with an Ebola-exposed environment do not leave the U.S. Ohio residents who are self-monitoring for symptoms of the Ebola virus must also undergo daily appointments with a health department official, according to the state's new mandates...

Ohio health officials have been working to track people in the state who might have been in contact with [the nurse from Texas who traveled there]. But since local health authorities are responsible for monitoring, as of Saturday [18 Oct 2014] evening, the state didn't know the exact number of people being tracked for the virus, Mr. Teets said. Daily statewide counts are expected to start on Sun [19 Oct 2014], he added...

There are rumors that the 1st Ebola patient [in China] was found at the China Import and Export Fair [Canton Fair, in Guangzhou] and sent to Provincial No. 2 People's Hospital for treatment. The Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission says that there are no Ebola cases in the province at this time. The facts are that yesterday [17 Oct 2014], Pazhou Trade Complex took a monitored subject to Provincial No. 2 People's Hospital. This monitoring subject is of Nigerian nationality. Blood samples were sent to the Guandong Province CDC's P3 [biosafety level 3] laboratory for testing and found negative for Ebola, ruling out infection with ebolavirus.
