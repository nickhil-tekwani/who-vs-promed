Human salmonella infection from cat exposure
-----------------------------------------------
Salmonella poisoning usually comes from raw eggs, undercooked poultry, or
unpasteurized milk, but some pets also carry it.
10 cases of human salmonella infection were reported recently in the
Treasure Valley area that link the bacteria to kittens and cats from the
Idaho Humane Society. All of the cages the animals were in have since been
thoroughly cleaned.
Central District Health officials say the key in preventing salmonella from
spreading from a pet to a person is to simply wash your hands. "If you
don't wash your hands well, then you go to handling or preparing food or
caring for a child, anything you may have close contact with, you may
inadvertently spread those germs to the next person," says Dieuwke Spencer,
Epidemiologist for the Central District Health Department.
"18 percent of the total number of cat population has salmonella at any
given time," continued Spencer.

[Although clinicians immediately think of zoonotic salmonellosis as being
related to human contact -- directly or indirectly -- with animals such as
the turkey, turtle, snake, and lizard, it is important to recall that
domesticated animals such as dogs and cats may also harbor the
bacterium. A variety of reports confirm this association. The incidence
of stool excretion of _Salmonella sp._ in dogs and cats seems to be
variable. Important factors that may increase the carriage include source
of the animal and its diet. In comparisons of household pets with stray
animals, the latter tend to have higher rates (1). Feeding pets raw
chicken or other products that may harbor the organism also increases the
risk (2).
