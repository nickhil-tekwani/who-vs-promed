Chickenpox in the city [Jamshedpur] is spreading like a pandemic. Up to 39 suspected patients have been found in 48 hours. Among them, 27 are students of Skill Development Center located at Dimna Resort Complex and 12 Golmuri Police Lines personnel. Given the growing number of chickenpox patients, the health department has issued a public instruction that if a large number of people suffer from red spots, fever etc. in any area, then inform the department.

Confirmation of 7 in one month: According to the report received from the district surveillance department, chicken pox has been confirmed in 7 people in the district for one month. Ten days ago, the team of Health Department took blood samples of 25 soldiers after receiving information about the spread of chicken pox in the Golmuri police line. After investigation, 7 of these policemen were confirmed with chickenpox.

It is important that you do not take any medicines without any medical advice, because there may be side effects of wrong medication. If possible, take chickenpox vaccine. After getting the vaccine, the possibility of getting this disease disappears for 40 years.

[Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV; also known as chickenpox virus), a human herpesvirus, occurs worldwide, and most persons living in temperate regions become immune by contracting varicella illness or receiving vaccinations by early adulthood. However, in tropical climates, as little as half the population is exposed to VZV by adulthood. The extent of disease and severity in adults in tropical climates is also greater than for temperate climates. In India, >30 percent of persons >15 years of age are susceptible. Routine infant vaccination has substantially reduced transmission of wild-type varicella; however, VZV vaccine is not a part of the Indian Universal Immunisation Program .
