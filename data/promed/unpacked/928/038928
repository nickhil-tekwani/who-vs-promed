Acute Neurological Syndrome in Bangladesh - WHO Update 2
--------------------------------------------------------
The international team (see below) has returned from the site of the
outbreak in Meherpur district. The team carried out detailed surveys in the
affected area, investigating a cluster of deaths that occurred between 26
Apr 2001 and 10 May 2001. An extensive search revealed that no new cases
had occurred after mid-May. Laboratory tests are underway to try to
determine the etiology of the outbreak.
The team recommended that surveillance be maintained to detect any
recurrence of a similar nature in Meherpur or elsewhere in the country. It
was further recommended that the capacity to detect and respond rapidly to
outbreaks should be strengthened at both national and district levels
through developing guidelines, establishing and training a rapid response
team, and maintaining appropriate supplies and equipment for rapid response.
