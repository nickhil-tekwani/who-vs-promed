France reported a new case of mad cow disease (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) on Monday, bringing the number
of cattle found with it in France this year to 19.
The farm ministry stated the animal concerned, and the rest of the
164-animal herd to which it belonged in the Maine-et-Loire region,
had been destroyed. A second herd of 91 cows, to which the
animal previously belonged, was also destroyed.
Given a ban on nervous tissue, ground bone and certain organs in
French cattle feed, any new cases of BSE were most likely the
result of contamination of animal feed by substances not meant for
cattle, the ministry said.
It added that the number of fresh BSE cases should die down after
2001 as the disease's incubation period is 5 years and tougher
controls were placed on animal feed from late 1996.
France has a total cattle herd of about 21 million.
