As many as 70 cases of measles have been detected in Prague since the beginning of the year [2018]. The number of patients has increased by 9 in a week, according to the spokesman of the Health Station of the Czech capital Zbyněk Boublík. The Motol hospital in Prague, the largest hospital in the Czech capital, has decided to ban any new admission to the emergency room because of the contamination of an employee. Last week, there were 88 cases of measles in the country, and 59 in Prague. The Ministry of Health has to take stock of the situation in the country on Mon [30 Apr 2018].

A widespread phenomenon in Europe, which also affects the Czech Republic, measles is experiencing an unprecedented resurgence in recent years. Considered as a benign disease, the latter is transmitted mainly by air. The infected person becomes contagious the day before the appearance of the 1st symptoms, and for the following 5 days.

The HSE has issued a public warning and have confirmed there have been more than 65 cases of measles since the beginning of the year [2018]. There have been 3 outbreak clusters of measles this year to date - 1 in Limerick, 2 in Dublin, with a small number of individual cases in the west and southeast.

The high number of adults and teenagers affected by measles in recent months is of great concern to health officials. A spokesperson for the HSE warned that "10 -- 30 per cent of the population under the age of 40 is not vaccinated."

People most at risk of catching measles are those who either have not had measles infection in the past, those who are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine (in particular babies younger than 12 months who are too young to be vaccinated), and those with weakened immune systems.

Anyone who has been exposed and is not immune to measles may develop measles up to 3 weeks following date of exposure. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness and early symptoms can include a runny nose, red eyes, swollen eyelids, sneezing and fever. A few days later, a red-brown spotty rash appears and lasts for about a week. It starts behind the ears, before spreading around the head and neck, and eventually to the legs and the rest of the body.

So, what should parents be looking for if they suspect their child might have contracted measles? The symptoms of the disease begin to appear between 7 and 21 days after infection. ...-more

[3] Australia (Victoria, Melbourne) ex Thailand: alert
Date: Sat 28 Apr 2018

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/melbourne-alerted-new-imported-measles-case-34383/


Officials with Victoria Health are warning the public of a new imported measles case in the Melbourne area. The confirmed case of measles has spent significant time in the places [listed in the URL] above while infectious.

There has been no identified link to other cases from Melbourne in early March [2018]. The case, an adult male, was in both Australia (8 days) and Thailand (10 days) during the exposure period (18 days). However, it is most likely that the infection was acquired in Thailand as the incubation period is generally 7--18 days from exposure, usually around day 10.

Unfortunately, the notification was made late to the department, so it is only now that passengers are being warned via media release and some may already be showing early symptoms. It is critical that diagnosing doctors and laboratories notify the department as soon as they are aware of cases to enable immediate follow-up.

Children or adults born during or since 1966 who do not have documented evidence of receiving 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine or do not have documented evidence of immunity are considered to be susceptible to measles. People who are immunocompromised are also at risk.

[5] New York [Orange County]: tourists

Two European tourists with now confirmed cases of measles visited a number of places in New York City, Orange and Putnam counties, including Tuxedo. An Australian tourist with a now confirmed case of measles visited a number of places in New York City, Putnam and Orange counties, including Tuxedo.

According to the New York State Department of Health, the tourists visited a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses in Brooklyn on [15 Apr 2018] and toured 2 separate Watchtower facilities in Orange and Putnam counties on [16 and 17 Apr 2018], potentially exposing others to measles. The risk of developing measles is very low for people who have been vaccinated or are immune.

[See URL above for list of locations where individuals may have been exposed]

The [listed] times reflect the period that the infected individuals were in these areas and a 2-hour period after the individuals left the area, according to the Department of Health, since the virus remains alive in air and on surfaces for up to 2 hours.

To prevent the spread of illness, the health department is advising individuals who may have been exposed and who have symptoms consistent with measles to contact their health care provider, a local clinic, or a local emergency department before going for care. This will help to prevent others at these facilities from being exposed to the illness.

Measles symptoms include a fever, rash, cough, conjunctivitis or runny nose and usually appear 10--12 days after exposure, but may appear as early as 7 days and as late as 21 days after exposure. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected people.

Individuals are considered protected or immune to measles if they were born before 1957, have received 2 doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, have had measles disease, or have a lab test confirming immunity, according to state health officials. Individuals who are not immune to measles and were exposed are at risk for developing measles.

Those individuals without immunity or who are not sure if they have been vaccinated, should contact their health care provider if they develop measles symptoms. ...-more

Typically, the 1st dose of MMR vaccine should be given at 12--15 months of age and the 2nd dose should be given at 4 --6 years of age (age of school entry). In New York State, measles immunization is required of children enrolled in schools, daycare and pre-kindergarten. Since August 1990, college students have also been required to demonstrate immunity against measles.

Second case of measles in Hudson Valley. This is the 2nd case of measles reported by the New York State Department of Health this year [2018]. In February [2018], an Australian tourist with measles visited a number of places in New York City, Putnam and Orange Counties.

[6] Kansas and Missouri

Numerous outbreaks of the measles are spreading throughout parts of Kansas and Missouri. There have been 18 reported cases in Johnson County, Kansas, and surrounding counties. Handwashing and covering one's mouth aren't just important manners to practice, they are becoming essential to preventing the spread of deadly disease.

In Missouri, Liberty Middle School has prohibited 13 unvaccinated students from attending classes after the school was exposed to an outbreak on [18 Apr 2018]. The 13 students are the only ones out of 791 students to not receive the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine for religious or medical exemptions.

Dr. Cynthia Brownfield is a physician at Mosaic Life Care and she said since the outbreaks are close enough to the area that residents should be aware. "It's not that far away. It's only one hour away. But most viruses and most outbreaks are just a plane ride away as well," Brownfield said.

Brownfield added the disease is incredibly contagious and can be transmitted by a simple cough. The disease can stay in the air for up to 2 hours. "Measles is probably the most contagious virus that we know," Brownfield said.

She said since many people nowadays are unfamiliar with older diseases such as measles, they don't take the threat as seriously. "People get a very false sense of security," Brownfield said. "We don't see measles that often but measles is a serious illness."

According to Brownfield, the symptoms that often accompany the disease is an unsightly rash, high fever, deafness and even pneumonia. Brownfield said pneumonia is often the deadliest side effect of the measles.

But why is the disease spreading so quickly in this day and age? Brownfield thinks some of it has to do with people consuming false information about vaccines.

"Don't trust social media," Brownfield said. "The amount of Facebook posts that I see that are incorrect, or have false information is staggering. Somehow they're played off that it's on social media so it's actually the truth, but it's not."

Brownfield said she recommends everyone who is old enough and medically able to should receive the measles vaccine. But if your child is medically exempt from receiving the vaccine, Brownfield said parents must be more vigilant.

"Make sure that you're smart with where you're taking your child that's too young to be vaccinated and just keeping your radar up. These things can occur," she said.
