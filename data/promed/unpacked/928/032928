From: Komar, Nick <nck6@cdc.gov>

I am providing the following reply to Dr. Karl Johnson's questions on West
Nile virus (WNV)-associated crow mortality: [see West Nile Virus
Surveillance - USA: questions, 3 Aug 2000.
During the peak of epizootic WNV activity in the US last year (September
1999), about half of the dead American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchus_) that
were tested yielded WNV isolates. Although I am not aware of viremia data
in crows infected with the NY99 strain of WNV, the Egyptian experience in
Hooded crows (_Corvus corone sardonicus_) would suggest that these birds
are not dead-end hosts. Nonetheless, I suspect that there are other species
of wild birds that become equally infectious to mosquitoes that may
contribute more to WNV epizootic transmission than crows. These other birds
may survive infection or, if they die, are not as obvious to the reporting
public.
