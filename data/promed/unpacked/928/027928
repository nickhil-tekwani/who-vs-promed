WHAT EVERY SERVICE MEMBER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE ANTHRAX VACCINE
- Anthrax is a biological weapon
- Anthrax is highly lethal
- Vaccination against anthrax is critical for your protection
- This is a mandatory vaccination program to preserve the fighting force
WHAT IS THE THREAT?
Biological weapons are maintained by several countries around the world. Use
of these weapons could cause widespread illness among unprotected military
forces. Anthrax is the biological weapon most likely to be encountered
because it is:
- Highly lethal
- Easy to produce in large quantities
- Relatively easy to develop as a weapon
- Easily spread in the air over a large area
- Easily stored and dangerous for a long time
WHAT IS ANTHRAX?
Anthrax is a disease normally associated with plant-eating animals (sheep,
goats, cattle, and to a lesser degree swine). It is caused by the bacteria
Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax has been recognized as an illness for centuries.
Once common where livestock were raised, it is now controlled through animal
vaccination programs. Anthrax still occurs in countries where animals are
not vaccinated, mainly in Africa and Asia. It does occur infrequently in
many countries, including the United States. Human infection with anthrax
usually results from direct contact with infected animals, or animal
products such as wool, meat or hides. However, when anthrax is used as a
biological weapon, people become infected by breathing anthrax spores that
are released into the air. Inhalation anthrax is the disease that results
from breathing anthrax spores. Symptoms of inhalation anthrax can begin as
early as 24 hours after breathing the spores. Initial symptoms include:
fever, cough, and weakness and usually progress to breathing problems,
shock, and death.
WHY VACCINATE?
Vaccines prevent illness by stimulating the body's natural disease-fighting
abilities. They are among the most powerful tools developed by modern
medicine for keeping people healthy. Vaccines are routinely used in the
United States to protect against diseases such as mumps, measles, whooping
cough, and polio. As part of force protection, military personnel are given
additional vaccines to protect against naturally occurring diseases
encountered when deploying overseas, such as typhoid, hepatitis, and yellow
fever. Vaccines also help protect against biological weapons.
A safe and effective licensed vaccine against anthrax is available. The
Department of Defense has established a vaccination program to protect
military personnel against anthrax.
WHAT IS THE ANTHRAX VACCINE?
The anthrax vaccine is a formalin-inactivated vaccine used to protect people
against anthrax. This vaccine contains no living organisms. The anthrax
vaccine is not new. Human anthrax vaccines were developed in England and the
United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. The vaccine that you will
receive was licensed by the FDA in 1970. This vaccine has been safely and
routinely administered in the United States to veterinarians, laboratory
workers, and livestock handlers.
FACTS ABOUT THE ANTHRAX VACCINE
- Vaccination is a critical part of protection against infection
- Licensed by the FDA since 1970
- Manufactured in the United States
- Safely used for more than 25 years
- As with other vaccinations, pain may occur at the site of injection
- Temporary side effects (sore arm, redness, and slight swelling) may occur
- No known long term side effects
- Six shots are required over 18 months, followed by an annual booster
COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Q: Why are we getting this vaccine?
A: Anthrax is a lethal weapon we may encounter. Vaccination before exposure
is a critical part of our protection against this weapon.
Q: Is the vaccine all I need to protect against inhalation anthrax?
A: Being fully vaccinated greatly increases your chances of surviving an
exposure to anthrax. Your chances are further improved by other measures,
especially proper use of the protective mask.
Q: Is this an experimental vaccine?
A: No, the vaccine has been FDA approved since 1970 (License No. 99, 1970).
Q: Is this vaccine safe?
A: Yes, this vaccine has been safely and routinely administered in the U.S.
to veterinarians, laboratory workers, and livestock handlers since 1970. No
reports of significant adverse effects have been received by theproducer,
the Michigan Biologic Products Institute.
Q: What if I am pregnant?
A: Pregnant women should not receive this vaccine. If you are or believe
that you may be pregnant, you should inform your health care provider. The
vaccination program will be deferred until the pregnancy is complete.
Q: What other medical conditions should I inform the medical staff about?
A: If you have an active infection or are taking a prescription medicine,
inform your health care provider before taking this shot.
Q: The anthrax vaccine was administered to personnel deployed in the Gulf
War. Has the anthrax vaccine been linked to illnesses among Gulf War veterans?
A: No. Several national scientific groups have addressed this issue and
have found no evidence to link anthrax vaccine with illnesses among Gulf War
veterans.
Q: How many shots will I have to take?
A: Six shots, three given two weeks apart followed by three additional
injections given at 6, 12 and 18 months. An annual booster shot is required
to maintain ongoing immunity.
Q: What are the side effects?
A: As with other vaccinations, pain may occur at the site of injection.
Temporary side effects (sore arm, redness, and slight swelling) may occur.
The vaccine has been in use since 1970 with no known long term side effects.
Q: Am I required to take the vaccine?
A: Yes. This program will be treated like any other vaccine that is
required to prepare you for deployment. You will be required to take it
unless medically deferred.
Q: How can I get more information about anthrax vaccine?
A: Your commander. In addition, more information on the anthrax vaccine can
be accessed at the website:
