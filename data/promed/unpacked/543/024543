Here is the latest update as of 17 Jul 2001
Total dead: 58 bison and 1 moose
Sex ratio of bison mortalities: 33 bulls and 23 cows out of a population
estimated at 300-400 in the Delta.
Last year we had 48 mortalities in this area.
We are running in 2 week operational periods. The current operational
period ends 26 Jul 2001. The focus of this period was to get a monitoring
strategy up and running. We are currently working with a rotary wing survey
of the outbreak area every 3 days and a fixed wing survey of high bison
density areas every 6 days. Planning for the next operational period has
begun.
We are hoping to test some carcass treatment options in the next
operational period. We would like to do some soil sampling around some
fresh carcasses and then try a range of carcass treatment options, followed
by another round of soil samples. It is unlikely that we will be able to
treat enough carcasses to have a statistically significant sample size, but
the information gained will help ourselves and GNWT determine effective and
efficient carcass treatment in isolated backcountry areas. Treatment
options being considered include chemical treatments, burning and
combinations of chemical treatment and burning. Two hurdles to this carcass
testing are an environmental assessment for formaldehyde use and securing
fuel and equipment for burning. If anyone has formaldehyde information that
would help in our environmental assessment please forward it to me.
I should note that we are only looking at testing carcass treatment options
on a few carcasses. At this time, we are not considering full carcass
treatment of all carcasses.

[In a discussion with Jonah I asked about the fate of the 3 calves seen
standing by their dead dams. "The calves are a bit of a tricky one. We have
only seen 3 and in each case they were observed once and then were no
longer present at the next monitoring flight. We have not found their
carcasses. Three calves per 19 dead cows is a pretty low calf recruitment
rate (our classification counts in early June in this area showed close to
50 calves for 100 cows). I suspect there may be more calves. However we
have also wondered about hormonal changes in nursing cow bison. Perhaps
they are less susceptible to anthrax than cows who have no calf and aren't
nursing? Every day brings more questions around here." This year is unusual
in the numbers of cows affected. It is traditionally a ratio of 4 bulls per
cow.
Otherwise surveillance flights have only seen one wolf and 2 black bears.
Scavenging at the carcasses this year has been very limited and the
majority have not been dismembered. Last year most carcasses were
scavenged. A bison survey and class composition study earlier in the summer
also discovered the Park herds had increased by about 1000 animals,
primarily calves and yearlings. Jonah has pointed out that over the last 2
years the muskrat, beaver, rodent and rabbit populations on the Delta have
crashed (mostly due to low water levels in the delta because of a dam
upstream on the Peace River). It is possible that a scarcity of primary and
secondary prey species on the Delta this past winter has caused the
carnivore populations to crash or to move out of the region. Scavengers
(wolves, bears, foxes) are normally fairly resistant to anthrax so the drop
in numbers should not be ascribed to last year's outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ
