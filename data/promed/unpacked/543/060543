U.S. Senate staff test positive for anthrax
-------------------------------------------
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle confirmed Wednesday that 31 people
who work in his office have had positive nasal swabs for "exposure to
anthrax." Daschle said 25 of them are his staff workers, and the remaining
6 are members of the Capitol police force. He stressed that a positive
nasal swab does not mean the person has anthrax. Hundreds of people were
tested Tuesday after a suspicious letter was opened in Daschle's office on
Monday.
A U.S. health official said the anthrax exposure has been confined to a
"very specific area" of the Senate Hart Office Building. Deputy U.S. Surgeon
General Ken Moritsugu said only those who visited the building's fifth and
sixth floors needed to be tested for anthrax exposure. "At this time there
has been no evidence of (anthrax) spores in the ventilation system,"
Moritsugu said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
Speaker Dennis Hastert said people who work in the building were being sent
home until at least Tuesday so a full sweep could be done on the building.
Gen. John Parker, Commander of U.S. Army Medical Research says the anthrax
samples being tested are "pure spores" and that it is a "common variety
anthrax." He said they have not identified the particular strain at this
time.

Anthrax spores in N.Y. governor's office
----------------------------------------
New York Governor George Pataki reported Wednesday that anthrax spores have
been found in his office in New York City, and that he and his staff will
begin taking the antibiotic Cipro immediately. Pataki said a secretary
found a suspicious letter and called for an environmental test on Monday.
When the results came back Wednesday, one came back positive indicating the
probability of anthrax in a room used by his state security police detail.
He said anthrax has not been found in his office, his secretary's office, or
in the building's air conditioning system. Pataki said they do not know the
source of the anthrax, but do not believe the suspicious letter is the
source. A spokesperson for Pataki said the affected room is not accessible
to the public.
Pataki's office complex has been closed for further testing and
decontamination and probably won't reopen until Monday. It's located on the
38th and 39th floors of a building at 633 Third Avenue.

Early tests: N.Y. anthrax is same as Fla. strain
------------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests indicate the anthrax found in a letter sent to NBC News
in New York is the same strain of the bacteria as the one identified in
several cases at a Florida tabloid publishing company, sources at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CNN Wednesday.

House shutting down for anthrax testing; dozens of staffers were exposed
-------------------------------------------
Congressional leaders ordered an unprecedented shutdown of the House on
Wednesday after more than 2 dozen people in Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle's office tested positive for exposure to a highly concentrated form
of anthrax. "We will not let this stop the work of the Senate," Daschle
said at a news conference outside the Capitol. He said 31 people have had
"positive nasal swabs," including 2 Capitol police officers. Despite the
vow to remain open, officials said all 3 of the Senate's office buildings
would be shut down Thursday and Friday for testing.
Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., announced that 2 of his aides had tested
positive for exposure to anthrax. Feingold's office is adjacent to Daschle's
suite in the Hart Senate Office Building. Neither of the staffers had
entered Daschle's suite, the senator said.
With word of the positive test results on Capitol Hill, officials opened a
second anthrax testing center in the physician's office on the first floor
of the Capitol. A line extended up to the second floor. Tests also were
available in an office building across the street. There, more than 1000
people were tested on Tuesday and given a 3-day supply of antibiotics as
a precaution.
Scott Lillibridge, a bioterrorism expert at the Department of Health and
Human Services, said the only known evidence of anthrax was found in
Daschle's office across the street from the Capitol and in the Senate's
mailroom in a second office building.
"This particular strain of anthrax is sensitive to all antibiotics," said
Maj. Gen. John Parker, speaking on behalf of the Ft. Detrick military lab
technicians in Maryland who performed the tests on the samples. He described
it as "common variety" anthrax.

Anthrax detected in New York governor's Manhattan office
--------------------------------------------------------
Gov. George Pataki's midtown Manhattan office showed the presence of
anthrax in an initial test, the governor announced Wednesday. No workers
were known to be exposed. The governor's complex of offices on the 38th and
39th floors of a high-rise building on Third Avenue between 40th and 41st
streets has been closed for further testing and decontamination work. Other
offices in the building remained open. About 80 employees were evacuated
after the positive result on the initial test was returned Wednesday
morning, Pataki said.
It was unclear how the anthrax was brought into the office, but the positive
result happened on samples taken from an area occupied by the state police.
Those officers were involved in the earlier investigation into anthrax
reports at NBC and ABC, Pataki said, suggesting it may have arrived in his
office that way. "The state police have been obviously at NBC, at ABC, all
over the environs over the course of the past month," Pataki said.
The tests were ordered Monday night in response to heightened concerns in
Manhattan, after the second case of anthrax in the city was confirmed
earlier in the day. No employees in the governor's office have tested
positive for anthrax but all of them, including Pataki, will begin taking
the antibiotic Cipro as a precaution.

Capitol Anthrax Scare
---------------------
Two days after a letter containing a white, powdery anthrax-contaminated
substance was opened in Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's personal
office, nasal swabs from 31 people tested positive for the presence of
anthrax spores. Those who were exposed include 23 members of Daschle's
staff, 3 staffers for Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., whose office on the
fifth and sixth floors of Hart Senate Office Building is adjacent to
Daschle's, and 5 Capitol Police officers.
The House was set to adjourn at the end of the day until Tuesday, but Senate
leaders decided to keep their chamber in session through Thursday. All
congressional office buildings will be vacated to allow authorities to sweep
the Capitol complex for anthrax spores.
Authorities said this afternoon that the bacteria do not appear to have
spread beyond the general vicinity of Daschle's office. "The exposure has
been confined to a very specific area," Dr. Kenneth Moritsugu, the deputy
surgeon general, told reporters on Capitol Hill. "At this time there has
been no evidence of spores in the ventilation system."
Senior law enforcement officials said today that a laboratory analysis of
the anthrax-laden powder in the letter received by Daschle's office last
Friday and opened Monday has revealed the substance was "professionally"
manufactured, suggesting the powder was produced by a well-funded
organization. The officials added that further testing is being done to
determine whether or not the material is "weapons-grade" like the varieties
produced by state-supported operations.
Sources have told ABCNEWS the powder has a high concentration of anthrax
spores and is very finely milled, making it easy for the spores to become
airborne and infect its victims with the often fatal inhalation form of
anthrax. "These are no amateurs," said one official.
. New York, Florida Strains Appear to Match
Dr. David Fleming, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control, said
today the strain of anthrax found in New York "appears to match" a strain
found in Florida. The news that the anthrax spores found in each case could
be from the same strain suggests that the 2 incidents may be linked.
Authorities announced today that a test of the ventilation system at ABCNEWS
has turned up negative for the presence of anthrax spores. Although spores
were found in the ventilation system at NBC, the first batch of tests of 500
employees have come back negative for anthrax or anthrax exposure.
. Daschle, Brokaw Letters Believed Linked
Senior law enforcement officials told ABCNEWS investigators believe that a
letter containing anthrax that was delivered to Daschle's office and another
sent to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw's office in New York are linked.
A federal official who has seen the Daschle letter said it was dated
"09-11-01," the date of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington,
and contained the message: "This is next. Take your medicine. Death to
America. Death to Israel. Allah is great."
A source who has seen the Brokaw letter said it was also dated "09-11-01"
and read in part: "This is next. Take penacilin (sic) now. Death to America.
Death to Israel. Allah is great."
Both envelopes had prepaid postage and were postmarked in Trenton, N.J. and
authorities have said the block handwriting on the outside of each envelope
is similar.
Despite the similarities in the letters, however, officials say the
anthrax-contaminated powders they contained are very different: The
substance sent to Daschle was white and appeared to have been professionally
manufactured, while the powder mailed to Brokaw was brown and crude in
comparison.

[I have edited out the statements of various politicians who were swept up
in the excitement of the moment. At this time I am more given to accepting
Gen Parker's simple description of the Washington isolates than the others.
This would also match that found in Florida. "Professionally" manufactured
would also cover a pathologically disgruntled academic or professional
microbiologist with access to good institutional facilities. But this powder
is clearly an excellent "flyer."
I apologise to everyone who tried to contact me today who didn't get a
reply. I had a planning meeting this morning on a project here to deal with
our significant infant mortality problem -- 1.1% -- in Baton Rouge, which
approximates to a classroom of kindergarten kids dying each year. It is
largely related to low birth weights. This is more important than the events
in Washington, in my opinion. There were 105 e-mail unread messages awaiting
me at midday. After 30 minutes of dealing with them I had 110 unread
messages. Plus 38 messages on my telephone. - Mod.MHJ
