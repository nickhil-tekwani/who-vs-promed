The Delaware Department of Agriculture (DDA) found on Tuesday morning [10
Feb 2004] that avian influenza is present on a second farm in Delaware.
The H7-type avian influenza was found in a commercial flock of roaster-type
chickens in northern Sussex County, at least 5 miles away from the southern
Kent County farm identified Friday as being infected. A flock of 72 000
birds 4.5 weeks old in 3 chicken houses on the northern Sussex County farm
is being destroyed this afternoon.
The source of infection of the 2nd farm is unknown at this time. While
dangerous to poultry, the H7 strain of avian influenza is not generally
considered to pose a danger to humans and is not the same strain that has
caused illness and deaths in Asia.
"This development is completely unexpected given the precautions we took,
the investigation we made, and the industry's expectations of this
disease's behavior," Secretary of Agriculture Michael T Scuse said. "We
will be taking immediate actions to contain this disease, but this is now a
serious situation for the Delmarva [Delaware/Maryland/Virginia area]
poultry industry."
Avian influenza is most often transmitted from one bird to another through
mud and manure that can be tracked from farm to farm on shoes or vehicles.
It can also be transmitted from bird to bird through the air.
Other developments Tuesday morning:
- test results received late on Monday show that all 20 farms within a 2
mile radius of the non-commercial southern Kent County farm with the first
detected case of H7 avian influenza were found to be negative for avian
influenza.
- the specific strain of avian influenza at the 1st farm has been confirmed
as H7N2, which has never been known to cause harm to humans. The strain at
the 2nd infected farm in known to be H7, but the more specific N-type is
not yet known.
- DDA is asking anyone with small numbers of backyard chickens or other
poultry to report any disease or suspicions of disease immediately to the
Department at (302) 698-4539.
- effective immediately, DDA is canceling all scheduled farmer and grower
related meetings in order to prevent spread of the disease and encourages
all those in the industry to do the same.
- effective immediately, DDA is asking that all sales or auctions of farm
equipment be cancelled in order to prevent spread of the disease.
- effective immediately, DDA is banning all sale of live poultry in Delaware.
- DDA officials will continue to hold discussions with industry,
epidemiology, agriculture, and health officials from surrounding states and
the federal government to identify any additional actions required to
contain and eradicate this avian influenza situation.
- a press conference was held on Tue 10 Feb 2004 at the Delaware Department
of Agriculture, 2320 South DuPont Highway in Dover, to provide additional
details on actions being taken and any impact on the poultry industry.
Individuals and the media are asked to stay away from poultry farms in
Delaware in order to prevent spread of this disease, secretary Scuse said.
