Gradually, hazardous diseases like Japanese encephalitis (JE) spreading its wings over the State [of Madhya Pradesh]. Currently, 8 patients of Japanese Encephalitis are found positive in Madhya Pradesh so far. Sources in the health department, on condition of anonymity, informed [us] that [there] are 8 JE patients and 3 of them are from Bhopal.

A few days back a 3 year old child died of JE. Health officials have already started research about the virus around the localities of positive patients. Authorities concerned have confirmed the presence of JE virus in the areas.

Sources informed that [up to now] a total of 8 JE positive cases [have been] registered all across the state. The health department is taking all the necessary measures to get control over the hazardous JE virus disease.

Dr Himanshu Jaiswar, director [of the] State Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, talking to 'The Hitavada' said that in the wake of rising vectorborne diseases, the State Vector Borne Disease Control Department is conducting local entomological work, especially at the native lands of JE patients. He said that the vectorborne disease control department is trying to get control over JE. The department has already [commissioned] local entomological work and the health department is trying to overcome the disease as early as possible.

Dr Himanshu told [us what the] Vector Borne Disease Control Department is planning to do to stop JE virus. He said that the heath department is also planning to concern the Government of India to administer immunisation for the same as JE could be controlled with effective vaccination. Notably, Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).

Symptoms of JE may include headache, vomiting, fever, and confusion. This occurs about 5 to 15 days after infection. JEV is generally spread by mosquitoes, specifically culex mosquitoes, pigs and wild birds. It can be prevented by Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which is both safe and effective, and by avoiding mosquito bites.

[This is the busy Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season in India. The report above uses the term "Japanese encephalitis" without mentioning "acute encephalitis syndrome" that has been used in previous reports from most localities in India. Where laboratory confirmation of exclusion is reported, usually these encephalitis cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) as a minority of cases, with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unspecified etiology for the majority. This is the season for JE virus, but AES also occurs at this time.

As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Fortunately, vaccination for JE is being carried out in the affected areas in the district, which will prevent cases of encephalitis due to infection with that virus. The type of vaccine used is not mentioned. If it is an inactivated vaccine the duration of immunity may not be long-lasting. Attenuated live vaccine would provide longer immunity. - Mod.TY]
