Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 22 Oct 2013
Report date: 29 Jan 2014
Date submitted to OIE: 29 Jan 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1991
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: _Mycobacterium bovis_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Cayo, Bee Lane, Spanish Lookout, Cayo
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Jul 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 133 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 /
Affected population: dairy herd (Holstein) in an important dairy area of Belize.
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0.75 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0.75 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: Belize initiated the Belize National Sanitary Cattle Plan Project in July 2012 where the national herd is being tested for bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. This Project also incorporates bovine traceability. Since the start of testing, this is the 1st laboratory confirmed bovine tuberculosis among 90 000 animals (90 percent of national herd) tested thus far. Epidemiological investigation is ongoing on this confirmed case.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Regional Laboratory, Merida, Yucatan (Mexico) (Foreign laboratory) / Cattle / bacteriological examination / 27 Jan 2014 / Positive
Central Regional Laboratory, Merida, Yucatan (Mexico) (Foreign laboratory) / Cattle / histopathological examination / 22 Oct 2010 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial disease of animals and humans caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. In a large number of countries bovine tuberculosis is a major infectious disease among cattle, other domesticated animals, and certain wildlife populations. Transmission to humans constitutes a public health problem.

Aerosol exposure to _M. bovis_ is considered to be the most frequent route of infection of cattle, but infection by ingestion of contaminated material also occurs. After infection, nonvascular nodular granulomas known as tubercles may develop. Characteristic tuberculous lesions occur most frequently in the lungs and the retropharyngeal, bronchial, and mediastinal lymph nodes. Lesions can also be found in the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, on serous membranes, and in other organs.

Bovine tuberculosis infection in cattle is usually diagnosed in the live animal on the basis of delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Infection is often subclinical; when present, clinical signs are not specifically distinctive and can include weakness, anorexia, emaciation, dyspnoea, enlargement of lymph nodes, and cough, particularly with advanced tuberculosis. After death, infection is diagnosed by necropsy and histopathological and bacteriological techniques. Rapid nucleic acid methodologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), may also be used although these are demanding techniques and should only be used when appropriately validated. Traditional mycobacterial culture remains the gold standard method for routine confirmation of infection.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.4.7 "Bovine Tuberculosis", available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2009).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to bovine tuberculosis are spelled out in chapter 11.6 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm.

_Mycobacterium bovis_ is not the major cause of human tuberculosis, which is caused by _M. tuberculosis_, but humans are susceptible to bovine TB. Humans can be infected both by drinking raw milk from infected cattle, or by inhaling infective droplets. It is estimated in some countries that up to 10 percent of human tuberculosis is due to bovine TB.
