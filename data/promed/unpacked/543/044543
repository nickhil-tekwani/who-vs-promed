[The newly reported laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in Taif brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 756, including 320 deaths (case fatality rate 42.3 percent).

This is now the 6th case reported in Taif since the beginning of September 2014. Two of the 6 recent cases from Taif were in healthcare workers, and (including this newly reported case) had a history of exposure to camels. Noteworthy is that of the last 5 cases reported (since 28 Sep 2014), 3 were in individuals giving a history of contact with camels and 2 were in healthcare workers.

The newly reported recovered case, a 60-year-old expat male healthcare worker in Jubail, was an individual who was confirmed to have MERS-CoV on 8 Sep 2014, at which time he was admitted to the ICU.
