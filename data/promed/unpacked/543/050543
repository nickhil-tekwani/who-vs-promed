Poultry supply fears after Polish outbreak
------------------------------------------
More than 100 000 birds have been culled in Poland after an outbreak
of bird flu was detected on a hen farm. The country's Ministry of
Agriculture expects the new outbreak will have a significant economic
impact on the Polish poultry industry.

Poland is thought to be one of Europe's largest producers of poultry
and poultry products, with annual exports to European markets
averaging 230 000 metric tons. The announcement of previous outbreaks
of bird flu caused wholesale prices for Polish poultry to drop at
least 30 percent, according to media reports.

The highly pathogenic (H5N1) avian influenza outbreak was detected at
a large laying hen farm in Mazowsze Province. More than 120 000 birds
were culled and 100 000 eggs were destroyed by the Veterinary
Service. The exact damage to the economy has not yet been calculated,
but earlier indications have not been good.

This is reported to be the 5th case of avian flu registered by Polish
veterinary authorities since last week [10-14 Dec 2007], when the
deadly virus was discovered at 3 turkey farms in central Poland. A
safety zone has been set up around the site to prevent the spread of
the virus. The deadly bird flu virus has hit numerous locations
across the bloc this year.

Hungary suffered an attack of the virus in January [2007]. Germany
and the Czech Republic have also both reported outbreaks of H5N1. The
Czech Republic was hit with its first bird flu case in March 2006.
Since then the country has registered another 13 cases of H5N1
infection of swans.

Also this year [2007], Germany confirmed that H5N1 was found in 6
wild birds found dead near Nuremberg, and then reported a later
incident where 3 wild swans in the east of the country were also
infected.[This was followed on Mon 17 Dec 2007 by an outbreak in a
backyard poultry holding in Magdeburg, a German State bordering
Poland; see ProMED Mail post 20071217.4061. - Mod.AS]
