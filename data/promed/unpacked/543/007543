Russia: Total Deaths from HFRS in the Orenburg Oblast Reaches 6
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 7 Dec 2005, 6 persons in the Orenburg Oblast (Region) have died
as a result of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [known locally
as "mouse fever"] since the beginning of October 2005, according to Marina
Sherstneva, a senior official of the Orenburg Regional Office of the
Russian (Health) Protection Agency (Rospotrebnadzor). She stated that since
the beginning of 2005, a total of 1158 suspected cases of HFRS had been
recorded in the region. Of these, 16 were children under 14 years of age.
By November of this year [2005], 758 of the suspected cases of HFRS had
been confirmed.
Sherstneva indicated that: "The very warm and dry autumn weather had been
responsible for an increase in the rodent population, which has resulted in
an enhancement of seasonal HFRS disease. This year [2005], the autumn
population of field voles was the highest for 9 years. Furthermore, between
6 and 33 percent of these animals were carriers of the virus responsible
for HFRS. [The virus responsible for these outbreaks of HFRS in the
Orenburg Region of Russia is likely to belong to the virus species _Puumala
virus_, which is a member of the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. - Mod.CP]
Sherstneva declared that 70 percent of HFRS infections were contracted
during outdoor activities, such as fishing, hunting, agricultural work and
during recreation in the countryside. The virus is transmitted also by
inhalation of murine detritus during such agriculturally-related activities
as transportation of hay, straw, firewood, etc.
The disease has been observed in 29 towns and districts of the Orenburg
Region. The highest number of cases have been observed the Orenburg,
Ilekskiy and Tashlinskiy districts.
