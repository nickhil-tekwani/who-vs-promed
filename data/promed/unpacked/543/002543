I was away on vacation when the bear rabies issues began being discussed so
I apologize for this late comment. In yesterday's USA Today (9/7/99) there
was a story questioning whether or not the bear actually had rabies - I
will leave that to the involved laboratories to resolve. On ProMED there
was discussion about off-label use of rabies vaccines for such animals,
again a topic I will not comment on other than to say the Kansas City
Health Department would not recognize as vaccinated any animal given a
rabies vaccine off-label.
What I did not see, however, was any discussion about rabies in bears other
than a comment that only a few wild bears have been diagnosed as rabid.
Therefore I dug through my reprint files and I think ProMED readers should
take a look at an old publication:
Rabies in Experimentally Infected Bears, Ursus spp., with Epizootiologic
Notes R.L. Rausch, Zbl. Vet. Med. B, 22:420-437, 1975
Rausch experimentally infected unweaned black bear and brown bear cubs with
fox rabies virus from Alaskan arctic and red foxes. His results are
presented below. From the descriptions provided, none of the 3 black bear
cubs exhibited aggressive behavior and basically would be considered dumb
rabies. Two of the brown bears, however, were aggressive towards the
researchers. Virus was detected in the saliva of only 2 of the 6 bears with
clinical rabies.
Granted we have learned a lot more about variability of animals to
different rabies variants, but the type of information provided by Rausch
for bears is at least helpful for public health decision making.
