TUBERCULOSIS TRANSMISSION RISK IN AIDS PATIENTS (2)
===================================================
[The original posting described an AIDS patient with tuberculosis.
In reply to the questions asked in the original posting about
assessing risk of transmission to others:]
In short, your assesment of low potential airborne infectivity in this
case is probably reasonable. The absence of cavitary disease lowers risk.
However, patients (HIV-infected patients in particular) can have sputum AFB
smear postive disease (and be potentially infectious) without having
parenchymal infiltrates. Also patients can have chest x-ray and sputum
smear negative, sputum culture positive tuberculosis, which has some, but
low, potential risk of infectivity. Was the lympadenopathy apparent on
chest radiograph (hilar and/or mediastinal adenopathy)? If, so it might
raise the suspicion that the patient has intrathoracic (as well as
disseminated) TB. Did the patient have pulmonary symptoms/signs? The
presence of cough would raise the potential risk of infectivity (and the
absence of cough lower it).
As you may know, a variety of screening strategies are employed
throughout the world, some using chest radiographs as the initial screen,
other using sputum microscopy as an initial screen. For a symptomatic
patient, especially and HIV infected patient with a very low CD4 count,
sputum AFB smears would be in order, obtained by sputum induction if
necessary.
Several pathogenetic mechanisms might underlie this patient's disease. His
disease might repesent an extrapulmonary (with or without pulmonary)
reactiviation of latent TB (in a Mexican born male with reasonable prior
probability of latent TB). Alternatively the patient may have primary
disease with rapid progression of a recently transmitted isolate. Is his
prior tuberculin status known? Is the contact tracing done and is there
disease or infection among his close contacts?
