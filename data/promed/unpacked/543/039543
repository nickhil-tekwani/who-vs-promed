[This is now the 3rd consecutive day with newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported by the MOH in Saudi Arabia. In the past week, there have been a total of 5 newly confirmed cases, and since the beginning of September 2014, there have been a total of 6 newly confirmed cases. One question is whether this is the beginning of another spike in transmission? This current case is reported from Taif in Makkah Province. On 12 Sep 2014 there was another case reported from Taif. Another question is whether there was possible contact between these 2 cases.

A map of Saudi Arabia showing the location of this current case can be found at the source URL.
