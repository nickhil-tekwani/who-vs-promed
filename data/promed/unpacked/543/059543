Following an outbreak of Lassa fever in some parts of the country, Lagos State government, on the weekend [8-9 Sep 2012], alerted residents on the need to maintain adequate personal and environmental hygiene at all times as part of the precautionary measures to prevent the [spread] of Lassa fever in the State. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Jide Idris, who disclosed this in Lagos, explained that the message to the residents became necessary to stem a possible outbreak of the disease in the state in the wake of reported cases in [other] parts of the country.

Dr Idris, who urged members of the public to avoid contact with rats, [instructed] them to cover their food and water properly, while ensuring that they cook all their food thoroughly, as well as block all rat hideouts and holes through which rats could enter the house. The commissioner also counseled the residents to store their grains and other dried food items in containers with covers, as well as keeping pets like cats in the house.

He explained that Lassa fever is an acute viral infection caused by Lassa virus associated with persistent high fever, and added that as the disease progresses into a severe form, the patient begins to develop facial swelling, fluid in the chest, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina, and gut, low blood pressure, shock, disorientation, coma, and kidney and liver failure. According to him, other usual symptoms include general weakness, malaise, headache, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. "Lassa fever is an acute viral infection caused by the Lassa virus and associated with persistent high fever. It is spread by exposure to and eating of foods contaminated with rat droppings or urine. It is also spread by direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of person with Lassa fever," Idris noted. He urged members of the public to report the case of anybody with the symptoms above, or persistent high fever that is not responding to standard treatment for malaria and typhoid fever, to the nearest health facility in the state.

The Commissioner noted that though Lagos state is not in the Lassa fever belt region, members of the public should practice adequate personal and environmental hygiene at all times to avert an outbreak of the disease in the state.

[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat." _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta. A photograph of a multimammate rat can be viewed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mastomys.jpg.

Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea (Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ rats are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained.

Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus from direct contact with rat droppings or urine and through touching objects or eating food contaminated with rat droppings or urine of infected _Mastomys_. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles.

Prevention of Lassa fever in the community centers on promoting good "community hygiene" to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households and keeping cats. Because _Mastomys_ are so abundant in endemic areas, it is not possible to completely eliminate them from the environment.

Lagos State is an administrative division of Nigeria, located in the southwestern part of the country. The smallest in area of Nigeria's states, Lagos State is the most economically important state of the country, containing Lagos, the nation's largest urban area.
