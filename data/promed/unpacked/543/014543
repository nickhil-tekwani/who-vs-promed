A food-borne illness caused by _E. coli_ is behind an outbreak of
illness among dozens of inmates at the Jefferson County jail,
sheriff's officials said Wed 11 Jul 2007.
About 70 inmates have reported symptoms including severe abdominal
cramping, diarrhea, vomiting and a low grade fever. An investigation
began Fri 8 Jul 2007, and 37 inmates were still ill, and one was
hospitalized Wed 11 Jul 2007, sheriff's officials said.
The illnesses were blamed on Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [STEC,
also known as Verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ or VTEC - Mod.LL]. County
health officials were awaiting further test results to determine the
exact strain of the bacterium, said Mark Johnson, head of the county
health department. Health officials were trying to determine what
food might have been contaminated and how.
Historically, outbreaks have been tied to eating under cooked ground
beef, raw milk, un-pasteurized apple juice, contaminated water, red
leaf lettuce, alfalfa sprouts and venison jerky, though the bacteria
have also been associated with poultry, pork and lamb.

[This significant outbreak is being attributed to VTEC, but it is not
clear whether this is a clinical diagnosis or based on microbiologic
information. More information regarding this cluster including
microbiologic confirmation, whether the organism, if VTEC, is O157 or
another somatic antigen type and the vehicle would be appreciated.
Jefferson County, Colorado is located in the Front Range of the Rocky
Mountains, just southwest of Denver. Its county seat is Golden,
Colorado. The location of the county can be seen at:
