Tomato crop hit by leafy curl virus
-----------------------------------
Tomato crop is facing severe yellow leaf curl virus coupled with blight pathogen attack, which has affected its size and yield badly this year. Farmers are now demanding the seed company compensate for the loss.

Authorities were forced to conduct tests and have collected samples from different districts [of Sindh]. The results prove that the crop has been hit by yellow leaf curl virus and early or late blights.

Researchers say the [tomato] variety in question has become susceptible to these attacks. An alternate variety is being advised. Tomato production will be wiped out from Sindh if the seed company does not replace this variety.

[_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_
-------------------------------
_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV; genus _Begomovirus_) originates from the Middle East and is one of the most damaging viruses of tomato worldwide. It can also affect a number of other solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Symptoms on tomato include small chlorotic puckered leaves and stunting of plants. Yield losses of up to 80 per cent have been reported.

The virus is transmitted in a persistent manner by the silverleaf whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B), which in itself is a serious pest of tomatoes and other vegetable crops. TYLCV can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation (poorly) and by grafting, but is not transmitted by seed or contact between plants. The term "seed" in the item above may refer to transplants or seedlings.

Disease management may include use of certified vector and virus free planting material, cultural practices, and removal of infected crop residues and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoirs to reduce inoculum. Control of the vector is most important, but this may cause problems of chemical residues on the fruit and is extremely difficult in open field situations due to the widespread presence and wide host range of the vector.

Field cropping of tomatoes has been abandoned in some areas due to TYLCV. Tomato cultivars with increased levels of resistance or tolerance are available. Transgenic tomato plants incorporating TYLCV capsid protein genes have been found to be resistant to the virus.

Leaf blights
------------
Early blight of potato and tomato is caused by the fungus _Alternaria solani_. It causes leaf spots, fruit rot, and stem lesions on tomato, and leaf spots and tuber blight on potato. The disease can occur over a wide range of climatic conditions and can result in complete defoliation and severe yield losses. The pathogen often causes no visible symptoms until plants approach maturity. It is spread with infected plant material (including tubers, transplants and seed), by mechanical means, wind, and rain. Solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Late blight of tomato and potato is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can affect leaves, stems, and fruit of tomato causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and in potato it affects leaves as well as tubers. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. It is spread by contaminated plant and other material, wind, and water. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management for both blights requires an integrated approach and may include phytosanitary measures, removal of pathogen reservoirs (solanaceous weeds, volunteer crop plants), limiting free moisture in the crop, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material (tomato transplants, potato seed tubers), fungicide sprays of crops, and crop rotation. Use of certified clean propagation material is essential.

--------

In the situation described above, switching to a suitable crop variety with higher levels of TYLCV resistance, combined with use of certified blight pathogen free tomato transplants, appears to be needed to improve yields.
