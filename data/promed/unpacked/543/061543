The World Health Organization (WHO) said it has intensified its response to the cholera outbreak in South Sudan after 63 people have lost their lives and 2340 people treated for the disease. WHO said steps have been taken to conduct comprehensive investigation following up all contact of the cases.

WHO said medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) reported 2 cases of suspected cholera from its hospital in Bentiu. "The 1st case is a 4-year-old female, admitted with malnutrition, pneumonia, and vomiting," it said.

WHO said it is running 3 cholera treatment centers (CTCs) and 3 oral rehydration points (ORPs) in key areas of the city. Its medical teams have already provided cholera treatment to hundreds of people and are in the midst of building 2 additional CTCs and further ORPs.

Aid agencies have warned that the situation is dire and may worsen as the rainy season hits. Hundreds of thousands of people in South Sudan are living in displaced camps which are congested and lack clean water.
