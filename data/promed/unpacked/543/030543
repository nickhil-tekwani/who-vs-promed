Dioxin fears shut Dutch farms
-------------------------------
Over 160 dairy and livestock farms in Holland have been temporarily shut
down, following the discovery of dioxin contamination in some of the feed
given to the animals.
The problem first came to light in October 2004, when routine sampling of
Dutch milk picked up unacceptably high levels of dioxins. An investigation
by the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority soon traced this back to
a dairy farm in Lelystad, which was immediately isolated. Further
investigations found the source of contamination to be potato peelings
supplied by a McCain's potato processing plant.
"On Nov 2 2004, it was confirmed that the potato industry by-product had
been contaminated by marly clay used in the washing and sorting process,"
said Dutch agriculture minister Cees Veerman in a letter to the parliament.
This clay had been supplied by a German company.
As well as isolating the original dairy farm, plus one other found to have
bought contaminated potato peelings, the food safety authority also
suspended all trade in potato by-products by McCain. However, it then
emerged that contaminated peel was also sold to various livestock farms. As
a consequence, some 162 pig, cattle, sheep, and goat farms in Holland have
also been temporarily closed. "These farms remain under government
supervision until test results have demonstrated that the dioxin levels in
the meat do not exceed threshold levels," said Mr. Veerman.
The Dutch authorities insist that there is no danger to the public from
consuming milk. Any of the contaminated milk would have been diluted by
clean supplies at the processor. It also claims that the potato products
from McCain intended for human consumption, while having slightly raised
background levels of dioxin, do not pose a health risk. The dioxin problem
is believed to have spread to Belgium and Germany, with more farms closed
in those 2 countries.
The EU commission's food chain committee will meet next week [week
beginning 8 Nov 2004] to review progress in tracking and containing the
problem.
