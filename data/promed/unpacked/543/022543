Nicaragua declares epidemiologic alert following 260 pneumonia deaths
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a link to a relevant article in the online edition of the
Ecuadorian daily "El Comercio" concerning the pneumonia outbreak
alert in Nicaragua
(<http://www.elcomercio.com/solo_texto_search.asp?id_noticia=137850&anio=2008&mes=8&dia=14>

The article (in Spanish) states that, as per the Director of
Epidemiological Surveillance of MINSA (as the Nicaraguan Ministry of
Health is known), Edmundo Sanchez, there have been over 7000 cases of
pneumonia (as diagnosed in health facilities) in the country
(Nicaragua) during 2008, with 260 deaths, of which 127 occurred in
children younger than 5 years of age. Most of the cases are said to
be due to influenza A H1 virus or respiratory syncytial virus. MINSA
has declared an epidemiologic alert due to the number of cases, which
represents an increase of 10 percent of acute respiratory infections
over last year [2007].

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Compte for abstracting and translating
from Spanish this Agence France-Presse (AFP) News Agency report. This
report underlines the fact that outbreaks of seasonal influenza virus
and respiratory syncytial virus infections can be accompanied by
appreciable mortality (in this case 260/7000 = 3.7 percent).

Outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus in particular are an annual
occurrence worldwide affecting infants and young children
predominately, but not exclusively. Influenza A virus infection is
more sporadic in occurrence but would be expected to have a greater
effect on overall mortality.
