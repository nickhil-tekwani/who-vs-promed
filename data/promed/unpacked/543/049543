New Era Canning Company of New Era, MI is voluntarily recalling 171 cases/6
cans per case of 6 lbs, 5 oz GFS Fancy Blue Lake Cut Green Beans, 4 Sieve,
lot code 19H7FL, because they may be contaminated with _Clostridium
botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death
from botulism. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does
not look or smell spoiled.
The canned green beans were distributed to foodservice customers in
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia and sold through GFS
Marketplace stores in Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The canned green
beans are packaged in 6 lbs, 5 oz cans under the GFS brand (GFS reorder
#118737; UPC 93901 11873) with lot code 19H7FL printed on the end of the
can. No other reorder numbers or lots are included in this recall.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The potential contamination of the product was found through testing by the
Food and Drug Administration. New Era Canning in conjunction with the US
Food and Drug Administration and the Michigan Department of Agriculture is
thoroughly evaluating all processes and procedures to determine the cause
of the problem.
Any food that may be contaminated should be disposed of carefully. Even
tiny amounts of toxins ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the eye or a
break in the skin can cause serious illness. Skin contact should be avoided
as much as possible, and the hands should be washed immediately after
handling the food. Customers should not be encouraged to return product to
Gordon Food Service. Customers who have the product or any foods made with
these products should throw them away immediately. Double bag the cans in
plastic bags that are tightly closed then place in a trash receptacle for
non-recyclable trash outside of the home. Restaurants and institutions are
encouraged to assure that such products are only placed in locked
receptacles which are not accessible to the public. Additional instructions
for safe disposal can be found at

[Photographs of the recalled product can be found at
<http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/photos/newera12_07.html>. Because of
the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if,
as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food. Most of
the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which
could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores
of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
