St Lucie County, on the state's Treasure Coast, reported Florida's 5th fatality due to vibriosis. In addition, new cases were reported in Citrus, Hillsborough, and Santa Rosa counties, bringing the total cases in 2014 to 25. Other fatal cases were reported from Dixie, Duval, Lee, and Sarasota counties in 2014. This follows 2013, when the Sunshine State reported 41 cases and 11 deaths, the highest number of cases reported in the past 6 years.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ is an emerging pathogen of humans. It causes wound infections, gastroenteritis, or a syndrome known as primary septicemia. It was first recognized as an agent of disease in 1976. The 1st documented case of disease caused by the bacterium was in 1979. The bacterium causes disease in individuals who eat contaminated seafood (usually raw or undercooked oysters) or have an open wound that is exposed to seawater. Among healthy people, ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Most _V. vulnificus_ infections are acute and have no long-term consequences.

In immunocompromised people, particularly those with chronic liver disease, _V. vulnificus_ can invade the bloodstream from either a wound or from the GI tract, causing a severe and life-threatening illness called primary septicemia, characterized by fever, chills, septic shock, and death. Blistering skin lesions accompany the disease in about 70 percent of the cases. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 per cent of the time.

These individuals are 80-200 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ primary septicemia than are healthy people. For this particular risk group, the infection carries one of the highest mortality rates of all bacterial infections.

[Eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in their name (in English) may carry a lower risk of infection than eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the adage is no longer very helpful.

Successful isolation of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ from diarrheic stools must start with consideration of this particular organism, as _Vibrio_ spp. and a number of organisms, including the enteropaths of _Escherichia coli_, require special media to either facilitate growth (_Vibrio_ spp. require higher salinity and are referred to as halophilic) or aid to identification (_E. coli_ O157 can be screened for using its lack of fermentation of sorbitol). - Mod.LL
