Last month [September 2022], health officials in Brazil reported the confirmation of an outbreak of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C in the state of São Paulo; 5 cases were reported. This is the most frequent cause of bacterial meningitis in Brazil.

This has prompted the health ministry to reinforce the importance of vaccinating children and adolescents against meningitis.

In Brazil, meningitis is considered an endemic disease. Cases are expected throughout the year, with occasional outbreaks and epidemics. Bacterial meningitis is more common in autumn and winter, and viral meningitis is more common in spring and summer.

Being a serious and contagious disease, meningitis is capable of causing sequelae and even death. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. For meningococcal meningitis, the following vaccines are available:

- Meningococcal C (Conjugate): protects against meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C. Vaccination schedule: 1st dose at 3 months of age, 2nd dose at 5 months of age, and booster at 12 months of age;
- Meningococcal ACWY (Conjugate): protects against meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Vaccination schedule: one dose in adolescents aged 11 and 12, depending on vaccination status.

The National Immunization Program (PNI) is also making the meningococcal C vaccine available to unvaccinated children up to 10 years of age and to health workers. Likewise, the meningococcal ACWY vaccine is being offered temporarily to unvaccinated adolescents 11 to 14 years of age .

The meningococcal ACWY (Conjugated) vaccine is available on the National Vaccination Calendar for 11- and 12-year-olds, but by June 2023, 13- and 14-year-olds will also be able to get vaccinated. The expansion aims to reduce the number of carriers of the bacteria in the nasopharynx.

The age group with the highest risk of illness are children under one year of age; however, adolescents and young adults are primarily responsible for maintaining the circulation of the disease.

The city of São Paulo confirmed this Tuesday [27 Sep 2022] the death of a resident of the East Zone because of meningitis. The woman, who was 42 years old, lived in the Vila Formosa neighborhood, which, together with Aricanduva, in the same region, has already had 5 confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis of the same type C in the last 2 months, which constitutes an outbreak situation, according to the classification of the Municipal Health Department. Due to the scenario, residents of Vila Formosa and Aricanduva are being summoned to go to health centers to be vaccinated against the disease.

Sought by Valor, the Municipal Health Department stated, via the press office, that it recommends vaccination for all residents of São Paulo at public payphones throughout the city. However, it informs that there is no reason for alarm and that vaccination is being recommended as a precaution.

According to data from DataSUS, from the Ministry of Health, vaccination coverage for meningococcal meningitis C is currently 42.5% in the capital of São Paulo and 52% throughout the national territory. In 2015, both were at 98%. "It should be clarified that throughout the city the number of cases has decreased this year compared to 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic. From January until yesterday (26 Sep [2022]) 56 cases of meningococcal disease were reported throughout the capital. During the same period of 2019 (January to September) 158 cases of the disease were registered, that is, a reduction of 64.5% in the general scope."

According to the Municipal Health Department of São Paulo, the serogroup identified in the 5 victims is type C meningococcal meningitis.

As soon as the cases were identified, the Health Surveillance Coordination (Covisa) began to supply preventive medicines to people considered closest to the victims, such as relatives or inhabitants of the same house, in addition to the vaccination intensification in the region. According to the Secretariat, 7400 people in the region have already been vaccinated in the last 15 days.

The São Paulo Health Department clarifies that the vaccine is available in all Basic Health Units (UBSs) in the city and guides vaccination.

[We are told in the news reports above of a cluster of 5 (or perhaps 6) confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal disease (i.e., meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia) caused by serogroup C reported in the same section of the city of São Paulo in the past 2 months. However, we are not told the ages of all cases, their meningococcal vaccination status, if the cases belonged to certain high-risk groups, such as university students living in dormitories or men who have sex with men, had close contact with someone belonging to a high-risk group, or had some other epidemiological link. Also, has there been molecular typing of the meningococcal strains to demonstrate if they are genetically linked?

In the United States, 95% of cases of invasive meningococcal disease are sporadic, each case unrelated to the other cases; meningococcal outbreaks account for only about 5% of reported cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends:

"All cases of meningococcal disease of the same serogroup should be included in the outbreak case count unless molecular typing indicates that the strain from a case is genetically different than the predominant outbreak strain. In outbreaks with well-defined risk groups, probable cases may be included as outbreak associated even if they are unable to be confirmed or serogrouped.

"The outbreak threshold for vaccine decision-making should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the following general guidance:
- Organization-based outbreak: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period
- Community-based outbreak: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period"
(https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf)

Clusters of invasive meningococcal disease have been reported in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia among men who have sex with men (MSM), associated with a high case-fatality rate. All cases were caused by hypervirulent serogroup C strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (MenC) belonging to the sequence type (ST) 11. (Please see ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (08): (FL) fatal, more cases, 17 counties 20220914.8705585.)

Vila Formosa (pop., 94 799 residents in 2007) is one of the 96 districts in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, located in the east side of the city about 4 km [2.5 mi] from Aricanduva (pop., 94 130 in 2008) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vila_Formosa and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aricanduva_(district_of_São_Paulo)). The 2 neighborhoods can be found on a map of Sao Paulo at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Vila+Formosa,+São+Paulo+-+State+of+São+Paulo,+Brazil/Aricanduva,+São+Paulo+-+State+of+São+Paulo,+03906-060,+Brazil/.

More information from knowledgeable sources concerning these cases of invasive meningococcal disease in Sao Paulo would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
