According to the above source, Jordan reported to the OIE the following numbers of human cases of 'bovine tuberculosis' (TB) for the years 2011 and 2012:

2011: 312 cases of bovine tuberculosis, [with an incidence rate of 4.8 per 100 000], ranking 1 among zoonoses, followed by leishmaniasis (136) and brucellosis (119).
2012: 234 cases of bovine tuberculosis, [with an incidence rate of 3.6 per 100 000], ranking 1 among zoonoses, followed by leishmaniasis (103) and brucellosis (96).

For the years 2009 and 2010, bovine tuberculosis was not named among the 4 top ranking zoonoses in humans. Ranks 1, 2 were leishmaniasis and brucellosis.

[The following media report in The Jordan Times dated Sat 30 Mar 2013 may serve as
background information on the current status of human tuberculosis in Jordan:

http://jordantimes.com/ministry-to-halt-implementation-of-plan-to-eliminate-tb
"The [Jordanian] Ministry of Health is planning to put its strategy to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) on hold, according to its secretary general. Deifallah Lozi said the Kingdom is facing new challenges with the discovery of 50 TB [tuberculosis] cases among Syrian refugees, noting that this will affect Jordan's efforts to completely eliminate the disease.

"Speaking late on Thursday [28 Mar 2013] at a ceremony to mark the annual 24 March World TB Day, the secretary general explained that Jordan is one of the few countries worldwide that has met the World Health Organisation's benchmark to reduce the global TB burden ahead of the 2015 target year. The Kingdom achieved this goal in 2010, when TB prevalence in Jordan was 6 cases per 100 000 people, a drop of over 50 per cent from 1995, when it was 14 cases per 100 000.

"However, with the high prevalence of the disease among Syrian refugees, the Kingdom's plans to eliminate it will stop, according to Lozi, who called on the international community to support Jordan in providing healthcare services for Syrian refugees. According to official figures, 330 TB cases were discovered among Jordanians in 2012 [5.1 per 100 000], and 69 cases among non-Jordanians residing in the country.

"In addition, 50 cases -- 5 of them are multi-drug resistant -- were discovered among Syrians in Jordan.

"Also at Thursday's [28 Mar 2013] ceremony, the Jordan Tuberculosis Association announced that it will establish a specialised centre for the treatment of TB patients. Currently, there is only one healthcare centre specialised in treating TB patients, and it is located in Mafraq Governorate, 80 km [49.7 km] northeast of Amman, according to Khaled Abu Rumman, director of the National Programme to Stop TB.

"In 2011, 233 TB cases were detected among Jordanians [3.6 per 100 000], compared with 232 in 2010 and 272 in 2009."

_Mycobacterium bovis_ can be transmitted from infected animals to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected animals. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ can also occur. Following ingestion of _M. bovis_-contaminated food, _M. bovis_ most commonly localizes in cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related lymph nodes with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs. These forms of _M. bovis_ infection occur commonly in children and were common in developed countries during the pre-pasteurization era. Following inhalation of infectious aerosols of _M. bovis_, primary pulmonary _M. bovis_ infection develops with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and other organs.

Reactivation of latent _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection can occur in later life and can clinically resemble disease due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Differentiation of pulmonary infection due to _M. bovis_ from that due to _M. tuberculosis_ requires special microbiologic laboratory tests that are not done routinely.

From the WAHID database, Jordan is said to have 312 and 234 human cases of bovine tuberculosis reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, we are not told how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans in Jordan was confirmed. Routine microbiologic methods allow only identification of "Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex", which includes _M. tuberculosis_, as well as _M. bovis_. To distinguish _M. bovis_ from _M. tuberculosis_, spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions are done. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of _M. bovis_ infection might otherwise be missed.

The numbers of human cases of bovine tuberculosis in the WAHID site do not correspond to numbers given by The Jordan Times for 2011 and 2012. According to the Jordan Times news release above, the official numbers of cases of tuberculosis were 233 and 330 reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. We are not told if these were cases of tuberculosis due to _M. tuberculosis_ alone or were a total of cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ plus cases due to _M. tuberculosis_. These numbers also differ from those reported by WHO for 2011 (312 new cases) for Jordan at https://extranet.who.int/sree/Reports?op=Replet&name=%2FWHO_HQ_Reports%2FG2%2FPROD%2FEXT%2FTBCountryProfile&ISO2=JO&LAN=EN&outtype=html.

Clarification of the numbers of new cases of tuberculosis due to _M. bovis_ and that due to _M. tuberculosis_ in Jordan for 2011 and 2012 would be appreciated, as well as how the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans was confirmed for the cases reported in the WAHID database.
