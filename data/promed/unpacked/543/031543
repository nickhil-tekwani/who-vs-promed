PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2009 (06)
****************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include some other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data
on other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease), are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>


The number of suspected cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh, and the number of deaths of definite and probable
cases due to vCJD remain unchanged since the previous monthly report;
that is, the number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases
remains 164. Four definite/probable patients remain alive, bringing
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases to 168. No cases
of vCJE have been recorded during the 1st 6 months of 2009.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001,
17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007,
only one in 2008, and none so far in 2009.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2009
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 6 Jul 2009 in the UK so far this year [2009], there have
been 68 referrals, 30 cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial CJD,
one case of iatrogenic CJD, 2 cases of GSS, and no cases of vCJD.

So far in the 1st 6 months of 2009, there have been 731 referrals, 29
cases of sporadic CJD, 5 cases of familial CJD and no case of
iatrogenic CJD. There is currently one case of suspected vCJD (no
details provided), but no confirmed case of vCJD.

In total, there have been 23 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD in
France, since 1992 when records began, and currently there is one case
pending. 12 of the confirmed vCJD cases have been male, and 11 female.
The median age is 34 years (range 19 to 58 years), and all have been
Met-Met homozygotes at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Six
patients were resident in the Ile-de-France and 17 in the provinces.

During the period 1 Jan 2009 to 15 May 2009, there were 116 referrals,
of which 66 were classified as prion disease, comprising 37 cases of
sporadic CJD, 14 of familial CJD, and no cases of iatrogenic CJD or
vCJD. (N.B. The prion disease category includes cases where the type
determination is pending but where vCJD has been excluded).

vCJD-related abnormal prion protein in a person with haemophilia - an update
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The finding of evidence of the abnormal prion protein that causes
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in a haemophilia patient at
post mortem, a risk assessment of the possible routes of exposure for
this individual, has been published by the Department of Health [1].
The vCJD-related abnormal prion protein was detected only in the
individual's spleen, but the finding was the 1st of the agent in a
haemophilia patient [2]. To date, no haemophilia or bleeding disorder
patients have been diagnosed with or died from clinical vCJD.

The investigations into the possible routes of infection considered,
assuming that the abnormal prion protein did indicate vCJD infection,
4 possible infection routes: dietary exposure to BSE; surgical
procedures; transfusions with several units of red cells; and
treatment with large amounts of UK sourced Factor VIII. This included
2 batches of Factor VIII 8Y that were sourced from plasma pools which
included plasma from a single donor who later developed clinical vCJD.

The calculations involved in this risk assessment depend on the likely
prevalence of subclinical vCJD infections among the UK population, the
infectivity of plasma products and blood components -- both of which
are subject to great uncertainties -- and the number of donors
contributing to the plasma pools. The risk assessment concludes that
in scenarios based on current evidence, the most likely source of this
patient's infection was treatment with UK sourced clotting factors.

This haemophilia patient had been treated in the 1990s with over 390
000 units of UK-sourced Factor VIII, including over 9000 units from 2
implicated batches of Factor VIII 8Y (linked to a donor who later
developed clinical vCJD).

The risk assessment concluded that, based on plausible assumptions,
the patient was more likely to have been infected by a batch of Factor
VIII that was not sourced from a pool containing plasma from the donor
known to have vCJD (a non-implicated batch), than by one of the 2
implicated batches that were linked to this donor.

This is because far more units of non-implicated than implicated
batches were administered to this patient. Each batch of plasma
product is sourced from many thousands of donors (around 20 000), any
one of whom could have had an asymptomatic abnormal prion protein
infection. The relative risks from implicated and non-implicated
batches will only be clarified further by long-term follow-up of
patients.

The CJD Incidents Panel considered the risk assessment, together with
other information, and concluded that this evidence confirms its
existing advice to patients already notified as at increased risk of
vCJD. There is, therefore, currently no reason to change that advice
or to notify any new groups of patients. There is no change in the
public health vCJD "at risk" status of any patients with bleeding
disorders.

All patients with bleeding disorders [3] who have been treated with
UK-sourced pooled factor concentrates or antithrombin [4] between 1980
and 2001 [5] are classified as "at risk of vCJD for public health
purposes." Special infection control precautions and other safety
measures apply to these patients.

All haemophilia centre doctors were informed of the panel's decision
on Tue 9 Jun 2009 and were asked to send a letter to their patients
who have been notified as at increased risk of vCJD. Further
information is available at <http://www.hpa.org.uk/vcjdplasmaproducts>.

human food chain. The end date of 2001 is the last possible expiry
date of any product manufactured by the UK fractionators that was
sourced from UK donors until 1998.
