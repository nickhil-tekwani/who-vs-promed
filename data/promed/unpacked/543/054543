On Friday [31 Jul 2020], the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) announced that an exotic tick, known as the Asian longhorned tick [_Haemaphysalis longicornis_], has been found in Gallia County.

ODA says the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed the exotic tick.

The tick was found on a stray dog originating from Gallia County, ODA said. The dog was later transported to a shelter in Canal Winchester, and the tick was identified on 28 May [2020] by The Ohio State University and sent to the federal lab for confirmation.

"Due to the nature of this pest, the female ticks can reproduce without a male, so it only takes one tick to create an established population in a new location," said ODA State Veterinarian Dr. Tony Forshey. "This pest is especially fatal to livestock, so producers should practice preventative measures and be on the lookout for this new threat."

The Asian longhorned tick is an exotic East Asian tick that is known as a serious pest to livestock. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 1st confirmed the presence of this tick in the U.S. in New Jersey in 2017.

Asian longhorned ticks are light brown in color. ODA says they are very small, often smaller than a sesame seed [engorged females are much larger, 10mm (0.4in). Nymphs and larval stages are much smaller (see https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal-health-diagnostic-center/testing/protocols/tick-evaluation/longhorned-tick) for images. - Mod.TY].

Livestock producers and owners should notify ODA's Division of Animal Health immediately at 614-728-6220 if they notice unusual ticks.

"They are difficult to detect due to their size and quick movement. They are known to carry pathogens, which can cause disease in humans and livestock and may also cause distress to the host from their feeding in large numbers," ODA said in a press release.

In the United States, the tick has been found in or near counties with large horse, cattle, and sheep populations. To protect against infestations, ODA advises farmers to check their livestock for ticks regularly.

Preventive measures like keeping grass and weeds trimmed, in addition to cleaning away brush on feedlots and pastures, can also help.

[This invasive tick continues to spread rather quickly in the eastern USA. The US Department of Agriculture APHIS publishes information updated monthly on the occurrence of this invasive tick in states and counties. The latest update, as of 15 Jun 2020, reports the presence of the tick in 12 states (see numbers, hosts, and a map at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/tick/downloads/longhorned-tick-sitrep.pdf).

The discovery of the tick in Ohio brings the total to 13 states. The update mentions the importance of this tick for human and animal health. "The tick can reproduce parthenogenetically (without a male); as such, a single fed female tick can create a population. It is also a known/suspected vector of several viral, bacterial, and protozoan agents of livestock and human diseases. This 3-host tick can spread pathogens among a diverse host range, on which it feeds side-by-side with other tick species." - Mod.TY
