[In March 2021, Mali reported an event of HPAI H5N1. 3 outbreaks were reported, affecting poultry farms in the region of Koulikoro, Sikasso, and Bamako (see report at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=32037). In April 2021, 2 more outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were reported in Koulikoro (see report https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=33442)

"The current HPAI epidemic season continues with outbreaks being reported in poultry and non-poultry mainly in Europe, and also in Africa, Americas, and Asia over the 3 weeks covered by the report. Across Europe, various countries continue to note the ongoing infection pressure posed by wild birds with Greece reporting significant mass mortality of Dalmatian pelicans during this period. The predominant subtype noticed in the current epidemic season is subtype H5N1. Compared with previous reports, the number of new events has decreased globally and based on the known global annual seasonal trend of HPAI cases, the spread of HPAI is expected to continue to decline in the coming weeks and months as the February peak has passed. However, the trend can vary between years and world sub-regions, and given the continued reports of wild bird cases, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) urges countries to maintain their surveillance efforts, implement strict biosecurity measures at farm level to prevent the introduction of the disease, continue timely reporting of avian influenza outbreaks in both poultry and non-poultry species, and maintain the high quality of the information provided to support early detection and rapid response to potential threats to both animal and public health."
