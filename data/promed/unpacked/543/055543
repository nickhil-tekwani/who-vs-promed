South Sudan: malaria cases triple in Aweil
------------------------------------------
Since last year [2011], the number of malaria cases in Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal state, South Sudan, have tripled. Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) teams are currently tackling this crisis in the town of Aweil.

Interview with Dr Andre Munger:
What is the scale of this crisis? Between March and August 2012 MSF teams have admitted more than 1000 children suffering from malaria -- 3 times more than in the year before.

Since 2010, the number of people MSF has admitted for malaria has continued to rise and this year is now far worse than previous years. What has caused this surge in cases? In Aweil Civil Hospital, MSF works together with the Ministry of Health to try and reduce maternal and paediatric mortality, treat malnutrition and respond to emergencies.

There were many more mosquitoes in the region not only because the rainy season began earlier than usual but also because the rains were particularly heavy. Also, this year there were no distributions of mosquito nets, which are the best means of prevention.

After severe rains and flooding, some areas became isolated limiting people's access to health services. On top of that, medical stocks to treat malaria ran out for a 2-month period as 2 million anti-malarial treatment kits expected by the Ministry of Health did not arrive until July [2012].

Finally, large numbers of South Sudanese who were living in Sudan have returned to Aweil, South Sudan, since the country's independence. These people have less immunity to malaria and are more likely to develop the disease.

Mortality rates among children with malaria has surged since July due to a lack of medication and because gravely ill children were brought in for treatment too late. Hence, we saw an exceptional mortality rate of 8 per cent in the beginning of September [2012], which came back down to "acceptable" numbers very quickly.

How is MSF combating this spike in malaria cases? More MSF staff have been sent to the area and this extra capacity means more people are able to be hospitalised and cared for in severe cases. In addition MSF is providing support to the outpatient and antenatal services of the Ministry of Health-run sections of Aweil hospital. MSF has been working in Aweil Civil Hospital, in Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal State, since 2008. It is the only hospital in the state, serving a population of about 750 000 people. Takuro Matsumoto/MSFA mobile clinic was set up Maperkot where we already have an ambulatory treatment centre for malnutrition. In the outlying areas of Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal, MSF is providing support to 4 health structures in Arroyo, Akuem, Malek Alel, and Bar Mayen. In just one month, 3180 people presented with symptoms of malaria, such as high fever, and thanks to rapid tests 2064 cases were confirmed as malaria.

MSF also supports 5 health facilities supported by other organisations, as well as 3 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in the fight against the malaria peak. Working with the Ministry of Health, we have transported 93 000 malaria treatment kits to Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal, distributing them in 87 health facilities in the region. Finally, Epicentre, MSF's epidemiological centre, set up a system of surveillance and data collection on the rise in cases.

What can we expect in the months and years to come?
Spikes of malaria generally start in May and begin to subside in September and October, hitting their lowest point in December. However, at the moment there is still flooding in the area and therefore a high number of mosquitoes. Because malaria cases are usually lower at this time of year MSF's activities are correspondingly reduced. However, as there are more cases this year we will continue to combat the outbreak. Thanks to the diverse measures MSF teams have taken to combat this spike in malaria cases, the global mortality has fallen to 5 per cent, which is "reasonable" in an epidemic like this.

MSF in Aweil, South Sudan
Since 2008, MSF has been working in Aweil, a city of around 40 000 inhabitants and the capital of Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal state. In Aweil hospital, the only secondary-care hospital for all of Northern Bahr-el-Ghazal, MSF is supporting the paediatric services (intensive care, tetanus treatment, neonatal care, and nutritional support) and obstetric and gynecological care. Our objectives are to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to respond to emergencies, such as this malaria epidemic.

[South Sudan is highly endemic for malaria. The resistance situation was discussed in our previous posting (Malaria - South Sudan: (Unity): 20111002.2968) and treatment is based on artemisinin combination therapy, ACT. Long-term control probably rests on impregnated bed nets, but the bed net coverage in Sudan and South Sudan are not mentioned in the World Malaria Report for 2011 (http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2011/WMR2011_annex4.pdf). This probably indicates that coverage is low. - Mod.EP
