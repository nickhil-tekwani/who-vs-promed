The Health Secretary, York Chow, says the number of scarlet fever
cases in Hong Kong remains high, at between 10 to 20 a day. He was
speaking after visiting a kindergarten in Central to get a better
understanding of precautionary measures taken against the disease.

Dr Chow said he believed the scarlet fever outbreak would last until
September 2011. He also said the government would monitor children
during their summer activities to prevent the further spread of the
disease.
