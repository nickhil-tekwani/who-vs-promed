Banana wilt spreads to Tanzania
-------------------------------------------
Bacterial wilt has been discovered in villages in the Kagera region
in northwest Tanzania. The disease, which has spread rapidly in
Uganda since it first occurred in 2001 and now affects almost all
banana-growing districts, has also been identified in Democratic
Republic of Congo and Rwanda during the past two years (see also
Uganda's war on wilt at:
<http://www.new-agri.co.uk/05-5/focuson/focuson1.html>).
In Uganda, Banana Bacterial Wilt (BBW) which is caused by the
bacterium _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ affects all
banana types, and causes wilting and premature ripening of the fruit.
The disease remains a significant concern in Uganda, but quick
adoption of control measures by farmers is yielding positive results
as incidences decline and production picks up.
In Tanzania, the affected districts of Muleba and Karagwe are
important banana producing areas with more than 90 percent of bananas
transported to markets outside Kagera. Efforts to advise and train
farmers in affected areas are currently constrained by a lack of
resources and there are concerns that the disease will spread more
widely. Experience shows that once the wilt has become established in
a plantation, control is very difficult and eradication is
effectively impossible. Disease control relies on removal of the male
bud to prevent insect transmission of the disease, cleaning of tools
and burying of all diseased material.

[2] How to prevent the spread of bacterial wilt
Date: Sun 15 Apr 2007
From: Dick Hamilton <rihamilto@shaw.ca>

Disease management of banana wilt depends upon cleaning up in the
production areas. Farmers should avoid introducing contaminated
materials such as cutting knives, animals or visitors (including
traders) which may have come from disease-affected areas. Male flower
buds should be broken off as soon as the fruits have formed. If
disease appears, cut down and dig up the whole of the affected plant
so that it cannot produce any new suckers. Cut the stem, corm, leaves
and any fruits into pieces, and bury all of the pieces completely,
heaping them into a mound by placing cut leaves on the ground,
followed by any fruits, pieces of the corm and cut stems. Allow the
leaves to rot down for at least 6 months before either disturbing the
mound or replanting. During this period do not replant within at
least 5 metres of the infected plant. Better still, kill the whole
stool by injecting herbicide (10-30 ml of 10 percent glyphosate,
according to size) into each of the pseudostems. Leave affected
plants to rot _in situ_, do not cut down or dig up the stems but
remove any fruits or flowers and leave them to rot down at the base
of the plant, enclosed in a plastic bag if possible.
After cutting a diseased plant or digging in the surrounding soil,
all tools must be sterilised so as to avoid spreading the infection
to other plants. Wipe them thoroughly with dilute disinfectant such
as hypochlorite, formaldehyde or alcohol, or heat them well in a
flame or fire. Remember that the neighbouring plants may also have
become infected so watch these carefully and kill them immediately if
disease reappears. Remember to sterilise cutting tools after cutting
each plant.
At present there is nothing one can do to save infected plants. Such
sources should be killed by herbicides or by cutting up affected
plants and burying them in a mound as quickly as possible. Sterilise
tools as previously described. Try to cut diseased plants at the end
of the day so that one can clean the tools at home and reduce the
possibility of spreading the bacteriuim. Routinely remove all male
flower buds of plants that are free of symptoms, breaking them off as
soon as possible, taking care avoid spread. Do not give any planting
materials to neighbours, even if these come from plants that still
appear to be healthy. Do not replant bananas until after all diseased
plants have been removed and no new cases appear. This may take at
least 6 months, making sure that these come from a source that is
free from pests and diseases.
There is no cure for this disease and it can destroy banana gardens
and plantations. Resistance is being sought but as yet no resistant
varieties are known. This advice is tentative and provisional. It
will be improved or changed as new research emerges with new information.

[Thank you to R. Hamilton for this contribution. Please see also E.
Boa's comment in the recent item Banana wilt - Kenya (02). If anyone
can provide actual facts on whether we are observing the spread of
two different diseases -- i.e., bacterial wilt and Panama (fungal)
wilt -- in this African region we would be most interested to hear
from them. Alternatively there may be confusion on what is what by
the different sources.
