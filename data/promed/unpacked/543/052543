The Department of Health (DOH) cautioned the public yesterday against
eating shellfish as toxic red tide organisms have once again been detected
in Manila Bay.
Dr. Eric Tayag, chief of the DOH-Infectious Disease Control Service, said
eating shellfish may lead to red tide poisoning, which is common from May
to August. "These are the months when toxic organisms usually breed," Tayag
said. "There is still no ban on Manila [shellfish, but we are urging the
public to take caution in eating shellfish products during these months."
Results of monitoring by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
(BFAR) showed the presence of the red tide organism, _Pyrodinium
bahamense_, in portions of Manila Bay in Bataan, Cavite and Navotas.
Densities of toxic red tide organisms in the water and shellfish gathered
from these areas, however, remained within the tolerable level. A red tide
shellfish ban is imposed when the organism density is 500 cells per liter
of sea water, and when the red tide toxin level is 40 micrograms per 100
grams of shellfish meat.
The BFAR has already imposed a ban in Balite Bay, Davao Oriental as
shellfish harvested there revealed a toxicity level of 46 micrograms per
100 grams of shellfish meat.
