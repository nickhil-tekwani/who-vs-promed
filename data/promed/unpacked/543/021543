A Peel Public Health physician says the Region's 1st active case of measles in 2014 is a cause for concern. Dr Natalie Bocking, a preventative medicine resident with the agency, said the one known case in Peel -- a Brampton infant who returned home with the virus on a flight to Pearson International Airport from Abu Dhabi on 25 Mar 2014 -- raises red flags because of the highly contagious nature of the infection. "The virus spreads so easily between people. And, because there are pockets of people who are not immunized, (measles) has the potential to spread very quickly. We can (also) develop complications from measles and it can be a very serious infection," said Bocking of the agency's urge to get the word out.

In addition to passengers arriving from Abu Dhabi on Etihad Airways Flight 141, Peel Health is warning residents to be aware of locations in Brampton where the infected child has travelled and people have possibly been exposed to measles. Visitors to Muslim Community Services on Central Pkwy. on [28 Mar 2014] from 8:30 am to 2:20 pm have been exposed to the virus. Also, anyone who attended Kings Cross Pharmacy on Kings Cross Rd. on [31 Mar 2014] from 3-8 pm and [1 Apr 2014] from 6-8 pm is warned that they have also been exposed to measles.

For more information, visit http://peelregion.ca/health or call 905-799-7700.

From 2008-13, there have been only 5 cases of measles in Peel. If you haven't already been immunized against the virus, Bocking said the best defence is a double-dose of the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine. The shot is available to children as young as 6 months in Peel, though the provincial vaccination schedule for MMR is 12 months.

Because of privacy laws, Peel Public Health is unable to disclose whether or not the Brampton infant infected with the virus was even old enough to be vaccinated. [In the US, MMR is not routinely recommended until one year of age, but may be given as early as 6 months of age when an infant is traveling to an area where measles is more common. - Mod.LM]

Similarly to the Peel case, Bocking says most cases tend to be travel-related.

"Measles is considered endemic. It commonly occurs in many other countries around the world," she said, adding that anyone travelling abroad should check with their family doctor to ensure that their immunization records are up-to-date.

"In Canada, we were quite lucky that we were able to decrease measles locally because of a high vaccination rate, but because there is so much travel between Canada and the rest of the world -- in between Canada and countries where it is considered endemic -- if people are not immunized, then they can become exposed and are at risk of developing the infection." A statement issued by Ontario Public Health on [2 Apr 2014] said up until [31 Mar 2014], there have been 11 cases of measles in Ontario -- 5 of which stem from people returning from places such as Europe and Southeast Asia.

Peel Health recently issued a warning asking people who visited Mississauga's Ultimate Sportsplex and Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park on [22 Mar 2014] to check their immunization records as they may have come in contact with a Hamilton resident who had the virus. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, the rate of reported cases of measles across the country rises and falls in various years. The number of cases jumped from just 6 in 2005 to 102 in 2007, before going back down to 14 in 2009. In 2011, Canada saw an outbreak of the virus with 750 documented cases. The majority of those cases (725) were reported in Quebec in people returning from Europe with the virus.

Local health unit officials say an adult with a confirmed case of measles visited a Collingwood hospital in addition to an Alcona restaurant and grocery store. Hospital officials said the risk to the public is very low, but they are advising anyone who accessed the Collingwood hospital's central registration and diagnostic imaging [2 Apr 2014] between 1 and 4 pm and the emergency department waiting room, main emergency department and diagnostic imaging [4 Apr 2014] between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm to check their immunization records to ensure they have had 2 doses of the measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV). Such information can be found on the yellow immunization card or can be provided by family physicians. On Thursday [10 Apr 2014], officials with the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit confirmed they were investigating a confirmed case of measles in an adult in Simcoe County.

They said anyone who visited the Sobeys on Jans Boulevard in Alcona and the Wild Wing on Innisfil Beach Road in Alcona between 12:30 and 3 p.m. [1 Apr 2014] may have been exposed. Patrons who were at the 2 locations outside of the times listed were not exposed, as the virus can only live on surfaces outside the body for up to 2 hours, according to the health unit. Those who have not had 2 doses of the measles vaccine and who have not had measles in the past are at risk of infection. Most adults born before 1970 are assumed to be immune because of previous measles infection. Patients or visitors to those areas who have weakened immune systems (for example chemotherapy patients or those taking immune suppressing drugs) or those who are pregnant should also follow up with their family physicians to confirm their vaccination status.

"While the risk to the public is relatively low, this provides a reminder to anyone who is not yet vaccinated to contact public health or their family physician to update their vaccinations," said Mark Quigg, a doctor in Simcoe County. Anyone who visited the Collingwood hospital locations outside of the times listed were not exposed, but as Dr Colin Lee, associate medical officer of health at the health unit, said, if a person coughs in a room, the virus stays airborne for those hours.

"It's very, very contagious," Lee said. "We've had about a dozen cases imported from outside the province this year alone. This case was caught outside the country." And it's deadly.

An estimated 175 000 deaths worldwide are attributed to measles each year. It can cause pneumonia or brain damage in those affected, but the biggest threat is to children under one year of age who haven't been inoculated. Measles is a contagious virus that spreads easily, particularly to those who are not immune or are vulnerable. The public should watch for symptoms after possible exposure until [25 Apr 2014]. Symptoms are cold-like and include cough and fever, sore eyes that may be sensitive to light, a red rash that lasts for up to 5 days and sometimes small white spots on the inside of the mouth.

Those displaying symptoms should call their health-care provider and tell them they have been exposed to measles. Do not go to your health-care provider's office/medical clinic/hospital without letting them know you think you may have measles so they can take precautions to prevent spreading it to others.

There is currently a measles outbreak in British Columbia. 200 cases have been confirmed in a community in the Fraser Valley. Last year [2013], total, across Canada, there were 83 cases. In 2011, that number was a scant 10. What is going on?

The answer is similar, there is a growing movement where parents will not vaccinate their children. Some will argue that vaccines are connected to autism, pointing to a study which has since been debunked, with both sample selection and a complete inability to replicate it leading it to be tossed out by the medical community. Others will cite religious regions, or their own beliefs on health. All of them are putting their kids, and the children of others, at risk.

Until now, measles largely controlled in Canada, and disease rates have been kept extremely low ever since the 1990s, entirely because of vaccinations. That's a good thing, because it's a disease that is both extremely contagious and dangerous. 330 children die a day from the disease around the world, and there is a risk of death in one of 3000 cases in Canada. Of course, there's no risk of death if you aren't getting the disease at all, and if a kid is vaccinated, they're going to be fine.

The problem is that there is that movement of ill-informed parents that doesn't trust conventional medical wisdom and has decided to reject all of it. They reject everything, which is almost noble in a way, but in the process they are putting their kids, and the children of others, at risk for serious life-changing and potentially life-ending disease.

Here's the simple fact, vaccines have saved lives. That's undeniable, over the years it has been the reason why smallpox, polio and now measles have gone from common, deadly ailments to things that exist largely in the past. There are millions of kids who will not know the danger of contracting measles, that's a fact, and vaccines are the reason why.

Of course, there's going to be people who point to complications arising from some vaccines, and there are certainly risks to any medical procedure. But the results are plain to see, there are simply diseases that no longer have an impact after the widespread adoption of vaccination.

The problem is that since people are not vaccinating their kids, there's a way for the diseases to be reintroduced. After all, it has never been easier to travel around the world, widespread air travel ensures that we can get to the furthest corner with little difficulty. Those far flung corners may still contend with these diseases, and they can and do spread it to other places, where there is no immunity. The only way to keep it from spreading is to ensure that everyone is vaccinated against it.

I can appreciate an unwillingness to trust the medical community, even if I don't share it. But in this case, we're making decisions for people who are not old enough to make decisions on their own. Nobody wants to see their child sick, and perhaps we've forgotten the time when a lot of these childhood ailments ran rampant and actually killed kids. That could explain why vaccines, once embraced, are now rejected. It does not, however, justify that rejection, and vaccination is still important for kids.

An unvaccinated person who has measles may have spread the disease around portions of the Valley, Maricopa County Health Officials said Wednesday [9 Apr 2014].

"Measles is the most contagious disease known to man, which is why when we find one case, we must act quickly to identify additional cases and stop the outbreak as soon as possible," said Dr Bob England, director of Maricopa County Department of Public Health, in a release.

The individual, who has not been identified, visited several areas in the Valley. Anyone who was at the following locations at the following times is asked to monitor themselves and call their health care provider if they notice anything out of the ordinary.

- 29 Mar 2014: Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport Terminal 4 from 6:30 pm until 10 p.m.
- 30 Mar 2014: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Cave Creek Chapel, 38008 N. Basin Road in Cave Creek (Cave Creek, Desert Ridge and Pinnacle Peak Wards) from 1 pm until 5 pm
- 31 Mar 2014: Wildflower Bread Company, 15640 N. Hayden Road in Scottsdale from noon until 5 pm
- 31 Mar 2014: Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport Terminal 4 from 3 pm until 7 pm

Measles symptoms typically surface within 7 to 12 days of exposure, but some cases take as long as 21 days. Symptoms generally begin with a high fever, red, watery eyes, and a cough followed by a raised, red, blotchy rash that moves from the hairline down the body.

It is spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with certain body secretions. It can survive outside the body for hours.

The Connecticut Department of Public Health reported two cases of measles in Fairfield County (in early April [2014]), while New York City reported 16 cases. So far, 51 cases of measles have been reported in the United States just this year [2014]. One Connecticut case was an adult with no record of being vaccinated, and the other was an infant too young to receive vaccine.

Outbreaks of measles in this country in recent years can be traced back to infections imported from other countries by an unimmunized person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, primarily from a measles epidemic in Western Europe. However, vaccination programs help to keep widespread infection with the disease in check. In order to attend school in Connecticut, children have to be vaccinated, although parents can claim religious exemption. Some parents refuse vaccination because of a belief that vaccines cause autism, even though no link has ever been found.

Measles is a highly contagious disease spread through the air. Symptoms include fever, runny nose and watery eyes, cough, and a rash. The rash typically spreads from the head at the hairline to the trunk and the rest of the body. Possible complications can include ear infections and hearing loss, pneumonia, brain inflammation, and even death.

Before an effective vaccine for measles was developed in 1963, 3 to 4 million people would be infected with the disease each year. So even though incidence of the disease has risen in the past few years, it is still much lower because of vaccination programs. At least one dose of measles vaccine is recommended for anyone over 18 years of age born after 1956 if they do not have documentation of having the disease. RVNA [Ridgefield Visiting Nurse Association] offers a wide range of adult vaccinations for routine and travel protection; call 203-438-5555 for an appointment.

The California Department of Public Health, in its [11 Apr 2014] report, announced that the number of confirmed measles cases in the state had risen to 56. In 2013, the entire state of California had just 4 reported measles cases for the same period. Orange County is the center of the largest outbreak and reports 22 cases for 2014.

The state of Washington has had 12 confirmed cases of measles thus far in 2014. 6 of the cases are linked to the measles epidemic just across the border in British Columbia. The remaining cases appear to be tied to a patient who was contagious for several days in March [2014] and visited a number of eating and drinking establishments in the San Juan area. The 1st 5 cases are among his friend and family. The latest case, announced 11 Apr 2014, was a patron of an establishment at the same time as the original patient.

In British Columbia, Fraser Health announced a total of 375 measles cases on [9 Apr 2014]. The public health authority stated that the second wave of infections appeared to be over. The statement is unclear if this means the end of the epidemic.

Also on [9 Apr 2014, British Columbia's Health Minister, Terry Lake, announced that he was replacing the board chair of the Fraser Health Authority. The 3.5 year tenure of David Mitchell in that position came to an end as the province was conducting a thorough strategic review of the agency. Unlike public health authorities in many parts of the United States, Fraser Health also operates hospitals and other healthcare providers. The review is examining performance in those units of the agency.

In the Phoenix, Arizona area, an alert was issued [9 Apr 2014] for a confirmed case of measles. From [29-31 Mar 2014], the patient was contagious and may have exposed others to the viral illness at the airport, an LDS chapel and a bread store in Scottsdale.

The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control shows 108 measles cases nationally from [1 Jan 2014] through [5 Apr 2014]. There is often a lag in case reporting between the states and the CDC. The current national total is the third highest in the last 6 years. There were 220 total measles cases in all of 2011 and 189 in all of 2013.

Health authorities are on the watch for people showing symptoms of measles after a confirmed case was reported last week by Baystate Medical Center.

The contagious person is a faculty member at Smith College, according to Northampton Public Health Director Merridith O'Leary. Health officials narrowed the location where the person came into contact with others to 2 buildings on campus and identified those who were in the buildings at the time, O'Leary said.

On [Sun 6 Apr 2014], Smith posted a notification on its website, saying anyone who was in Dewey or Hatfield hall on [31 Mar 2014] could have been exposed. Those who been vaccinated for measles or were born before 1957 are considered immune and not at risk. The college has asked those who feel they might be at risk to contact Smith's Health Services. It also advised visitors to Smith over the next few weeks to check their immunization status before spending time on campus.

Smith spokesperson Marti Hobbes said no other cases of measles have been reported.

According to O'Leary, most people in the US have been vaccinated for measles. Those who haven't include babies under 12 months of age and fetuses.

"Measles is a huge risk to those who haven't been vaccinated," O'Leary said.

Measles produces flu-like symptoms, including fever and a runny nose. A rash also appears. Carriers are considered contagious 4 days before and after the rash manifests itself. Symptoms typically develop 10-14 days after a person has been exposed. Measles is transmitted through the air via coughing, sneezing or talking.

O'Leary emphasized the importance of being vaccinated, noting that measles is preventable. If contracted, however, there is no effective treatment. She also pointed out that those who choose not to be vaccinated are putting others at risk. Once a person is confirmed to be exposed, the health department will quarantine them from the general population.

The Washington State Department of Health recently issued a warning of a case of measles in Western Washington.

A Whatcom County woman traveled to several locations in Seattle and Pierce County. She was at the Kings of Leon concert at KeyArena on [28 Mar 2014] and also at the Best Western Loyal Inn and the Wasabi Bistro. She visited Beth's Cafe, Aurora Suzuki, Starbucks on First Street and Pine Street and the Pike Place Market, according to the Department of Health news release.

The woman's case was linked to a measles outbreak in British Columbia. Measles is highly contagious and can cause severe illness with rash, fever, cough, eye irritation, and can be fatal and can be contagious before a rash appears.

Local doctor Robert Wagner of South Whidbey Pediatrics and the Department of Health encourage children to be vaccinated twice and adults to be vaccinated at least once to reduce the risk of catching the potentially fatal disease.

State health officials said the measles outbreak in Washington has continued to spread, and passengers aboard the ferry M/V "Tacoma" during morning sailings on [Fri 4 Apr 2014], from Bainbridge Island may have been exposed to the measles virus.

Authorities said a Kitsap County resident, described as a man in his 40s, visited several places in Friday Harbor, including a restaurant where a contagious San Juan County man was at the same time.

San Juan County now has 5 cases of measles, and Kitsap County has one. In Whatcom County, the case count remains at 6.

According to state health officials, the Kitsap County man may have been exposed to measles [21 Mar 2014] at Cask and Schooner Public House and Restaurant, where San Juan County's 1st case was also present while contagious.

The Kitsap resident also traveled around Puget Sound while contagious, going to Seattle from Bainbridge Island on the ferry, then flying to Friday Harbor.

A list of the places visited by both cases while they were contagious is available online. Anyone who was in those places at the listed times should find out if they've been vaccinated for measles or have had measles before.

Times and locations of possible public measles exposures on Bainbridge Island, which include the 2 hours of potential exposure after the person with measles left each location, is:

4 Apr 2014
----------
- 6 am to 8:20 am Washington State Ferry passenger walk-on terminal, Bainbridge Island;
- 6:20 am sailing Washington State Ferry "Tacoma," Bainbridge Island to Seattle -- passenger area;
- 6:45 am to 9:15 am Washington State Ferry passenger terminal, Seattle;
- 7:05 am sailing Washington State Ferry "Tacoma," Seattle to Bainbridge Island -- passenger area;
- 7:55 am sailing Washington State Ferry "Tacoma," Bainbridge Island to Seattle - passenger area;
- 8:45 am sailing Washington State Ferry "Tacoma," Seattle to Bainbridge Island -- passenger area;

9 Apr 2014
----------
- 10:30 am to 4 pm Virginia Mason Bainbridge Island Medical Center (380 Winslow Way E).

People who are unvaccinated, or aren't sure if they're immune, and develop an illness with fever and unexplained rash should consult a health care professional immediately. Call ahead to their clinic, doctor's office, or emergency room before arriving so people in waiting rooms aren't exposed.

Officials noted that measles is highly contagious even before the rash starts, and is easily spread when an infected person breathes, cough or sneezes. People can get the measles just by walking into a room where someone with the disease has been in the past couple of hours.

Washington typically has 5 or fewer measles cases per year. So far in 2014, there have been 12.

[10] USA (New York City): 2011 outbreak traced to fully vaccinated patient

Measles outbreak traced to fully vaccinated patient for 1st time
----------------------------------------------------------------
Measles vaccination rates top 90 percent in high-density cities like New York, but new data suggest even the immunized can catch and spread the disease.

Get the measles vaccine, and you won't get the measles -- or give it to anyone else. Right? Well, not always. A person fully vaccinated against measles has contracted the disease and passed it on to others. The startling case study contradicts received wisdom about the vaccine and suggests that a recent swell of measles outbreaks in developed nations could mean more illnesses even among the vaccinated.

When it comes to the measles vaccine, 2 shots are better than one. Most people in the United States are initially vaccinated against the virus shortly after their 1st birthday and return for a booster shot as a toddler. Less than 1 percent of people who get both shots will contract the potentially lethal skin and respiratory infection. And even if a fully vaccinated person does become infected -- a rare situation known as "vaccine failure" -- they weren't thought to be contagious.

That's why a fully vaccinated 22-year-old theater employee in New York City who developed the measles in 2011 was released without hospitalization or quarantine. But like Typhoid Mary, this patient turned out to be unwittingly contagious. Ultimately, she transmitted the measles to 4 other people, according to a recent report in Clinical Infectious Diseases that tracked symptoms in the 88 people with whom "Measles Mary" interacted while she was sick. Surprisingly, 2 of the secondary patients had been fully vaccinated. And although the other 2 had no record of receiving the vaccine, they both showed signs of previous measles exposure that should have conferred immunity.

A closer look at the blood samples taken during her treatment revealed how the immune defenses of Measles Mary broke down. As a 1st line of defense against the measles and other microbes, humans rely on a natural buttress of IgM antibodies. Like a wooden shield, they offer some protection from microbial assaults but aren't impenetrable. The vaccine (or a case of the measles) prompts the body to supplement this primary buffer with a stronger armor of IgG antibodies, some of which are able to neutralize the measles virus so it can't invade cells or spread to other patients. This secondary immune response was presumed to last for decades.

By analyzing her blood, the researchers found that Measles Mary mounted an IgM defense, as if she had never been vaccinated. Her blood also contained a potent arsenal of IgG antibodies, but a closer look revealed that none of these IgG antibodies were actually capable of neutralizing the measles virus. It seemed that her vaccine-given immunity had waned.

Although public health officials have assumed that measles immunity lasts forever, the case of Measles Mary highlights the reality that "the actual duration [of immunity] following infection or vaccination is unclear," says Jennifer Rosen, who led the investigation as director of epidemiology and surveillance at the New York City Bureau of Immunization. The possibility of waning immunity is particularly worrisome as the virus surfaces in major US hubs like Boston, Seattle, New York, and the Los Angeles area. Rosen doesn't believe this single case merits a change in vaccination strategy -- for example, giving adults booster shots -- but she says that more regular surveillance to assess the strength of people's measles immunity is warranted.

If it turns out that vaccinated people lose their immunity as they get older, that could leave them vulnerable to measles outbreaks seeded by unvaccinated people--which are increasingly common in the United States and other developed countries. Even a vaccine failure rate of 3 percent to 5 percent could devastate a high school with a few thousand students, says Robert Jacobson, director of clinical studies for the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn't involved with the study. Still, he says, "The most important 'vaccine failure' with measles happens when people refuse the vaccine in the first place."

A West Central Illinois Health Organization has confirmed a 2nd case of the vaccine-preventable disease, measles, in the state.

"Measles is an extremely contagious viral infection that is almost 100 percent preventable with a safe and effective vaccine. Measles can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and even death in those who are not protected," said Andrew Bonwit, MD, pediatric infectious disease expert at Loyola University Health System.

Dr Bonwit is available to comment on the dangers of measles and also the importance of vaccines.

At least 7 children have been killed while 185 others hospitalised due to the recent outbreak of measles in a village near Keenjhar Lake, Thatta [District, Sindh province].

Representative of various leading humanitarian organisations linked the outbreak of measles to the use of contaminated water of Keenjhar Lake. The death of 7 children took place in Sonehri village, located close to Keenjhar Lake. The village has 550 families, mostly depending on fishing and cultivation for their livelihoods.

The villagers said that only 50 per cent population has access to get water from the filter plant installed by a non-governmental organisation, while the remaining population has no other option but to use water from the government's water supply line, which is said to be smelly and contaminated. The villagers accused the government authorities of ignoring them.

The releasing of industrial chemicals into Keenjhar Lake ignited the measles outbreak, killing 7 children and inflicting around 185 others in Sonahri Village and its neighbourhoods. The fishermen said that neither they have job to feed their children properly nor health facilities in the area to get treatment in emergency.

The government's apathy could be gauged from the fact that some of the medical practitioners, who were deputed at major government hospitals, are running their private clinics in the scattered villages and are reluctant to provide help to the ailing children.

"When we took our 3-year-old child to a nearby private clinic in Sonda Village, the doctor didn't even come out to suggest us what to do. We stayed outside the clinic for 2 hours, crying for help but returned home hopelessly. Again we hired a vehicle on Rs 8000 [about USD 83] to take the child to Makli Hospital. However, the child expired at hospital before reaching any medical aid," the father of the victim narrates the tale of apathy. He has lost his 2 children, a boy and girl, in the same disease one after the other. A 4-member team of Pakistan Fisher-folk Forum (PFF) after visiting the affected area quoted the parents, saying despite getting their children vaccinated they are facing horrible situation. According to the villagers, so far, they have buried 7 dead children who became victims of the measles.

It is for the 1st time the people are experiencing disastrous situation, but the government officials are reluctant to declare emergency to avoid further loss.

They said that doctors are still unable to share cause of the outbreak that is said to be similar to the one which killed a large number of children in Shikarpur district after the 2010 flooding. It was the contaminated water there which caused deaths of several children.

The team collected information of about 185 children affected by the diseases (measles and pneumonia), where 7 children [2-11 years old] reportedly have died.

The villagers said that the failure of health services is also aggravating the problem. No health facilities are functional properly to benefit the people.

The parents are facing difficulties to take their children to major hospitals in Thatta and other cities for treatment because of poverty. Many times they starve hunger; they have empty pockets; they even cannot afford to visit private clinics, said [a parent]. There is dispensary in village Sonehri, which remained closed most of the time. After this phenomenon, the dispensary has been made functional for the sub immunisation activity of the affected children. Moreover, the dispensary only provides medicines for fever, cough and other ailments as 1st aid. After receiving a measles or pneumonia patient, the staffers refer the patient to Makli Hospital, Thatta Civil Hospital, Jinnah Hospital Karachi and other private clinics for getting better treatment.

PFF chairperson Mohammed Ali Shah said the efforts against hunger and poverty could be fruitless without protecting natural resources. Fresh water lakes are the natural assets and degradation of such resources due to flawed policy and carelessness resulted in such outbreaks of diseases.

He also appealed to the authorities concerned to take precautionary measures as Keenjhar Lake is the main source of supplying water to Karachi. "When we can reach here to help the people, why the government is reluctant to visit the affected areas and declare emergency to help the people," he criticised the officials. He said the people, who are facing malnutrition, joblessness and acute poverty, are unable to take their loved ones to the hospitals.

Thatta Medical Officer Hassan Gandro said that the recently launched vaccination covered more than 5000 children in Sonda Union Council. The measles outbreak was reported at the end of March and now it has panicked the wide area. The PPP-led Sindh government is seemingly silent as it could not initiate any move to extend helping hand to save the lives of children.

[While the report above does not clearly distinguish the diseases causing childhood morbidity and mortality, measles is not difficult to recognize and may be complicated by pneumonia in some children. Therefore, there is most certainly a measles outbreak in progress. Clearly, contaminated water is not at fault, but the lack of infrastructure might be expected to accompany an inadequate vaccination program.

[13] Viet Nam

According to the Health Ministry, 25 children, most from the northern region of Viet Nam, have died of measles since the end of last year [2013].

Medical experts say that the genotypes of the measles virus in Viet Nam are no different than those of other countries in the world, and that its virulence has not suddenly increased. Therefore, the diagnostic treatment guidelines can remain unchanged.

They also say that the measles epidemic is now on a downward trend. The measles vaccination schedule has not changed and health professionals insist that the vaccine is safe and effective.

Dr Tran Dac Phu, Director of the Department of Preventive Medicine, says that from the end of last year, there were more than 3,300 cases of measles. Of those, 25 children died.

According to Phu, the disease has appeared in 59 provinces in the north and the south. The number of children under one year of age accounted for 16 percent.

The majority of cases can be attributed to children failing to be vaccinated, often because parents were not aware of the vaccination, or not aware of their child's vaccination status. Notably, 4 percent of the patients had been fully vaccinated, with two doses, but nevertheless still caught the disease. The causes of the deaths were due to measles-related pneumonia.

The measles epidemic in Viet Nam occurs within the overall context of the world, based on 3-4 year cycles, experts say.

Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long urges all provinces to complete their measles vaccination programs in April [2014.

[According to the newswire above, the Viet Nam Ministry of Health has reported more than 3300 measles cases from 59 out of 63 provinces, since the end of 2013. Among those, 25 died.

According to WHO statistics, as of 7 Apr 2014 there have been 1487 suspected cases of measles reported in Viet Nam in 2014, of which 941 were confirmed -- 687 were laboratory confirmed, 250 were confirmed through an epidemiologic link to laboratory confirmed cases, and 4 were clinically confirmed. The annualized measles incidence rate per 100 000 population is 6.10 cases, compared with 2013 when there were 1102 confirmed cases and an annual measles incidence rate of 1.2 per 100 000 population (see http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/active/measlesreportedcasesbycountry.pdf), suggesting that 2014 may be a year of increased measles incidence in Viet Nam.

A measles outbreak in the Philippines has infected 23 Singaporeans who had travelled there since January [2014], said an alert from the Ministry of Health (MOH).

They are among 80 people here have come down with measles so far this year [2014]. This is high, given that the annual numbers were 46 and 38 respectively for the past 2 years.

But the risk of an outbreak here is low, said the MOH, as most people are vaccinated against this highly contagious disease.

It said that half the people who were infected here this year [2014] were young children who had missed their vaccination.

The local Health Department confirmed that during the 1st quarter of 2014, 102 cases of measles have been reported in Catalonia, most of them in Barcelona, and 24 percent of affected persons were healthcare personnel.

Additionally, there are 16 suspected cases pending confirmation of their diagnosis; healthcare authorities recommend that persons suspected of having measles must undergo isolation measures in order to prevent the occurrence of new cases, avoiding the airborne transmission of this disease during its communicability period.

The possible origin of this outbreak was an imported case and the link between the index case and the other persons affected is located in a Barcelona neighborhood. 12 additional cases were reported in Girona province, which were initially related to Barcelona cases.

28 of the confirmed cases during this time period (27.4 percent of the total number of reported cases), had to be hospitalized. None of then was vaccinated against measles, or had an incorrect vaccination schedule.

At the end of February 2014, Catalonia healthcare authorities reported a measles outbreak affecting 28 persons, and this means that during a 5 week period, up to 7 Apr 2014, 76 new cases occurred, and there are still 18 cases in which a confirmed diagnosis is still pending.

During the last measles outbreak, one of the main sources for transmission was within healthcare facilities, particularly in waiting rooms, as it was recognized by the Health Department in a published report.

Amongst affected persons during the 1st quarter of 2014, 62 (60.8 percent) were between 5 and 52 years old, and only 13 patients were less than 5 years old.

After learning that one of every 4 affected persons is a healthcare worker, health authorities recommended that every healthcare worker should be immunized against measles, including physicians, nurses, technicians, and transport personnel.

Since 2000, when autochthonous cases of measles were eliminated from Catalonia, occasionally imported cases have occurred giving rise to outbreaks with limited numbers of affected persons.

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. It is usually transmitted through direct contact with nasal or throat secretions from infected persons and, less frequently, through contact with objects recently contaminated with the aforementioned fluids.

Symptoms of measles usually include fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, dry cough, and conjunctivitis.
