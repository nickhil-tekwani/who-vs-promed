Foot-and-mouth subsides in Viet Nam key regions
-----------------------------------------------
There have been no new cases of foot-and-mouth [FMD] infection among cattle
in Viet Nam's major previously infected localities in the last 21 days,
suggesting an end to disease outbreaks in the region.
Dak Nong and Dak Lak provinces in the central region and Hanoi and Hai
Phong cities in the north have been all but cleared of the epidemic, said
the National Veterinary Department on Saturday [8 Jul 2006].
However, FMD continues to plague several localities on a small scale,
including northern Lai Chau and central Quang Nam provinces, the department
added.
The deadly cattle disease had spread to nearly half of Viet Nam by early
last month [June 2006].
