A major tour operator has announced that it is withdrawing from the
Dominican Republic in response to reports of gastrointestinal infections,
including typhoid and cholera, in the majority of [vacationers. Although
only 14 laboratory reports citing travel to the Dominican Republic have
been received by SCIEH in 1996/97, there are two notable features: firstly,
all but three of these were reported in 1997, reflecting the increasing
flow of travelers; secondly, this group comprises infection with 12
different organisms (6 species of _Salmonella_, including one _S.
paratyphi_; two _Campylobacter_; and one each of _Aeromonas hydrophila_,
_Cryptosporidium_ sp., _Giardia intestinalis_ and _Plesiomonas shigelloides_).
SCIEH has also received queries regarding health problems following
possible exposure to insecticides or other chemical toxins.

travelers to this vacation spot may develop gastrointestinal disease. Too
bad, it's a beautiful part of the world. - Mod.ES
