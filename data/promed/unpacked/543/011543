Alert for coffee growers - emergence of a new disease
-----------------------------------------------------
According to the chairman of the Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindio,
Jose del Carmen Prieto, various plantings have been lost in this department
because of cercospora leaf spot. The disease is attacking the trees not on
a huge scale, but in a very aggressive way.

"Fortunately, it is not a widespread problem, but rather for individual
plants or small groups of trees. There are no means to control it and that
gives us an unfavourable outlook," he said.

The disease exacerbates the existing crisis due to pests and rust [see
ProMED-mail posts 20090225.0773 and 20091008.3490] in Quindio as a result
of the current heat wave and lack of fertilisers.

[Cercospora leaf spot (brown eye spot) of coffee is caused by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella coffeicola_ (previously _Cercospora coffeicola_). The
fungus can also cause berry blotch disease. Symptoms include expanding
brown leafspots with an eye-like appearance as well as spots on the fruits
resembling sunburn or scars, which make berries difficult to pulp and may
reduce the green bean quality. Stress factors, such as lack of fertilisers
mentioned above, may predispose plants to infection.

The disease is favoured by high humidity, rain, warm temperature, and
drought stress after flowering. Exposed, unshaded trees and nursery
seedlings are most susceptible. Disease management includes mainly cultural
practices, but serious outbreaks may require copper fungicides.

Leaf spot diseases on a range of crops can be caused by related fungi
previously classified as _Cercospora_ species. While some of them have
since been attributed to different genera, the diseases are often still
referred to as cercospora leaf or eye spots.
