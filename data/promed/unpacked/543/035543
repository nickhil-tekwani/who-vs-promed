Outbreak of Gastroenteritis Associated with Raspberry Desserts (LCDC; Sant
Canada): Quebec
Between July 28 and August 9 more than 200 people, who were part of 8
different events in Quebec, became ill with gastroenteritis. The common
link between the events was a caterer who had prepared the meals. Desserts
containing raspberries or raspberry puree, and cream were epidemiologically
linked to illness. The median incubation period was 36 hours and illness
generally lasted 24 hours.
Analysis of stool specimens to date suggests a viral etiology. No parasites
or [pathogenic? bacteria have been found. The means of contamination of the
food is under investigation.
