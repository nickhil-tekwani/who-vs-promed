[The Lao People's Democratic Republic has a poultry population of approximately 20 million, with 80 per cent owned by smallholder farmers.

"Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments [Note: Lao PDR reported a human case on 13 Oct 2020 in Saravan province, see ProMED 20201113.7939962.- Mod CRD]. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.

"With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans. Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses."
