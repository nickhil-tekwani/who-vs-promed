It was suggested that a factor in the transmission of Brucellosis in elk
(wapati) (_Cervus elaphus_) is the eating of afterbirth. Many, (most?),
mammals eat afterbirth. In my experience as a veterinarian it is only the
mother that does this at the time of delivery. In that case, the
afterbirth would not be infected unless the mother was already infected.
Although I agree with Dr. Prouty that it is usually the mother that eats
the afterbirth, it has been common knowledge among those of us in the
business of Brucellosis Eradication, that many more animals sniff and
specially lick newborns, fetuses, and afterbirths. Since these tissues are
covered with millions of _Brucella_ (from infected dams), it has been known
to be the most common way of transmitting the disease to other susceptible
animals, especially in cattle. My guess is that this same pattern occurs
and is probably the most common way of Brucellosis spread in Elk (wapati) (
_Cervus elaphus_). In addition, it has been observed that carnivores will
drag these tissues a considerable distance and in this way potentially
expose other susceptible animals.
