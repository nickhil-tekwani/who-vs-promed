Health officials say more pigs across Malaysia will be infected by Nipah
virus, which has already killed more than 100 people, news reports said
today.
Malaysia has been conducting random tests on pigs throughout the Southeast
Asian nation, according to Veterinary Services Director General Dr. Mohd
Nordin Mohd. Nor. Any hog farm found with just one infected pig [defined as
having antibody, as far as we can tell - Mod.CC] must destroy its entire
stock, he was reported as having said. Whereas Nipah virus first was
observed to have killed pigs and humans in Negri Sembilan state in western
Malaysia where 84 people died, the virus has since swept into the states of
Perak, Johor, Kelantan, Malacca and Selangor.
Health officials initially believed the disease was Japanese encephalitis,
[the etiologic agent of] which is transmitted from pigs to humans by
_Culex_ mosquitoes. Later, scientists identified a new virus, named Nipah
after the Malaysian village where it claimed its first victim.
The eight-month outbreak has ruined the pig-farming industry in many parts
of Malaysia. Pig farmers in the worst-hit area, 60 miles southeast of the
capital of Kuala Lumpur, abandoned their homes in March.
A farm in Sungai Buloh, Selangor, has been listed as "high risk" after one
of its workers was admitted to hospital on May 14 and fell into a coma,
Selangor executive councillor Datuk Abdul Fatah Iskandar said yesterday.
Fatah said the Sungai Buloh farm had 2,600 pigs and "some of its pigs are
also coughing, a symptom of Nipah infection."
Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Abu Bakar Suleiman said the ministry
expected some farms outside the outbreak areas to be tested positive
because "of the way pigs were moved all over the place. "I am more
concerned about farmers and workers taking precautions to protect
themselves from being infected by the pigs," Dr Abu Bakar said in an
interview.
[Bernama reported that] the government is no longer allowing military
personnel to be involved in pig culling operations and following the
decision, the operation to put down the animals in five pig farms in Alor
Gajah [in Malaka] today had been shelved. State Secretary Datuk Wira Abdul
Aziz Omar said confirmation of the government decision had been conveyed
early this morning. "Thus the operation scheduled to commence at about 8 am
today had to be shelved as there are no shooters," he said. Pig culling
operations planned for Perak and Johor were also facing the same problem
following the decision prohibiting members of the armed forces to be
involved, he said.
The operation in Alor Gajah was said to be deemed urgent as the state
government feared the possibility of an increase in the number of pigs that
had to be destroyed as the results of the tests on blood samples taken from
pigs in 93 other farms throughout the state had yet to be received.

[The reports painted a rather grim picture of the present status of the
Nipah virus encephalitis outbreak in peninsular Malaysia. There should be
no doubt that Nipah virus has already spread countrywide, at least among
pigs. At least one new yet-to-be-confirmed human case (patient is now in a
coma) has been reported. To make matter worse, military personnel have been
taken off pig culling operations, resulting in delay in culling of infected
pigs because of lack of shooters. - Mod. CYC]
[Given that wild birds are a natural amplifying host for Japanese
encephalitis virus, what will happen next mosquito season when mosquitoes,
infected by feeding on such birds, look for a mammalian vertebrate blood
meal? If there won't be any pigs around for them to feed on will they
quest for other large vertebrates, such as humans? - Mod.CC]
