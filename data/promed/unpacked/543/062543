In government news, the Ministry of Health of Belize has embarked on a
campaign to detect and control the spread of leptospirosis which is
believed to have caused the death of one child in Benque Viejo del Carmen.
According to the Ministry a resident of Orange Walk has also tested
positive for this bacterial disease transmitted from animals such as rats
to humans. A public health education program is being carried out and
rodent control efforts will be heightened. Health care professionals will
be made aware of the possible source of the infection and how to provide
treatment. An investigating team will be in the Cayo District tomorrow and
then move on to Orange Walk. The report of the Ministry's efforts was made
at today's Cabinet meeting in Belmopan.(Very rare that leptospirosis is
diagnosed here. Not meaning the disease is uncommon, but rather that it is
seldom properly diagnosed. Peter Singfield).
