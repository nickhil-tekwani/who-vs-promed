Missoula County placed under rabies quarantine; skunk bit woman
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Montana Department of Livestock has placed Missoula County under a rabies quarantine after an infected skunk bit a woman last Wednesday [9 Sep 2015].

It is the 1st time in nearly 2 decades that a case of terrestrial -- non-bat -- rabies has been found in the county. The quarantine was implemented on [14 Sep 2015] and will last 60 days. All dogs, cats and ferrets must have current rabies vaccinations for a minimum of 28 days prior to travel outside the county.

The woman was walking in the Harpers Bridge Road area west of Missoula when she was bitten [9 Sep 2015]. "The skunk that bit her was acting very abnormally and aggressively," said Missoula County Environmental Health Director Jim Carlson.

The next day, a neighbor submitted a skunk for testing that he captured after it had an encounter with one of his dogs. The results were positive.

Carlson said officials have no idea whether the skunk that was captured was the same one that bit the woman, so Missoula County Animal Control officials are trying to trap all skunks in the area for testing. "There's a really good chance that was the one, but we're not 100 percent (positive)," said Missoula County Animal Control Supervisor Jeff Darrah. "We have some traps out there, but so far we haven't caught any."

Carlson said the bite victim has begun the rabies post-exposure treatment, and notification has been given to area residents. "She is receiving rabies immune globulin plus normal vaccination," Carlson said. "Ordinarily, when it's a human or animal being immunized, it takes about 28 days to build up enough antibodies to be effective. So blood is taken from an animal that has been infected and they concentrate the immune material and give you that so you develop your own immunity. You are using antibodies from somebody or something else."

Carlson said the victim is doing fairly well, all things considered, and should make a full recovery. ["Recovery" from what? Symptoms had not appeared. I think he means that the vaccination should successfully prevent disease. - Mod.MHJ] "She started the treatment well within the window of need and there should not be any problems," he said.

The Department of Livestock and Animal Control are working together on the management of exposed domesticated animals.

Four privately owned dogs and one colony of 15 to 20 feral cats appear to have been exposed so far. Three of the 4 dogs were past due on rabies vaccinations and will be placed under a 6-month quarantine. "A long quarantine period is inconvenient and can be expensive for the owner," said assistant state veterinarian Tahnee Szymanski. "In contrast, currently vaccinated animals only require a booster vaccination and a brief observation period."

The feral cat colony will be live-trapped and euthanized because of the difficulty of managing and quarantining wild or feral populations exposed to rabies. There is also the potential risk to human health and other animals if the spread of rabies is not controlled, Szymanski said.

"This incident highlights the importance of keeping your pet's rabies vaccinations up-to-date," Carlson said.

County health regulations require that all dogs, cats and ferrets older than 3 months be vaccinated against rabies and re-vaccinated at appropriate intervals.

Lora O'Connor, executive director of the Humane Society of Western Montana, said that when her shelter 1st received the order, it had to stop people from adopting animals. However, shelter officials spoke with Animal Control and are now allowing adoptions, as long as pets are kept in the county for 60 days. "All of our animals are vaccinated against rabies with the exception of kittens under 3 months of age," she said. "It's business as usual as long as they don't bring them out of the county."

Rabies is a fatal viral disease that is spread through the bite of infected mammals. It is nearly 100 percent preventable in domestic animals through the vaccine. A typical series for a dog or cat includes an initial 3-month vaccination, a one-year vaccination and subsequent doses every 3 years.

Historically, rabies in western Montana is seen almost exclusively in bats. The last documented case of non-bat rabies west of the Continental Divide was a single skunk in Missoula County in November 1996. "We always have endemic rabies in the bat population here because bats are migratory," Carlson said. "We've had situations where people thought they didn't need vaccinations for their cats because they never leave the house, but then a bat gets in the house. It's a very serious disease and people need to keep pets vaccinated to protect their family."

If bat rabies is the most commonly seen, it would be of value for this skunk isolate of rabies virus to be genetically typed to see if it is a simple overflow from bats, or a skunk strain in its own right. - Mod.MHJ
