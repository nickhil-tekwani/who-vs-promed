CJD AND BLOOD DONORS (07)

Swiss health authorities have reported the June death of a 64-year old
frequent blood donor in Switzerland who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD). The Federal Health Agency (BAG) ordered a recall of blood products
and a detailed list of the man's blood donations.
Recipients will be informed as quickly as possible and will be given
professional counselling, although BAG said there is no medical evidence that
CJD could be transmitted through blood samples.
