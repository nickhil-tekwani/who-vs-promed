Effectiveness of Spraying - Putting the Record Straight
-------------------------------------------------------
Until now I have refrained from commenting on the material sent through the
internet on West Nile virus (WNV). However, after being quoted by name, I
felt the need to clarify a misquote by the media - something I'm sure none
of you readers have experienced! [See the edited extract of the Newsday
article of 7 Nov 2000 posted as West Nile virus, effectiveness of spraying?
- Mod.CP.
The comment on obtaining 30% reduction in tests done in residential areas
in Florida was incorrect. These tests were conducted in a bankrupted
development in south Sarasota County. There was an extensive road system
with very few houses. This provided an excellent site for ground ULV
[ultra-low volume tests. The tests were funded by the state of Florida and
took place over 2 years - 1990-91. The results showed ca. 80-90% control of
natural populations, predominately _Culex nigripalpus_. The insecticides
tested were resmethrin (Scourge), permethrin, and malathion. All showed
similar results. This type of test on natural populations is very difficult
to run. We trapped mosquitoes nightly (7 nights a week) for the duration of
the test. In my opinion this is the only method to determine insecticide
effect on natural populations. Trapping a few days before a treatment and a
few days after will not accurately measure the effect of an insecticide on
a natural population. To my knowledge this has not been done in an urban
situation on _Cx. pipiens_ or _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. We would like to
attempt this in Houston but do not have the resources - someone needs to do
this.
The 30% reduction I was quoted on was my comment about controlling _Cx.
pipiens_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ in urban areas such as Houston, New
York City, New Orleans.....etc. We base our control strategy on this 30%
and treat 3 nights per week in areas where we find mosquitoes positive for
St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). It is my opinion that no one will
routinely do any better than this in a large city environment - unless of
course you design your experiment to get better control. Do we need
research in adulticide methods? You bet we do. Think about it. Millions of
dollars have been spent on surveillance and laboratory work (definitely
needed) and millions more on control. The control part involves taking the
surveillance results and sending the least paid, usually least trained and
motivated persons out in an area to stop a mosquito-borne outbreak. I'm not
pointing fingers at New York or anyone else about this. We do it here in
the Houston area also. I would like to be able to increase that per cent
kill from 30% to 50-70%. Can it be done? I don't know, but if we're going
to continue to rely on adulticides for mosquito-borne disease we had better
start getting out from behind our computers and into the "Real World."
A final note. I was quoted saying that I didn't believe New York City got
85% control with their adulticiding. I stand by that quote. Do I think the
adulticiding had an impact on the WNV outbreak in the city? Yes, I do. How
much effect? I wouldn't even make a guess. At the present time we can't
afford to give up adulticiding. Anyone have any ideas on who is going to
pick up the flag and run with this?
