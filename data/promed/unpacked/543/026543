[In the 9 patients under observation for febrile respiratory illness with history of travel to Wuhan city that were identified in the past 24 hours, 2 had laboratory-confirmed infections with human rhinovirus and coinfection with enterovirus, 1 had coinfection with influenza B and coronavirus 229 E, and 1 had influenza A(H3) identified. Five are still pending laboratory-confirmed etiologies.

[2] USA, CDC alert

Pneumonia of unknown cause in China
-----------------------------------
Watch - Level 1, Practice usual precautions
Key points:
- There is a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The cause is not yet known, nor is the mode of transmission.
- The cluster is centered at the Wuhan South China Seafood City (also called the South China Seafood Wholesale Market and the Hua Nan Seafood Market). The market has been closed since [1 Jan 2020] for cleaning and disinfection.
- Travelers to Wuhan, China, should avoid living or dead animals, animal markets, and contact with sick people.
- The situation is evolving. This notice will be updated as more information becomes available.

What is the current situation?
There is a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, China. As of [5 Jan 2020], local, provincial, and national health commissions in China have reported a total of 59 cases with no deaths. The cluster is centered at the Wuhan South China Seafood City (also called the South China Seafood Wholesale Market and the Hua Nan Seafood Market). In addition to seafood, the market sells chickens, bats, marmots, and other wild animals. The market has been closed since [1 Jan 2020] for cleaning and disinfection.

Health authorities in China are monitoring more than 150 close contacts for illness. To date, there have been no reports of spread from person to person or to healthcare workers.

Symptoms include fever and difficulty breathing. Though the cause of this cluster is unknown, there is concern that it is a virus. Local authorities have reported negative laboratory results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, and 2 specific coronaviruses known to cause respiratory illness (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]).

What can travelers do to protect themselves?
Travelers to Wuhan should:
- Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).
- Avoid contact with sick people.
- Wash hands often with soap and water.

If you traveled to Wuhan and feel sick, you should:
- Stay home. Except for seeking medical care, avoid contact with others.
- Don't travel while sick.
- Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor's office or emergency room, call ahead and tell the doctor about your recent travel and your symptoms.
- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

Clinician information
As of this posting, case-patients in the cluster reportedly have had fever, difficulty breathing, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. For patients with similar respiratory symptoms who recently traveled to Wuhan, consider pneumonia related to the cluster and notify infection control personnel and your local health department immediately.

Although the etiology and transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, the CDC recommends a cautious approach to symptomatic patients with a history of travel to Wuhan. Ask such patients to don a surgical mask as soon as they are identified. Conduct their evaluation in a private room with the door closed. Personnel entering the room to evaluate the patient should use contact precautions and wear an N95 disposable facepiece respirator. For patients admitted for inpatient care, implement contact and airborne isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, until further information becomes available. For additional infection control guidance see https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html.

[The USA CDC travel notices can be one of 3 levels:
- Warning - Level 3, avoid nonessential travel
- Alert - Level 2, practice enhanced precautions
- Watch - Level 1, practice usual precautions

The above notice from the CDC is a Watch notice, just advising individuals on precautions to be taken to prevent disease transmission. I am intrigued, though, by the wording in the following sentence from the above notice: "Local authorities have reported negative laboratory results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, and 2 specific coronaviruses known to cause respiratory illness (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS])". Specifically "and 2 specific coronaviruses...SARS and MERS," leaving room for questions about a possible novel coronavirus as yet to be identified or confirmed by reference laboratories. Again a reminder that this is pure speculation and probably shouldn't be in this comment.

As of 11:00 PM GMT-5, there has been no further information from the Wuhan Public Health Commission on progress in identifying the etiologic agent. We await further information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
