Kaikoura has been hit by a whooping cough epidemic, with 15 cases
confirmed by the Kaikoura Medical Centre since the beginning of April
[2010]. Centre practice manager Wendy Campbell said the outbreak was
under control with no new cases reported for 2 weeks.

One of the confirmed cases was a baby under one. Babies were
especially vulnerable to the disease, which could be deadly, Mrs
Campbell said. "It is more than likely there are more undiagnosed
cases in the community," she said.

Kaikoura Medical Centre doctor Andrea Judd said these kinds of
epidemics were more likely when parents did not have their children
immunised. She was concerned whooping cough might become more
prevalent. Dr Judd praised early childhood centres and schools for
being aware of the epidemic and working to control the outbreak.

Nelson Marlborough District Health Board medical officer of health
Jill Sherwood said health practices were legally required to report
suspected cases of whooping cough, also called pertussis. One
probable case of whooping cough in Marlborough had been reported to
the public health service this year. "We know that many people with
pertussis may not attend their GP," Dr Sherwood said. However,
notified cases were a good guide as to whether whooping cough was on the rise.

Canterbury medical officer of health Ramon Pink said babies should be
vaccinated and kept away from anyone with whooping cough.

[Kaikoura is a town on the east coast of the South Island of New
Zealand, with a population is 2172 in 2006
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaikoura>). It is the governmental
seat of the territorial authority of the Kaikoura District, which is
a part of the Canterbury Region. The Canterbury, Nelson and
Marlborough regions of New Zealand are located in the northeast of
the South Island (for a map of the regions of New Zealand see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand#Current_regions>).

For pertussis immunization, an older vaccine called DTP (an acronym
for a triple vaccine used to immunize against diphtheria, tetanus,
and pertussis) has been replaced by DTaP, a safer version in which
the pertussis component is acellular
(<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-dtap.pdf>). DTP
is no longer used in the United States. Children should get 5 doses
of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and
15-18 months, and 4-6 years of age. DTaP is not licensed for
adolescents, adults, or children 7 years of age and older. A single
dose of another vaccine called Tdap, which is similar to DTaP, is
recommended for people 11 through 64 years of age in place of their
next Td booster (recommended to be given every 10 years). Td,
protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis.

From the moderator LL's comments in a prior ProMED post Pertussis -
USA: (MN) 20100514.1573:

"Cases of pertussis in previously vaccinated older children and
adults are generally attributed to waning immunity without
considering potential differences in _Bordetella pertussis_ strains.
As pointed out in 2009 by Dr Frits Mooi (ProMED-mail Pertussis -
Australia (02): (SA) 20091108.3876): There are now many studies which
show that outbreaks of pertussis are often associated with changes in
the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we have shown that more
virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe to be (partly)
responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3 strains have
emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden upsurges in
infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen
population. This is even true for pertussis.
