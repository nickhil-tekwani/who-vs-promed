BIOLOGICAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AND INCREASING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE ARE
GROWING GLOBAL THREATS
Apr 14 1998
(from a National Foundation for Infectious Diseases press release)
[excerpt]
WASHINGTON -- Health experts painted a bleak future today with predictions
of biological terrorist attacks and life-threatening diseases caused by
microbes resistant to antibiotics. Extremist groups worldwide are learning
how to use biological agents, such as bacteria, viruses and toxins, to
develop weapons and methods of delivery. This coupled with the increasing
problem of resistant bacteria, lack of physician education and inadequate
preparedness could pose a potential health threat worldwide, health
officials warned today at a news conference sponsored by the National
Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID).
According to Michael T. Osterholm, Ph.D., M.P.H., state epidemiologist and
chief, Acute Disease Epidemiology Section, Minnesota Department of Health,
"It is likely that a biological terrorism disaster will occur in the United
States in the near future," and "we will be ill-prepared." His concern lies
with recent world events, such as the break-up of the former Soviet Union,
the perceived dominance of the United States as the leading world power and
the rise of international extremist groups.
"Diseases such as anthrax, smallpox, plague, botulism and viral hemorrhagic
fevers are the most likely candidates for biological terrorism," Dr.
Osterholm explained. This is because they are inexpensive, easy to produce
and disperse, able to withstand the elements and are capable of producing a
deadly disease with limited treatment.
In the event of this type of attack, Dr. Osterholm is concerned that the
United States and other countries will not be properly prepared. "For
example, today we have inadequate supplies of smallpox and anthrax vaccines
for civilian use, and there are no current efforts to improve upon this
situation." In addition, he said the current federal legislation is
"seriously lacking" in this area, and he warned that in the event of an
attack, health care providers will be overwhelmed.

Question: It's not a question of IF, but WHEN, we will experience
biological terrorism in a major U.S. city, according to many experts,
including the FBI. What's your position on that?
Answer: Unfortunately, I agree with those experts who predict a
bio-terrorist act in the foreseeable future, here in the United States.
They are not Jeremiahs, but quite rational prophets who know about
biological warfare. We may have to look toward Israel for some guidelines.
First, the Israelis are educated about both biochemical and biological
threats. The recent spate of anthrax scares in the U.S. may, in part, be a
good thing. Anthrax is no longer as scary a concept, relatively speaking,
as it was one year ago. Dissipating fear without producing fatuity is
important, so educating people as to what a disease threat is, is the first
step. Having confidence that our government will attempt to interdict
terrorists is also a part of education and reassurance.
Every Israeli has a "set" of protective gear at home: gas masks and
atropine syringes (to be used if a sarin-like organophosphate nerve gas
were to be used); in addition, all families have "Fuller powder" [Fuller's
earth] -- for cleansing the skin of chemical agents. There are special
masks for small children and sealed bassinets with filtering vents for
infants. The Israeli government "bar codes" all of these devices,
computerizing data to allow for replacement with fresh supplies when masks
and atropine become outdated, or growing children need larger masks. (A
real problem is fitting masks for those with beards.) And, while citizens
appeared to be educated and prepared, there is concern for illegal aliens,
diplomats and tourists.
Shelters to protect against both chemical and biological agents have been
constructed for each family. They are used for storage until a threat is
imminent. When so, the rooms are cleared, supplied with drinking water, dry
food, a portable radio, toilet paper, etc. The room's windows and door
frames have to be sealed with plastic sheeting, a commodity in short supply
during the Persian Gulf war.
Hospital and emergency personnel have been trained -- something that is
beginning to occur in the United States. Hospitals have to be prepared to
decontaminate exposed victims. This requires showers, powder, atropine,
antibiotics, and possibly vaccines. The logistics were and are ongoing in
Israel. We have just begun.

simulated chem/bio attacks have been carried out in a number of key cities

all aspects of the situation. They need the public's support & cooperation
