2000/041 Surveys on _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_,
_Pseudomonas corrugata_ and _Ralstonia solanacearum_ in Tanzania
In 1997/1998, surveys carried out on solanaceous crops in southern and
northern regions of mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar showed the presence of
three wilt pathogens: _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest), _Pseudomonas corrugata_ and _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest). The EPPO Secretariat had
previously no data on the occurrence of _C. michiganensis_ subsp.
_michiganensis_ in Tanzania.
The bacterium was isolated from wilting tomato plants in the southern
highlands
in Lushoto district (Tanga region, north). In addition, it was found in
several sources of seeds (farmer-saved seeds and seeds extracted from
diseased plants). In 1998, _Ralstonia solanacearum_ was detected for the
first time in Zanzibar on tomato and aubergine. It was also detected in
other studied regions of Tanzania. In tomatoes, only biovar 3 was detected.
On potatoes, biovar 3 was found in mid-altitude fields and biovar 2 (race
3) was found only at altitudes above 1500 m.

[According to the authors, _R. solanacearum_ was isolated for the first
time from tomato and eggplant in Zanzibar in 1998. In Tanzania, wilts
caused by the three bacterial pathogens had not been readily differentiated
prior to the research results reported here. It had been assumed that pith
browning in solanaceous hosts was due to infection by _P. corrugata_ until
_R. solanacearum_ was isolated frequently from such plants. The
distribution of the _R. solanacearum_ pathovars is consistent with their
temperature optima for disease expression. - Mod.DH
