Abstract
---------
In Turkey, camels are bred and used for various purposes such as touristic, traditional camel wrestling and transportation in the Aegean, Central Anatolia, Marmara, Mediterranean, and Southeastern Anatolia regions. We examined serum samples belonging to 188 dromedary camels from 72 herds in 9 cities in Turkey for antibodies to MERS-CoV using indirect ELISA. 52.7% of the camel sera were seropositive for MERS-CoV, and moderate levels of antibodies against MERS-CoV were detected (mean OD: 1.90 ± 0.97). This indicates that Turkish dromedary camels demonstrate a significantly high prevalence of MERS-CoV infection, and follow-up studies should continue to monitor the epidemiological status of this infection in camels in Turkey.

[The following excerpt from the discussion segment is notable (references omitted):
"Aside from the high seropositivity rates among camels, we did not include any case reports from humans. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, the number of MERS-CoV cases has been very low, because the infection has shown weak transmission characteristics for humans at 1st contact and has not presented human-to-human transmission. Besides, most of the available data on the high mortality rates of MERS-CoV originated from hospitalized patients, so only the most severe clinical manifestations might have been observed. This hypothesis was further strengthened by a 2015 cohort study on a Saudi Arabian population, where the mortality rate decreased to 10%. Moreover, previous research has highlighted that the MERS-CoV infection alone may not be fatal in humans and that some risk factors like diabetes mellitus, heart disease, smoking, and other respiratory infection have contributed to fatal outcomes. However, given the high fatality rates (~36%) among humans (WHO, 2021), it should not be ignored that high seropositivity in camels could still pose a risk for individuals who are in close contact with camel populations.

"Our findings indicate that MERS-CoV antibodies are quite common in dromedary camels in Turkey. Follow-up studies should continue to monitor the epidemiological status of the infection in camels in Turkey. Furthermore, planning a seroepidemiological research on individuals who are in close contact with camels would make significant contributions for displaying the epidemiology of this infection in Turkey."

According to WHO risk assessment, community-acquired human infections with MERS-CoV have occurred from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. Observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred mainly in health-care settings. Human-to-human transmission can be stopped with adequate infection prevention and control measures. - Mod.AS
