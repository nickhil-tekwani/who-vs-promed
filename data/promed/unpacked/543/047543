Tests back hides as anthrax source in New York case
---------------------------------------------------
Laboratory testing in the case of the New York City drum maker who recently
contracted anthrax has supported the belief that he inhaled anthrax spores
while working with contaminated animal hides, according to federal health
officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on 24
Feb 2006 that tests revealed _Bacillus anthracis_ in the workplace, home,
and van of the 44 year old man. He fell ill with inhalational anthrax after
performing in a concert in Mansfield, PA, on 16 Feb 2006. The test results
"are consistent with the hypothesis that the patient's exposure occurred
while working on contaminated hides while making traditional drums," CDC
said in a notice sent through its Health Alert Network.
The man, who is the 1st known US anthrax case since 2001, remains in
serious condition in a Pennsylvania hospital, according to a New York Times
report today [1 Mar 2006]. He was reported to have made drums from goat
hides imported from Africa.
The Environmental Protection Agency planned to begin cleaning the man's
Greenwich Village apartment and his studio near the Brooklyn waterfront
this week, the Times reported yesterday [28 Feb 2006]. The agency intended
to clean the apartment hallways and other common areas, plus other
residents' apartments on request, the story said.
The Times also reported yesterday [28 Feb 2006] that testing had revealed
no anthrax in an apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where a man worked
on unprocessed hides obtained from the drum maker.
The CDC said about 2/3rds of anthrax cases in the United States in recent
decades were linked to handling animal hides or hair, but hides nonetheless
pose little risk of causing anthrax. Hides "pose a low risk of cutaneous
[skin] anthrax, and an extremely low risk of inhalation anthrax," the
agency said. However, the industrial handling of large numbers of hides or
of hair from many animals has been linked historically with an increased
risk. Among 236 anthrax cases reported to CDC from 1955 through 1999, 153
(65 per cent) were tied to industrial handling of hides or hair, the CDC
said. But only 9 of the 153 cases (6 per cent) were inhalation anthrax, the
most dangerous form.
"No cases of inhalation anthrax in the US have ever been associated with
animal hide drums," the agency said. The man's exposure "occurred when he
was making and finishing drums made from un-tanned animal hides and was not
associated with playing finished drums. His exposure was similar to that
experienced during industrial handling of hides."
While CDC does not recommend preventive treatment for people who have had
contact with animal-hide drums, drum owners or players should report any
unexplained fever or skin lesions to their health care provider, the agency
said.
The man's illness worried parents of children attending a New York area
school, where he performed about a week before he got sick, according to a
report in today's [1 Mar 2006] Journal News in White Plains, NY. At a
meeting last night, 4 doctors assured about 50 parents there was virtually
no chance that their children would contract anthrax as a result of the
man's performance at Hillside School in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, the
newspaper reported.
Ada Huang of the Westchester County Health Department said the drums the
man used had been treated with chemicals that would kill anthrax spores.
And school superintendent John Russell said public health agencies would
not test for anthrax at the school, because there was next to no chance of
finding any spores, according to the story. However, some parents asked
whether the rooms where the man performed could be chemically
decontaminated, and school board members said they would consider that, the
report said.
The story said the man's dance troupe has traveled globally promoting the
culture of Ivory Coast through chant, mime, dance, and music.

[Thanks to the awareness policies of Homeland Security, the public is more
than sensitive of possible risks from anthrax but not of the true level of
risk, which is modest. Plus the disease is essentially not contagious.
Historically, those at greatest risk from contaminated hides were
stevedores. When hoisted out of a ship's hold, the hides could slam down
onto the dock, and hide dust and sharp particles would go flying. Handling
them put them at direct risk of cuts from the sharp dry hides. Over the
decades of tourists and others buying Haitian Voodoo dolls and drums, the
risk was more a footnote by enthusiastic public health laboratory folk
sampling them. In West Africa, _Bacillus anthracis_ has been isolated from
a significant proportion of shade-tree slaughterings of sick livestock. So
anyone casually buying goat hides from street vendors in West Africa should
be aware of the risk they are taking. Properly processed, however, the
tanned hides present no risk. - Mod.MHJ]

Tenants irked as anthrax keeps a Brooklyn warehouse closed
-----------------------------------------------
As government workers prepared to decontaminate the apartment of a man who
contracted anthrax, tenants of the warehouse where he kept unprocessed
animal skins complained yesterday [28 Feb 2006] that the closing of the
building had hurt their livelihoods.
An Australian fashion designer, who pays USD 850 a month to rent a 500
square foot studio in the 8 storey building, said that his 5 employees had
not been paid in a week and that 2 of them were planning to quit. "It
affects the momentum of my business," he said. He also said he had 2000
T-shirts in the studio worth USD 2200 that were supposed to be shipped on
Friday.
The anthrax patient, a 44 year old man, remained in serious condition
yesterday [28 Feb 2006] at Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, although
doctors there said that he had shown improvement. Officials believe he
contracted inhalation anthrax, the 1st naturally occurring case of the
disease in the United States since 1976, after working with unprocessed
animal skins to make drums.
Last Friday, laboratory tests confirmed the presence of anthrax spores in
the man's apartment in Greenwich Village, his work studio in the Brooklyn
warehouse and in a Dodge van he is thought to have used to transport the
skins. Officials have struggled with how to decontaminate the 2 buildings.
The man's 5th floor apartment remains sealed, but other residents of the
building have been allowed to come and go. Starting tomorrow [2 Mar 2006],
workers for the federal Environmental Protection Agency will use a bleach
solution and a high-efficiency particulate air-filter vacuum to clean the
apartment and the building's common areas, including hallways. Several of
the man's possessions may have to be destroyed, but his family will be
consulted before any such decision is made, said Mary Mears, a regional
spokeswoman for the agency. The work is to be completed by Friday.
The fate of the warehouse is less certain. The building is mostly occupied
by a self-storage company, but about 30 loft studios on the 3rd and 6th
floors have been rented, mostly to artists and musicians.
One of the tenants who runs an online bookstore with his partner out of a
1000-square-foot studio that costs USD 1400 a month in rent, said his
business had been crippled. "If the doors aren't open, we can't sell," he said.
A sculptor who pays USD 860 a month to rent a 600-square-foot studio said
he had asked government representatives when he could return, to no avail.
"I've had one client who wanted to see my work, but he is leaving the
country on Tuesday," the sculptor said. "I was told it would be 7 to 10
days before we could go back in. It's an incredible frustration and
inconvenience."
Erik T Ekstein, one of 3 owners who hold the lease on the building, said
they had hired a contractor to do the cleanup and were awaiting approval by
the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and by the Environmental
Protection Agency, which will oversee the work. "We definitely feel for our
tenants," he said in a telephone interview. "We will do everything in our
power to get them back into the building as quickly as possible." He said
he hoped the plans would be approved by tomorrow [2 Mar 2006]. The
environmental agency has scheduled a meeting with the tenants tomorrow night.

[The difference between this situation and 2001 is that the latter materiel
was virtually pure spores, most individual spores, some in very small 5
micron clumps. Contaminated material found in hides and wool and hair is
relatively large chunks of dirt and grease with some embedded spores; very
few are small enough to be aerosolizable, which is why inhalational anthrax
is unusual, even in Bradford in the 19th century. (Occupational
inhalational anthrax was known in the UK as Bradford disease.) So the
contamination in the 2 buildings will be qualitatively different from that
involved in the 2001 events, even though there were patently enough small
particles to infect the man and thus to add to the contamination in his
apartment, studio, and vehicle. - Mod.MHJ]
