Mysterious disease hits pineapple crop
----------------------------------------
The pineapple cultivation at Bidhannagar has been hit by a mysterious
disease. The disease has already affected more than 10 percent of
pineapple cultivation and is spreading fast. According to the
pineapple growers, the mysterious disease is infecting the crop right
after the flowering stage. As a result, the upper part of the
pineapple, including the crown, gradually gets crooked, followed by a
subsequent taint on the fruit. The taint ultimately leads to the
decay of the whole fruit.
Mr Norojeet Sarkar, a pineapple grower from Bidhannagar part I GP
area, said he has applied all the remedies known to him, but failed
to avoid the disease. Mr Sarkar has around 5 acres of land under
pineapple cultivation, a remarkable portion of which has been
infected with the unidentified disease.
Like him, pineapple growers across Bidhannagar are facing the same
crisis, as 10 to 15 percent of the total pineapple cultivation there
has already been marred by the infection.
"The disease has turned out to be a major concern for us. If the
authorities do not address the problem on an emergency basis, I fear
the pineapple cultivation at Bidhannagar would collapse," said Mr
Arun Kumar Mondal, general secretary of the Uttar Banga Anarash Chasi
Sanghatan (ACHASH).
The district horticultural officials visited some of the affected
cultivation areas last week and collected samples of infected
pineapples. However, they too failed to identify the disease. "We
have sent the pineapple samples to the plant pathology wing of the
Uttar Banga Krishi Viswabidyalaya, Pundibari for diagnosis. The
samples were forwarded on 14 May 2007, and we are expecting the
report in a day or 2," said Mr Nilesh Bhowmick, district
horticultural officer in-charge, Siliguri.
Mr Bhowkick said the horticulture department was also upset with the
development, as Bindhannagar is considered the "pineapple capital" of
West Bengal.
As per a rough estimation, there are over 7000 growers at Bidhannagar
who cultivate pineapple on about 9000 hectares of land. The pineapple
grown at Bidhannagar is being exported to many parts of the country.

[An apparently serious threat to a major regional crop of low-income
farmers, the report of symptoms starting soon after flowering,
distortion of the upper part of the fruit and progression of browning
may provide clues towards a possible vector insect spreading a pathogen.
