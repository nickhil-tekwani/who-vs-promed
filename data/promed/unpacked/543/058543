North Korea has culled 219 000 birds at 3 chicken farms following what is
believed to be its first outbreak of bird flu, an official at the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization said Thursday.
North Korean authorities also told an FAO expert visiting Pyongyang that
areas near the chicken farms have been vaccinated, and surveillance
measures for the disease have been expanded to the entire country, the
official told Kyodo News.
The official said although FAO suspects avian influenza, a final
confirmation has yet to be made. It is unknown whether the virus involved
is the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus, the official said.

North Korea working to contain bird flu - FAO
---------------------------------------------
North Korea, which has culled tens of thousands of chickens and clamped
down on bird movements, may be able to contain its 1st suspected bird flu
outbreaks on 3 farms, a top U.N. bird flu expert said on Friday [1 Apr 2005].
"For the time being, everything indicates that it can be contained," Hans
Wagner, a senior official with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
told Reuters by telephone from the North Korean capital Pyongyang.
Wagner, in North Korea to assess what is believed to be the 1st outbreak of
avian influenza in the secretive nation, said it was not known if the virus
was the H5N1 strain which can jump from birds to humans.
H5N1 has killed 49 people since late 2003, 16 since the disease erupted
anew in December 2004, and has proved extremely difficult to stamp out in
Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.
"There are indications that it is avian influenza, but they lack the
diagnostic tools to do a proper diagnosis of which type and sub-type," said
Wagner, who has played a prominent role in Asia's battle against the deadly
H5N1 virus.
The FAO's China-based regional diagnostic coordinator was expected to fly
to Pyongyang on Saturday [2 Apr 2005] with testing equipment to confirm the
strain of virus, he said.
Officials told Wagner some 219 000 chickens had been culled since the 1st
outbreak was detected on a large poultry farm in Hadang outside the
capital. Outbreaks were found on 2 other farms within a 4-kilometer radius
of the 1st case.
Wagner said authorities have imposed strict controls on animal movements in
the area and stepped up surveillance across the country. "So far there are
no indications that we have human flu cases," he said. "They are very well
aware of the general threat of avian influenza on a global scale".
But Pyongyang's neighbours are taking no chances. China has tightened
quarantine controls on its border with North Korea, and stepped up the
fight against poultry smuggling. South Korea, which has also stepped up
quarantine measures at border points and at poultry farms near the border,
believes the outbreaks in North Korea are extensive.
The source of the outbreaks was not known, but the fact the 3 farms are
owned by the same company probably contributed to the spread of the disease.
"Admittedly we are a little bit surprised to have an outbreak in large
farms because generally large farms have higher biosecurity standards than
smaller farms," Wagner said.
Most of North Korea's annual 25 million birds are produced on larger farms,
one of the few growing sectors in a country battling severe food shortages.
Bird flu has become entrenched in several other Asian countries because the
virus can circulate among small, backyard farms where chickens often mix
with wild ducks, believed to be silent carriers of the disease, experts say.

Bird Flu Hits N. Korea in Sore Spot
------------------------------------
The 1st reported outbreak of avian flu in North Korea could have a
devastating effect on the secretive, impoverished country.
In a rare moment of candor, the regime in Pyongyang confirmed rumors in the
South Korean media that it was battling an epidemic of the deadly virus.
Its official news agency said the flu had broken out at "a few chicken
farms." No humans had been infected, it said, but in an effort to control
the disease, "hundreds of thousands of chickens have been burned."
South Korean officials believe that the fact North Korea felt compelled to
make the announcement suggests that the situation is far worse than described.
"It is our judgment seeing North Korea reveal itself in this way that they
are experiencing difficulty in taking the necessary prevention and
quarantine measures and that it must be quite serious," Kim Chun Sik,
director of inter-Korean exchanges for the Unification Ministry, said
Wednesday [30 Mar 2005].
Another sign of Pyongyang's concern is its decision to promptly accept an
assessment team from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Hans
Wagner, a senior official from the agency's Thailand office, flew in
Tuesday and will be joined by 2 more officials this week.
The U.N. team is bringing diagnostic kits to determine whether North
Korea's avian flu is the dreaded H5N1 strain, which has spread through
Southeast Asia. That virus can be transmitted from birds to humans and is
blamed for the deaths of 48 people since late 2003.
The seriousness of the outbreak is also evident from accounts by business
people and aid workers who have visited Pyongyang.
"When I went to the market, there was no poultry at all and not a single
egg. To me, that signaled they are on the alert," said Kathi Zellweger of
the Roman Catholic charity Caritas, recalling an experience of 19 Mar 2005.
There have been reports in the South Korean media that large numbers of
troops have been deployed to carry out the slaughter and burial of the
chickens and that up to 10 million birds may have been destroyed.
If an epidemic takes hold -- or has taken hold -- in North Korea, the
implications could be grave, in part because of the country's faltering
healthcare system. North Korea was so frightened by Asia's 2003 epidemic of
severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, that it sealed its borders and
suspended flights from Beijing. Now it is North Korea's neighbors that may
face the risk of contagion.
Hospitals in North Korea are known to lack sanitary facilities, antibiotics
and equipment considered basic in the West. Because of its authoritarian
system, an aid official who works in North Korea said, the country could
effectively quarantine infected areas, but hygiene conditions could sharpen
the risks.
The World Health Organization advises people to cook fowl completely and
wash their hands thoroughly after handling, "but we're talking about a
country where there isn't even enough soap," said the official, who asked
to remain anonymous.
Even if the flu is confined to the bird population, the economic
consequences are likely to be more severe than in other Asian countries.
North Korea's people suffer from a chronic lack of protein, and the
nation's sparse economy generates few legal exports.
"Their loss defies comparison," said Lee Suk Doo, president of Porky
Trading Korea, the Seoul-based firm that has suspended plans to import 2000
tons of chicken from North Korea this year. The first shipment of poultry
was scheduled to arrive at the South Korean port of Inchon today.
The deal had been in the works since 2000, when then-South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung met with Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang to set the stage for
economic cooperation. Lee believes that North Korean chicken would sell
well in the South because it is "almost 100 percent organic" -- raised
without added hormones or antibiotics.
"As a matter of state policy, the North Koreans developed poultry farms to
feed their own people," Lee said. "They were just about to start the export
business with the sale to us when this happened."
The high esteem in which North Korea holds chicken farming can be seen in
the words of Kim Jong Il himself. Inspecting a newly built farm in 2000, he
proclaimed it among the "edifices of eternal value to pass a prosperous
socialist homeland onto posterity," according to the official Korean
Central News Agency.
So proud of the chicken farms are North Koreans that a visit was included
on the South Korean president's itinerary during his visit in 2000. The
following year, a state agency was established to oversee chicken and duck
breeding, and the armed forces have been used for much of the farm
construction.
According the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, North Korea had
roughly 25.5 million poultry in 2004, double that of 1997. The agency
called it one of the few growing sectors in the country.
Diderik de Vleeschauwer, an FAO spokesman in Bangkok, the Thai capital,
said the team sent to North Korea would provide advice on destroying
chickens and disinfecting farms. There are at least 3 farms said to be
infected, all in the Pyongyang area, according to several sources.
"It can be tough to convince producers to accept killing the chickens," he
said. "Everybody in the [supply] chain must agree on the need for culling.
And then you have to keep the farms idle for so many months."
South Korea and China also have offered North Korea equipment and chemicals
for culling. Should the outbreak develop into an epidemic, there is concern
that the disease could spread to neighboring countries. North Korea has
well-fortified borders, notably the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone
dividing the Korean peninsula; but migratory birds can carry the disease
where humans dare not tread.
South Korea has stepped up quarantine measures at border crossings and is
examining wild and domestic birds near the DMZ for signs of the illness.
Some South Korean analysts suspect that the North covered up the bird flu
outbreak for weeks and may still be concealing its severity.
"Since there are 3 farms infected simultaneously, it is hard to trust the
North's announcement that there have been no human cases," an agricultural
expert said in today's edition of the newspaper Joong-Ang Ilbo.
