An outbreak of 13 cases of falciparum malaria in the Caribbean province of
Limon has led the Public Health Ministry to issue an alert for the area,
announced Public Health Minister Maria Luisa Avila yesterday. Authorities
have observed high-risk cases of this strain of malaria, which is rare and
has not been seen in Costa Rica in 10 years. The ministry is advising
citizens to take immediate and constant measures to keep it from spreading,
including using mosquito nets.
The mosquito-transmitted disease could multiply and spread to other areas
of the country, Avila said. So far, there have been 13 confirmed cases of
falciparum malaria and 29 people who suspect they have the disease. Most of
them live in the town of Batan on the Caribbean slope. Falciparum malaria
is transmitted by a mosquito that deposits a parasite into the body that
then attacks the blood. This can cause severe anemia that can lead to death
if it is not treated in time. The Public Health Ministry is sending
additional medical personnel to Batan to implement preventive measures to
keep the disease from spreading.
