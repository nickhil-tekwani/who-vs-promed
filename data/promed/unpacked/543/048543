Sequence information on CSFV from Lithuania
-------------------------------------------
In the latest information on CSFV in Lithuania ['Classical swine
fever - Lithuania (03): (PA), EU report'] the genotype 2.1 is
mentioned.

The sequence details were submitted from the Danish National
Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever to the EU Central
Reference Laboratory (CRL) for CSFV in Hannover on 13 Jul 2009. This
was done to assure that the sequence information is gathered where
most details on CSFV within the EU are present.

We have used the CRL CSF virus database and the Genetic Typing Module
and the CSF virus is a genotype 2.1 according to the 5'NTR, E2, and
NS5B sequences.

Comparing with the sequences deposited in the database the Lithuanian
genotype 2.1 is not identical to any previously submitted sequence.
Further epidemiological studies will hopefully give better
indications of the introduction.

[This firsthand complementary information on the genotyping of the
Lithuanian CSFV (type 2.1) strain is gratefully acknowledged.

According to the information included in Lithuania's SCFCAH (Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) presentation, as cited
in the previous posting, the highest sequence similarity was observed
with CSFV, type 2.1, strain Asia 2007. However, according to the
information above from the sequencing performers, the current
genotype is not identical to any previously submitted sequence.
Further investigations are anticipated with interest. Interestingly,
the Lithuanians suspect human involvement in the introduction of the
virus into the breeding farm, probably in mid-May 2009; clarification
will help.

We repeat suggesting that sequence data of animal viruses will be
deposited by laboratories and scientific institutions into publicly
available databases, in line with the influenza sequence databases,
available on OIE/FAO OFFLU (joint OIE-FAO network of expertise on
animal influenza) website
