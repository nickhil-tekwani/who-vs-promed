The 2nd case of haemorrhagic fever has been recorded in Duhok province, bringing up the total number of cases in the Kurdistan Region to 4.

Akre Health Directorate announced on Wednesday [8 Jun 2022] that a 24-year-old woman from a village in Akre district has tested positive for haemorrhagic fever.

The directorate said that the woman was sent to Baghdad for medical tests and would stay there for treatment.

Special tests for the diagnosis of haemorrhagic fever are currently unavailable in the Kurdistan Region.

The directorate said the patient had contact with animals.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral disease usually transmitted by ticks, according to the WHO.

It can also be contracted through contact with animal tissues where the virus enters the bloodstream during and immediately post-slaughter of animals.

10 to 40% of those who contract the virus die as a result.

The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Minister of Health, Saman Barzinji, said on 19 May 2022 that there had been 2 recorded haemorrhagic fever cases in the Kurdistan Region, both contracted from animals that were slaughtered in unlicensed locations.

He explained Congo fever was not a new disease and steps must be taken to prevent its spread.

The Kurdistan Region's health ministry spokesperson confirmed the 1st case of a death related to Congo fever on Saturday [11 Jun 2022]; the same day he told Rudaw that a COVID-19 patient died as a result of the respiratory disease after over 40 days of no recorded coronavirus fatalities.

The 1st case of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was recorded in the Kurdistan Region on [10 May 2022]. The infected person was a 17-year-old from Erbil province. The Region has confirmed 4 cases of the fever so far, according to health ministry spokesperson Aso Hawezi.

Hawezi said in a statement released on the ministry's Facebook page on Saturday [11 Jun 2022] that one of these cases, a 27-year-old man from Erbil province's Khalifan subdistrict died earlier that day [11 Jun 2022]. The official did not identify the deceased.

The fever is tick-borne and causes severe hemorrhaging, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It has been endemic to Iraq since 1979 and reappeared again last year [2021].

People are often infected after they are exposed to the blood of infected animals, for example after slaughtering livestock.

The Kurdistan Region had not recorded any coronavirus related deaths since [29 Apr 2022]. However, the spokesperson told Rudaw's Rawchi Hassan that a COVID-19 patient died on Saturday [11 Jun 2022].

The health ministry recorded 47 new cases of coronavirus on Friday [10 Jun 2022], bringing the total number of known cases to 438 477. Of this, 7450 have died.

At a time the world continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic that claimed over 63 lakh [6.3 million] lives, the Kurdistan Region, on [11 Jun 2022], registered the 1st fatality from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. In an official update, the Kurdistan Regional Government's Health Ministry said that the 1st fatality recorded from Congo fever was a 27-year-old school teacher from Khalifan, Erbil province. The Ministry of Health confirmed in a statement obtained by ESTA that Kurdistan Region has become the first to document a death due to Congo fever.

"A 27-year-old man who was designated as infected before with Congo fever died today [11 Jun 2022]," the Ministry of Health said in the statement.

According to the Kurdistan health officials, the patient hailed from Soran district and had died due to a fatal health condition which resulted from the disease. "The patient died due to a fatal health condition and it was recorded as the 1st case of death in the Kurdistan Region," the Ministry stated. It urged citizens to adhere to health safety measures and the prescribed guidelines in order to avoid Congo fever and to check for the symptoms.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever causes severe haemorrhaging among patients and spreads via the blood of infected animals, according to the World Health Organization. The disease has a fatality rate of 10 to 40% in all cases. It has been endemic in Iraq, of which the Kurdistan Region is an autonomous part, since 1979.

Small outbreaks of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been reported yearly. Iraq, in May [2022], was in the midst of a Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever outbreak with 19 deaths among the 111 confirmed cases, the World Health Organization had informed in a statement. The health body had warned that the disease can cause severe bleeding both internally and externally, including from the nose, resulting in death. "The number of cases recorded is unprecedented," Haidar Hantouche, a health official in Dhi Qar province had said.

As per the WHO, the cases had far exceeded those recorded in almost 43 years since the disease first spread in Iraq in 1979. It was also found in Crimea in 1944 and has since been endemic in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Balkan states. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that the disease caused by a tick-borne virus has a slow recovery rate. It is "primarily transmitted" via the ticks on livestock, and hence farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are most at risk.

"Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks," said the WHO. "The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter," it added.

The Iraqi Ministry of Health revealed on Wednesday [15 Jun 2022] the governorates with the highest number of hemorrhagic fever cases and deaths while noting that more than half of these cases have recovered.

The Ministry spokesman, Saif Al-Badr, said, "the latest official statistics issued by the National Center for Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases in the Public Health Department have recorded 171 confirmed cases of hemorrhagic fever, including 32 deaths, since the beginning of this year [2022]."

"More than half of these cases have recovered after the disease was detected at an early stage. Dhi Qar governorate recorded the most cases with 66 cases, including 17 deaths, followed by Maysan with 22 cases, Wasit with 18 cases, and Babil with 16 cases" Al-Badr added.

He also said that "infection cases were also recorded in the governorates of Al-Muthanna, Al-Diwaniyah, Baghdad, Karbala, Basrah, Kirkuk, Nineveh, Najaf, Erbil, Diyala, and Duhok."

Al-Badr continued, "failure to implement the preventive measures and recommendations of the Ministry of Health, follow-up of cases and control of the insect, as well as treat infected animals led to the spread of the disease." He explained that the role of the Ministry of Health is early detection of the disease through the central public health laboratory and the provision of medical care.

[Iraq is currently witnessing an increase in the number of hemorrhagic fever cases that have been reported in most governorates. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is the type of hemorrhagic fever endemic in Iraq.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a tick-borne viral disease of zoonotic origin. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Protective measures against the infection include raising awareness about the mode of transmission, wearing protective clothing while handling animals and their tissues, and using repellent on the skin and clothing. - Mod.NS

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

Iraq is one of the eastern Mediterranean countries where CCHF is endemic. CCHF has been reported in Iraq since 1979 when the disease was first diagnosed in 10 patients. Since then, 6 cases were reported between 1989 and 2009; 11 cases in 2010; 3 fatal cases were reported in 2018; more recently 33 confirmed cases including 13 deaths (CFR 39%) were reported in 2021.

Sheep and cattle husbandry is very common in Iraq. Studies have shown that these animals are regularly infested with tick species, mainly _Hylomma_ species, the principal vector of CCHF.

Human cases of CCHF are mainly treated with general supportive care. The antiviral drug ribavirin, both oral and intravenous formulations, has been used to treat CCHF infection. However, no evidence from randomized clinical trials has demonstrated the effectiveness of ribavirin for treating CCHF. There is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals.

Between 1 Jan and 22 May 2022, 212 cases of CCHF have been reported to the WHO from the Iraqi health authorities of which 169 (80%) were reported in April and May 2022 alone. Of the 212 cases, 115 were suspected and 97 laboratory confirmed. Twenty-seven deaths occurred overall, of which 13 were in laboratory confirmed cases [case fatality ratio (CFR) 13%; 13/97]. The Iraq Central Public Health Laboratory confirmed the cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Among confirmed cases, most had direct contact with animals, and were livestock breeders or butchers. Just over half of the confirmed cases were 15 to 44 years old (n = 52; 54%) and of male gender (n = 60; 62%).

Nearly 50% of confirmed cases (n = 47; 48%) were reported in Thiqar governorate, southeast Iraq, and the remainder of cases were reported from 12 different governorates; Missan (13), Muthanna (7), Wassit (6), Diwaniya (4), Baghdad Karkh (4), Kirkuk (3), Basrah (3), Najaf (3), Nineveh (3), Baghdad-Rusafa (2), Babylon (1) and Karbala (1) (data available from WHO as of 1 Jun 2022 at https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON386)

The last report above mentions 171 confirmed CCHF cases with 32 deaths. According to the WHO update, "Health authorities conducted the following multidisciplinary outbreak response:

- Health authorities deployed an epidemiological investigation team to Thiqar governorate. The teams comprised fellows from the Iraq Field Epidemiology Training Program and staff from the Communicable Disease Control section of the Ministry of Health (MoH). The epidemiology team conducted an outbreak investigation, which included a house-to-house visit of the reported cases and contact tracing. They also conducted entomological investigation for disease vectors, which included the collection and classification of ticks from each site of reported suspected cases.

- The MoH vector control team sprayed indoor and outdoor acaricides in affected areas and the veterinary hospital treated domestic animals with acaricides in affected areas.

- Teams from the MoH and the Ministry of Agriculture printed Information, Education, and Communication materials which outlined prevention and control measures for CCHF. They shared the materials with case contacts and the local community, especially butchers and animal barn owners. - Mod.UBA]

The Iranian health ministry has warned of an increase in the number of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in the country compared to the previous year [2021].

Behzad Amiri, the director of the ministry's Center for Infectious Diseases Management, in an interview with the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) said only 13 patients were infected with the tick-borne disease last year [2021], but 18 cases have already been recorded for the 1st 3 months of the new Iranian year (starting 21 Mar 2022).

Endemic in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans, the disease causes severe bleeding. People usually catch it through contact with the blood of infected animals.

As the first batch of Iranians departed for the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia on Sunday [12 Jun 2022], Amiri advised the pilgrims to follow hygiene protocols during the rituals which include having sheep slaughtered.

Iran's neighboring country, Iraq, is experiencing a sharp uptick in the number of Congo fever cases, with the latest figure showing 27 fatalities.

The Iranian official said the surge in Iraq can cause the spread of the disease as there are no vaccines to curb it yet.

The 1st case of infection with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in 2022 has been detected in the Volgograd region.

The case of infection was detected on [9 Jun 2022]. The disease was diagnosed in a resident of the Gorodishchensky district.

The CCHF virus is primarily transmitted to people from tick bites or through contact with infected animals, although human-to-human transmission can also occur. The virus causes the disease Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which typically manifests itself with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, joint pain, vomiting and bleeding, and can progress to organ failure and death.

The disease is endemic with fairly stable infection levels in 30 countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, southeast Europe and parts of Africa. However, with global warming, the ticks carrying the virus are spreading to other parts of the world, with more cases seen in other parts of Europe in recent years.

[It is important to emphasize the importance of maintaining strong CCHF surveillance, diagnostic capacity, and outbreak response activities by all Member States.

WHO also recommends reducing the risk of tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission by:
(i) enforcing relevant preventive measures during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures,
(ii) quarantining animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides 2 weeks prior to slaughtering them, and
(iii) ensuring that health care workers implement infection prevention control measures when taking care of CCHF cases or other cases presenting with haemorrhagic fever.

It is important to raise awareness about the risk factors of the disease, particularly in the population groups likely to be exposed to the virus, and educate them to take precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals.This is especially important as massive animal movements are expected in most of Middle East and other Muslim countries in preparation for Eid-ul Adha which also entail animal sacrifice practices.

Furthermore, appropriate capacity building and training of public health rapid response teams (RRT) should be carried out in order to equip them to control any future outbreaks of this anthropo-zoonotic disease. - Mod.UBA
