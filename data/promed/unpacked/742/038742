On this island of 760 000 inhabitants in the Indian Ocean, 6200
people have been infected by the Chikungunya virus, and the number
increases by 250 new cases per week.
"Chikungunya" is a swahili word which means "curved up": a rather
poetic description for this disease which is not lethal, but largely
incapacitating. Transmitted by certain mosquitoes, it causes acute
articular pain and can lead to serious neurological complications.
The Department of Epidemiology of Reunion (Cellule interregionale
d'epidemiologie de la Reunion, CIRE) and the Regional Department of
Health and Social Affairs (Direction regionale des affaires
sanitaires et sociales, DRASS) fear the epidemic will spread during
the next summer rainy season in the southern region.
Today, 1000 people take part in the operations of vector eradication
on the island. But for Julien Thiria, a sanitary engineer who is
responsible for the anti-mosquito campaign, the fight against the
epidemic must be accomplished by the entire population.

[Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease; _Aedes_ mosquitoes
such as _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. africanus_ are pertinent to the
African context, see also 20040115.0164. Chikungunya virus is a
member of the family _Togaviridae_. Many outbreaks of Chikungunya
since the beginning of 2005 have been noted mainly in the west rim
(the offshore islands of East Africa and Kenya), the north rim (Sri
Lanka) as well as the east rim (Indonesia) of the Indian Ocean Basin.
