New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1 (SH_HPAI _2021_1): Rhein, Schaffhausen
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Feb 2021
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Yellow-legged Gull: _Larus michahellis_ (Laridae) / 1 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: The sick yellow-legged gull (_Larus michahellis_) was shot on [1 Feb 2021] on the bank of the river Rhein.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Yellow-legged Gull: _Larus michahellis_ (Laridae) / 100 / 0 / 0 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Samples of the gull were sent to the National Reference Center for Poultry and Rabbit Diseases (NRGK, Zurich, Switzerland), where they tested positive for avian influenza of the subtype H5 in RT-qPCR. Confirmation and sequencing analyses were carried out at the Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI, Mittelhausern, Switzerland) where highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N4 was confirmed on [4 Feb 2021]. It is the 1st confirmation of this subtype in Switzerland. However, this is the same strain already confirmed recently in the region of Lake Constance in Germany. Following confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds on the German side of Lake Constance, the FSVO and the Cantons concerned preventively established control and surveillance zones along the shores of the lake and parts of the river Rhein on [25 Jan 2021]. A control zone of a width of one km was established along the shores of Lake Constance and along the shores of nearby parts of the river Rhein. In the Canton of Schaffhausen, the control zone includes almost the entire territory. Poultry in the control zone area are obliged to be kept such that contact between poultry and wild birds is prevented. The surveillance zone covers a 3-km wide zone along the shore of Lake Constance and along the shores of nearby parts of the river Rhein. In the surveillance zone, poultry holders are obliged to notify veterinarians or the cantonal authorities about any suspicious symptoms of disease in poultry. The affected gull was found within the existing control zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, zoning, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Reference Centre for Diseases of Poultry and Rabbits (NRGK) (National laboratory) / Yellow-legged Gull: _Larus michahellis_ / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 Feb 2021 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
