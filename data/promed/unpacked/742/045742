A quarantine has been imposed on livestock to stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Teso South, Busia county.

In a letter to the county director of veterinary services, Teso South veterinary officer Polycap Kundembule said all livestock markets in the subcounty have been closed until the disease is contained.

The letter, dated 3 Dec 2014, directs all chiefs to stop movement of livestock within their locations.

Kundembule said the 1st case of the disease was reported in Amoni on the Teso South and Teso North border.

Teso South is a "disease vulnerable zone" since it lies on the Kenya-Uganda border.

Some unlicensed Kenyan livestock traders import livestock from Uganda with little knowledge of the risk they pose to local cattle farmers.
