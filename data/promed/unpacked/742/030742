The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced today that all imports of
eggs, products containing eggs, and game meats (FDA regulated) from
Belgium, France and the Netherlands, and all animal products including
animal derived medicated and non- medicated feeds, feed ingredients, and
pet foods from all European countries will be detained at U.S. ports of
entry. These products are being detained because of the possibility they
may be contaminated with polychlorinated byphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins.
Dioxins and PCBs are groups of compounds that may be potential carcinogens
at low levels of exposure over extended periods of time and may have other
types of toxicological effects. FDA is detaining these products as a
precautionary step.
FDA is taking this action in response to recent reports that a fat product
from a rendering company in Europe was contaminated with PCBs and dioxins
in January 1999. This fat was subsequently sold to European animal feed
manufacturers. Most of these feed manufacturers are in Belgium although
some of the contaminated feed has reportedly been shipped to feed
manufacturers in France and the Netherlands. Food producing animals may
have consumed the feed resulting in potentially contaminated food products,
for example, eggs.
Since some animals that ate the contaminated feed may have been rendered
and the renderings added to feed shipped to other European countries, FDA
is detaining all animal-derived feed and feed ingredients and pet food from
all European countries.
FDA is gathering information on food products possibly affected. Because
this was a one-time incident with eggs being only one component of many in
egg-containing products, FDA believes the exposure of US consumers to
harmful levels of PCBs and dioxins is minimal. However, FDA is continuing
its investigation and is sampling and analyzing products imported since the
incident in question. FDA is working with officials in Belgium as the
investigation progresses.
At this time, in order for products to be released from detention,
importers must provide laboratory test results showing PCBs are not
detectable and/or dioxins do not exceed 1 part- per-trillion (ppt).
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is holding poultry and
pork from all European Community member states because of the possibility
livestock may have been fed the contaminated feed. USDA is initiating
investigations and analyses of these products.
FDA will continue to provide updates to this information. For updated
information, consult the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
web site under the heading "What's New."
