[It is now 2 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. Of concern is the local transmission ongoing in Guangdong. Yesterday (4 Apr 2020), there were 5 newly confirmed cases reported in Guangdong, today (5 Apr 2020), there is 1 additional case reported from Guangdong. At the country level there were 39 newly confirmed cases reported of which 38 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 708 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3331 deaths, representing an increase of 39 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (4 Apr 2020) report was prepared. An additional 10 suspected cases were newly reported, all imported cases. In addition, 1 death was reported, from Wuhan. 28 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported 0 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

A total of 38 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 951. There are an additional 88 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the report above, there were 78 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 40 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1047, 275 of whom are importations from abroad. 5 originally asymptomatic cases have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours (all were imported cases).

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan tomorrow on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 47 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (4-5 Apr 2020) when there were 81 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 284 confirmed cases, including 186 deaths were reported today, up from 10 237 cases and 183 deaths yesterday [4 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 13 consecutive days and for the 1st time since before 17 Mar 2020 when the daily newly confirmed number was less than 50. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 65.9% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.8% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 27.7% of the total newly confirmed cases while Seoul represented 23.4% of the newly confirmed cases, and Gyeonggi represented 17.0%. Quarantined imported cases represented 14.9% of the newly confirmed cases. 9 provinces reported 0 newly confirmed cases.

As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 310 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Overall, there have been a total of 741 imported cases into South Korea, with 50.2% of these cases coming from Europe and 35.6% coming from America. This includes all imported cases since the virus was identified and not just those in quarantine. Also as in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

Cases in Italy as of 6:00 pm 5 Apr 2020
---------------------------------------
Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 128 948 total cases. At the moment 91 246 people are positive for the virus; 21 815 people have recovered. There are 28 949 patients hospitalized with symptoms, 3977 are in intensive care, and 58 320 are in home isolation.

There have been 15 887 reported deaths, however, this number can only be confirmed after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

The head of civil protection Borrelli stressed that today [5 Apr 2020], the lowest number of deaths were reported since [19 Mar 2020] and that there is still a decrease in patients admitted to intensive care today.

Borrelli also reported that the transfer of patients from Lombardy to other regions was discontinued today [5 Apr 2020], because the situation in hospitals in Lombardy does not require it. Another good news comes from the Spallanzani [Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases] who records a greater number of patients discharged than those hospitalized.

Case distribution by province: number of cases (number of new cases in past 24 hours)

Lombardy: 50 455 (1337)

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 128 948 cases, including 15 887 deaths, up from 124 632 cases and 15 362 deaths reported on 3 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 4 and 5 Apr 2020 was 4316 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4805 newly confirmed cases between 2 Apr 2020 and 3 Apr 2020, stable from yesterday's observations. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country -- in Lombardy (50 455), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (17 089), Veneto (11 226), and Piedmont (12 362). These 4 provinces combined account for 68.1%% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Piedmont, with 15.1% of the newly confirmed cases reported, is seeing more activity than Veneto. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

Today's news is a cautious ray of sunshine with respect to the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy. The reduction in mortality and the health infrastructure able to manage the daily caseloads with decreasing ICU admissions is heartening. But there is definitely concern re: Piedmont and the increase in case reporting.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 24 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 22 days since the countrywide lockdown. There does appear to be a positive trend of decreasing daily newly reported cases and mortality, still with small hiccups occasionally.

The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 336 673, including 9616 deaths, an increase from 277 161 cases, and 7392 deaths. New York state, with 123 018 (36.5%) cumulative case reports and 8243 (32.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) website accounts for 52.8% of the total reported cases. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (3381 newly confirmed cases 13.4%), Michigan (1497 newly confirmed cases 4.7%), California (1388 newly confirmed cases 4.5%), and Pennsylvania (1095 newly confirmed cases 34%).

A closer look at New York State, the epicenter as of 5:30 AM on 3 Apr 2020, the total number of cases were 102 863, with NYC (New York City) reporting 57 159 (55.6% of the total cases).

In Louisiana, the cumulative case count is now at 13 010 with Orleans Parish reporting 4066 (32.3%) of the cases, and neighboring Jefferson Parish reporting 3088 (23.7%) cases - the 2 parishes accounting for 55.0% of the reported cases in the state. (http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/)

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain appears to be leveling off and beginning a decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that today's report shows a 34.7% reduction since 31 Mar 2020. As of today (5 Apr 2020), totals of 130 759 cases and 12 418 deaths have been reported, up from 124 736 cases and 11 744 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 217.3. It is 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy, in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for increasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 130 759 cases, 58 744 (44.9%) have been hospitalized and 6861 (5.2%) admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate is 9.5%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions. Both the proportion of cases hospitalized and the proportion of cases in ICU have shown slight decreases over the past few days.

[7] Turkey, cumulative case counts increasing rapidly
Date: Sat 4 Apr 2020
Source: Assume Tech [edited]
https://asumetech.com/why-turkey-is-facing-a-steep-curve-of-new-coronavirus-cases/


Considering that stating its 1st coronavirus case 3 weeks back, Turkey has actually tape-recorded one of the steepest trajectories of new cases on the planet, in the middle of worries it might end up being a location of the pandemic. The fast rise in cases -- 18 135 validated infections and 356 deaths as of late Thursday [2 Apr 2020] -- has actually seen Turkey surpass other G20 states such as South Korea and Canada that reported cases of the infection weeks previously.

It has actually likewise left Turks asking if the nation may be following the course of Italy, which has actually tape-recorded more than 110 000 cases. "Turkey has the highest acceleration rate for cases," stated Caghan Kizil, associate teacher of neuroscience and genes at the Helmholtz Association of German Research Study Centres.

"This is because social mobility wasn't prevented. If we look at China, they were successful because they identified asymptomatic patients who weren't showing signs of infection. After the lockdown in Wuhan, the number of cases caused by undocumented infected people dropped significantly." Esin Senol, a teacher of transmittable illness at Gazi University in Ankara, mentioned that Turkey has actually now seen the world's 10th-highest number of cases and is one of the countries at many danger.

"It appears to have spread long before the 1st case was reported, due to trips to Europe, Iran, and Umrah," she stated, describing the Muslim expedition to Saudi Arabia. Restricting screening to those who had actually just recently been abroad in the early days of the break out in Turkey likewise enabled the infection to spread out, Senol added.

On Thursday night [2 Apr 2020], Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca revealed 79 new deaths. The figure is far lower than numbers seen in the worst days in countries like Italy and Spain, where day-to-day death tolls have actually regularly exceeded 800 just recently, it was the sharpest boost yet in Turkey. In an interview on Wednesday [1 Apr 2020], Koca exposed for the 1st time the nature of the spread of the break out throughout Turkey, revealing that 60 percent of cases had actually been reported in Istanbul, the nation's industrial center, which represents a 5th of Turkey's population.

Mehmet Ceyhan, chairman of Turkey's Contagious Diseases Association, cautioned that the nation might see its number of infections overtake others. "If we go at the current rate, our number of cases will be 300 000 in 10 days," he stated. Nevertheless, shutting down public areas, limiting travel in between cities and guaranteeing people remain at home would prevent such a remarkable situation.

"I look at the measures that have been implemented, and our people have begun to adapt a little better," Ceyhan stated. "If we comply with the measures in the same way, we may see a fall in the rate of increase."

Scarcities
----------
In spite of winning appreciation for its early adoption of constraints such as border closures, suspending flights, and quarantining those aged over 65, the federal government has actually dealt with criticism over the reasonably low number of tests performed. Turkey had actually carried out simply under 107 000 tests and just reached a target of performing 10 000 a day on Monday [30 Mar 2020]. This compares to more than half a million tests performed in Italy.

Expert medical groups have actually highlighted a shortage in the equipment, beds and health personnel required to handle bigger numbers of coronavirus clients. "It is evident that hospitals in the city have not prepared adequately in the 2.5 months since this deadly virus first came into the spotlight," the Istanbul Chamber of Physicians stated in a declaration. In addition to a lack of protective equipment such as masks and gloves, the chamber likewise criticised an absence of organisation and incorrect screening of health employees, keeping in mind that more than 100 personnel in Istanbul medical facilities had actually checked favorable.

According to the federal government, more than 600 healthcare personnel have actually been contaminated throughout Turkey. "That's worrying," stated Kizil. "The answer to the question of whether we will be like Italy will be determined by how ready our healthcare system is for the high number of cases that appear on the horizon."

Require quarantine
------------------
Ankara has actually withstood requiring a full lockdown, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan requiring services to remain open and keep the economy's "wheels turning." Nevertheless, the president stated Turkey would step up procedures if the break out continued dispersing.

The federal government has actually advised people to remain at home; closed bars, coffee shops, and schools; limited domestic travel; stopped international flights; and suspended sporting occasions and spiritual events. The presidency declined to comment on the effectiveness of its procedures, however Koca on Wednesday [1 Apr 2020] safeguarded the federal government's action and stated the health ministry intended to execute 30 000 tests daily within 10 days.

[I have been flagging the rapid increase in confirmed cases in Turkey over the past week or so as it has been climbing up the ladder of ranking order among the global arena. In a little more than 3 weeks, it is now number 9 globally.

Reading the descriptions of the challenges is a déjà vu of reading the challenges experienced in Italy and the United States. Basically a lack of preparedness for dealing with pandemic surge capacity needs.
