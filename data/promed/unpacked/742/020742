The Health Secretariat of Guerrero established, according to preliminary results, that the bacterium _Staphylococcus aureus_ which was found in the food taco rice with egg, was what caused the poisoning of 709 people from 16 communities belonging to the municipality of Chilapa, and consumed after attending a meeting of former mayor and licensed and a congressional candidate for the PRI, Sergio Dolores Flores.

The health secretary, Lazaro Mazon Alonso, said it was in the preparation of food originated as food contamination with _Staphylococcus aureus_, but additional analysis to confirm cases will be ready next week . He revealed that the presence of the bacteria might be the cause of the poisoning to 709 people whose symptoms manifested by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and dehydration, however, are only preliminary results, he reiterated.

Doctors of the State Health Laboratory performed further sampling in other vomit and fecal sample to confirm the cause of the poisoning.

Health Secretary welcomed the attention of the City of Chilpancingo, the Chilapa and authorities of the Red Cross that cared for affected persons and that so far all were discharged.

Lazaro Mazon said 709 people were poisoned, including children, elderly and adults, of the approximately 4000 people who attended the rally, are safe and at home.

He announced that those attending the meeting were given as a pancake breakfast prepared with ham, vegetables and mayonnaise. The event ended at 13:00 and for the trip back to the towns the participants were provided with rice tacos with green sauce and egg.

[As suspected, the outbreak appears to be caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin.

As stated in the initial posting on this large outbreak: in the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).
