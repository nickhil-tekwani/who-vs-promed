Herdsmen in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region fear migrating
wild Mongolian gazelle might transmit foot and mouth disease [FMD],
which is wreaking havoc in Mongolia, to their livestock.

About 100 000 Mongolian gazelle had jumped an iron fence on Hulun
Buir Grasslands (on China's border with Mongolia) this month [October
2010] in their annual winter migration to China, said Wang Guohua, a
border official in Xinbaerhu Right Banner.

"Border patrol forces have been mobilized to help keep the wild
animals away from livestock pastures. We also had to guard against
poaching, as the gazelle is on China's 2nd-class animal protection
list," he said.

Wang said poachers hunted wild Mongolian gazelle for their meat.
Local forestry, health and disease prevention authorities had joined
forces to inspect marketplaces and restaurants.

Arisileng, a herdsman in Xinbaerhu Right Banner, Inner Mongolia, said
local people had received brochures about FMD prevention from the
county government. "The wild gazelle is a threat to the safety of our
herds, so we have to restrict our livestock movements," he said. In
neighboring Mongolia, 20 550 out of 31 400 head of livestock in 16
counties had been infected with FMD, and 20 346 had been culled, said
Orgil, chairman of Mongolia's veterinary service and livestock
breeding agency, last week.

Enkhbbold Miegombo, deputy prime minister and head of the Mongolia
emergency commission, said efforts to fight the disease in the
country were unsatisfactory. Wild Mongolian gazelle were suspected as
one of the causes of transmission of the disease.

[FMD in Mongolian wildlife has been reported several times throughout
the years, including an outbreak in unspecified animals (antelopes?)
in 2004 (see archived 20040219.0540). The 2 main antelopes in
Mongolia are the zeren or white-tailed gazelle (_Procapra gutturosa_)
and the black-tailed gazelle (_Gazella subgutturosa_). In the
southwest, the Saiga or burhom (_Saiga tatarica_) is reportedly
present.

In February 2010, mass mortality was reported in wild antelopes in
Russia's Zabaykalsky krai, bordering Mongolia; FMD was suspected, but
no confirmation has become available. The animals had migrated from
Mongolia (see archived 20100202.0354). FMD outbreaks in antelopes of
several species, in some cases characterised by high mortalities,
have been recorded in the past in several geographical locations,
mainly in Africa and Asia. One such outbreak, affecting the Saigak
(Saiga) antelope, was reported from Kazakhstan during the late 1960s.
The disease spread along the long-distance north-south annual
migration route of the animals, at that time counting several hundred
thousand. Among the signs observed were the loss of horns and hooves
and considerable mortality (Kindyakov, Nagumanov, et al (1970);
Veterinariya 47, 52). The actual FMD situation in Mongolia is in need
of clarification.

According to Mongolia's reports to the OIE (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9653>),
an epizootic of FMD serotype O (re)started on 26 Aug 2010. The 1st
outbreak, in Sukhbaatar soum, Baga-3 Gun jalga, Sukhbaatar,
reportedly affected 15 386 susceptible animals (3194 cattle, 3590
goats, 8599 sheep and 3 camels), all being clinical cases; none died,
and all were culled. This, as reported, meant an "apparent morbidity
rate" of 100 percent, zero "case fatality rate," and 100 percent
"proportion susceptible animals lost." A 100 percent FMD morbidity
rate is most exceptional or rather unheard of.

Similar exceptional data were included in the follow-up report No 1,
dated 11 Sep 2010, addressing an outbreak which reportedly started on
2 Sep 2010 in Teeliin bulag, Tsagaanchuluut baga, Chuluunhoroot soum,
Dordnod. This outbreak, reportedly, involved 6353 susceptible animals
(1736 cattle, 1211 goats, 3400 sheep and 6 camels), all of which
being clinical cases; none died, and all were culled. Follow-up
report No 2, submitted to the OIE on 16 Oct 2010, stated that "no new
outbreaks" have been recorded since the previous follow-up report (11
Sep 2010). This apparent absence of disease is in disagreement with
the recent media-derived news on continuing spread of FMD, leading to
an urgent need to vaccinate and to serious concern of the authorities
(see archived 20101013.3708).

The data in the current posting, cited from Chinese sources by the
Chinese press, concerning the alleged spread of FMD "in 16 counties"
in Mongolia, are also in discrepancy with the OIE report on recent
absence of disease.

Any help in unfolding the actual situation on the ground will be
appreciated. In addition, observations on the health status of the
Mongolian antelope population(s) will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
