Mass poisoning leaves 6 people dead and 34 injured in the Jara,
Creator of Life hostel for alcoholics and [drug] addicts. The center
is located in Federation Street at the intersection with Mariano
Jimenez in Colonia La Perla, Guadalajara, Jalisco. Among those
affected are 2 doctors and a Red Cross paramedic who treated 2 of the
dead, by the toxic gases emitted by the bodies, which were evacuated
at the aid station at Parque Morelos. The victims ate vegetables, rice
and sausage that allegedly contained cyanide.

Medical officials say 5 [6 in report above] recovering drug addicts
died and dozens of others were sickened by soy sausage served for
Christmas dinner at a rehabilitation center in western Mexico.

Authorities were investigating whether the poisoning at the center in
the city of Guadalajara was accidental or intentional. Drug cartels
have taken over rehabilitation centers in parts of Mexico, forcibly
recruiting addicts as hit men and smugglers. The invasions have led to
mass shootings at the centers that have left dozens dead.

Alhy Daniel Nunez is a spokesman for the Red Cross in the western
state of Jalisco, where Guadalajara is located. He said Monday that 37
people remained hospitalized, 3 of them in serious condition.

[Cyanide exists in several forms. While it is easy to remember it is a
colorless, odorless gas, it is also available in crystalline form as
potassium cyanide and sodium cyanide. These are generally the forms
that are used in food, as this case appears to be. Consequently, a
person may be exposed through inhalation or ingestion or through
absorption through the skin on contact.

Cyanide is used in manufacturing for making paper, textiles, and
plastics. It is also in photographic developing chemicals, which may
not be in great demand but are still around. Metallurgy employs
cyanide salts for electroplating, metal cleaning, and removing gold
from its ore. Cyanide gas is used to exterminate pests in ships and
buildings. Cyanide is also found in chemicals, such as
acetonitril-based products which may be used to remove artificial
nails, or perhaps polish. Sadly this is sometimes ingested.

People exposed to a small amount of cyanide by inhalation, absorption,
or ingestion may have some or all of the following symptoms within
minutes: rapid breathing, restlessness, dizziness, weakness, headache,
nausea and vomiting, and rapid heart rate. Exposure to a large amount
of cyanide by any route may cause any of the following symptoms:
convulsions, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, loss of
consciousness, lung injury, and respiratory failure leading to death.

Generally treatment for cyanide poisoning must be given very swiftly,
especially after ingestion. Unfortunately specific antidotes and are
generally only available at a hospital. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
chambers have proven to be helpful. - Mod.TG
