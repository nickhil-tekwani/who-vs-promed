Changes to the Pet Travel Scheme – implications for human health
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the UK Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) were introduced on 1 Jan 2012 to make travel with pets easier [see part (2) below]. The 6 month quarantine period [in the UK] previously applied has been lifted and most other controls necessary to ensure freedom from rabies and other exotic diseases have been aligned with those of other European Union countries.

All pets are still required to be vaccinated against rabies but those coming from the EU (and certain other countries such as Australia and the US) now only have to wait 21 days after vaccination before travel (whereas those being brought from other countries are required to undergo a blood test to confirm immunity followed by a 3 month waiting period before entry). There is no longer a requirement for pets to be treated for ticks before their arrival in the UK, but treatment for tapeworms is still required.

DEFRA [the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has assessed the risk of imported rabies or tickborne diseases resulting from these changes to be extremely small. Whilst there is a risk that the dog tick _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ (the vector for Mediterranean spotted fever) could be introduced to the UK by an untreated pet, DEFRA concluded that there is a negligible risk of it being able to establish in the wider environment under current climatic conditions. In addition there are other routes by which the ticks can enter -- for example, on people or vehicles.

With respect to rabies, DEFRA concluded that risk of animal or human disease would remain extremely small. Currently, where there is suspicion of animal rabies in the UK, the responsible veterinary agency undertakes rapid assessment and testing of the suspect animal, if appropriate. In the unlikely event of an animal case of rabies occurring in the UK, rapid identification and diagnosis, and close liaison between veterinary and public health professionals, would ensure that urgent risk assessment and provision of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for human contacts is undertaken; PEP is highly effective in preventing rabies if given promptly after exposure.

Whilst rabies PEP is not routinely given following exposure to a terrestrial animal in the UK, occasionally it may be administered where there are particular concerns about an animal's origin or behaviour. Where such concerns occur veterinary and human health professionals should seek further advice as necessary.

Pre-exposure rabies vaccination is provided to certain occupational groups in the UK who are considered to be at increased risk of contact with potentially rabid animals. These include those who regularly handle imported animals such as staff in quarantine centres and zoos, and those who regularly handle bats. Based on DEFRA's risk assessment the HPA has concluded that there is minimal change in risk to other occupational groups as a result of changes to PETS.

The UK will harmonise its pet movement rules with the rest of the European Union from 1 Jan 2012, bringing the UK’s Pet Travel Scheme into line with the most recent science. The UK will maintain its high level of protection against animal diseases after the changes, which have the potential to save pet owners around £7 million in fees.

Forcing pets to spend six months in quarantine, a practice dating from the 1800s, is no longer necessary because of vastly improved rabies vaccines and treatments.

All pets will still need to be vaccinated against rabies. Pets from the EU and listed non-EU countries such as the USA and Australia will no longer need a blood test and will only have to wait 21 days before they travel. Pets from unlisted non-EU countries such as India, Brazil, and South Africa will be able to enter the UK if they meet certain strict criteria to ensure they are protected against rabies, including a blood test and a 3 month wait before they enter the UK.

The changes will ensure the risk of rabies coming to the UK remains extremely low. It’s estimated that the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21 000 years.

Environment secretary Caroline Spelman said: "The UK’s quarantine system was designed to combat the threat of rabies in the 19th century and has now been left far behind by scientific advances. It’s time we changed these outdated rules which have caused hardship to generations of pets and pet owners, and those who rely on assistance dogs, with too many animals cooped up unnecessarily. What is needed is a simpler, evidence-based system for protecting the UK from rabies which recognises the actual risk to pets and pet owners. The EU’s pet movement scheme has been working very well for nearly a decade, and it makes sense for us to have similar rules. It means the UK will remain protected from rabies and other exotic diseases while making it easier and cheaper for people to take their pets abroad."

Chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said: "Rabies is a very serious human disease and the rabies-free status of the UK must be protected. The pet travel scheme provides important protection of public health by ensuring that pets entering the UK are free of rabies and other infections. Scientific evidence shows that there is a robust alternative to quarantine in preventing rabies incursion from those countries where there is a high incidence of rabies and good reason for changing our very precautionary rules. The EU pet travel rules have been successful in preventing any cases of rabies occurring in legally moved pets since the scheme started, so harmonising the UK’s rules with those of the EU will make it easier for those who wish to travel with their pets."

The UK, along with Ireland, Sweden, and Malta, has an exemption from the standard EU pet travel rules. They are all harmonising their entry rules with the rest of the EU at the same time as the UK.

The English Channel, dog licensing, killing of stray dogs, muzzling and other measures contributed to the elimination of rabies from the United Kingdom in the early 20th century. More recently, large-scale vaccination of cats, dogs, and ferrets has been successful in combating rabies in some developed countries.

[Human rabies is extremely rare in the UK. The last case of classical rabies acquired in the UK was more than a century ago, in 1902. Cases occurring since then have been acquired abroad, usually through dog bites. In 2002 a man who was a licensed bat handler died in Scotland from infection with European Bat Lyssavirus 2. On rare occasions someone who is incubating rabies arrives in this country and then falls ill with the disease.

Since 1946, 24 cases of rabies have been reported in the United Kingdom, all imported. Only 4 cases have occurred since 2000. Two unconnected cases occurred in 2001, imported from the Philippines and Nigeria. A case in 2005 followed a dog bite in Goa, and the most recent case (December 2008) followed a dog bite in South Africa.

Strict enforcement of disease control legislation has allowed the UK to relax the rules relating to the movement of domestics. - Mod.CP
