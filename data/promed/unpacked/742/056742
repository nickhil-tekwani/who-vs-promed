Health Department officials say 2 tenants of a Morris Heights building have tested positive for Legionnaires' disease.

Tenants at 1600 Sedgwick Ave. received a letter from the department alerting them to the positive results. The 2 cases were about 12 months apart from each other.

The Health Department held a meeting at the building Monday [14 Nov 2016] night regarding its water supply, which is now being tested for _Legionella_, the bacteria that cause the type of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. While the tests are being conducted, residents at the building are advised to take baths instead of showers and to not use hot water when cooking.

The Aspen Management Company, which runs the building, says: "We also just found out this morning [14 Nov 2016] and will follow the recommendations of the New York City Department of Health."

The announcement comes after an outbreak last year [2016] in the South Bronx led to major changes by the city to help prevent the spread of the disease [see ProMED-mail "see alsos" below].

The Health Department tells News 12 that hundreds of cases of Legionnaires' do occur in the city every year and that tenants are notified when 2 or more cases are confirmed at a single address in a one-year-period.

[If available, matching the genotypes of the clinical isolates from the 2 cases of legionnaires' disease that occurred in the same apartment building in the Morris Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City, could establish whether this is a common source outbreak.

Morris Heights is a residential neighborhood with a total land area of less than one-half square mile and a population of about 36 779 residents; it is located in the West Bronx, bounded by Jerome Avenue to the east, the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the south, the Harlem River to the west and West Burnside Avenue to the north. The neighborhood contains 5 and 6-story, old, formerly abandoned, rehabilitated tenement buildings, older multi-unit homes, and one of the highest concentrations of New York City Housing Authority subsidized projects in the Bronx; almost half the population lives below the poverty line and receives public assistance.
