State investigating flu illness linked to swine from LaPorte County Fair
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Indiana State Department of Health, the Indiana Board of Animal Health, and the LaPorte County Health Department are actively investigating an outbreak of 4 human illnesses associated with the LaPorte County Fair, held 8-14 Jul 2012. All 4 individuals had direct contact with swine and all 4 cases are now recovered.

The State Health Department continues to collect information to determine the extent of the illnesses. Symptoms reported include cough, fever and sore throat. Confirmed test results on patient specimens indicate the cause as a variant influenza A virus. Swine specimens also tested positive for this virus. [Since August 2011, the US CDC has identified several human infections in 5 states with a swine-origin influenza A (H3N2) viruses -- now referred to as "influenza A (H3N2)v, a variant influenza viruses with genes from avian, swine and human viruses." These A(H3N2)v viruses also have the M gene from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. See: Update: Influenza A (H3N2)v Transmission and Guidelines -- Five States, 2011, MMWR Weekly, January 6, 2012 / 60(51);1741-1744 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6051a4.htm#box].

Influenza viruses can be directly transmitted from swine to people and from people to swine. Human infections are most likely to occur when people are in close proximity to live infected swine, such as in barns and livestock exhibits at fairs. Influenza viruses are not transmitted by eating pork or pork products. Since 2011, 17 human cases of [a] variant influenza A virus have been identified nationwide; 6 of these cases have been identified in Indiana.

Individuals should always wash hands with soap and water before and after petting or touching any animal. Never eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in animal areas. Older adults, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems should be extra careful around animals. Hoosiers who have direct, routine contact with swine, such as working in swine barns or showing swine at fairs, and have experienced cough or influenza-like illness should contact their health care provider or local health department. Symptoms include cough, sore throat, fever, body aches, and possibly other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea.

While influenza is not an uncommon diagnosis in pigs, the State Board of Animal Health encourages swine owners to contact a veterinarian if their animals show signs consistent with flu, including coughing, respiratory illness, off-feed and fever. Most county fairs have a private veterinary practitioner on call for on-site assistance.

[The report indicates that the influenza A (H3N2)v, variant virus which has genetic material originating from avian, swine and human viruses, 1st identified in Indiana and subsequently in other states, is still circulating in the state of Indiana and responsible for rare human cases of influenza disease. This virus has been associated with mild forms of influenza disease and not been detected outside the USA. - Mod.CP
