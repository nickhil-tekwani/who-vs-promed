A [maize] miller in Kamonyi District in the Southern Province, said the crop in the district was affected by multiple challenges, including drought and disease.

"Much as there was a dry spell and later heavy rains, in Kamonyi, the maize plantations were attacked by maize mosaic disease, which left many farmers counting losses," she said.

[Mosaic disease of maize is caused by _Maize mosaic virus_ (MMV; genus _Nucleorhabdovirus_). It has been reported to affect _Zea maize_ and subspp., as well as _Sorghum_ spp. and few grasses. MMV can cause serious crop losses in the tropics and subtropics. Symptoms on maize may include chlorotic stripes on leaves, distorted tassles, deformed or empty ears and severe stunting of plants.

MMV is spread by the planthopper _Peregrinus maidis_ which breeds on the hosts. Insects remain infectious for life. Infectious vector insects transported on air currents or by people movements can spread the virus over long distances. Disease management may include vector control, cultural practices to minimise inoculum, and the use of crop varieties with low MMV susceptibility.

In Rwanda, Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) was reported for the 1st time in 2014 from northern areas (ProMED-mail post 20140604.2518403). MLN is spreading in the region. It is a synergistic disease which may involve different mosaic viruses, such as some strains of _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ or _Sugarcane mosaic virus_. While the disease above is being reported as Maize Mosaic, the methods used to arrive at this diagnosis are not specified. Until MMV has been identified unequivocally by molecular methods, a confusion with MLN cannot be excluded.
