Since 2021 to March 2022 [sic. Not clear whether dates are inclusive or exclusive. - Mod.SH], a total of 7 probable cases of yellow fever including 5 confirmed have been reported from [the Republic of] Congo. The most recent case was reported from Talangai district, Brazzaville, confirmed through plaque reduction neutralization test at Institut Pasteur in Dakar. There were 2 cases reported from Pointe Noire.

The context is concerning, as preventive mass vaccination campaigns are not yet completed outside of Pointe Noire; they have been delayed for a year.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

Symptoms of yellow fever (fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) develop 3-6 days after infection. About 15% of people infected with yellow fever virus will develop severe illness that can lead to liver disease, bleeding, shock, organ failure, yellowing skin (jaundice), and sometimes death.

There are no medications to treat or cure yellow fever.

[This very brief, incomplete report indicates that yellow fever (YF) cases are occurring in the Republic of Congo. However, the specific dates when these cases occurred are not given, nor is information about the vaccination status, clinical status, age, and sex of the affected individuals. It would also be of interest to know the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated against YF in the localities where the infection was acquired and if a vaccination campaign in those locations is planned. In 2018, a vaccination campaign to control the spread of yellow fever was planned in the port city of Pointe Noire and surrounding areas. More than one million people from 9 months of age were expected to be vaccinated in this 6-day campaign. Presumably this vaccination effort was carried out in part, but the above report indicates that vaccination is not yet completed outside of Pointe Noire and has been delayed for a year. - Mod.TY
