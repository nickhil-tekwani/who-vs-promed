The number of measles cases reported in Leeds has risen dramatically - with an increase of over 60 cases in the last 6 weeks. There have been 69 cases of measles reported in the city in the past 6 weeks, compared to just 2 in the same period last year [2016/2017].

In the 6 weeks to [7 Jan 2018], covering [December 2017] and the festive period, 69 suspected cases of measles were reported to Public Health England (PHE) in Leeds.

While not all the cases will turn out to be measles, the number of reports is much higher than in the same period in the previous 2 years, the 6 weeks to Week 01 of PHE reports, when 2 cases each were reported in 2016/17 and 2015/16. Reports in 2016/17 were at their highest in the week to 3 Dec, with 31, falling to no reports in the week to 31 Dec, and 3 in the week to 7 Jan.

However, with PHE warning that recent outbreaks are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe, with people who have recently travelled to Romania, Italy and Germany and who have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine particularly at risk, there is a possibility that the number of cases will rise again as people return to school and work following the festive break.

Across England and Wales, in the 6 weeks to 7 Jan, covering December and the festive period, 372 suspected cases of measles have been reported to Public Health England (PHE). Again, while not all the cases will turn out to be measles, the number of reports has risen when compared to the same period in the previous 2 years, the 6 weeks to Week 01 of PHE reports, when 142 cases were reported in 2016/17 and 115 in 2015/16.

The number of reported measles cases across England and Wales is at its highest level for this time of year since 547 cases were reported in 2012/13 - when there were major measles outbreak in England and Wales between [November 2012] and [July 2013], primarily concentrated in Wales but with high numbers of cases in the north of England.

Measles: Symptoms and the MMR vaccine
-------------------------------------
Symptoms of measles include high fever, runny nose, conjunctivitis and cough. A rash then usually develops, starting at the head and spreading to the trunk and limbs over 3 -- 4 days.

People are infectious from their 1st symptoms to 4 days after the rash appears. Symptoms start around 1--2 weeks after exposure to an infectious case.

Those who catch measles are generally very unwell and frequently admitted to hospital.

Complications from measles, including pneumonia, are common, and the death rate is approximately one in 5000 cases in the UK.

The MMR vaccine is available to adults and children who are not up to date with their 2 doses. Routinely the 1st dose of MMR is given between 12 and 13 months of age and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age, before starting school.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, said: "This serves as an important reminder for parents to take up the offer of MMR vaccination for their children at 1 year of age and as a pre-school booster at 3 years and 4 months of age. Children and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had 2 doses should contact their GP practice to catch-up. "We'd also encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks.

"The UK recently achieved WHO measles elimination status and so the overall risk of measles to the UK population is low, however due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, we will continue to see cases in unimmunised individuals and limited onward spread can occur in communities with low MMR coverage and in age groups with very close mixing."

As of [9 Jan 2018], there were 34 confirmed cases in West Yorkshire, 29 in Cheshire and Liverpool, 32 in the West Midlands, 20 in Surrey and 7 in Greater Manchester, according to data released by Public Health England.

This follows on from data from [19 Dec 2017] showing 34 confirmed cases in West Yorkshire, 28 in Cheshire and Liverpool, 22 in the West Midlands, 11 in Surrey and 4 confirmed cases in Greater Manchester.

Children and young people who have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine are at risk from contracting the highly infectious viral illness that, in some cases, can lead to serious complications, such as deafness, pneumonia and blindness.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of Immunisation at PHE, recently said the current outbreaks in England are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe.

In September last year [2017] the World Health Organisation deemed that measles was eradicated in the UK for the 1st time, as the disease had not circulated around the country during the previous 3 years.

As the current outbreaks remain isolated the UK's measles elimination status still stands, and the overall risk to the UK population is low, according to officials.

Another 20 children have been infected with measles in Kyiv over the weekend, according to the Ukrainian TV news service TSN.

Kyiv City State Administration said 84 cases of measles have been registered in the capital, including 20 over the weekend, TSN said. Over the past 4 days, more than 10 000 people in Kyiv have been vaccinated against measles.

At the same time, it is reported that schools or kindergartens cannot bar unvaccinated children from visiting the institutions. Only local government agencies are authorized to pass such a decision, which is not available at the moment.

According to WHO recommendations, the epidemic is declared when 100 cases of morbidity per 100 000 people are recorded. So far, no epidemic has been announced in Ukraine; there is only an outbreak of the disease with 6 registered deaths (2 adults and 4 children).

[Ukraine should consider making vaccination mandatory except for medical reasons, e.g., immunocompromised conditions, especially during outbreaks of measles. The report states that the number of cases/deaths recorded are not at the level where an outbreak would be declared.

Health officials in New Jersey are warning passengers who traveled through Newark Liberty International Airport earlier this month [January 2018] that they may have been exposed to measles.

The New Jersey Department of Health says an international traveler with a confirmed case of the highly contagious disease arrived in Terminal C on [2 Jan 2018], departed for Indianapolis from a domestic terminal, and may have gone to other areas of the airport.

They say anyone at the airport between 6:30 AM and 5:30 PM on [2 Jan 2018] may have been exposed and could develop symptoms as late as [23 Jan 2018].

Anyone with symptoms of measles -- including rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes -- should contact a health care provider before going to a medical office or emergency department.

[According to WHO, measles transmission had been considered interrupted in North, South, and Central America since 2002, when the last endemic case was reported in the Americas. However, as the disease has continued to circulate in other parts of the world, some countries in the Americas experience imported cases. The International Expert Committee reviewed evidence on measles elimination presented by all the countries of the Region between 2015 and August 2016 and decided that it met the established criteria for elimination. The process included 6 years of work with countries to document evidence of the elimination.

Even when a country is declared measles-free, indicating no endemic initiation of a measles transmission chain, virus transmission can occur following exposure during travel to locations where measles is endemic, or from an infected traveler entering the country. The index case also may become infected en route to a location, as in airports and on airplanes, as reported at 2 airports in the US in this ProMED post and the following one. For these reasons, it is important that even measles-free countries maintain a high level of immunization.

Illinois Department of Public Health reports that a passenger with a confirmed case of measles passed through Chicago O'Hare International Airport.

According to the department, on [10 Jan 2018], the passenger arrived from an international flight in Terminal 5 and departed on a domestic flight from Terminal 1. The passenger was infectious on that day and may have been in multiple areas of the airport between flights.

Measles is highly contagious. People may have been exposed to measles if they were at the airport between 6:30 AM and 1:00 PM [10 Jan 2018].

If infected, you could develop symptoms as late as [31 Jan 2018], according to the health department. The health department said most people are vaccinated during their childhood and are not at risk. However, if you are not vaccinated, you could be at risk.

If you think you may have been exposed to measles, contact your doctor. Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Measles can cause serious illness such as pneumonia and swelling of the brain.

Measles is easily spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also be transferred through mucus or saliva.

Local health departments are working to notify people who were on the infected person's flights.

The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) reported [Fri 12 Jan 2018] on a confirmed travel-related case of measles in Little Rock at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). ADH is urging anyone who may have been exposed to measles to immediately take precautions to make sure they have had a dose of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine in the past.

Anyone who was in the UAMS emergency department [Wed 10 Jan 2018], from 4:30 PM -- 12:30 AM, and again on [Thu 11 Jan 2018] from 10 AM -- 2 PM has possibly been exposed to the measles.

People who were in the emergency department between those hours are already being contacted by ADH so they are aware of where to get vaccinated if they are not up-to-date on the measles vaccine. The ADH is advising for anyone who may have been exposed, and who is not up-to-date on their MMR vaccine, to get the shot in the next 24 hours.

Anyone who is concerned that they may have been exposed, and who is not up-to-date on their vaccine, is encouraged to get their vaccine on [Sat 13 Jan 2018]. Those who get regular care from UAMS can go to the UAMS emergency department to get the vaccine. All other individuals who need the vaccine are urged to go to the Pulaski Central Health Unit tomorrow, [Sat 13 Jan 2018], from 8:00 AM -- 4:30 PM.

"Measles is highly infectious," said Dirk Haselow, MD, PhD, State Epidemiologist and Outbreak Response Medical Director for ADH. "The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from measles is to make sure you and your family are up-to-date on the MMR vaccine."

Measles is a virus that can be spread very easily. It starts with a high fever, runny nose, cough and red eyes, followed a few days later by a rash that starts on the head and gradually moves down the body. Measles can be very serious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1 in 4 people in the U.S. who get measles will be hospitalized. It usually takes anywhere from 9--21 days after someone is exposed for them to develop symptoms. Anyone who suspects they may have the measles should call into their healthcare provider before entering for instructions on how to proceed, in order to not expose others.

Because measles is a vaccine-preventable disease, it is rare in the United States. This is the 1st case of measles in Arkansas in 3 years.

According to the CDC, from [1 Jan 2017 to 30 Dec 2017], 120 people from 15 states (California, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Washington) and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles.
