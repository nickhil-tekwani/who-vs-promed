I am reporting an additional case of meningococcal disease in Corvallis, OR, this time in a middle school student. The strain identity has not yet been released to the public. In a Gazette Times article from earlier today, [Wed 17 Jan 2018], it states, "A student at Linus Pauling Middle School in Corvallis has been hospitalized with meningococcal disease, public health officials announced on [Wed 17 Jan 2018]. The student was admitted to the hospital on [Sun 14 Jan 2018], health officials said, and testing is being done to determine which strain of the potentially deadly disease is involved."

Please see the link to the article from the Gazette Times below.

A student at Linus Pauling Middle School in Corvallis [Oregon] has been hospitalized with meningococcal disease, public health officials announced on [Wed 17 Jan 2018]. The student was admitted to the hospital on [Sun 14 Jan 2018], health officials said, and testing is being done to determine which strain of the potentially deadly disease is involved.

Up to 6 undergraduates at Oregon State University [OSU] have been infected with meningococcus [serogroup] B since the fall of 2016, but so far there is no indication of a connection between the Linus Pauling case and the OSU outbreak, according to Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. However, he added, "If the laboratory work indicates serotype [serogroup] B, we'll go back and revisit everything."

Health Department and school officials have declined to release the name of the infected middle schooler, citing federal privacy laws. They also have declined to give the student's age, grade or gender. However, a spokeswoman for the Corvallis School District said [Wed 17 Jan 2018] that the child is doing better. "As of this morning, the student is recovering," Brenda Downum told the Gazette-Times.

Fautin said parents should make sure their children have all age-appropriate vaccinations, including the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine that is recommended for young people between the ages of 11 and 21. Parents should seek immediate medical attention if their child shows signs of meningococcal disease, which can be fatal or cause life-altering complications including brain damage, loss of hearing or vision, and amputation of limbs.

In the case of the Linus Pauling student, Fautin said, "that was an alert parent who saw a stiff neck and rash and got this kiddo into emergency care promptly."

While the disease can strike people of any age, it mainly afflicts young people between the ages of 18 and 24 and is relatively rare in children of middle school age. It is not highly contagious but can be spread through prolonged, face-to-face exposure to an infected person.

The disease spreads via body fluids and can be passed from one person to another by sharing eating and drinking utensils or smoking paraphernalia or through kissing, coughing or sneezing. People who may have been exposed can be treated with antibiotics as a precaution. County health workers are in the process of contacting people who may have been exposed to the infected student, Fautin said. The Corvallis School District sent an email to Linus Pauling parents about the situation on [Wed 17 Jan 2018] morning, Downum said, and is mailing letters to families who don't have email.

"We are sharing information with all the families at the school to make sure they know the signs" of meningococcal disease, she said. "We're just allowing the Health Department to do their work and reminding families to watch for signs."

[ProMED-mail thanks Hannah Carey for submission of the above news report.

- In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University (OSU) students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319).
- In March 2017, we posted a report of a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus was reported with IMD due to serogroup B meningitis (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).
- In October 2017, we posted a report of a 4th OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD that was subsequently confirmed to be also serogroup B (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college 20171030.5412497).
- In November 2017, we posted a report of a 5th OSU student with IMD due to serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (OR) college, sg B 20171130.5473532); and - In Dec 2017, we posted a report of a 6th OSU student with IMD, that is now said in the news report above to be serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (07): (OR) college, sg B 20171222.5520017).

Many of these cases occurred despite campus-wide vaccination programs with a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine started in November 2016 and the requirement that incoming students at OSU be vaccinated against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y. The news reports have not given the vaccination status of the OSU students with IMD.

Humans are the only reservoir for the organisms that cause IMD. Colonization of the nasopharynx of asymptomatic carriers or persons with IMD provides the source from which an outbreak clone is spread among people. The news report above says that a middle school student without known contacts with OSU has developed IMD, which if due to the OSU outbreak strain, suggests that nasopharyngeal carriage of the outbreak clone has spread from the OSU campus into the general population.

OSU is a coeducational, public university; the main campus is located in the city of Corvallis in the Willamette Valley of the US state of Oregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University#Main_campus_.28Corvallis.29). OSU has a total student enrollment of 30 354. - Mod.ML
