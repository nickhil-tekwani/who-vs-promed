Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
Since epidemiological week (EW) 1 to EW 11 of 2017, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Suriname have reported suspected and confirmed yellow fever cases.

Following is a summary of the situation in Brazil and Peru.
In Brazil, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2016 to 17 Mar of 2017, there were 1561 cases of yellow fever reported, of which 28.7 percent were laboratory-confirmed (n=448), 16.9 percent were discarded (n=263), and 54.8 percent (n=850) remain under investigation as suspected cases, including 264 deaths (144 confirmed, 10 discarded, and 110 under investigation). The case fatality rate (CFR) is 32 percent among confirmed cases.

According to the probable site of infection, the cases were reported in 188 municipalities, of which 49.4 percent are in the state of Minas Gerais. This state, furthermore, accounts for the majority of suspected and confirmed cases (1016), followed by Espírito Santo (243), São Paulo (15), Bahia (8), Tocantins (6), Goías (3), and Rio de Janeiro (3).1 The confirmed cases are distributed in 4 states: Minas Gerais (349), Espírito Santo (93), São Paulo (4), and Rio de Janeiro (2).

The cases reported in the state of Rio de Janeiro are 3 men that reside in the rural area of the municipality of Casimiro de Abreu and have no history of travel to states with confirmed circulation of the yellow fever virus.

In the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, the downward trend in reported cases observed in the last 5 weeks continues (Figures 1 and 2). Figure 1 illustrates the trend of reported cases in the 4 regional health units which account for 96 percent of the cases reported in Minas Gerais.

There is possibility of a change in the yellow fever transmission cycle in this current outbreak, however, to date _Aedes aegypti_ has not been reported to have a role in transmission. Confirmed cases have been reported in municipalities near large urban areas in the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais; this combined with the confirmation of epizootics and notification of suspected cases in the municipality of Vitoria, Espírito Santo, represent a high risk for a change in the transmission cycle.

With regard to the confirmed fatal cases and their probable site of infection, 118 were in the state of Minas Gerais, 3 in the state of São Paulo, 22 in the state of Espírito Santo, and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. In decreasing order, the CFR among suspected and confirmed cases by state is 75 percent in São Paulo, 34 percent in Minas Gerais, 33 percent in Rio de Janeiro, and 24 percent in Espírito Santo.

Figure 3 [maps] illustrates the municipalities with confirmed cases and cases under investigation, as well as confirmed epizootics, and epizootics under investigation.

The thematic maps presented in Figure 3 incorporate in superimposed layers the following elements: in red, the municipalities where human cases have been confirmed, and in red hatched pattern (with red lines), the municipalities where epizootics have been confirmed. In the states of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, the overlap of the 2 layers can be observed.

On the other hand, in blue, the municipalities with suspected human cases under investigation, and in blue hatched pattern (with blue lines), epizootics under investigation. It is observed that the states of Alagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul, Para, Paraíba, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul, Rondônia, Santa Catarina, and Sergipe, have only reported epizootics under investigation and no human cases.

Since the last yellow fever Epidemiological Update up to 17 Mar 2017, 21 new epizootics were reported in nonhuman primates (NHP). Since the beginning of the outbreak up to 17 Mar 2017, a total of 1249 NHP epizootics were reported, of which 389 were yellow fever confirmed, 382 remain under investigation, and 12 were discarded.

Epizootics in NHP were reported in the Federal District and in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Goiás, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Pará, Paraíba, Paraná, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Rondônia, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins.

Reports of epizootics are currently under investigation in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul (bordering Bolivia and Paraguay), Santa Catarina (bordering Argentina), Rio Grande do Sul (bordering Uruguay and Argentina), Rondônia (bordering Bolivia), Pará (bordering Guyana and Suriname), and Paraná (bordering Argentina and Paraguay), this represents a risk of spread of the virus to the bordering countries, especially in areas with similar ecosystems.

In Peru, as of EW 10 of 2017, a total of 14 cases of yellow fever were reported, of which 3 were confirmed, 5 remain classified as probable, and 6 were discarded; including 2 deaths. The confirmed cases were reported by the department of Ayacucho and the 5 probable cases by the department of Amazonas (2), San Martin (1), Madre de Dios (1), and Pasco (1).

Figure 4 illustrates the number of probable and confirmed yellow fever cases reported between 2000 and 2017 in Peru. Figure 4 [graph].

Recommendations
---------------
Given the current yellow fever situation in Brazil and the emergence of cases in areas where cases have not been detected in several years, the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges Member States to continue efforts to detect, confirm, and adequately and timely treat cases of yellow fever. To this end, health care workers should be kept up-to-date and trained to detect and treat cases especially in areas of known virus circulation.

PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to take the necessary actions to keep travelers, heading to areas where yellow fever vaccination is mandatory, informed and vaccinated.

Vaccination
The most important yellow fever prevention measure is vaccination. Preventive vaccination can be carried out through systematic immunization in childhood or through unique mass campaigns to increase vaccination coverage in risk areas and also through vaccination of those traveling to at-risk areas.

The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and provides effective immunity against the disease in the range of 80 to 100 percent of those vaccinated after 10 days and 99 percent immunity after 30 days. A single dose is sufficient to confer immunity and protection for life, without the need for booster doses. Severe side effects are extremely rare.

Given the limitations on the availability of vaccines, it is recommended that national authorities conduct an assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever in risk areas in order to focus the distribution of vaccines. In addition, it is recommended to keep a stock of vaccines at a national level to respond to possible outbreaks.

The vaccine against yellow fever is contraindicated in:
- people with acute febrile illnesses, with a commitment to their general health;
- people with a history of hypersensitivity to hen's eggs and their derivatives;
- pregnant women, except in an emergency situation and following explicit recommendations of the health authorities;
- people severely immunocompromised by illness (e.g., cancer, Leukemia, AIDS, etc.) or by medicines;
- infants younger than 6 months (consult the vaccine laboratory leaflet);
- people of any age who have a disease related to the thymus.

Precautions:
- It is recommended to individually assess the epidemiological risk of contracting disease in the face of the risk of an adverse event occurring in persons over 60 years previously who have not been vaccinated.

Local health officials in Brazil say the uncle of a man who died earlier this month [March 2017] from yellow fever was infected with the virus in the 3rd case in the same area of Rio de Janeiro state.

The state's Health Department has confirmed that the 3rd case is a person who was hospitalized and later released. Officials in Casimiro de Abreu identified the man as J.S., a man who was living in a rural area of the small community. The man's 38-year-old nephew, W.S. died [11 Mar 2017], whereas a neighbour was also infected and survived.

Brazil's Health Ministry says 449 people have been infected in the largest yellow fever outbreak the country has seen in years and 144 have died.

Mosquitoes transmit yellow fever, which causes fever, body aches, vomiting and sometimes jaundice.

Rio [state] has announced plans to vaccinate its entire population.

[The state of Rio de Janeiro has just confirmed its 3rd case of yellow fever, which occurred in the same locality as the 2 previous cases. The Health Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro state has initiated a massive vaccination campaign for all state residents. Despite having just 3 confirmed yellow fever cases, mass vaccination is prudent because YF outbreaks can get out of hand very quickly. Fortunately, all Brazil cases so far are reported to be spill-over from the sylvan transmission cycle without urban _Aedes aegypti_ YF virus transmission.

Individuals traveling to yellow fever (YF) endemic countries should be vaccinated. Where sylvan YF has been identified, as is the situation in the current outbreak in Brazil, individuals traveling to or residing in these areas should be vaccinated.
