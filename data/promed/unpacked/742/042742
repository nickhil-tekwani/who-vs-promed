Newcastle disease, cormorants - USA (California)(03) 980615204550

From: Carol Meteyer <Carol_Meteyer@usgs.gov>

There was an error in the posting below... may have just been a slip but
should still be corrected for those that may not be familiar with the
circumstances.

The first paragraph reads that there was "an outbreak of Newcastle disease
virus in cormorants kept at a non-commercial facility in Fresno,
California".
The correction should make clear that the viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle
disease (VVND) virus referred to in this memo was isolated by the
California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System from game chickens that
were part of a backyard flock in Fresno, California.
The VVND virus from the Fresno chickens has NO connection with cormorants
in general or with the cormorant die-off from this past April at Salton Sea
in S. California (which, incidentally, has not as yet been confirmed as NDV
by virus isolation, although it remains suspect neurotropic Newcastle
disease virus infection based on
histologic lesions, neurologic signs and field circumstances surrounding
the event).

[We thank Carol for the clarification. The OIE website carries the
following line below the title of the report of this outbreak:
"(Date of last previously reported outbreak: June 1997, in wild cormorants)"
We regret the error - Mod.JW
