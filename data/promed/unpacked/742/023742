----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the ProMED-mail report concerning the ongoing outbreak of
West Nile virus (WNV) infections in Greece, I would like to inform you
that WNV lineage 2 sequences were obtained from patients' sera taken
during the acute phase of the illness. Sequences of the NS3 gene are
identical to those obtained in 2010 from _Culex_ mosquitoes and blood
donors, thus, similar to the Hungarian WNV strain.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Papa for this update on WNV lineages in Greece.
It is interesting that the sequences of this year (2011) are the same
as last year.
