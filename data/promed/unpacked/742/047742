The following is an official update from the veterinary services of Honduras.
Twenty-eight cases of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) have been
serologically diagnosed in different regions of the country. All cases have
been tested also for eastern equine encephalitis and western equine
encephalitis with negative results. Other differential diagnoses conducted
include equine infectious anemia and _Babesia equi_.
The movement of horses from affected areas has been restricted. Focal and
perifocal vaccination has been carried out and the situation is under
control.
The first case was detected on February 5 and the last on June 15. No human
cases have been recorded.
Brain and blood samples have been sent to NVSL [National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames Iowa to attempt virus isolation. Results are
still pending.
End of official report

My own comment follows:
Diagnosis of VEE in Central America has always been difficult and somewhat
imprecise. Virus isolation is seldom attempted and the exceptional samples
taken have yielded negative results. This does not mean of course, that VEE
may not be present, as the sensitivity of virus isolation is low.
There have been positive serological results in previous outbreaks as well
as on the most recently reported one in Honduras; however, interpretation
is not possible because many horses are vaccinated using a trivalent
VEE-EEE-WEE or a TC-83 vaccine. Paired samples are rarely taken despite
repeated recommendations.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are believed to be endemic in the
region, circulating in rodent hosts and occasionally escaping into the
horse or human population. VEE subtypes IAB or IC have caused zoonotic
outbreaks (such as the 1995 outbreak in Colombia [IC and the large
epidemic that ran through several countries in the seventies [IAB). Equine
outbreaks have been caused by the later two subtypes and also by the IE
subtype. Such was the case in the 1993 outbreak in Chiapas, Mexico, in
which VEE IE was isolated; this was the first time that IE was blamed for
an equine outbreak, no human cases were recorded.
It is extremely important to isolate and characterize the virus involved,
as experts claim that the TC-83 vaccine does not protect against the IE
subtype. In the early days of the Chiapas outbreak in 1993, we did not know
the subtype involved (later characterized as IE) and began massive
vaccination with the TC-83 strain. Because the outbreak stopped abruptly
two weeks after vaccination, we thought that the vaccine was effective, but
it may well be that the virus ran out of susceptible animals.
It will be interesting to see if a virus can be isolated and identified
from this outbreak. I will post any further news in due time.

[We are most grateful for this comprehensive report. Some clarifications
are necessary. The sensitivity of virus isolation, under optimal
conditions (properly collected specimens, tested by knowledgeable
technicians by accepted techniques), is not low; it is high. Low
sensitivity speaks for itself. Indeed, infection with VEE virus is one of
the easiest of all viruses to diagnose; antibody titers are high, no matter
what test one uses (except, perhaps, agar gel diffusion) and viremia titers
may approach 10 logs in mosquitoes, 6-7 logs (as I recall) in equids.
Obviously, in this outbreak the effects of vaccination are clear. Such
vaccination, however, produces antibody to VEE (if TC-83 strain is used) or
to VEE, eastern equine encephalitis, and western equine encephalitis (if
the trivalent vaccine is used). This might put some of our younger readers
into shock but I recommend the complement-fixation (CF) test in such
situations. The trivalent vaccine contains killed viruses and does not
stimulate production of CF antibodies. TC-83 vaccine contains the live
attenuated virus but it does not stimulate production of CF antibodies. The
CF test is easy to do; I just do not know if there is still anyone alive
who uses it.
In addition, the trivalent vaccine does not stimulate production of IgM
antibody to any of the constituent viruses; the TC-83 vaccine does.
Finally, in a study published 20 years ago (Fillis, C.A. and C.H. Calisher.
Neutralizing antibody responses of humans and mice to vaccination with
Venezuelan encephalitis (TC-83) virus. J. Clin. Microbiol. 10:544-549,
1979), we showed that mice vaccinated with TC-83 (which is attenuated VEE
IAB) were susceptible to challenge with VEE ID, IE, II, III, and IV, and to
some extent to VEE IC. Humans vaccinated with TC-83 have high antibody
titer to VEE IAB, less to IC, and not much or none to the other subtypes.
Thus, TC-83 vaccine likely will not protect equids against any but VEE IAB
and maybe IC.
Clearly, the authorities in Honduras have applied coverage at a high level,
hence the limited outbreak and the absence of human cases. - Mod.CHC
