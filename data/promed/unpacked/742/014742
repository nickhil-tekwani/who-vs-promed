COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Hong Kong (SAR-PRC)
------------------------------------------
Information received on 5 May 2020 from Dr Thomas Sit, chief veterinary officer/assistant director (inspection & quarantine), Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (SAR-PRC)

Summary
Report type: follow-up report no. 1 (final report)
Date of start of the event: 30 Mar 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Mar 2020
Report date: 4 May 2020
Date event resolved: 19 Apr 2020
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 1 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: zoonotic potential unknown at this time
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

Epidemiology
Epidemiological comments: The cat was placed under quarantine on 30 Mar 2020 after its owner was hospitalised due to COVID-19 infection. Following veterinary examination, nasal, oral, and rectal swab samples were taken after the cat's admission to the quarantine facility. All samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Virus neutralising antibody was detected in a follow-up blood sample [the test was plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRN); see further under "Diagnostic check results"]. The cat has not exhibited any specific clinical signs. Animal has returned to the owner after completion of quarantine and consecutive negative test results. Risk management measures are in place for this case, including cleansing and disinfection of the premises, and proper personal hygiene and protection. Samples of mammalian pets from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 will be collected for testing of SARS-CoV-2 as appropriate.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, traceability, quarantine, disinfection, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong (regional reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cat / Plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRN) / 2 May 2020 / Positive
Cat / Virus isolation / 13 Apr 2020 / Negative

[The Hong Kong authorities were commendably the first to methodically attend companion animals owned by COVID-19 patients (20200229.7036661). The above exposed cat (from Aberdeen, Southern District, Hong Kong) was initially notified to the OIE (immediate notification dated 3 Apr 2020, covered in posting 20200403.7179945) when found COVID-19 positive. The diagnosis was based upon real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) test. The test was applied by 2 laboratories: HK University and Agriculture Ministry ("Tai Lung" Veterinary Laboratory). Positive results were obtained in both.

Earlier reports to the OIE addressing field infections of animals by SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) presented the following animal species and (in brackets) tests:
- in cats: Belgium (PCR Ct, high throughput sequencing), France (qRT-PCR assay targeting 2 genes of SARS-CoV-2), and USA (RRT-PCR, gene sequencing, virus neutralisation test)
- in dogs: Hong Kong SAR (RRT-PCR, virus isolation, virus neutralisation test)
- in captive wild felids: USA (RRT-PCR, gene sequencing)
- in minks: Netherlands (PCR); the Dutch authorities informed about their planned extended investigations on the 2 infected mink farms, to include virus sequencing and (unspecified) serology.

So far, the various tests applied for the COVID-19 diagnosis in animals have been similar to the ones used for diagnosis in humans and, it is hoped, were validated. In the USA, animal SARS-CoV-2 testing requires coordination with the state veterinarian before sample submission. Reportedly, the laboratories are working on the development and validation of a serologic test and other ongoing investigations.

According to WHO's blueprint of the Coordinated Global Research Roadmap, the expected date for completion of the development and validation of kits meeting target product profile (TPP) was 20 Apr 2020.

OIE has published a document titled "Veterinary Laboratory Support to the Public Health Response for COVID-19 -- Testing of Human Diagnostic Specimens in Veterinary Laboratories" (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/A_Guidance_for_animal_health_laboratories_1April2020.pdf).

From the said document, we present herewith article 3 -- "Types of test and testing requirements" (abridged):

"Ideally, testing protocols should be harmonized between public health and veterinary laboratories and should follow standard operating procedures.

"Nucleic acid detection methods, such as real-time RT-PCR, are the methods of choice for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Substitution of normal RNA extraction processes using heat inactivation of specimens is not recommended because this may result in loss of sensitivity.

"Antibody tests are not useful for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 (although they may be useful to estimate potential protective immunity in individuals, and in surveillance studies to estimate population prevalence and immunity). The sensitivity of antigen tests is not yet fully demonstrated, and they are currently not recommended for routine diagnosis.

"To mitigate against risks of supply chain interruptions, laboratories may source reagents from multiple suppliers and countries (although this can create challenges in test validation). Testing of reagents on receipt by the laboratory should be done to check for contamination.

"Only validated diagnostic tests should be used. If the test has been validated elsewhere it should still undergo verification in the veterinary laboratory performing the tests. Numerous commercial RT-PCR kits are available but not all have been validated. Commercial kits should be subject to verification prior to use and should be backed up by in-house assays in case of supply chain problems.

"Primer and probe sequences for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are available on the WHO website, and several studies on assay performance, with published primers and probes, have been published. Due to viral mutations, primers and probes should be regularly assessed for their suitability to detect circulating strains. All newly purchased primers and probes should be tested for their performances before using in routine testing.

"Appropriate controls should be used to identify any amplification inhibition associated with samples."

In a recent review (Ref 1), validation of a COVID-19 PCR assay from pets is presented (https://www.idexx.com/en/about-idexx/news/no-covid-19-cases-pets/).

The authors, addressing COVID-19 in companion animals and livestock, lend priority for consideration to the following 3 issues:

1. The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread.
2. The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry.
3. The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical service animals such as explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, etc.

The article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions:

1. What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans?
2. What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock?
3. What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers?
