Mystery illness kills at least 6 in Panama
-----------------------------------------------
Panama's Health Ministry declared a national epidemic alert on Tuesday [3
Oct 2006] after a mystery illness killed at least 6 people and left others
suffering with fever, diarrhea and partial paralysis.
Doctors do not know the cause but say the disease progresses rapidly to the
renal system and causes neurological damage. Another 6 people may have died
from it in the last month [September 2006].
"These symptoms are completely unusual, and have not been detected before
in our country," Panama's health director, Cirilo Lawson, told Reuters.
Ten more people have been stricken but survived.
Doctors in the central Panama and Cocle provinces are taking samples from
the affected people and seeking advice from abroad.

While the Ministry confirmed 6 deaths, medical sources are speaking of 17
[deaths]; Alert for lethal syndrome
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities have not been able to identify the cause of a syndrome that has
already affected 22 persons. There is no evidence of direct contagion with
this syndrome, which begins with severe diarrhea.
An "epidemiologic alert" has been issued by the Ministry of Health. The
cause is an "aggressive, acute syndrome, whose origin is unknown, that has
led to the deaths of at least 7 of the 22 [persons] who were treated in the
Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid Hospital Complex of Social Security (CSS) and in
the Santo Tomas Hospital.
The patients presented with a clinical picture that, in the lethal cases,
developed over the course of one week, beginning with fever and severe
diarrhea and progressed to renal failure and neurological deficits in the
extremities.
The Minister of Health, Camilo Alleyne, reported last night [2 Oct 2006]
the deaths of 6 people by cardio-respiratory arrest, but medical sources
said that there were already 17 fatalities in the complex.
The problem began one and a half months ago, although it wasn't until the
end of September [2006] that the authorities considered it to be an
"unusual" occurrence.
In the CSS Complex, for example, the Department of Epidemiology issued a
memorandum on 27 Sep [2006] in which it requested that all medical
personnel give notification immediately of any "renal syndrome with
neurologic manifestations."
In addition, it was known that the Minister and the Director General of
Health, Cirilo Lawson, had met various times with investigators of the
Gorgas Institute and medical specialists to study the medical records of
the deceased patients in order to rule out possible causes.
In fact, the Gorgas Institute conducted studies in order to determine the
causes and also sent specimens from the deceased to the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention in the United States.
Alleyne explained that "there [was] no evidence encountered of direct
contagion," and that all of the patients were persons greater than 60 years
of age, with predisposing diabetes, renal disease or hypertension.
Nevertheless, medical sources reported that the patients were between 40
and 80 years of age. The cases presented in the metropolitan area, west
Panama, San Miguelito and Cocle Province.

[From the description given in the article from the local press in Panama,
there appears to be "confidence" on the part of the Ministry that the
outbreak does not appear to be "contagious," so that person-to-person
transmission seems to be ruled out by the epidemiologic studies. Obvious
questions include what is the common exposure on the part of the patients;
the mention that they are all older individuals with pre-existing medical
problems could be an indication of an exposure that, in most cases, is
relatively benign, but when a compromised individual is exposed, then
problems are seen. Or it may be an indication of an exposure that is
occurring in the health care environment where these individuals may have a
common exposure. And a key question is whether this exposure is to an
infectious agent or a toxin.
Clearly, more information on the epidemiologic studies conducted on this
outbreak would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
