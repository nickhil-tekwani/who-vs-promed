180 patients checked into "Sveti Luka" hospital in Smederevo yesterday [9 Sep 2013] with symptoms of food poisoning, reported RTS. 48 were admitted to the hospital. The exact cause of illness is still unknown.

The head of the children's department Dr. Slavica Andjelkovic said that their department admitted a large number of children during the night, but due to limited capacity of the hospital, those with lighter symptoms were released for home treatment. 13 children were kept for treatment in the hospital, 2 in the department for infectious diseases, she said, adding that all pediatric patients are feeling better, but stressed that, by morning, new children came with the same symptoms. However, Dr. Andjelkovic said it is expected that most of the children will be released to home treatment after receiving therapy.

Among the patients who were kept for treatment in the hospital were 2 pregnant women. Director of the hospital Dr. Goran Kuljanin said that they will most probably be released home after receiving treatment.

Most of the patients ate hamburgers in several places in the city, while a few of them ate pizza.

[Although the post attributes the illness to "food poisoning," there is not enough information given regarding the presumed gastroenteritis and any potential links between cases to assess a common food borne pathogen. Norvovirus illness, foodborne or otherwise, could be responsible, as well as a variety of other agents.
