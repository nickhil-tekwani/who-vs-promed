After 27 years without rabies in the city of Buenos Aires, a cat was
diagnosed with the disease. [On 15 Mar 2008, the cat's owner, a
15-year-old boy, saw it and the other family's cat] playing with a
bat on the flat roof of his house. He tried to take them inside the
house, but although one of the cats obeyed, Sasha did not. 15 days
later the family noticed that Sasha was nervous, hiding from their
owners. On 2 Apr 2008 she was taken to an emergency veterinary post
[clinic] and the day after to her regular veterinarian. None of them
could understand the signs so she was sent to a veterinary hospital
where she died. Meanwhile she had bitten both vets, the 15-year-old
boy, and his father.

On 10 Apr 2008, a National Laboratory for Zoonoses press release
confirmed that IF [immunofluorescence] test and Webster test (after 6
days of incubation) were positive. Antigenic characterization showed
a variant 4-rabies virus. Apparently the cat was not vaccinated, as
most people don't think rabies is a danger for cats. Sanitary
authorities implemented a wide pet vaccination campaign. The 4 bitten
persons were vaccinated.

In yesterday's [12 Apr 2008] and today's [13 Apr 2008] editions,
respectively, of the newspapers Clarin and La Nacion, it was reported
that the Ministry of Health, City of Buenos Aires (BA), Argentina,
reported a case of rabies in a cat, from the Caballito district of
that city. This is the 1st case in a terrestrial animal detected in
the city in 27 years.

Dr Oscar Lencinas, director of the Pasteur Institute of BA reports
that the cat had been playing with a bat on 15 Mar [2008], became
sick 2 weeks later, and died on 8 Apr 2008. The DIF (direct
immunofluorescence) test on the brain was positive and the mouse
inoculation test is in process. The typing of the isolate will be
done on the brain of dying inoculated mice.

[This is such a sad situation and so needless. Rabies can affect any
mammal. If you have a pet, it should be vaccinated against rabies.
Argentinean veterinarians and the public health authorities need to do
more education of the public. Rabies is preventable. - Mod.TG
