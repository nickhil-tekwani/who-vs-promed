British scientists jump in the saddle to identify 'mystery' horse illness
racing across Israel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

British experts have been called in to identify a mystery disease sweeping
across stables in Israel, which is being blamed for the death of several
horses. Experts are a at a loss to explain the disease which has left
hundreds of horses with high temperatures, listlessness and no appetite. At
least 30 stables have been affected and the entire country has been placed
under equine quarantine.

All public horse meetings and shows have been cancelled until scientists at
the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, can pinpoint the
cause.

"It's very unusual and although we are working round the clock testing
samples from many horses, we still don't know the cause of this outbreak,"
said Dr Boris Yakobson, director of the Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI]
in Rishon Le Zion. "We have placed all the horses in the country under
quarantine and restricted the movement of all horses in Israel for the next
96 hours, until we get the results of the tests back from our colleagues in
England." He added that he had never seen an outbreak such as this and that
the horses seemed to be depressed.

"They are behaving strangely, they seem unhappy and they are off their
food," he said. "We have heard reports of horses dying, but so far none of
them have been brought to our lab for postmortem examination, so we cannot
confirm that this disease is fatal."

In a nationwide alert sent out today [08 Nov 2008], the Israeli Ministry of
Agriculture confirmed the quarantine. But the government assured people
that the disease did not affect humans and could not be transmitted by
contact between horses and people.

When the illness was 1st noticed last week, the ministry clamped a
quarantine on several areas of the country. But the outbreak continued to
spread, prompting the dramatic decision to halt all movement of horses in
Israel. Officials said they did not know whether the illness had spread
into neighbouring Palestinian areas, where horses are commonly used for
farming and transport.

The initial diagnosis of equine viral arteritis was made in the Virology
division of the Kimron Veterinary Institute by SNT Ab test. The results
were confirmed by the same methodology at VLA - Weybridge, UK on 07 Nov
2008 late afternoon. Further testing and epidemiological investigation is
under way. The official communication will be published over the weekend.

[A map showing 7 localities in the Hadera district, put under quarantine
due to a "fever disease in horses" detected between 30 Oct and 4 Nov 2008,
was published on the official website of the Israeli Veterinary Services
(Hebrew). The foci were represented as red circles; see at
<http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/6BB602CD-698F-4D6E-8300-88121B3973E0/5099/mapa.pdf>.

On Thu, 6 Nov 2008, a notification to all horse owners in Israel was
published on said website (in Hebrew), informing about 32 additional horse
stables throughout the country where similar clinical signs of the "fever
disease" were reported. The notification included an official ban on horse
movements on a country-wide basis, to prevent contacts between horses
within and between all municipalities. According to the said communication,
the ban is due to expire on Mon 10 Nov 2008 at 5 pm.

According to OIE's WAHID interface, EVA belongs to the group of "Diseases
never reported" in Israel.

Reportedly, the disease there is notifiable and subject to "Targeted
Surveillance."

A countrywide serological study for equine viral diseases, carried out in
1987 by A Avraham (KVI), revealed all tested samples to be negative to EVA,
compared with 76 per cent positives to Herpes type 1, 22 per cent to Herpes
type 2, 100 per cent positive to Equine Influenza subtype 1 and 82 per cent
to Equine Influenza subtype 2 [1].

Detailed background information on EVA is available in the commentary to
posting 20070714.2260.
