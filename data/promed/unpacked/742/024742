From: Ellicott McConnel <eck@shore.intercom.net>

The posting on leishmaniasis, and its relationship to HIV infections was
interesting. When working in the Sudan on the epidemiology of _L.
donovani_, several of us contracted cutaneous infections, sometimes after
spending only one or two nights in the field observing the collection of
sandflies from human bait. At first, I was inclined to believe that these
might be infections with a different species, but each isolate was
identified by Adler in Israel as _L. donovani_. It is impossible to
believe that the local (100 kilometers, more or less, north of Malakal)
population is not repeatedly infected, and I suspect that the epidemics of
kala azar are related to malnutrition during lean years. At the same time,
the story may not be straightforward, and could involve an increase in
virulence following human passage, or some other predisposing factors.
