A potentially devastating mildew has been found on cucumber farms in
northern Ohio, and Ohio State University vegetable experts are asking
growers to take measures now to prevent heavy damage.
The downy mildew was confirmed in a cucumber field in Medina County
on 21 Jun [2007] and in Erie County on 25 Jun [2007], reported Sally
Miller, a plant pathologist with the Ohio Agricultural Research and
Development Center in Wooster and a vegetable-crops specialist with
Ohio State University Extension.
The outbreak follows a report of the disease in southwestern Ontario
on 8 Jun [2007]. Officials do not know the source of the spores that
triggered the Ohio outbreak, but Ohio cucumber growers should be
vigilant, Miller said. She is recommending that all cucumber growers
in northern Ohio check their fields and protect their crops with one
of 4 protectant fungicides. Organic growers in high-risk areas may
want to apply a copper-based fungicide to their cucumbers on a weekly
basis when weather conditions are favorable for the disease. The
weather has been warm and dry with some heavy rains.
The spores are found in the winter in Mexico and southern states. The
fungus can be carried north by winds or storms, but Miller said the
outbreak could be from greenhouse production in Canada. Last year
[2006], the disease hit cucumber farms in Ohio and Michigan and cost
growers millions of dollars in lost crops and fungicide costs.
The mildew first appears as pale green areas on the upper leaf
surfaces. They change to yellow angular spots. A white to gray downy
growth soon appears on the lower leaf surface. Infected leaves
generally die but may remain erect while the leaf edges curl inward.
Ohio has nearly 300 cucumber farms that cover about 3100 acres (about
1255 hectares). In 2006, those farms raised 20 900 tons of cucumbers
with a value of USD 8.3 million, says the Ohio Department of
Agriculture.

Michigan's 1st 2007 cases of downy mildew, a disease that can wipe
out entire fields of susceptible crops, have been confirmed on
cucumbers this week [25-30 Jun 2007]. It was found at a home garden
and on plants in a commercial grower's fields, both in Monroe County.
Michigan is the nation's leading producer of pickling cucumbers.
Symptoms are yellow or dark spots on the leaves and black spores on
the leaves' undersides. Downy mildew invades the leaf tissue,
stealing nutrients the plant needs for fruit production.
All commercial cucumber growers in Michigan are being urged to begin
fungicide sprays immediately and repeat them every 5 to 7 days. Crops
of pumpkins, melons, cantaloupes, squash, zucchini, and gourds, which
may also be damaged or destroyed by downy mildew, should be sprayed
every 7 to 10 days, according to Mary Hausbeck, plant pathologist at
Michigan State University (MSU).
She also asks that home gardeners check their plants for downy mildew
and recommends they spray susceptible crops with a copper-based
fungicide every 7 days. Gardeners whose plants get downy mildew
should pull out the plants and put them in sealed plastic bags to
discard them, said Dean Krauskopf of the MSU Extension. Placing the
plants in sealed bags should prevent spores from spreading through
the air to other gardens as well as to commercial fields.
Nearly simultaneous outbreaks of downy mildew have been reported
recently in Ohio and upstate New York. Downy mildew on cucumbers has
long been a problem in the south but was not reported in Michigan
until 2005. Scientists speculate it arrived with winds following
hurricanes or on seedlings that originated in the south. Earlier this
month [June 2007], downy mildew was reported on cucumbers being grown
in greenhouses in Essex County, Ontario (Canada), across the Detroit
River from Michigan.

[Downy mildew on cucurbits is caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora
cubensis_. However, different strains with variable host preferences
(pathovars) seem to exist and it is not uncommon to see squash, rock
melon (cantaloupe), and cucumber severely affected while watermelons
nearby show no signs of disease. _P. cubensis_ is found worldwide,
but it is most damaging in tropical and subtropical areas. By
affecting the leaves and thus the photosynthetic potential of its
host it reduces yield and fruit quality, and it can eventually kill
the host plant. It is an obligate parasite surviving on cultivated or
wild cucurbits and is spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means.
Disease development can occur over a wide temperature range under
conditions of high humidity. Control strategies include the use of
resistant cultivars and fungicide applications.
The related species _P. humuli_ causes a devastating disease of hops.
Downy mildews in other genera cause serious diseases of grapevine,
sunflower, and a number of vegetable crops.
