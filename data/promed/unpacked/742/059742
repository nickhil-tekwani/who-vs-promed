USA: Wisconsin girl is 1st unvaccinated patient to survive rabies infection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Wisconsin teenager is the 1st human ever to survive rabies without
vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday,
after she received a desperate and novel type of therapy.
Last month, doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa, a
suburb of Milwaukee, put the critically ill girl into a drug-induced coma
and gave her antiviral drugs, although it is not clear which, if any, of the
4 medicines contributed to her surprising recovery.
Dr. Charles Rupprecht of the disease control agency called the
recovery "historic." But even the doctors who took care of the girl said the
result would have to be duplicated elsewhere before the therapy could be
considered a cure or a treatment. "You have to see this therapy repeated
successfully in another patient," said Dr. Rodney Willoughby, the associate
professor of pediatrics who prescribed the cocktail of medicines for the 15
year-old sick girl. "Until then, it is a miracle."
The girl, a resident of Fond du Lac, was bitten by a bat at a church service
on 12 Sep 2004. She did not visit a doctor and so was not vaccinated, as is
standard medical practice for such an exposure. "As society has developed,
people have forgotten the folklore about don't play with stray animals, or
stay away from bats," Dr. Willoughby explained. The bat drew blood, he said,
but the bite was quick and small, so the girl thought she had just been
scratched. Her fellow churchgoers assumed that only healthy bats could fly,
so they picked it up after it flew into a window and threw it out the door.
On 18 Oct 2004, she was admitted to the hospital with fluctuating
consciousness, slurred speech and other symptoms typical of full-blown
rabies.
Rabies is caused by a virus present in secretions, such as saliva, from an
infected animal. The vaccine, which stimulates antibodies to the virus,
eliminates the chance of getting the disease if it is administered within
days after the initial exposure. Once symptoms develop, generally after a
few weeks, vaccination becomes much less effective. They are useless when
the rabies is advanced, so doctors opted in for the experimental treatment
in this girl's case. Only a handful of people have recovered after
developing even the earliest symptoms of rabies, and all of those were given
the vaccine.
The technique of inducing comas has been used by neurologists in patients
with large brain injuries from infection, injury or stroke. But it had not
been tried for rabies. The girl's doctors said they would not disclose which
medicines they had used until publishing their findings in a medical
journal. Dr. Willoughby said he had tried to induce the coma in part because
evidence suggested that rabies did not permanently damage any brain
structure. Instead, death comes because the virus seems to cause temporary
dysfunction of brain centers that control critical functions like breathing
and swallowing.
While rabies kills tens of thousands of people in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, it is rare in developed countries. Even if the girl's treatment
proves successful in a 2nd patient, it is not clear how widely it could be
used in poorer parts of the world, since it requires an intensive care unit,
with all its high technology. Still, Dr. Willoughby said he expected the
girl to make a good recovery. She is already responding perfectly to
questions by pointing to a message board or nodding her head.
Her father said he was grateful to the doctors and their novel treatment,
but added that prayer had made the crucial difference. "The day after we
found out, I called on everyone we knew for prayer," he told The Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel this week. "We believe a lot of that snowballed and it
really made a difference."

[This is indeed an historic event. The original description of the bat
attack suggested that the rabid bat was not preserved. This is unfortunate,
because isolation of rabies virus from this animal might establish whether
the genome of the virus carried any attenuating mutations that might have
played a role in the survival of the patient. - Mod.CP]
