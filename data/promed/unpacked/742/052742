Bird flu fears spread last night [2 Jan 2012] after Shenzhen experts
revealed the virus that killed a bus driver is similar to the one
found in a dead migratory bird in Yuen Long last month [December
2011]. Health officials are racing to track down the source of the
[mutant ?] H5N1 amid growing fears. The 39-year-old Shenzhen driver
died on Saturday [31 Dec 2011] in the 1st reported case of bird flu in
a human in 18 months in China.

Hong Kong has declared a "control zone" banning the import of live and
frozen chickens and poultry products from inside a 13-kilometer [8 mi]
radius of the driver's home in the Shaijing area of Baoan district.
The ban will be effective until 21 Jan 2012 -- 2 days before Lunar New
Year [celebration].

The Shenzhen Centre for Disease Control said initial genetic analysis
shows the virus that killed the man is similar to that in the Yuen
Long bird. However, the genes of the virus that killed him are not as
close to the virus found in dead poultry in Hong Kong, the centre
added. The virus found on the victim is H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1. The center
said that although the mutated [?] virus is highly pathogenic, it
cannot be spread from human to human so people do not need to panic.

Further analysis is under way to confirm whether [the bus driver]
caught the virus through wild birds. There is no evidence that
suggests this virus is more contagious or deadly," said centre officer
Wu Chunli. "Natural mutations happen in all flu viruses."

The victim developed a fever on 21 Dec 2011 and was sent to hospital
on 25 Dec 2011 with severe pneumonia. On Saturday [31 Dec 2011] he was
confirmed to have H5N1. The center said earlier that Chen regularly
visited the wetland at Waterlands Resort for morning exercise. About
120 people who had close contact with him have not developed any
abnormal symptoms, health authorities said.

The Guangdong Department of Agriculture announced on Saturday that no
epidemic of bird flu among poultry has been reported in the province.
Hong Kong infectious diseases specialist Lo Wing-lok criticized the
center's report as "confusing" and "nonsense." Lo said: "They cannot
say that the virus is similar to that found in wild birds and say the
man may have contracted the virus from wild birds. There is no
evidence in the whole world that suggests people contract H5N1 through
wild birds. It is always through poultry. Does that mean the virus
simply fell from the sky?"

Lo said H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1. is found in many H5N1 cases and is not
especially deadly. He said further analysis is needed to compare this
virus with that found on a dead chicken in Cheung Sha Wan last month
[December 2011]. But Lo stressed mutation does not mean it is more
deadly because flu viruses always mutate naturally. He called on
people to wash their hands after handling live chickens and to cook
them thoroughly before consumption.

The government said on 20 Dec 2011 that Hong Kong would have no live
chicken supplies for 21 days after a dead chicken at the Cheung Sha
Wan poultry market was found to have H5N1. The government culled 19
451 birds at the market, including 15 569 chickens.

[This report does not add much clarification, apart from the
information that the deceased Shenzhen driver had a habit of spending
time at the wetland of the Waterlands Resort. However, Dr Lo
Wing-lok's strictures regarding the use of the term 'mutant' are
relevant.

Readers' attention is draw to an 'Original Paper' newly compiled by
FluTrackers.com, entitled: "A Summary of Worldwide Human H5N1 Cases in
2011", that is fully sourced including charts, graphs, and maps, all
or part of which may be freely reproduced (see
http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=179069).

The Abstract reads: "In 2011, 59 human cases of H5N1 were reported
from around the world, a 23 percent increase over 2010. 5 countries
reported cases in 2011, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, and
Indonesia. Almost half of the 59 cases (about 45 percent) were
children under 10 years old. The fatality rate did not appreciably
decline in 2011, about half of all the reported cases died. 4 small
family clusters were noted during the year. The source of exposure for
all of the cluster cases has been reported as exposure to sick and
dying poultry. None of these clusters resulted in sustained
human-to-human transmission. Based on an analysis of the 2011 data,
the potential for a virulent H5N1 pandemic has not diminished."

The document begins: "The big H5N1 news of 2011 was the bioethical
debate surrounding the publication of the details of genetic research
by 2 groups of scientists who were able to create a laboratory strain
of H5N1 that maintained its virulence and was easily transmissible
[among ferrets] in aerosolized droplets. A few of the many media
reports and commentaries are referenced in this FluTrackers report
[http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=177126]. Equally
as important, but without the accompanying media hype, is that there
was a 23 percent increase in the number of worldwide H5N1 human cases
over the number of cases in 2010. In 2011, at least 59 cases were
recorded; in 2010 the total was only 48. The following summary of
human cases from 2011 is generally organized according to the outlined
presented last year in "A Summary of Human H5N1 Cases in 2010"
(http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=157504).

Perhaps of greatest interest is the section on High H5N1 Infection
Rates Among Small Children. "Since 2009, there has been an observable
trend of an increasing number of H5N1 infections among very young
children. This should not be surprising since H5N1 is a novel
influenza virus, and young children are more susceptible to influenza
viruses in general. What is surprising is the recovery rate (that is,
low CFR) for this age group. As virulent as H5N1 is, many of the
infected children survive. The children survive at a much higher rate
than their infected adult counterparts. These children would not have
time to build up cross-protective immunity, so the recovery process
for these young people is worthy of further study. Also, most of these
child infections do not occur in family clusters so questions arise
about the exposure source for these children. What is the nature of
contact between exposed poultry and these young children? Is there a
mild asymptomatic strain of H5N1 circulating in some countries?" But
perhaps there is greater resort to treatment with neuraminidase
inhibitors in the case of young children?

assimilable condensation of the information contained in the text. -
