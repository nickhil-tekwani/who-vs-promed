Cases of dengue fever have hit a record high of 4,628 so far this year --
the highest in three years. The number already outstrips last year's total
by about 400 cases. And the Environment Ministry said it is expected to hit
5,000 by the end of the year. No one has died from the disease so far this
year. But with the wet months ahead, the ministry has reminded the public
to step up their checks on breeding spots for mosquitoes, such as outdoor
items like pails or canvas sheets which can collect rainwater. These, as
well as flat rooftops and roof gutters, should be checked constantly.
Stagnant water pools and even shallow puddles can become breeding grounds
for the _Aedes_ mosquito, which transmits dengue fever or the fatal dengue
haemorrhagic fever. Singapore's rainfall is expected to increase by more
than 20% in the months ahead, according to the Meteorological Service. Its
spokesman, Mr. Wong Teo Suan, said yesterday: "Although the period from
December onwards is normally wet, the demise of the strong El Nino event
recently is the cause of the increase in rainfall here." Since 1984, a
total of $1.1 billion has been spent on widening and deepening of drains
and canals to improve the island's drainage system. This has reduced
flood-prone areas from 6,900 ha in the 1960s to 260 ha today.
