It has been reported by the Interfax Agency on Monday [20 Mar 2006] that
experts from the World Health Organization suspect 14 more people in
Azerbaijan [have contracted] avian influenza, where 2 girls died of H5N1
virus infection earlier in March 2006. A group of WHO experts reported
their suspicions after visiting the Salyansky district of Azerbaijan, 150
km to the south of the capital Baku. Earlier 3 residents of the district
had been provisionally diagnosed with avian influenza.
Meanwhile, according to the Regnum News Agency the state commission for
preventing the spread of bird flu in Azerbaijan and coordinating the work
of relevant government bodies has issued a statement saying that no new
outbreaks of avian influenza have been discovered, Regnum news agency said.
"Bird flu has not been discovered in new areas. The Health Ministry has
said no-one has been hospitalized [with suspected bird flu] in recent days,
and that it has stockpiled the medications and disinfectants necessary to
prevent and treat the bird flu virus," the statement read.

Azerbaijan: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 2
----------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 11 Mar 2006, samples from 11 patients under investigation in
Azerbaijan for possible H5N1 infection have now been tested at a WHO
collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. Positive H5N1 results were
obtained for 7 of these patients. 5 cases were fatal.
Today is an official holiday in Azerbaijan. The government will issue an
official statement on the situation shortly. 6 of the cases occurred in
Salyan Rayon in the south-eastern part of the country. All 6 cases resided
in the small Daikyand settlement of around 800 homes.
A 17-year-old girl died on 23 Feb 2006. Her first cousin, a 20-year-old
woman, died on 3 Mar. The 16-year-old brother of this woman died on 10 Mar.
A 17-year-old girl, a close friend of the family, died on 8 Mar. All 4 of
these cases lived together or near each other. The source of their
infection is presently under investigation.
The additional 2 cases in Salyan involve a 10-year-old boy, who has
recovered, and a 15-year-old girl, who is hospitalized in critical condition.
The 7th case occurred in a 21-year-old woman from the western rayon of
Tarter. She died on 9 Mar 2006.
2 additional patients, from Salyan and the adjacent rayon of Neftchela,
have been hospitalized with symptoms of bilateral pneumonia. Testing of
these patients is presently under way.
Last week, WHO strengthened its field team in Azerbaijan to include experts
in clinical management and infection control and additional senior
epidemiologists. Over the weekend, a field investigation in Salyan, jointly
conducted by WHO and the Azeri Ministry of Health, found some evidence that
carcasses of numerous swans, dead for some weeks but not buried, may have
been collected by residents as a source of feathers. In this community, the
defeathering of birds is a task usually undertaken by adolescent girls and
young women. The WHO team is today investigating whether this practice may
have been the source of infection in Daikyand, where the majority of cases
have occurred in females between the ages of 15 and 20 years. Interviews
with surviving family members have failed to uncover a history of direct
exposure to dead or diseased poultry for several of the cases.
Excellent collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the WHO team
continues. WHO is confident that ongoing house-to-house surveillance for
cases of influenza-like illness, undertaken by more than 90 local medical
teams in Salyan and Tarter, will detect patients requiring further
investigation. On-site diagnostic capacity continues to be provided by the
US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3). A better understanding of the
situation in animals is, however, urgently needed.

[General reference maps for Azerbaijan can be accessed at
<http://www.geocities.com/fanthom_2000/List_of_Maps.html>. The Salyansk
District can be located in both the top row middle and right-hand maps.
Confirmation of these cases makes Azerbaijan the 8th country in the world
to report human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. The cluster
of cases in Salyansk district is one of the biggest recorded so far, but
person-to-person transmission does not appear to be involved.
The number of human cases of H5N1 infection confirmed by WHO has risen now
to 184 including 103 deaths. The breakdown of case numbers by country and
year can be accessed at:
