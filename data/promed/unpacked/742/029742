A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in central China led to the
slaughter of over 12 000 dairy cattle at the end of 2008. The
outbreak occurred in the outskirts of Wuhan City of Hubei Province.
Local residents said that on New Year's eve [26 Jan 2009] the
authorities sent in armed troops and enlisted large digging machines
to dig a pit 20 to 25 feet (6-8 m) deep to dump in infected cattle.
Soldiers shot the infected animals, doused them with gasoline, and
burned the bodies. Finally, the cattle corpses were sprinkled with
lime and antiseptic lotions before being buried. The whole process
lasted several days and nights.

Local villagers said all the cows and bulls in the area were killed
and buried. Road barriers were set up to disinfect passing vehicles,
and major roads were also sprayed with disinfectants.

However, authorities did not alert people of the epidemic disease.
Local media also remained silent. Further investigation confirmed
the disease to be a special type of FMD resistant to the current
vaccine [see commentary].

Villagers in the area said they do not dare to touch the animals
anymore because they knew the disease was infectious. But most people
in Wuhan City are not aware of the outbreak.

An Epoch Times reporter called several government departments in
charge of epidemics, healthcare, or agriculture. All refused to
comment saying FMD is not their responsibility, and told the reporter
to call other departments.

On 21 Jan 2009 China's Agriculture Ministry notified the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) about an outbreak of FMD virus
type A in the Wuhan region on 13 Jan 2009, and an outbreak of FMD
type Asia I in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on 14 Jan 2009.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[On 12 Feb 2009, ProMED-mail distributed a posting covering a media
(Xinhua) report on an outbreak of FMD (untyped) in the Wusi cattle
farm in Fengxian district, on the outskirts of Shanghai, which
required the culling of 440 cows. Our following commentary was
included: "Earlier this year (2009), China notified the OIE of
outbreaks of FMD type Asia 1 in Xinjiang (north western China) and of
FMD type A in Hubei (mid eastern China); the serotyping of the
current outbreak, further to the east, is expected. The reporting of
FMD outbreaks in 3 locations, from the far west to the extreme
eastern side of the Chinese subcontinent, may give rise to concern
that the disease might be underreported; additional foci may be
expected."

On the same day, namely 12 Feb 2009, China submitted to the OIE an
official immediate notification on the mentioned outbreak (Wusi, Fen
Xian, Shanghai) informing that 41 FMD cases were observed within a
dairy herd of 440 heads. See, including map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7782>.

According to the report, all 440 cattle were destroyed. The "Reason
for notification" was stated as "First occurrence of a listed
disease." The "first" referred, most probably, to the fact that a new
serotype, FMDV A, was involved (previous outbreaks in China during
recent years were caused by serotypes O and Asia 1).

However, the new serotype A strain had already been reported from
China in an immediate notification dated 22 Jan 2009, when an
outbreak in Sunwan, Dongxihu, Wuhan, Hubei, involving 58 cases -- of
which 5 died -- in a dairy farm comprising 294 susceptible animals.
The remaining 289 animals were, reportedly, destroyed. The given
reason for notification was "New strain of a listed disease." Among
the applied measures, "no vaccination" was included; the "Measures to
be applied" article said: "Vaccination in response to the outbreak."

The immediate notification above was followed on 12 Feb 2009 by
"follow-up report No 1," which stated that no additional outbreaks
were recorded and included the following significant epidemiological
comments: "For eradication of the serotype A of FMD, we applied
proactive precautionary measures and expanded the area where
stamping-out policy was implemented and 9858 dairy cattle were
destroyed." Both reports are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7712>.

As apparent from the current Epoch Times report, the official
notification was delayed for several weeks. The later outbreak in the
Shanghai district, similarly caused by FMDV A, reflects the
continued, eastward spread of the new virus. It is recommended that
the isolate be forwarded to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD,
Pirbright, UK for further studies and in order to define its
relevance to other A strains.

It will be useful to note if an effective vaccine (homologous?) is
available in China and if it has already been put into mass
application.
