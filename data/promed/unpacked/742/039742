The number of confirmed cases of measles in the Dutch Bible Belt outbreak has reached 921, the public health institute (RIVM) said on Thursday [8 Aug 2013]. This is an increase of 141 on a week ago. In addition, a further 21 children have been hospitalised, the RIVM stated. However, the total is a "major underestimate" of the real number of cases because most people do not report their illness to family doctors, the organisation said in its latest update. Most of those infected are children aged 4 to 12 who come from families which refuse vaccinations on religious grounds. The RIVM expects the epidemic to continue until the autumn and to be of the same proportions as the last outbreak in 1999-2000, when 3000 cases were reported.

Central Somerset parents are being advised to get their children vaccinated against measles. Outbreaks of the disease, which is highly infectious, have been reported in Street and Glastonbury. Public Health advisers say they have received 11 new notifications of measles in children and young people aged from 10-24 in the area since July [2013]. Those affected live in the Street and Glastonbury areas and were all unvaccinated. Prior to July there had been just one case of measles in Somerset in the 1st half of this year [2013].

Now parents are being urged to make sure their children are fully vaccinated with both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Stewart Brock, Public Health Specialist at Somerset County Council, said: "By getting immunised you protect yourself, or your child, but you are also protecting other more vulnerable people in the community who could become seriously ill if they catch the disease. Over the past 2 months, we've been working hard with NHS and public health colleagues on an MMR catch up programme, looking to identify anyone aged 10-16 years old who has not had any MMR vaccine, so they can be offered the jab."

Early symptoms of the disease are a runny nose, high fever and tiny white spots in the mouth. After a few days a rash appears, usually beginning behind the ears, then spreading across the face, neck and rest of the body.

Measles is most common among children aged between 1 and 4, although anyone not vaccinated against measles can catch it. It can be especially dangerous to like newborn babies, pregnant women as well as patients on cancer and organ transplant drugs.

Cllr Christine Lawrence, Chair of Somerset Health and Wellbeing Board, said: "We want to encourage parents and young people to ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations. Measles should never be taken lightly, and you can never tell when you have passed it on to someone in whom it would cause serious, maybe fatal disease."

[Glastonbury is the site of the Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, a performing arts festival, held in July, that takes place near Pilton, Somerset, England, best known for its contemporary music, but also for dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other arts. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by at least 175 000 people, requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, water and electricity supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for good causes. There is consequently a large increase in the population of the area before, during and after the festival -- conditions favouring the spread of measles virus infection among young adults -- the segment of the population with the highest number of susceptible.

The decline in the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of measles in England observed in May [2013] continued in June [2013], with a total of 113 cases, bringing the total since the start of the year [2013] to 1287 cases. The north-west remains the most affected region, although numbers have increased in the south-west and in London). The highest proportion of cases were reported in children aged 1-4 years (26/113; 23 percent), a shift from the 10-14 year age group most affected earlier in the year. The proportion of cases reported in June [2013] aged 10-16 years (17/113) -- the age group targeted in the on-going MMR catch-up campaign -- was lower than in any month since February 2012.

So far this year [2013], 260 (20 percent) cases have been associated with secondary school outbreaks. Small outbreaks have also been reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low vaccine coverage such as the travelling community and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in north London. Overall, 257 (20 percent) of all cases in 2013 were admitted to hospital, including 39 with complications including pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

In England, most of the cases with an onset date in June [2013] that have been genotyped have been shown to be MVs/Taunton.GBR/27.12/[D8], with sporadic cases of other D8 and genotype B3 strains.

As previously reported, the shift towards cases in secondary school age groups during 2013 is likely to be due to the fall in coverage of MMR between 1999 and 2005. To reduce the risk of larger outbreaks of measles in the next academic year, Public Health England, the Department of Health and NHS England announced an MMR catch-up programme in late April [2013]. The campaign has targeted children aged between 10 and 16 years who have a record of incomplete MMR vaccination, or none at all. Returns from the NHS Areas Teams confirm that almost 5000 practices have already signed up to participate in the programme. The service involves sending letters from general practices inviting under-vaccinated children to attend the surgery for vaccination. The primary target population was the estimated 8 percent of that age group who had received no vaccine (around 1/3rd of a million). Secondary targets included a similar number of that age group who had received one dose of MMR, and a similar number of children in other age groups.

Data has been extracted from just over 2000 practices (around 1/4th of the total) on the MMR status of children turning 10 to 16 years of age in June 2013. Comparing this with children aged 9-15 years in 2012, suggests that the proportion recorded as unvaccinated fell by around 1.3 percent (representing around 16 000 children in the participating practices). If this progress was replicated nationally this suggests that around 57 000 unvaccinated children have received MMR since last year [2012]. The proportion recorded as having received 2 doses of MMR has increased by 1.6 percent. Although some of this may represent data cleaning, this scale of increase is consistent with the vaccine ordering data, which suggests that around 200 000 extra doses have been used. So far, most vaccination has been conducted in primary care, although schools campaigns have been conducted in response to local outbreaks in many areas. Plans are being developed to sustain these activities and to undertake specific programmes in some schools during the next academic year.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday announced this year's [2013's] 2nd confirmed case of measles, advising families with small children to get them vaccinated as scheduled and young people going on vacation to visit travel clinics before going to regions with measles epidemics.

A 25-year-old male with no recent travel history and an unknown vaccination history started to develop symptoms of coughing and a runny nose on 28 Jul 2013, and a skin rash developed 2 days later. He tested positive for measles yesterday [6 Aug 2013], CDC official Liu Ting-ping said. Of the 148 people who have had close contact with the patient, 43 have been confirmed to show no symptoms, with the remainder still under observation, Liu said. Liu Yu-lun, a disease prevention physician working at the CDC, said the man is the 2nd case of locally acquired measles this year [2013].

The CDC said that neighboring countries, such as China and some Southeast Asian nations, as well as some European countries, are in the throes of measles outbreaks, adding that because measles virus is easily spread between countries, children older than one year old are advised to receive the MMR vaccine immediately. "It should be noted that both of this year's cases involve young people, as the 1st case was a person also in her 20s," Liu Yu-lun said.

The immunity provided by the vaccine might wane over time, the CDC said, advising young people to visit travel clinics to be tested and receive the vaccine 2 to 4 weeks before flying if it is required. Meanwhile, the CDC also issued warnings to those who plan to travel to high-risk areas for bacillary dysentery, as the center has seen 5 cases of bacillary dysentery infection imported from Cambodia in the past month alone [July to August 2013].

Fraser Health is warning people living in 6 Fraser Valley [British Columbia] communities after a spike in measles cases. The increase is in low immunized areas of the region, including Abbotsford, Mission, Chilliwack, Agassiz, Harrison Hot Springs and Hope. In the most recent incident, up to 60 women and newborns were exposed to the virus in a post-natal unit at the Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Centre by a visitor. The most recent took place in April 2010.

Last month [July 2013], Vancouver Coastal Health had issued a warning after a measles outbreak in Whistler and Pemberton [British Columbia]. That outbreak came just weeks after 3 people were infected with measles on Bowen Island [British Columbia].

Fraser Health spokesperson Tasleem Juma says the best way to protect yourself from measles is to get vaccinated. Measles is a very contagious virus. It spreads easily through air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and red and inflamed eyes. These are followed by a rash, which starts 1st on the face and neck, and spreads to the chest, arms and legs, and lasts at least 3 days. Anyone who may be experiencing these symptoms should see their doctor and notify the clinic before arriving to prevent the spread of the disease.

Victoria's most senior medical officer has warned of a potential measles outbreak after an infected 26-year-old man travelled through several public crowded locations in Melbourne. Chief Health Officer Rosemary Lester said it was essential Victorians were aware of the signs and symptoms of measles in light of the recent case that may have exposed a large number of Melburnians to the illness. "While this case -- a 26-year-old East Brunswick man -- is now recovering, it is possible he may have infected others before being diagnosed," Dr Lester said. The man saw a movie at the Hoyts cinema at Northland on the afternoon of Thursday [1 Aug 2013], and also attended an East Brunswick medical practice on the morning of Saturday [3 Aug 2013], before being diagnosed.

The illness usually begins with common cold symptoms such as fever, sore throat, red eyes and a cough. The characteristic measles rash usually begins 3 to 7 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body. Anyone developing these symptoms is advised to ring ahead to their GP or hospital and alert them that they have fever and a rash.

Dr Lester urged parents to be on the lookout for signs and symptoms in children, who often suffered complications from infection. "Measles is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause serious illness, particularly in very young children and adults," she said. The measles vaccine, given as a combination with other vaccines, is currently recommended on the National Immunisation Program as a 2 dose schedule for children between 12 months and 4 years of age.

[7] Australia (Queensland): alert

A Victorian man with the contagious disease measles visited Queensland before being diagnosed in Melbourne, prompting a 2-state health warning. Thousands of people in Victoria and Queensland may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease measles by a Melbourne man with the illness. Health warnings have been issued in both states after it was discovered the 26-year-old from East Brunswick was in Brisbane from 27-31 Jul 2013 before flying home to Melbourne where he was eventually diagnosed on Saturday [3 Aug 2013].

Authorities fear he may have infected others and are warning people to be on alert for symptoms. In Brisbane [Queensland], he visited Fairfield Shopping Centre, a restaurant in Sunnybank and the Brisbane domestic airport. In Melbourne [Victoria], he went to a number of public places, including the Hoyts cinema at Northland on 1 Aug 2013.

Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said large numbers of people had potentially been exposed and further measles cases could present in Brisbane or anywhere in Queensland over the next few weeks.

Queensland Health staff are contacting people known to have been in close contact with the man, who was put into isolation at the Royal Melbourne Hospital until his discharge on Wednesday [7 Aug 2013].

A spokesman for Victoria's health department said passengers on the same flight from Brisbane to Melbourne had already been contacted. Victoria's chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said anyone who developed the symptoms, or who knew they had been in contact with a measles case, should call their GP or hospital emergency department 1st.
