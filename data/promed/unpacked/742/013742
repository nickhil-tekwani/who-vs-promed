Argentina diagnosed 566 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDv) as
of 5 May 2001, the national food and animal health inspection service
Senasa said in a statement.
The outbreaks of the highly contagious disease are concentrated in Buenos
Aires province. Argentina, the world's fifth-largest beef exporter, lost
its main export markets in March 2001 when officials said they had found
animals infected with the financially devastating disease. That put in
danger some $600 million in annual meat shipments.
A sanitary commission from the European Union, which arrived 30 Apr 2001 to
evaluate disease control measures and the ability of health authorities to
guarantee beef exports do not carry a risk of transporting the virus,
concluded its investigation and was to return to Europe on Friday, said a
Senasa spokeswoman. She said that they will issue their report from there
(Europe).
Agriculture Secretary Marcelo Regunaga said Monday he expects the EU to
issue a positive report on Argentina's disease control measures and to
decide to reopen its market to beef imports by the end of May. That would
free up about $291 million in annual meat exports to Europe.
In April 2001, health officials began a program to vaccinate 98 percent of
the country's nearly 49 million head of cattle, with the hope of achieving
the status of "FMD with vaccination" in 4 years.
Though not fatal, the virus is easily transported on clothes, vehicles and
in the air. Argentina's latest battle with FMD began in August [2000 when
cattle carrying viral antibodies entered the country illegally from Paraguay.
Officials have since stepped up border controls. Government and OIE
officials have repeatedly said it will be impossible for Argentina to
regain and maintain a disease-free status without a regional commitment to
fighting the disease. Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and
Chile agreed last week to work together and to share information to
eradicate the disease in the region.
Argentina's disease control program also establishes a geographical barrier
below which no cattle or meat products with bones can pass, in order to
protect the historically FMD free area of Patagonia, in southern Argentina.
Senasa authorities incinerated more than 2 metric tonnes of meat with bone
illegally transported to the Patagonian province of Chubut.
