As many as 29 trainee constables at the Police Training Centre in Dhule have been admitted at the Shree Bhausaheb Medical College, after they complained about vomiting and loose motions after their [Fri 8 Apr 2022] Dinner. SP Pravin Patil of Dhule while confirming the incident said that the condition of the cadets is stable and they are under observation.

There are about 600 cadets at the Police Training Centre in Dhule. The concerned cadets had their dinner at around 7pm. At their 8pm roll call, some 100 cadets started complaining about stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhea. They were immediately taken to the hospital and treated. While most of them were sent back to the training centre after primary treatment, 29 with more serious condition, were hospitalized. They too are stable, said SP Patil.

"According to initial information, the cadets who suffered nausea-like symptoms were those who had consumed non-vegetarian food. However, 372 of them had consumed non-vegetarian food and only some 100 of them felt unwell," said Patil.

"Nonetheless, the Dhule city police are investigating the matter," SP Patil added.

[With a short incubation period and what seems like prominent vomiting, the illnesses were likely caused by the enterotoxin produced by _Staphylococcus aureus_.

A non-febrile illness primarily with vomiting is suggestive of staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated illness where foods are not adequately handled and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. Other chemical toxins can also produce this syndrome of illness. - Mod.LL
