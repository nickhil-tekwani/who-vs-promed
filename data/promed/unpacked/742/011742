Turkey Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update: 7 Jan 2006
---------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Turkey has confirmed an additional two cases of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Both cases are
children, aged five and eight years, and both are hospitalized. This brings
the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Turkey to four. Two of
these cases were fatal. A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United
Kingdom has today confirmed detection of the H5N1 virus in samples taken
from the two fatal cases.
The Ministry of Health has also announced a third death, presumably caused
by the H5N1 virus, in a 12-year-old girl. The girl, who died on 6 Jan 2006,
is a sibling of the two children who died. A fourth child in the family, a
six-year-old boy, is also hospitalized. Tests on samples from these
patients are ongoing; neither is laboratory confirmed at present.
According to Turkish authorities, some 30 patients are being treated and
evaluated for possible H5N1 infection at a hospital in Van Province. Most
of the patients are children, and the majority come from the rural district
of Dogubayazit.
Plans for a team of international experts to travel today to Van Province
have been deferred because of adverse weather conditions. Government
officials are assisting the team in finding a rapid mode of transportation
to the affected area in the eastern part of the country.
To date, all evidence indicates that patients have acquired their
infections following close contact with diseased poultry. Contact between
people and poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather,
when the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their
homes. Tests have shown that the virus can survive in bird faeces for at
least 35 days at low temperatures (4 degrees Celsius).
Based on experiences during the avian H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, behaviours
that carry an especially high risk of infection include the slaughtering,
defeathering, butchering, and preparation for consumption of diseased
poultry. These behaviours tend to occur most frequently in rural areas
where populations traditionally slaughter and consume birds once deaths or
signs of illness are seen in poultry flocks.
In recent days, vigilance for outbreaks of the disease in poultry has
increased considerably. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza
have now been confirmed in six provinces in the eastern and south-eastern
part of the country. Outbreaks at additional sites in the area are under
investigation. Avoidance of high-risk behaviours remains the most important
way for local populations to protect themselves from infection.

[As of Sat 7 Jan 2006, contrary to some earlier media reports (reproduced
in part in some previous ProMED-mail posts) so far only two cases of avian
influenza virus infection have been confirmed independently by a
WHO-affiliated laboratory in the UK. The confirmed cases are the two
children first suspected of having contracted avian influenza virus
infection and who died subsequently. WHO appear to be reverting to earlier
practices of not confirming local tests until they have been verified
independently. - Mod.CP]
