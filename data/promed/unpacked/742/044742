>>Among other plant causes of cleft palate (in pigs, sheep, cattle and
goats) are included ingestion of piperidine and quinolizidine
alkaloid-containing plants such as the genera Conium (Umbelliferae),
Nicotiana (Solanaceae) and Lupinus (Leguminosae).<<
Neither Conium or Lupinus occur in the area - _Solanum mauritianum_ is a
favourite food plant, but we doubt if it would be responsible as the bats
have been eating them for years.
However, a fruit grower colleague has suggested that it could be due to a
systemic fungicide called Tilt (propicozinole). 'Tilt' is used on bananas
and papaya (paw-paw) - especially during the winter months - when the young
would be in the first trimester, and it is used within the feeding area of
the bats. It is regularly aerial sprayed, and the bats could get it through
skin adsorption of recently sprayed fruit.
Has anyone more information on Tilt, which I gather is responsible for
cleft palate in humans in Coffs Harbour - a major NSW banana growing area?

[When this thread started I never expected that we might reach a suggestion
that bats & humans might be sentinels for each other vis-a-vis agricultural
chemical exposures. Has anyone got information relevant to Hugh's question?
