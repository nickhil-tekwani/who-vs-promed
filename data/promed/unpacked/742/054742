I would like to comment on a trend I have been seeing in private practice
over the past few years. Dogs have been found to have allergic reactions to
the leptospirosis component in the 5-way vaccines (DHLPP) that are usually
administered. Many veterinarians have opted not to vaccinate for
leptospirosis at all, even though pre treatment with diphenhydramine
usually prevents allergic reactions. I am concerned about the possibility
of a decrease in herd immunity that could eventually put us in an outbreak
situation.

No live leptospiral vaccines are used in veterinary medicine - all are
bacterins. Also, there is no evidence canine parvovirus (CPV) originated
from a vaccine - this is a myth batted about for nearly 20 years. The myth
was created by a veterinary scientist, then in Townsville, Queensland (QLD)
and though it seems to endure, has since been disproved. The origin of CPV
is still unknown, despite extensive sequence analysis of several
parvoviruses of carnivores by Parrish, Truyen and colleagues in the U.S.
(Cornell Univ.) and Germany (Munich).
