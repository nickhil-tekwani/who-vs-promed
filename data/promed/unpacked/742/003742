Wed 22 Apr 2015: Sierra Leone's Disabled Women and Girls Union combats stigma of Ebola epidemic
http://www.awdf.org/sierra-leones-disabled-women-girls-union-combats-stigma-in-ebola-epidemic/
[This is a wonderful example of empowering local women by bringing them into the mainstream of the Ebola response. Disabled Women & Girls Union plans to "follow-up on Ebola survivors to curb further hostility and stigmatization. They will also promote income-generating activities and continue with psycho-social counseling to help them cope with the devastating effects of the disease."

Also see: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/teenage-ebola-orphan-tells-how-5584583, describing the plight of children, especially females who are abused and abandoned after having survived Ebola. There have been numerous reports describing a similar fate for other pregnant girls in West Africa. Being prohibited from going to school because of pregnancy adds further censure. It is noteworthy that this organization and UNMEER are addressing the problem. See 1st posting below under "Region" from UN, which also is addressing the problem. - Mod.LK]

http://www.thelocal.ch/20150423/ebola-cases-rise-to
[According to the World Health Organization, in the last 16 months, 26 079 people have contracted Ebola virus disease; 10 823 have died.
"The decline in confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease has slowed over the last 3 weeks," the WHO said in its latest report. "To accelerate the decline towards 0 cases will require stronger community engagement, improved contact tracing and earlier case identification," it said. Thus, while the spread of Ebola virus has significantly diminished, the drive towards 0 cases has stalled for the moment.
