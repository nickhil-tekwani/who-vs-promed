[1] Netherlands: 70th outbreak, Gelderland
Date: Sat 21 Nov 2020

The number of mink farms [in the Netherlands] where the coronavirus has been discovered has risen to 70. At a mink farm in Putten, one of the animals was also found to be infected with the virus this week, the Ministries of Health and Agriculture report. The animals are killed. The company has about 3000 mother animals.

A letter to Parliament [see commentary] stated that the samples were examined by the Animal Health Service (GD) last Thursday [19 Nov 2020] in the context of the early warning (EW) program, for which keepers have to send in cadavers of naturally dead [minks] every week.

These samples were found to test positive by the GD. After that, the NVWA [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority] collected samples for official confirmation. These were taken and examined on Friday [20 Nov 2020]. These test results were negative according to the [above] letter to Parliament, [which further] clarified:

"It has happened a number of times before, that the cadavers from farms that were submitted by the owners initially tested positive at the EW, while later, officially collected samples [a procedure which takes place the next day] were not found positive. These farms were eventually turned out to be [factually] infected with SARS-CoV-2. One explanation for this confusing phenomenon is that the 1st official sample is [a cadaver submitted during the early stage of] an incipient infection, when still few animals are infected. The chance of detecting virus is higher in fallen animals, as the case is in the Early Warning program. The later, official sampling might involve -- in the absence of dead animals AND of clinical signs -- animals randomly selected, which, therefore, may in certain cases test negative."

Based on the positive initial result and upon previous experience, it was therefore decided to cull the farm. "In the current situation, we consider it important to remove a virus source in a new area as quickly as possible. This will be done as soon as possible. Extensive tracing research is still being done."

In an initial reaction, [Putten's] Mayor Lambooij speaks of a harsh and bad message. "Putten has a large number of mink companies. For that reason, we have always followed developments closely and kept in touch with our local entrepreneurs in this sector. As time progressed, the hope that Putten would escape the outbreak grew. Unfortunately, that is not the case."

The mayor had telephone contact with the owner and his family on Friday [20 Nov 2020]. This is to encourage them. "The family has been running the company with heart and soul for years. It is terrible that they have to experience this," said Mayor Lambooij.

The mink on all other farms where corona has been discovered have also been killed. The animals are currently being killed and skinned on the remaining 56 "clean" farms due to the fur season; 21 of these companies are now vacant.

The controversial mink sector will come to an end anyway, possibly early next year [2021], the cabinet expects. Mink farmers were initially obliged to stop in 2024, but this timespan has been shortened because the fur animals can spread the coronavirus. The holders receive financial compensation for this, which involves a total amount of EUR 150 million [USD 178.9 million].

[For the location of Putten, situated in the province Gelderland, see map at https://tinyurl.com/y5jmku3l. The 70 farms known to have been infected so far are located in North Brabant (44 farms), Limburg (23), and Gelderland (3).

The mentioned letter to the parliament, signed by both ministers -- Hugo de Jonge (Public Health, Welfare and Sport) and Carola Schouten (Agriculture, Nature and Food quality) -- is available (in Dutch) at https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/11/21/kamerbrief-sars-cov-2-bij-nertsenbedrijf-in-putten. It follows more than 50 (closer to 100) earlier letters, notifications, and replies-to-queries by the 2 ministers, submitted since April 2020, separately and, in many cases, combined. These documents, reporting also epidemiological observations, science-based findings, and assessments, underline the transparency and One Health approach manifested by the Dutch in relation to COVID-19 in animals.

The information included in the reports, such as the above clarification of controversial test results, are potentially useful to all countries addressing COVID-19 in animals; machine translation will help. - Mod.AS]

[2] Italy: COVID-19 in minks, control

Suspension of the activities of mink farms throughout the Italian territory until the end of February 2021: this is what an ordinance signed by the Minister of Health, Roberto Speranza, provides. A new evaluation of the epidemiological status will be carried out at the end of February 2021. The measure comes after COVID-19 risks related to these farms have been detected internationally.

The measure, informs the Ministry of Health in a note, adds SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink to the list of infectious and diffusive diseases of animals subject to health measures according to the "Veterinary Police Regulations (DPR 320, 8 Feb 1954)."

Although the number of mink farms in Italy is very small compared to other European countries, "it was decided to follow the principle of maximum precaution in compliance with the opinion expressed by the Higher Health Council," the ministry specified.

According to the ordinance, in case of suspicion of infection, the competent local authorities order the seizure of the farm; the blocking of the movement of animals, sewage, vehicles, equipment; and the start of an epidemiological investigation. In case of confirmation of the disease, the mink on the farm are culled.
