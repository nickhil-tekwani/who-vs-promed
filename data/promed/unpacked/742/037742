LEPROSY, WATER BUFFALO ORIGIN?: REQUEST FOR INFO
************************************************

In the July issue of ASM News there is an article by Stanley Falkow, "What
is a pathogen" (pp359-365), in which the author states that water buffalo
are the origin of human leprosy. On checking with my colleague Richard
Truman of the USPHS Hansen's Disease Center it appears that this claim
derives from a 1926 report by Kok & Roesli describing _Lepra bubalorum_ in
Java. Subsequently Lobel (1934) published a paper describing a
characteristic cutaneous lesion in some 158 water buffalo in Indonesia. It
has also been described in Indonesian cattle (Ressang & Titus, 1960), which
was defined as _Lepra bovina_ by Kraneveld & Roza (1954).
The claim of leprosy is based on the close similarity of the histological
picture of the cutaneous lesion to those seen in humans, and that acid-fast,
rod-shaped bacteria are always present in the skin nodules. The organism has
yet to be cultured nor does it infect guinea-pigs.
It appears that there have been no scientists working on this buffalo
condition since Lobel died in 1944.
Is there any validity in this claim of origin or is it merely a similar
mycobacterium that infects the skin of the legs of Indonesian water buffalo?
A paradigm lurking in the literature?
