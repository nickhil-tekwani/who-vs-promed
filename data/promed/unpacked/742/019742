Mississippi health officials have confirmed the state's 1st case of a virus that causes respiratory illness in children. The Mississippi State Department of Health on Tuesday [23 Sep 2014] confirmed a case of enterovirus D68 in Hancock County. Health officials say the child was hospitalized and has since recovered. Enterovirus D68 [EV-D68] is a more virulent strain of the virus that causes the common cold. It has shown up in 22 other states since mid-August [2014]. The virus can cause mild to severe illness, with the worst cases needing life support for breathing difficulties. Children with asthma are more vulnerable. No deaths have been reported.

In recent days, North Carolina has confirmed 6 cases in the state, with 2 more popping up in Upstate South Carolina. Since mid-August [2014], EV-D68 has been linked to clusters of respiratory illness in roughly 30 other states. Confirmed cases According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the patients that tested positive were 10 years old or younger. The confirmed cases were located in different parts of the state, so it is important for everyone to take necessary actions to protect themselves from EV-D68 and other respiratory viruses. There are no vaccines and no specific treatments for EV-D68, so prevention is the best option. Enterovirus infections are not generally life-threatening but can sometimes be severe, especially for children with asthma or other underlying respiratory conditions. Since people with asthma are at higher risk for respiratory illnesses, health officials are reminding everyone with asthma to take their medications as prescribed and make sure their asthma is under good control.

The positive results showed up in 12 of 22 samples sent to the CDC from Primary Children's Hospital. "We've seen an increase in the number of children being admitted with severe respiratory symptoms who test positive for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, the hospital's division chief of pediatric infectious diseases. "In addition to the 12 positive samples, Primary Children's had 37 rhino/enterovirus positive admissions in the past week and 10 of those were admitted to the Pediatric ICU. Utah is the 30th state to have patients test positive for enterovirus D68. Other states have experienced about 6-8 weeks typically from 1st recognizing the virus until it seems to be almost gone which is what we are anticipating, Pavia said. The rate of increase may be slowing but we don't think we have passed the peak of the outbreak. Pavia said there is no way to predict how many other patients may have been infected. The ages of those infected in Utah vary from 4 months old to 20 years old. The median age has been 4. There is no specific treatment for EV-D68 infections; however, Pavia said it is not deadly.

Massachusetts has its 1st confirmed case of a cold virus that has sent hundreds of children to hospitals across the country. The case of an 8-year-old girl who was treated at Boston Children's Hospital and released means enterovirus D68 is here and spreading, says state epidemiologist Al DeMaria. It is not typically as dangerous as the flu, he says, except in children with asthma. "Compared to influenza virus, this virus does not cause a lot of serious complications," DeMaria said. "In fact, the vast majority of children who have asthma attacks get better." DeMaria urges children with asthma to take their management medications. He asks everyone to wash their hands often. From the full press release from the state Health Department (DPH) [which can be accessed via the source URL]: There is no specific treatment for enterovirus D68 infection. People with mild illness caused by enterovirus infection typically only need symptom treatment. They usually recover completely. However, some illnesses caused by enteroviruses can be severe enough to require hospitalization. DPH continues to advise clinicians to consider EV-D68 as a potential cause of illness in children and adults, as it is now known to be circulating.

Enterovirus D68: 7 confirmed cases in British Columbia (BC). Infection presents like a cold, but hits some kids hard and can cause severe breathing problems. The virus causing respiratory illnesses that has sickened hundreds of children across Canada and the US has now been detected in 7 patients in BC. Enterovirus D68 comes on like a cold, but tends to affect younger children strongly and can cause more serious symptoms including wheezing, trouble breathing, dehydration and loss of appetite. Officials with the BC Centre for Disease Control say the cases so far have been sporadic, with 5 of them in the Lower Mainland, one in the province's north, and another in the Interior. Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a specialist in emerging respiratory pathogens, says the centre will be watching closely for more cases now that children and teenagers are back in school. "It's certainly a possibility that with kids congregating more in classrooms with their kind of rich social network there may be greater spread of the virus," she said. But the late start to the school year this fall because of the teachers' strike may slow the spread of the virus.

[Enterovirus D68 is now widespread throughout North America and continues to be associated with relatively mild disease and confined to children in their early years. The number of cases in some situations has been affected by extraneous factors such as closure of schools in British Columbia which has affected the date of 1st admission to school. The extent of the exposure to human enterovirus D68 suggests that the virus has been present in previous years, but not at a level greater than other infections in children. - Mod.CP
