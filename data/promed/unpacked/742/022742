E. COLI 0157 - JAPAN (8)
========================
[see also archive.960614, archive.960617, archive.960620, archive.960621,
archive.960622, archive.960623]
In order to properly evaluate the _E. coli_ situation in Japan, it would help
to know exactly what diagnostic tests are being performed. As yet, the posts
have not been clear on this very important point. Isolation and typing of
the bacteria are more specific than serodiagnosis for the bacteria or its
toxins. There are other _E. coli_ which secrete verotoxins, although they
are not as common. How many are being typed H7 after verification of the
O157 antigen?
