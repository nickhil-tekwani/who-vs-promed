An official with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) confirms 3400 mink have died on a farm in Taylor County.

This comes nearly a month after 9 mink tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19 in humans.

A quarantine at the specific farm remains in place.

Kevin Hoffman, with DATCP, also tells News 9 on 4 Nov [2020] that a 2nd mink farm in Taylor County has a confirmed positive case. He says at this time the farm is under quarantine but does not know the number of mink that have died. [This implies the mink farm has already depopulated its animals. - Mod.TG]

The DATCP is working with state, federal, and local partners on the case.

Update: According to Kevin Hoffman of DATCP, more than 2000 mink have died at a 2nd farm in Taylor County.

This 2nd farm confirmed a positive case on 4 Nov [2020].

This means that between the 2 farms, more than 5000 mink have died due to the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans.

[This article provides little information aside from a large mink farm has been found with the COVID-19 virus and has likely been depopulated. The article states the reporter did not know how many animals had died. It is unclear if this statement means the animals died of the virus or if the animals were depopulated.

Mink are in the weasel family, along with ferrets, which are easily infected with the coronavirus. Ferrets appear to suffer mild clinical signs. Mink, which are kept in crowded conditions ideal for spreading a virus, can become quite sick and die. Mink have been infected in other countries as well, including the Netherlands, Denmark, the United States, and likely China, which is the world's leading mink producer. Thousands of minks were killed in Utah because of a coronavirus outbreak, but authorities there said there it did not appear the mink transmitted the virus to humans, but the opposite.

There is concern in Denmark the virus could mutate and potentially hinder vaccine efficacy in people if the virus strain is passed to human beings. However, in the Utah case, the people passed the virus to the minks.

This article does not provide details regarding if the virus in Wisconsin was also transmitted from humans to the animals.

We extend our sympathies to the producers. - Mod.TG
