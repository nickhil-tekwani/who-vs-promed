Rhodococcus equi and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum: Two
"Coryneform" Bacteria Increasingly Recognized as Agents of
Human Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
_Rhodococcus equi_ & _Arcanobacterium haemolyticum_ induce a
spectrum of disease in humans, from mild, common illnesses to
rare, life-threatening infections. They are frequently
overlooked, which results in missed or delayed diagnoses.
_R. equi_ has become an opportunistic pathogen of severely
immunosuppressed humans. _A. haemolyticum_ is the infectious
agent responsible for 0.5% to 2.5% of bacterial pharyngitis,
especially among adolescents.
