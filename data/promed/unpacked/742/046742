Kazakh officials said 2 people had been rushed to hospital in southern
Kazakhstan last week suspected of being infected with anthrax. Local
newspapers said up to 11 people had been infected with anthrax in the
regional capital Shymkent by meat from a sick animal sold illegally at a
local market.

[From an independent but fully informed source in Kazakhstan: the 11 people
became ill as a result of butchering and handling the infected horse and
goat carcasses. The animals became ill as a result of the poor quality of
STI vaccine available and from infringements of the national anthrax
immunization scheme. The disease is enzootic in southern Kazakhstan. -
