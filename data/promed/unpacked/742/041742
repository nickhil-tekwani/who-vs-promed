A Southland veterinarian says there is an unexplained series of
outbreaks of a type of salmonella in sheep in Otago and Southland.
Most common strains of salmonella in the 2 regions are brandenburg,
which causes ewes to abort, and hindmarsh, with which they scour badly
[have bad diarrhea] and usually die.

Kim Kelly from VetSouth in Winton says there has not been a major
outbreak of salmonella hindmarsh for about 10 years, but 15 farmers
have had ewes die this year from the hindmarsh strain.

Mystery surrounds the outbreak of a salmonella strain that
veterinarians fear could devastate southern sheep farms like the
brandenburg strain of the past decade. Gribble's Lab in Invermay, near
Mosgiel, identified 15 farms in Southland and Otago this year [2009]
with ewes suffering from enteric salmonella, also known as salmonella
hindmarsh. Sheep died in all cases, with one Southland farmer losing
96 ewes from a flock of 2500 many of which were carrying lambs.

VetSouth vet Kim Kelly, of Winton, said hindmarsh was rare in the
South Island, as it typically needed the warmer North Island climate
to survive. Infected sheep were lethargic, had khaki-coloured
diarrhoea, suffered severe damage to their gut lining and died in most
cases, Mrs Kelly said.

VetSouth vets originally attributed the outbreak to a decline in
Salvexin+B vaccinations, which protect ewes against abortions and
deaths in late pregnancy caused by salmonella brandenburg, but also
cover hindmarsh, she said. VetSouth figures show Salvexin+B
vaccinations have dropped from about 390 000 in 2001 to about 80 000
this year but Mrs Kelly said only 5 cases of brandenburg had been
reported in Southland this year, which suggested the vaccine was doing
its job.

Even more puzzling was that hindmarsh typically appeared in ewes under
stress but the cases reported this year were ewes in good condition,
that had not been yarded and were on good planes of nutrition, she
said. That left VetSouth vets with no clue as to what caused the
disease or what kind of comeback it might make when warmer
temperatures reappeared in January, she said. "That's the
million-dollar question; will it come back? We just don't know."

Kelly said her greatest concern was that the hindmarsh outbreak had
followed a similar pattern to when brandenburg appeared in 1998. "The
1st time brandenburg popped up, there were only a few cases. Then it
returned the following year and everybody copped it. People were
throwing 50 lambs a day into the ground."

In 2000, the number of confirmed cases of brandenburg in Southland and
Otago reached 300. It dropped to 50 in 2003 but rose to 200 in 2005,
killing thousands of lambs.

The Southland farmer who lost 96 ewes to hindmarsh would have lost
about NZD 31 000 [USD 22 993], when taking into account the lambs his
ewes were carrying, Kelly said. When added to the cost of buying new
livestock, it showed how devastating a hindmarsh outbreak could be for
farmers, she said. The timing was also terrible, with average lamb
prices for the 2008-2009 year having just risen to NZD 88 [USD 62.43]
a head, from a miserly NZD 57 [USD 40.44] the year before, she said.

reported a suspected outbreak of salmonellosis that occurred only in a
zinc-dosed group of trial animals and suggest that there may be an
association between zinc administration and salmonellosis.

No one really knows why Brandenburg or Hindmarsh seem to pop up. Zinc
oxide is used in the face of mycotoxin outreaks, so how important the
association mentioned above may be is unknown. - Mod.TG]
