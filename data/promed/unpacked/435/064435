Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds), Uganda
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received [and submitted] on 16 Jan 2017 from Dr Nicholas Kauta, director Animal Resources, Department of Livestock Health and Entomology, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Entebbe, Uganda

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 2 Jan 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 14 Jan 2017
Reason for notification: first occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: highly pathogenic influenza A virus
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1: Kachanga, Bukibanga, Bukakata, Masaka
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Jan 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
White-winged tern: _Chlidonias leucopterus_ (Laridae) / - / 1000 / 600 / 0 / 0

Outbreak 2: Lutembe, Wakiso
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Jan 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
White-winged tern: _Chlidonias leucopterus_ (Laridae) / - / 1000 / 600 / 0 / 0

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
White-winged tern: _Chlidonias leucopterus_ (Laridae) / - / 2000 / 1200 / 0 / 0

White-winged Tern: _Chlidonias leucopterus_ (Laridae) / ** / ** / 60 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.

Epidemiological comments: there are still continuous deaths of wild ducks and birds along the shores and islands of Lake Victoria in Masaka and Wakiso districts. In Masaka alone, wild and domestic birds are dying at alarming numbers and in Lutembe, wetland white-winged terns are the ones dying. This is already a big threat to over 30 million domestic poultry in Uganda which calls for an urgent response to control the spread of the disease from wild birds to domestic birds.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; disinfection/disinfestations; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Since 2014 cases of HPAI H5N1 and most recently H5N8 have been reported in Africa. The following comment by Mods. AS/CRD published in posting 20161219.4709905 is applicable here:

"The identification of HPAI H5N8 in an open range poultry holding in the state of Kano, north western Nigeria, reflects the spread of this highly infectious virus strain, already circulating in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, in a southwestern direction into West Africa. In view of the information about the possible source of this outbreak in an animal market, it may be assumed that the virus is already widely circulating. In case it follows the footsteps (or rather areal path/flyway) of the recent HPAI events in Nigeria, namely the HPAI H5N1 epizootics, the H5N8 spread into central Nigeria and in other countries in the region should not be a surprise".

Recently, outbreaks caused by different HPAI H5 subtypes have been reported in both Europe (H5N8) and Asia (H5N1, H5N8 and H5N6).

Since the main species affected in this event is a migratory bird, and the neuraminidase has not yet been determined, characterizing the subtype and strain of this virus is very important and requested.

The white-winged tern has an extensive range, extending from central and south east Europe to central Asia and New Zealand. At the beginning of winter it migrates in large flocks to Africa, south Asia and Australia. It is found from sea level up to around 2000 meters http://www.arkive.org/white-winged-tern/chlidonias-leucopterus/. See a distribution map of breeding, feeding, wintering and resident of white-winged tern at http://www.avibirds.com/euhtml/White-Winged_Tern.html. - Mod.CRD
