Equine influenza in New South Wales, Australia
----------------------------------------------
Australia and New Zealand are the only countries with significant
equine industries that have been free from equine influenza. Horses
in Australia are not vaccinated. An outbreak of equine influenza
would have a major impact on the equine stud and racing industries.
Quarantine programs have been developed for the safe movement of
horses internationally for breeding, racing, and other purposes. At
this time of year, there is a high demand on quarantine facilities in
Australia for importation of horses for racing and breeding purposes.
Between 17 and 20 Aug 2007, at a quarantine station in Sydney, New
South Wales, Australia, 3 horses recorded elevated temperatures and
signs consistent with a respiratory infection. Another 3 horses
subsequently developed nasal discharge and minor temperature elevations.
Affected horses and those at risk of exposure on the quarantine
station were tested for equine influenza as a precaution. At the
CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization)
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) 5 samples gave a positive
result to a TaqMan real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test for
influenza A viruses. Conventional PCR specific for H3 equine
influenza confirmed these 5 animals to be positive. Sequencing of PCR
product from these animals showed that the PCR product was different
from strains of equine influenza viruses held as laboratory controls
at AAHL. Virus isolation is currently underway at AAHL's biosecure facility.
Blood test results from the initial 3 horses with clinical signs
suggest that one of the 3 horses had recent exposure to equine influenza.
On the basis of the test results to date and the clinical signs
observed, the horses in the quarantine station will remain in
quarantine until it is determined that the group does not represent a
risk of introducing equine influenza. The source of infection of the
horses in the quarantine station is yet to be determined. The station
contains horses from the United States of America, United Kingdom,
Ireland, and Japan, all of which have previously reported the
presence of equine influenza.
On 24 Aug 2007, some horses at a riding centre in Sydney displayed
signs consistent with a respiratory infection. A total of 11 horses
have given a positive result to an influenza A screening test
conducted at the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute in NSW,
subsequently confirmed by AAHL. Further testing specific for H3
equine influenza is currently being undertaken.
Investigations are underway to determine any links between the riding
centre and the quarantine station.
The Chief Veterinary Officers of Australia's states and territories,
the Australian Chief Veterinary Officer, Australia's quarantine
officials, and representatives of relevant industries met on 25 Aug
2007 to discuss the situation.
It was agreed that all states and territories would implement a
standstill on the movement of horses for at least the next 72 hours.
Animal health authorities recommend that all equine events and
gatherings should not take place during that time. Racing clubs and
other equine associations are being asked to cancel or postpone any
meetings or events.
Control zones of 10 km (6.2 mi) radius have been established around
the 2 suspect premises in New South Wales. Surveillance and tracing
of horse movements from the affected areas is underway.
Horse owners and veterinarians have been advised to report any
suspicious cases and a hotline is in place for this purpose.
I have notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of
these findings.
