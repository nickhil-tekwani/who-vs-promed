West Nile Virus; Host/Pathogen Relationship
-------------------------------------------
The Promed mail [ProMED-mail post of 28 Oct 2000 [West Nile virus
surveillance - USA (45) on 'Possible Additional Reservoir Hosts for West
Nile Virus' made some interesting points regarding the identification of
reservoir hosts for the virus in North America.
However, it was suggested that crows are not a reservoir because of the
high mortality in West Nile Virus-infected crows. Natural selection will
tend to maximize the net reproductive value of a virus, not necessarily
minimize virulence for the reservoir host. To quote Robert May, "Evolution
could favour decreasing virulence, increasing virulence, or convergence to
some intermediate level. There is no a priori way of knowing. The details
matter." (R. M. May, 1995, The co-evolutionary dynamics of viruses and
their hosts, In: Molecular Basis of Viral Evolution, A Gibbs, CH Calisher &
F Garcia-Arenal, eds., Cambridge University Press).
With regard to West Nile Virus in North America, most of the details are
unknown. It would seem unwise to discount crows as an important reservoir
at this time.

West Nile Virus; Possibility Of Cryptic Spread
----------------------------------------------
If bird-to-bird transmission proved to be the case in the field [as well as
under experimental conditions, West Nile virus might continue to spread
from bird to bird in colder weather when mosquitoes are not active. Since
many (most?) states quit surveillance activities by the end of November,
any bird-to-bird spread of West Nile virus into new areas or into new bird
populations during this time would likely pass unnoticed, at least until
surveillance restarted in the spring.
