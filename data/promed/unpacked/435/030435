Chlamydia Outbreak Kills a Dozen Penguins
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of chlamydiosis at the San Francisco Zoo has left a dozen
penguins dead, according to a spokesman.
The Chlamydia bacteria, which were most likely transmitted to the birds by
an infected seagull, are spread through airborne saliva or other bodily
fluids, said Bob Jenkins, the zoo's director of animal care and
conservation. A similar disease is sexually transmitted in humans.
Jenkins said that at [the height of the outbreak], nearly 80 percent of the
zoo's penguin colony was infected. "It required very aggressive treatment
on our part." Zoo workers first noticed several lethargic birds about 2
months ago. The penguins that died were mostly original members of the
colony and about 20 years old, Jenkins said. Their weakened immune systems
led to kidney failure and respiratory distress, which eventually killed
them. The average penguin's life span is 15 to 20 years.
Precautions were taken to ensure no other animals or human visitors were
infected. Only certain keepers wearing special clothing and masks took care
of the penguins, the whole area was routinely disinfected, and the birds
were treated with antibiotics, Jenkins said. He added this was the 1st
chlamydiosis outbreak among the penguins. Some of the zoo's 55 remaining
penguins are still recovering, he said. "It's a strong colony, so it seems
to be bouncing back well," Jenkins said.

[This article mentions that humans may be at risk of acquiring avian
chlamydiosis, which is a zoonotic disease. Generally people are
exposed through air- or dust-borne organisms when processing a flock.
The birds shed the organism from their digestive or respiratory
tracts. In people the disease usually has a respiratory
characterization and progresses to flu-like symptoms. It may produce
pneumonia, organ failure, and death if left untreated. The zoo has
appropriately taken precautions regarding its workers and visitors. -
