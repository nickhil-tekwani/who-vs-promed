The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa reported on 3 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in 2 provinces between 30 Oct and 5 Nov [2020].

Officials say the cases were reported in Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces and do not constitute an outbreak but warrant heightened attention (a cluster or outbreak is defined as 3 cases within one health district within one month).

NICD reports declining vaccine coverage rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Measles is a contagious disease caused by the measles virus and is spread by droplets from respiratory secretions of infected persons when coughing or sneezing. People at high risk for severe illness and complications from measles include infants and children aged under 5 years, pregnant women, and persons with compromised immune systems, such as from certain cancers and HIV infection.

Vaccination is the most important way of preventing measles. The Department of Health provides measles vaccine free of charge at local clinics.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail post of measles in South Africa this year (2020).

These are scattered cases and not a focal outbreak. The above comment indicates that measles vaccine coverage has been declining in the country since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic there. Making up for lost ground with expanded vaccination coverage in the face of the pandemic will be difficult.

Although South Africa is not on the CDC list for African countries with current measles outbreaks (see: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/measles-africa), travelers going to South Africa or other countries in Africa, and especially those on the outbreak list, should be vaccinated. - Mod.TY
