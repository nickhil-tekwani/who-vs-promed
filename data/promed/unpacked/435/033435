-----------------------------------------------------------------
The report excerpted from the NovaNewsNow.com mentioned that the EEE virus
is believed to be spread between nonmigratory birds by mosquitoes that
generally don't bite horses or humans. Indeed, mosquitoes of the genus
_Culiseta_ are highly ornithophilic, and serve as the main enzootic vectors
for EEE virus in North America. Whereas _Culiseta_ mosquitoes do, indeed,
sometimes stray and feed upon mammals (including people), mosquitoes of
other genera (most often _Aedes_) seem to serve as the most likely bridge
vectors.

The identities of the offending mosquitoes in Nova Scotia remain elusive.
The efforts by DNR to survey deer for evidence of virus exposure may help
highlight the extent of exposure across the island. More interesting,
however, would be a survey of birds and, next year, of _Culiseta_
mosquitoes. The results of such an effort can help elucidate temporal and
spatial parameters of enzootic transmission (if this occurs on Nova
Scotia), and would serve as the basis for improved surveillance and
intervention activities.
