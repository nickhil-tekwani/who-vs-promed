State of Ceara interrupts chain of transmission of measles
----------------------------------------------------------
To combat the outbreak, the ministry sent the state 5.1 million doses of measles vaccines, including MR [measles, rubella], MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella, and MMRV [MMR vaccine with the addition of chickenpox vaccine or varicella vaccine.]

The health minister, Arthur Chioro, announced on [Thu 24 Sep 2015], in Brasilia, together with the governor of Ceara, Camilo Sobreira de Santana, the end of the measles outbreak in the state. Between 2013 and 2015, 4094 suspected cases of measles were reported in the state of Ceara. Of these, 22 per cent (916/4094) were confirmed and 78 per cent (3178/4094) discarded.

Since 2000, there had been no continued transmission of measles in the country. In 2013 and 2014 a measles outbreak occurred in the states of Pernambuco and Ceara, which affected people in all age groups. In Pernambuco, the transmission was interrupted after the development of different vaccination strategies. Outbreaks occur due to so-called 'imported viruses' that infect susceptible -- that is, unvaccinated people -- who can then transmit the disease. Therefore, it is important that the entire population is immunized and up to date with their vaccinations.

During the announcement, the health minister pointed out that there was strong teamwork between the Ministry of Health, the state, and municipalities to stop the virus transmission chain. "This success was only possible due to the intense coordination between all involved, proving once again the quality and speed of surveillance strategies developed under the Unified Health System (SUS). However, it is essential to maintain an active epidemiological surveillance and vaccination strategy to eliminate pockets of susceptible individuals in the population of unvaccinated people aged 6 months to 49 years old across the state," said Chioro.

The governor of Ceara thanked the minister of health for their partnership in combating the outbreak. "It was the collective planning of the 3 federal agencies that allowed us to fight the measles outbreak in Ceara. Health is one of the great challenges of our country, and collaborative actions like the one used in our state is one of the ways to face this challenge," said Camilo Sobreira.

Throughout the period of the outbreak, the Ministry of Health closely followed and supported Ceara and its municipalities in carrying out prevention and control of the measles outbreak in the state. They sent financial resources amounting to 2.2 million Brazilian real [BRL] (about USD 530 000). They were also supported by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO), which provided the state BRL 1.2 million (USD 290 000). In addition, they distributed 5.1 million doses of measles vaccines with components (MR, MMR, and MMRV), for the main strategic vaccination front in the state.

These funds were used in the development of vaccination actions in the affected municipalities, the training of human resources, mobilization and training of health workers, and hiring teams to strengthen existing professionals. In addition, resources served to provide overtime pay for the maintenance of vaccinator teams and supervisors over long weekends, holidays, and extended periods, in addition to logistics services to meet the demands of epidemiological surveillance areas, laboratories, and immunizations.

"The actions we undertook are permanent: expansion of vaccination and active house to house case searching. The fact that the transmission chain is broken does not mean that there are no more cases of measles worldwide. We must maintain our surveillance activities so that whenever there are new suspected cases, we can trigger the necessary steps to avoid the reintroduction of the virus in the country," said secretary of health surveillance, Ministry of Health, Antonio Carlos Nardi.

The months with the highest numbers of confirmed cases in Ceara were January, July, and August 2014. The highest incidence -- 8.6 per 100 000 inhabitants -- was also recorded that year. To block the spread of the virus in the state, the Ministry of Health intensified routine vaccination with the expansion of the age range for children from 6 months to 5 years of age, and health professionals. In addition, people were vaccinated at up to 29 years of age in the cities of Fortaleza and Caucaia. Another measure was the selective vaccination of people who had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of the disease.

In 2014, the National Campaign Against Polio and Measles reached 100 per cent of the target audience in the state. The vaccine offered by SUS is part of the National Immunization Program of the National Immunization Calendar and is available throughout the year at more than 35 000 nationwide vaccination posts.

According to WHO, 160 000 cases of the disease were registered throughout the world in 2014. It is noteworthy that, with tourism and trade flows between countries, the risk of importing the virus is higher, and so is the importance of immunization.
