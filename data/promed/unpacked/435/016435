Devastated by summer's unprecedented firestorms, Australia's koalas are facing a potentially more serious and enduring existential threat from a fellow mammal -- the bat.

A new collaborative study led by Burnet Institute and CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation] scientists reveals bats as a reservoir for a family of deadly viruses that cause an AIDS-like disease in koalas, a finding with important implications for the conservation of the iconic marsupial.

The study also identified a new addition to the retrovirus family, the 1st infectious retrovirus found circulating in bats, discovered by co-lead author, Mary Tachedjian, a Senior Experimental Scientist at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency.

Published in the prestigious journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), the research reveals Australian and Asian bats to be carriers of multiple gammaretroviruses very closely related to the koala retrovirus, known as KoRV.

By depressing the immune system in a similar way to HIV in humans, KoRV renders the koala susceptible to cancers and infections including chlamydia -- a cause of infertility, blindness and kidney failure -- and is estimated to infect the majority of Australia's koalas.

Co-lead author of the study, Burnet Research Officer, Dr Joshua Hayward, said retroviruses like HIV are known for being transmitted between different species, and the presence of infectious KoRV-like viruses in bats raises concerns for other Australian animals which could become infected.

"This could explain how KoRV-related viruses originally got to Australia from South-East Asia in the 1st place, and it highlights the role of bats as really important reservoirs of viruses that can be transmitted to other animal species," Dr Hayward said.

Able to host but remain unaffected by viruses deadly to other mammals -- including Ebola, Hendra, and coronaviruses -- bats transmit viruses through their droppings and bodily fluids, putting animals that share their habitat, including the koala, at risk.

The new retrovirus discovered by the study that's closely related to KoRV, named Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus (HPG), was found to be capable of replicating in human and bat cells in laboratory cell cultures.

Corresponding author of the study, Burnet Institute Head of Life Sciences, and President of the Australasian Virology Society, Professor Gilda Tachedjian, said: "The further we encroach into bat habitats, the greater the chance of a spillover of viruses from bats to animals and humans, so the identification and characterisation of what viruses might be out there is really important."

Dr Hayward said the study highlights the need for ongoing research into the impact of the spill over of viruses between species, and how we might harness bat antiviral mechanisms to prevent and control viral infections.

"A philanthropic foundation has already recognised the importance of this research and kick-started the next phase," he said. "Burnet is urgently seeking funding of AUD 186 000 [about USD 117 600], which is a small sum given the devastating impact of KoRV on Koalas."

This study was led by Burnet Institute and the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (formerly the Australian Animal Health Laboratory), Health and Biosecurity Business Unit CSIRO, with major contributions from the Robert Koch Institute, Centre for Biological Threats and Special Pathogens, and The University of Sydney School of Life and Environmental Sciences and Sydney Medical School, Sydney, Australia.

Before the discovery of the koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV), mammalian endogenous retroviruses were thought not to produce infectious particles. KoRV retains its ability to form virus particles capable of 'de novo' horizontal infection transmission. Due to this, it is thought to be undergoing a process of 'endogenization'.

Recent investigations in koalas kept in zoos revealed the existence of 4 subtypes of KoRV, KoRV-A, KoRV-B, and KoRV-J. Different subtypes have different traits in their transmission and pathogenicity.

In the new study reported here, the authors describe the 1st exogenous retrovirus in bats, the Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus (HPG) in northeast Australia. Koala populations are currently in severe decline and at risk from KoRV, which is closely related to HPG. HPG is also related to the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). These findings suggest that the origins of KoRV and GALV are spill-over from bats, which alerts to possible new spill-over events in other species. - Mod.PMB
