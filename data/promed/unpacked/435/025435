Tayshet rayon in Irkutsk hit by bovine tuberculosis outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) has been registered in Tayshet rayon. In
the village Tayojnoye, 254 cattle, more than half of the herd, were
infected with TB. 11 animals from private households have also developed TB.
The infection is spreading quickly. According to rayon staff, the only way
to stop the spread is to cull the ill herds. [I am guessing that "spread"
here is probably within the herd and may in fact just be recognition of
clinical cases. Certainly, TB doesn't spread between herds the way other
fast moving infections do. - Mod.PC]
At present, 36 animals have been destroyed. According to veterinarians, the
possible cause of the outbreak is an absence of necessary control over the
animals' health [including vaccination and other preventive measures? -
Mod.PC]. According to veterinarians, the infection can pass from animals to
people. All staff were checked for TB through X-ray. So far, no symptoms
have been discovered among the staff. Officials are taking necessary steps
to prevent the spread of infection.
