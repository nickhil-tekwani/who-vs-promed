A mystery virus has killed around 50 swans in The Lough [Irish for
lake] area of Cork city over the past few days.

Cork City Council has yet to say how long it has been aware of the
problem, but it has been removing the dead swans for the past few days.

The virus is understood to have been introduced by migratory ducks
that have settled in the area.

Officials say the illness only affects [wild]fowl species and poses no
threat to humans.

[It is not clear why this event is a ascribed to "a mystery virus".
While "mystery," as long known, is a welcome, appetizing
ingredient/term in any media item, the term "virus" is in need of
clarification.

In case this does turn out to be a virus, its laboratory-derived
identification is requested with urgency, with special attention to
the exclusion of HPAI. It would also help to obtain the identity of
the swan subgenus involved.
