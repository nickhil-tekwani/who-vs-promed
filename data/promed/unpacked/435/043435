Liver fluke _Fasciola hepatica_ in Ireland
--------------------------------------------
The latest issue of the Lancet today gives details of two cases involving
US tourists to Connemara, who got the disease after they ate wild watercress.
These are the first confirmed cases of the extremely rare condition in
Ireland since the 1960s. The liver fluke is a tiny flattened worm which
usually infects sheep in wet areas but can cause severe illness, known as
fascioliasis, in humans by infesting [sic] bile ducts within the liver.
The two tourists became infected by _Fasciola hepatica_ by eating the
watercress in a sandwich after finding it growing beside a river. it is
frequently used in salads.
According to liver fluke expert Prof John Dalton of Dublin City University,
who assisted Dr LaPook, interest in the US will be further heightened by
another research paper citing another case in Florida, to be published by
the New England Journal of Medicine.
Adult flukes normally infest [infect] sheep and produce eggs that are
passed in their faeces. This is a problem for livestock in counties with
high rainfall. The eggs are eaten by snails from which immature forms of
the fluke emerge. These become enclosed in a sac on aquatic vegetation,
particularly wild watercress. Watercress is grown in glasshouses for sale
in food outlets.
The human version has two stages. In the first, young flukes migrate
through the liver causing tenderness, organ enlargement, fever, night
sweats and sometimes a rash. This may lead to the second; inflammation of
the bile duct or its obstruction with associated jaundice.
Prof Dalton and other researchers have been focusing most on South America,
where humans and livestock are known to share
water sources. Through the molecular parasitology laboratory in DCU, a
rapid diagnostic test for liver fluke has been developed.
They are also developing a vaccine for animals.

[Most physicians think of parasitic infections as associated with the
tropics or at least with less developed countries. Looking into the big
textbooks it is clearly stated that _Fasciola hepatica_ occurs worldwide
where the temperature is above 10C. The main host of _Fasciola hepatica_ in
Ireland is sheep, and it would be interesting to have a comment from
veterinarians in Ireland on whether this is a well recognised problem.
The case stories therefore remind us that even in temperate, industrialised
countries, infection with _Fasciola hepatica_ is a possibility and should
be considered in cases with unexplained hepatic enlargement, especially if
associated with eosinophilia and raised total IgE. -Mod.EP]
