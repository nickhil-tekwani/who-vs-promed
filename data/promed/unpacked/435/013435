3 species of bats that are eaten by people in
central Africa may be carriers of the [filovirus]
Ebola virus that has killed hundreds of humans
and great apes, scientists said on Wed 30 Nov 2005.
Although the bats do not show any evidence of
infection, the International Centre for Medical
Research in Franceville, Gabon discovered genetic
evidence or an immune response in the animals,
captured during outbreaks between 2001 and 2003.
"We find evidence of asymptomatic infection by
Ebola virus in 3 species of fruit bat, indicating
that these animals may be acting as a reservoir
for this deadly virus," Eric Leroy and his
colleagues said in a report in the science journal Nature.
Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which was first
identified in 1976, is one of the most virulent
viral diseases, according to the World Health
Organisation. It damages blood vessels and can
cause extensive bleeding, diarrhoea and shock.
The virus killed more than 240 people in the
Democratic Republic of Congo [formerly Zaire] in
1995. Several outbreaks, which resulted in 254
deaths, occurred between 2001 and 2005 in Gabon
and the Republic of Congo. The virus is
transmitted by infected body fluids and kills up
to 90 percent of victims, depending on the
strain. There is no cure for Ebola haemorrhagic fever.
Leroy and his team captured and tested more than
1000 animals [i.e. small vertebrates including
frugivorous bats - Mod.CP] in Ebola
virus-infected areas of Africa to find possible
reservoirs of infection. Each of the bat species
that showed evidence of the virus had a
geographical range that included regions where
human outbreaks of Ebola had occurred.
The researchers said the findings could help to
reduce infections in both great apes and people.
"Human infection directly from fruit bats might
in part be countered by education, as these
animals are eaten by local populations living in
the outbreak regions," Leroy added.

[The paper referred to in this agency report is a
Brief Communication published in the 1 Dec 2005
issue of Nature (Nature 438, 575-576
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7068/abs/438575a.html>).
It is entitled: "Fruit bats as reservoirs of
Ebola virus" and the authors are Eric M. Leroy
and 9 others. The first paragraph of the paper
reads: "The first recorded human outbreak of
Ebola virus was in 1976, but the wild reservoir
of this virus is still unknown. Here we test for
Ebola virus in more than a thousand small
vertebrates that were collected during Ebola
outbreaks in humans and great apes between 2001
and 2003 in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo.
We find evidence of asymptomatic infection by
Ebola virus in three species of fruit bat,
indicating that these animals may be acting as a
reservoir for this deadly virus."
Previously, Lerory and colleagues (Science. 2004
Jan 16;303(5656):298-9) concluded from an
analysis of Ebola viruses from outbreaks in
humans over the past 4 years in Gabon and the
Republic of Congo, that these outbreaks were
distinct epidemics caused by different Ebola
virus strains, and that the epidemics resulted
from the handling of different gorilla,
chimpanzee, or duiker carcasses. These animal
populations declined markedly during human Ebola
outbreaks, apparently as a result of Ebola
virus infection. Animal carcasses were infected
by a variety of Ebola strains, suggesting that
Ebola outbreaks in great apes result from
multiple virus introductions from the natural
host. It cannot be assumed, however, that fruit
bats are the original source of the Ebola viruses
responsible for outbreaks in primates; they may
merely be infected from another common source.
Ebola virus may be transmitted from an animal
carcass during the harvesting of meat, but
cooking of harvested meat would destroy infectivity. - Mod.CP]
