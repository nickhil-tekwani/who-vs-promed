The debate on global warming frequently includes predictions that diseases
like malaria, dengue and yellow fever will emerge from the tropics to
plague those of us who live in climates that are (presently) temperate.
Last year, I found that 8 of 9 web pages dealing with this subject put the
danger of malaria "migrating" to the United States and Europe as the #1
danger caused by global warming. The 9th put it in the #2 spot!
The much quoted IPCC report, and several other "authoritative" surveys also
had warnings of this kind.
To try to put the subject in perspective, I have written an article on
malaria in England:

I would be most interested to receive comments on this article, and the
issue as a whole, from my vector colleagues. [See Dr. Reiter's e-mail
