Around 185 000 hens have been slaughtered after an outbreak of a rare form of salmonella. The strain of the disease poses no threat to human health.

A total of 125 000 birds were culled at Ready Egg Products at Manor Waterhouse in Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh. The company is one of the largest egg producers in Ireland [see archived ProMED post 20121102.1388087].

A further 60 000 hens were slaughtered on Wednesday [7 Nov 2012] following a 2nd suspected outbreak of the rare form of salmonella known as _Salmonella gallinarum_ at another farm in the Lisnaskea area.

The Ulster Farmers Union (UFU) has called on farmers to be vigilant following the outbreak. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) said the control of the disease is a matter for those operating farms. DARD added that this strain of salmonella did not pose a risk to humans.

As the disease is not dangerous to the public, it is classified as "non-notifiable," a spokesman for the department said.

Charles Crawford, director of Ready Egg Products, said the birds started dying about 4 weeks ago, and the company culled about 1/3rd of the flock to stop the disease from spreading. "We have had a problem, and we have dealt with it," Mr. Crawford said. "There is no danger to human beings."

A DARD spokesman said the disease detected can kill up to 100 percent of an infected flock. "This type of salmonella is non-notifiable, and the control of the disease is a matter for any companies involved," he said. "The department is keeping in touch with the industry in relation to the situation. This outbreak is unusual in 2 ways: Firstly, isolation of _Salmonella gallinarum_ is rare in Ireland, and; secondly, in this form, it is more commonly a disease of backyard flocks rather than commercial ones. The control of this strain of salmonella, which has no implications for human health, is (a concern) for the industry. It is the choice of the individual owner to cull. The industry may from time to time cull birds for a variety of reasons, and DARD would not necessarily be aware of this."

A spokeswoman for the UFU revealed it had received a number of calls from concerned farmers in the area following the outbreak. UFU president Harry Sinclair said: "Everything possible is being done to contain the spread of this production disease which has no implications to human health. Both the farmers and the industry are working to establish the circumstances of the outbreak. At this time, I would re-emphasise the need for farmers to be vigilant and keep a close eye on their flocks."

_Salmonella gallinarum_ disease is caused by one of the 2 poultry-adapted [species-specific] strains of salmonella bacteria, _Salmonella gallinarum_. It can cause mortality in birds of any age. Infections are rare in most commercial systems now. Signs of disease include dejection, ruffled feathers, lack of appetite, thirst, yellow diarrhoea, and reluctance to move. The bacterium is fairly resistant to normal climate, surviving months, but is susceptible to normal disinfectants.

[The above media report, applying comprehensible terms to convey an animal health issue to the wide public with clarity and accuracy, is exemplary.

_S. pullorum_ and _S. gallinarum_, species-specific pathogens, have been effectively controlled in most industrialized countries but may sporadically occur, particularly in backyard holdings which escape surveillance. According to EU legislation, one of the prescribed conditions for intra-community trade in poultry and hatching eggs is the following:

"All birds in the consignment shall have been found negative in serological tests for _Salmonella pullorum_ and _Salmonella gallinarum_ antibodies in the month preceding the consignment. In the case of hatching eggs or day-old chicks, the flock of origin shall be tested serologically for _Salmonella pullorum_ and _Salmonella gallinarum_ in the 3 months preceding the consignment at a level which gives 95 percent confidence of detecting infection at 5 percent prevalence."

The above and additional relevant information is included in EEC's "Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 Nov 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs," with annexes, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:343:0074:0113:EN:PDF.
