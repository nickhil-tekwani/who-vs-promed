Seven COVID-19 symptoms can maximize detection of COVID-19 in the community, according to a large study published in PLOS Medicine yesterday [Tue 28 Sep 2021] that looked at data from England's Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study.

A total of 8 rounds of data collection from June [2020] to January [2021] occurred across 1 147 345 English residents aged 5 and older who received a COVID-19 test. From rounds 2 -- 7, 0.4% of 979 079 were positive, and in round 8, which was dominated by the alpha (B117) variant, 1.4% of 167 646 were positive.

By modeling COVID-19 positivity predictability on 7 symptoms --loss or change of smell, loss or change of taste, fever, new persistent cough, chills, appetite loss, and muscle aches-- the researchers found a 0.75 area under the curve (AUC) for rounds 2 through 7 and a 0.77 AUC for round 8.

Looking further at round 8, the researchers said that testing people in the community with at least 1 of the 7 selected symptoms gave sensitivity, specificity, and positive-predictive values of 74%, 64%, and 9.7%, respectively. New persistent cough and sore throat was more associated with the alpha variant, while loss or change of sense of smell was more predictive of the wild-type.

Using the 7 symptoms to determine COVID-19 community testing eligibility would result in 30% to 40% of symptomatic individuals in England being eligible compared with the current 10%, which allows for only 4 of the 7, the researchers write. They add that if everyone eligible under these hypothetical conditions were to get tested, the country would detect 70% -- 75% of positive cases.

"These findings suggest many people with COVID-19 won't be getting tested --and therefore won't be self-isolating-- because their symptoms don't match those used in current public health guidance to help identify infected people," said study author Paul Elliott, MBBS, PhD, in a PLOS press release.

"We believe that our approach, relying on these 7 symptoms, provides a reasonable balance between number of tests performed and detection rates in England, but alternative approaches could be envisaged depending on national population size, composition, and resources," write the researchers.

[The goal of this large study was "to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms that jointly predict COVID-19 and investigate whether predictive symptoms differ between the B.1.1.7 (alpha) lineage (predominating as of April 2021 in the US, UK, and elsewhere) and wild type."

"The rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community is key to ensuring efficient control of transmission via isolation. Quantitative evidence measuring which symptoms are the most informative of a COVID-19 infection remains scarce.

What do these findings mean?
- These 7 symptoms can improve the detection of COVID-19 infection in the community.
- Using this sparse set of symptoms for test allocation would increase the number of tests performed (up to 30%-40% of symptomatic individuals being tested) but would enable up to 75% of symptomatic cases to be detected.
- This set of 7 symptoms is also predictive of B.1.1.7 infection and performs similarly across age groups. Its use would maximize the case detection rate in the community and would be particularly relevant in situations where test capacity is limited." (excerpted from article cited) - Mod.LK]

Type 1 diabetes in those over 40 years of age is linked with higher COVID-related hospitalization risk, while type 2 diabetes is associated with higher mortality in COVID-hospitalized patients, according to a study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism and data presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) annual meeting, respectively.

The 1st study looked at 767 US patients with COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes from April [2020] to March [2021]. Compared with those younger than 40, those older had a 6.5-fold higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization after adjusting for sex, insurance type, and A1c (a way to measure blood sugar; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0 -- 12.2). Furthermore, the researchers found that, even after comorbidities were adjusted for, those who were 40 and older still had a 4.2-fold higher risk (95% CI, 2.3 to 7.8).

More than half of the cohort (54%) was 18 years or younger, while 32% were ages 19 to 40, and 14% were older than 40. No deaths occurred in the youngest age-group, while 2 occurred in the middle age-group and 3 in the oldest. Other associations included an increased likelihood of hospitalization if the patient had higher A1c values (odds ratio [OR], 1.5), if the patient were a minority (OR, 3.5), or if the patient had comorbidities (OR, 3.1).

The 2nd study [Abstract to EASD Annual Meeting abstract] involved 1004 UK COVID-19 patients with diabetes and found that, within 7 days of hospitalization, mortality risk was 3.4 times higher for those older than 70 who had high C-reactive protein levels and 2.7 times higher for those younger than 70 with chronic kidney disease, a common long-term diabetes complication. Risk was also 2.5 times higher for those with type 2 diabetes compared with other types, and it was halved for those who had insulin infusion.

Body mass index, the researchers noted, was not associated with 7-day mortality.

The study period lasted from 1 Jan to 30 Jun [2020], with 24% dying by day 7 post-hospitalization and 33% by day 30. The researchers say that the cohort's old age (median, 74.1 years) and lower social status (45% lived in the most deprived areas of the nation) may have influenced the high death rate.

["Background and aims: Diabetes is associated with greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. However, it is unclear if characteristics specific to this cohort affect the prognosis of COVID-19. ACCREDIT study explored clinical and biochemical characteristics associated with 7- and 30-day mortality and intensive care amongst diabetes patients hospitalised with COVID-19. ...

"Conclusion: CRP [C-reactive protein] and age were predictive of in-hospital death by day 7. Using these 2 variables in the validated model enables early prognostication of this cohort during their hospitalisation. Higher 7-day mortality rate was observed compared to other studies, possibly due to greater socioeconomic deprivation and older age. Young patients with CKD had a greater risk of early death. A high proportion of these patients required diabetes treatment escalations warranting increased input from the inpatient diabetes teams." (Llanera D, Wilmington R, Shoo H, et al. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in a regional population with diabetes: the ACCREDIT study. EASD Abstract 307. Wed 29 Sep)

"The combination of older age and high levels of the inflammatory marker CRP were linked to a tripled risk for death by day 7 after hospitalization for COVID-19 among people with diabetes. But, in contrast to other studies, recent A1c and body mass index (BMI) did not predict COVID-19 outcomes."

"Both of these variables are easily available upon admission to hospital," said Llanera, who now works at Imperial College, London, UK, in an EASD press release.

"This means we can easily identify patients early on their hospital stay who will likely require more aggressive interventions to try and improve survival."

"It makes sense that CRP and age are important," commented Simon Heller, MB BChir, DM, of the University of Sheffield, UK. "It may be that diabetes alone overwhelmed the additional effects of obesity and A1c. Certainly in other studies, age was the overwhelming bad prognostic sign among people with diabetes, and perhaps long-term diabetes has effects on the immune system which we haven't yet identified."

[2] Infection of insulin producing cells in pancreas
Date: Tue 28 Sep 2021

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/29/covid-can-infect-cells-in-pancreas-that-make-insulin-research-shows


COVID-19 can infect insulin-producing cells in the pancreas and change their function, potentially explaining why some previously healthy people develop diabetes after catching the virus. Doctors are increasingly concerned about the growing number of patients who have developed diabetes either while infected with coronavirus, or shortly after recovering from it.

Various theories have been put forward to explain this increase. One is that the virus infects pancreatic cells via the same ACE2 receptor found on the surface of lung cells, and interferes with their ability to produce insulin - a hormone that helps the body to regulate levels of glucose in the blood; alternatively, an over exuberant antibody response to the virus could accidentally damage pancreatic cells, or inflammation elsewhere in the body may be making tissues less responsive to insulin.

To investigate, Prof Shuibing Chen at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York screened various cells and organoids - lab-grown clusters of cells that mimic the function of organs - to identify which could be infected by COVID. The results suggested that lung, colon, heart, liver, and pancreatic organoids could all be infected, as could dopamine-producing brain cells.

Further experiments revealed that insulin-producing beta cells within the pancreas were also susceptible, and that once infected, these cells produced less insulin, as well as hormones usually manufactured by different pancreatic cells.

"We call it transdifferentiation," said Chen, who presented the results at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes on Wed. "They are basically changing their cellular fate, so instead of being hardcore beta cells which secrete a lot of insulin, they start to mix different hormones. It could provide further insight into the pathological mechanisms of COVID-19."

Scientists have observed a similar phenomenon in some individuals with type 2 diabetes, although the disease is more strongly associated with the body's tissues becoming less responsive to insulin.

It is not yet clear whether the changes triggered by COVID infection are long lasting. "However, we know that some patients who had very unstable blood glucose levels when they were in the intensive care unit and recovered from COVID-19, also recovered [glucose control], suggesting that not all patients will be permanent," Chen said.

Separate research by Prof Francesco Dotta at the University of Siena in Italy and colleagues confirmed that COVID attacks pancreatic cells by targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein on their surface, and that insulin-producing beta cells express particularly high levels of this protein.

They also demonstrated that ACE2 levels were increased under inflammatory conditions, which is important because people with existing type 2 diabetes may already have some inflammation within their pancreas. "This means that these insulin-producing beta cells could be even more susceptible to viral infection when inflamed," Dotta said.

This could imply that people with existing diabetes or prediabetes are at greater risk of pancreatic dysfunction if they catch COVID-19 - something he now plans to investigate. "Diabetic patients in general are not more susceptible to COVID-19 infection in terms of frequency, but once they are infected, they develop more severe complications and severe metabolic derangement," said Dotta. Prof Francesco Rubino, chair of metabolic surgery at King's College London, said: "These studies seem to be consistent in supporting a biological rationale for the idea that COVID-19 could increase the risk of developing diabetes in people who are either predisposed to it, or even potentially completely from scratch."

He is co-leading an international effort to establish a global database of COVID-19-linked diabetes cases, to better understand whether the infection can cause a new form of diabetes, or trigger a stress response that leads to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. "Whether such changes are enough to permit this virus to cause diabetes is a question that these studies do not answer, but it gives us another reason to believe this is a possibility," he said.

However, this may not be the only way in which the virus increases diabetes risk. "At least clinically, one of the things we're seeing is that in some cases, patients who already had type 1 diabetes have started to express severe insulin resistance, which is a typical feature of type 2 diabetes," Rubino said. This may imply a problem with how cells elsewhere in the body are responding to insulin after COVID-19 infection.

Dr. Lucy Chambers, head of research communications at Diabetes UK, said: "People with diabetes have been disproportionality affected by COVID-19, and many people with the condition have tragically died as a result. Diabetes is a well-established risk factor for serious illness from COVID-19, and there is emerging evidence that COVID-19 may be triggering new cases of diabetes, but how these 2 conditions are biologically linked is not yet well understood.

"This research deepens our understanding of how diabetes and COVID 19 may interact biologically. This will help in the development of new, effective ways to treat people at risk of - or living with - diabetes who have COVID-19. Taking the COVID-19 vaccination, including a booster when offered, remains the best form of protection from the virus."

[These studies are getting closer to understanding why COVID infection may increase the risk of developing diabetes in patients who do not have it, and why people with diabetes are at risk of more severe infection. This is one more pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 other than respiratory symptoms. - Mod.LK]
