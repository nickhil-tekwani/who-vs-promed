"Citrus fruit production [in Sicily] this year [2016] is quite low, especially for oranges. Producers not only had to deal with the _Citrus tristeza virus_, but also with a whole lot of other factors," reports Corrado Vigo, agronomist.

In addition to weather conditions, there is a series of pathogens that spread. "For example, _Phytophthora citrophthora_ led to a loss of fruit. In addition, there was a late attack of _Ceratitis capitata_ [Mediterranean fruit fly]." There are a lot of drops of yet unripe oranges as well as a lot of mouldy fruit on the trees.

"There are very few innovative varieties. Producers are looking to replace the trees (especially because of the _Citrus tristeza virus_), but costs are high. Orchard response times are slow. Another problem is the availability of plants."

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses and has destroyed millions of trees worldwide. Besides citrus species (family of _Rutacea_), it affects hosts in only few other families, and it appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in severity, and symptoms also depend on the citrus variety and the scion-rootstock combination. The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of _Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. CTV has been included on the alert lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline, stem pitting, and a mild type, and may occur singly or in combination. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas. Disease management for CTV includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum and vector control.

In Italy, the 1st report of a significant CTV outbreak in a citrus-growing area was reported from Sicily in 2003 (ProMED-mail post 20030312.0609), which was followed by several outbreaks (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20130329.1610397, 20150807.3563988). Control measures have been unsuccessful so far, leading to a high CTV incidence in Sicilian citrus.

The fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora citrophthora_ causes root and collar rot in citrus and may also be associated with other crop diseases in certain areas, such as leaf blight of taro and black pod of cocoa (see ProMED-mail posts 20101216.4451 and 20090521.1896, respectively). Citrus root rots may also be caused by several fungal species (see pathogen list below). These pathogens are spread with infected soil, plant material and contaminated equipment. Disease management is difficult and generally requires an integrated approach.
