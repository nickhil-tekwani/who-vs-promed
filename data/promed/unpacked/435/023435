Leprosy funding [is] being cut despite 1841 cases [in 2015]. Cuts in funding for leprosy care could result in more cases, according to health workers. Funding for support surveys that identify leprosy patients, record growth of the disease and administer medicines, is not available any more, they say. Sister Christina, who works in Sumanahalli Leprosy Colony, said, "Due to lack of surveys, we are now getting more multibacillary (MB) cases, which have more than 5 patches on the skin. The government wants to project that its National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) has been highly successful. So it discourages us from doing any survey."

The government claims that Karnataka achieved the goal of leprosy elimination in the year 2005. Dr Hemavathi, deputy director (leprosy), Department of Health and Family Welfare, said that since the number of new cases is low, there is no need for surveys based on World Health Organization guidelines. However, there are 1841 new cases in Karnataka for the year 2015-2016. In Bengaluru Urban, 33 leprosy cases were reported in October 2015.

Dr Hemavathi agreed that medics meant specifically for leprosy detection are now being replaced by general staff. She said, "Earlier there were paramedic workers, a separate staff for the detection of leprosy, called 'vertical programme', but now, we have made the programme horizontal from vertical, where general staff in hospitals attend to leprosy." There is a shortage of 2144 paramedics in the health and family welfare department. These paramedics are meant to help in door-to-door identification and medication of leprosy patients. Peter D'Souza, director of Sumanahalli Leprosy Rehabilitation Centre, said, "Since the World Health Organization (WHO) is using the word elimination, people are confusing it with eradication. Various government policies and approaches are based on this assumption, which makes treatment and eradication difficult."

The government also wants to replace leprosy hospitals with general hospitals. The Central Leprosy Hospital on Magadi Road which treated solely leprosy patients has recently started restricting admissions to leprosy patients. Dr B.C. Rathna, joint director (leprosy), said, "We want leprosy to be treated in general hospitals from now. We don't want any discrimination between leprosy and other diseases." Dr Hemavathi did not respond when asked whether hospital workers are trained to deal with leprosy cases. No programme has been devised to deal with situations arising from complaints by patients with other diseases in the same hospital and their family members.

D'Souza added, "The government has recorded that 2712 patients are at hand and 561 854 cases have been cured with multi-drug therapy (MDT). But leprosy does not end after giving MDT; it only makes the disease non-contagious. Bodily deformities take place and ulcers break out. Most patients lose eyesight, become limbless and there are various diseases that run throughout their lives." The MDT drug has a six-month course, which has to be administered in the homes of the patients. A total of 9122 MDTs has been supplied to the Leprosy Department in Bangalore in the month of September 2015 from the Government Medical Store depot in Chennai. Christina added, "For the care of the patients, the government provides us INR 500 [USD 7.54] per patient per month. This is too meagre an amount since we have to look after their food, sanitation and, for children, education."

There are 7 leprosy colonies in the city. The leprosy department gets INR 424 580 [USD 6402.34] per annum with which they buy MCR chappals [slippers for affected feet] and self-care kits for ulcers under their DCMR (Disability Control and Medical Rehabilitation) Action Plan. One patient living in a leprosy hospital for the past 13 years, said, "I am not allowed inside my own home since people have an issue living with me in proximity. I have clawed feet and lost a limb. I am closing in to blindness. I keep getting ulcers for which I always need treatment. The MDT got over a long time back but once you get leprosy you suffer all your life."

A leprosy patient at the Sumanahalli Leprosy Colony for 10 years had become destitute after being abandoned by his family. He spends all day with his friend who he says became blind after the disease and forgot his name. D'Souza said, "There is a lingering social stigma associated with leprosy. People avoid coming in contact with them. Awareness is very low in India. I don't know what hurdles this step will bring as far as leprosy eradication is concerned."
