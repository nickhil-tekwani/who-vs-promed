The USA is planning a mission to Mars, to bring back to Earth a rock
weighing a half kilo by 2005. The biological defense plan drawn up by
experts, including researchers from CDC, is to build a maximum security
lab, similar to that used to study Ebola virus, in which to examine the
specimen.

[This harks back to the quarantine imposed on the first astronauts to
return from the Moon, which turned out to be unnecessary. Predictions are,
however, that conditions on Mars may be more hospitable to microbes than
those on the Moon. - Mod.JW]
