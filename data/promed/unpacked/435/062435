I evaluated and treated a symptomatic patient who acquired _Cyclospora_ infection after eating basil at a reception in upstate NY in late June 2019. Several other individuals who attended the same reception were reportedly also diagnosed with _Cyclospora_ infection. The patient appears to be one of the cases of the recent outbreak attributed to basil imported from Mexico.

Several weeks after successful treatment, the patient developed right upper quadrant discomfort with elevated transaminase levels (ALT approx. 600). Hepatitis E IgM was positive. Evaluation for other causes of acute hepatitis, including serologies for other viruses, was negative. An abdominal sonogram was unremarkable. The patient has not traveled out of NY state with the exception of a weekend trip to the Pocono Mountains in PA in early July 2019.

The timing of the patient's acute hepatitis E virus infection is consistent with exposure at approximately the same time she was exposed to _Cyclospora_. I am suspicious that the patient may have been infected with both cyclosporiasis and hepatitis E virus by eating contaminated basil from Mexico. I am curious whether other cases of acute hepatitis E virus infection have been identified in patients with _Cyclospora _ infection attributed to this recent outbreak.

[ProMED sincerely thanks Dr. Acosta for this report.

Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL]

[Dr. Acosta's letter is in response to the ProMED post from 17 Aug 2019, Cyclosporiasis - USA (05): imported basil, Mexico 20190817.6627273. ProMED would appreciate any information regarding possible other cases of hepatitis E that occurred in conjunction with the cyclosporiasis outbreak that affected more than 500 people in the United States in May-June 2019.

Although the literature regarding the survival of hepatitis E virus in the environment and foods is limited, the fact that hepatitis E is transmitted by the fecal-oral route suggests that it can be relatively stable under environmental conditions, including survival on produce.
