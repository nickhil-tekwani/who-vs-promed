To my knowledge, 5 _Mycobacterium abscessus_ abdominal wall infections have
occurred during 2003 following liposuction surgery performed in Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) have requested that any patients with MOTT [mycobacteria other than
tuberculosis] infections after cosmetic surgery in Santo Domingo be
reported to them.
After speaking with the patients themselves (4 cases) or their physician (1
case), it is clear to me that at least 4 of the 5 operations were performed
in the same clinic in Santo Domingo. I have forwarded the information to
the department of health in NYC and to CDC. I would advise any physician
who has a patient considering cosmetic surgery in Santo Domingo to contact
CDC or the New York City Department of Health.
The CDC contact is:

[It is likely that more cases related to these cases will surface. The
postings below are related to past occurrences. There is no clear link
between these cases and the posting above, even though the New York report
involved Latin American patients. The New York report below contains an
excellent discussion of _M. abscessus_. - Mod.LL]
