The menace posed by stray dogs has hit an alarming high in Coimbatore. 4 persons have died of rabies after being mauled by rabid dogs this year [2014], and at least 9000 people who suffered dog bites were treated at the government Coimbatore Medical College Hospital in just in the 1st 9 months this year in Coimbatore. The resident medical officer of CMCH, Dr S Dharmalingam, told DC that nearly 30-40 cases of dog bites are treated daily. "The hospital treats anywhere between 1000 and 1200 cases every month.

4 patients including one woman have succumbed to the rabies virus in the last 9 months." In 2013, 5 men died of rabies at the government hospital, the hospital official added.

Though bat bites can also cause rabies, the patients who have died in the government [hospital] were bitten by rabies-infected dogs. If patients do not take prompt treatment the moment they are bitten, fatality is certain. "The victim should wash his wound and immediately rush to the hospital and get the vaccine administered within 48 hours. CMCH has enough stock of vaccine, and [it is] administered free of cost," the RMO said.

[In a prior report (20140921.2792358), we reported some 1076 dog bites needing clinical attention this year (2014) to date and 5 rabies deaths in Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu in the 1st 9 months of 2014, they have seen some 9000 such bite cases in the one hospital, the government Coimbatore Medical College, in Coimbatore, and 4 rabies deaths.

For a map of India, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg. Tamill Nadu occupies the southern point of India and faces Sri Lanka; Coimbatore is on its NW border with Kerala State. If the conditions in Coimbatore are typical of the whole state, the statewide dog bite incidence must be horrific, quite apart from the additional cost of rabies deaths in spite of any treatment given. The numbers on their own argue for a statewide canine rabies control programme and soon, both in Tamil Nadu and in other Indian states. - Mod.MHJ
