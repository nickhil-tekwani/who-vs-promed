Paraguay declares state of emergency after 1st yellow fever death
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Paraguayan health authorities on Tuesday [5 Feb 2008] declared a
state of emergency after an Asuncion hospital confirmed the nation's
1st death for more than a century from yellow fever, a liver and
kidney disease spread by mosquitoes.

The dead man was a 24-year-old from the central Paraguayan department
of San Pedro, who died in Asuncion's Clinicas Hospital from renal and
liver failure. Adolfo Galeano, an epidemiologist and the hospital's
director, said the young man had fallen ill after hunting for monkeys
with a group of friends. Galeano told a Tuesday [5 Feb 2008] press
conference that the hospital had studied a biopsy and performed an
autopsy to confirm the result.

He said that the [hospital] was also caring for a 22-year-old [man]
in its intensive care unit suffering from critical liver failure and
complications, after surgeons removed one of his kidneys. He had been
admitted by his relatives. He comes from the village of Calle 8000,
which is 7km [4.34 miles] from San Estanislao, the capital of San
Pedro department.

During the same press conference, the nation's Health Minister, Oscar
Martinez, said that there were 5 confirmed yellow fever cases in the
nation. The last yellow fever death in Paraguay was in 1904 and the
last confirmed cases of infection were in 1974.

Paraguay reports 1st case of yellow fever in 34 years
----------------------------------------------------
The case was detected in San Pedro province, some 240 miles from the
border with Brazil, public health official Gualberto Pinanez said.
San Pedro residents between the ages of one and 60 are being
vaccinated against the mosquito-borne disease as a precaution, he said.

Authorities reported no known link to an outbreak in Brazil, where 8
yellow fever deaths were confirmed last month [January 2008] in rural
areas far from cities where most Brazilians live. [Now 13 deaths. - Mod.JW]

The World Health Organization says an estimated 30 000 people
worldwide die annually from the viral disease, which caused
devastating epidemics before officials learned to fight it by
controlling mosquitoes and with vaccinations. Symptoms can include
fevers, vomiting, jaundice and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes and stomach.
