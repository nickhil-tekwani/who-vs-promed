UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, BOVINE - AUSTRALIA (NEW SOUTH WALES) (02)

The following is submitted on behalf of the CVO for NSW in response
to the request for information in ProMED post Undiagnosed deaths,
bovine - Australia (NSW): RFI 20070324.1028.
200 cattle mortalities have occurred over a wide area of the NSW
Western Division. In the last 4 months, stock deaths have been
investigated at Balranald, Wentworth, Hillston, Cobar and Broken Hill
Rural Lands Protection Boards. A range of endemic diseases such as
pestivirus and IBR infections have been found.
Exotic diseases as well as anthrax and Sporadic Bovine Encephalitis
have been eliminated as possibilities. Mortalities in stock during a
drought or following post-drought rain events of this kind frequently
increase due to the ingestion of poisonous weed species or
nutritional imbalances.
Access to a recently introduced Brassica weed species, Ward's weed
_Carrichtera annua_ has been noted in some of the investigated cases.
While Ward's weed has not previously been identified as a poisonous
plant, the clinical effects sometimes associated with Brassica family
weeds, i.e. gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract irritation,
hemolysis and dehydration, have been observed in some cases.
Investigations will continue to determine the involvement of Ward's
weed in the deaths of some cattle in the Western Division.
The region has been in drought for the last 5 years. The availability
of normal pasture species has been severely limited, with less
palatable species and weeds present in significant numbers. The
Western Division of NSW is a rangeland environment with less than
15in. (40 cm) rainfall per year on average. There are approximately
50 000 cattle in the region.
The NSW Animal Health System undertakes investigations as part of
ongoing surveillance to detect exotic, new, emerging and important
endemic diseases, and these are reported as required under national
and international agreements. All animals slaughtered within NSW must
pass both ante- and post-mortem inspection before human consumption is allowed.

[ProMED-mail thanks Bruce Christie, the CVO in New South Wales (NSW),
for sending us updated information. Sporadic Bovine Encephalitis
affect is caused by _Chlamydophila pecorum_, an organism usually
present in cattle intestines; see
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/102500.htmHis>.
His comments underscore the importance of thorough investigation of
the usual disease agents as well as considering unusual etiologies
when environmental conditions change, as has occurred during the
current drought in NSW.
Under unfavorable environmental conditions, all species are likely to
suffer to some degree, although the mechanism may be considerably
different. I thought it instructive in this regard that in nearby
South Australia, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in children was
attributed to children bathing together to save water.

We hope to be apprised of any further finding relating to ingestion
of Ward's weed or any other cause of these mortalities as the
investigation progresses. - Mod.PC]
