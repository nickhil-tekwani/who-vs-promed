Nearly 400 people in south China were hospitalized with possible food
poisoning after a wedding banquet, state media said on Fri 2 Mar 2007.
No one was reported dead from the incident from Thu 1 Mar 2007 in Yunnan
province's Lincang city, where 371 people became ill shortly after eating
at the party and were rushed to 3 local hospitals, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
The guests were friends and family of a man who hosted the banquet to
celebrate his daughter's marriage, it said. There were still some 118
people in hospital on 2 Mar 2007, it said. Local authorities were
investigating the incident.
Large scale food poisoning incidents regularly affect China, many of which
are blamed on cooks who disregard hygiene rules or mistakenly use
industrial chemicals instead of salt and other ingredients.

[The etiology of this foodborne illness is not known nor is the specific
vehicle involved. Information about specific symptoms, whether fever
occurred or not, and how long the illness lasted would be helpful and, of
course, any microbiological data collected. A toxin, bacterium or virus
could be among the causes.
