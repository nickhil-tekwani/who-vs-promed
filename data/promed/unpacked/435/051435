[The "new" RHDV (provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb) emerged in France in 2010 in wild and farmed vaccinated rabbits, and rapidly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Malta and Tunisia), and also in Australia in 2015. According to Le Gall-Recule et al. (2013), RHDV2 did not derive from classical RHDV, but rather it originated as a 2nd emergence of unknown origin. Antigenic and disease protection data led to it being classified RHDV2 as a 2nd RHDV serotype.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity but a variable proportion of rabbits die according to the type of virus. The incubation period of RHDV/RHDVa is 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever (80-90 percent lethality). Around 5-10 percent of rabbits show a subacute-chronic clinical course. Although rabbits of all ages can be infected, the infection is subclinical in animals younger than 6-8 weeks of age. The disease caused by RHDV2 has typical features: the mortality rate is lower but highly variable (5-70 percent) with an average mortality of 20 percent in experimentally infected rabbits; death occurs in lactating rabbits from 15 days of age onwards and the course of the diseases is usually longer (3-5 days), with higher proportion of rabbits showing subacute-chronic disease. In addition, RHDV2 is able to cause an RHD-like disease in 2 hare species: Cape hare (_Lepus capensis_ var. _mediterraneus_) and Italian hare (_Lepus corsicanus_). http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf
