The [influenza pandemic] H1N1 virus is now suspected to have surfaced
in the southern central part of the country, with 2 schools closed for
a week in Tsirang and Dagana. With about 175 students suffering from
headache, high fever, and throat pain in Daga HSS [higher secondary
school], Dagana dzongkhag [district] declared a break for a week for
the 503 students since 22 Jul 2010. The vice principal of the school,
Loden, said that, as a preventive measure against spreading the
disease, the students from nearby areas are being sent home, while
those from Drujeygang and Lhamoizingkha are kept in the hostel,
separate from the affected students. "The sick students, about 50 boys
and 26 girls, are kept in classrooms and hostels," said the vice
principal. Loden said that the sick students are being given porridge
and Horlicks [a malted milk drink brand] to supplement their diet.

But it [has not been] confirmed whether it is H1N1 or not. "But it
definitely is an outbreak of something, since 175 students got sick,"
said the district health officer (DHO), Gunja Raj Gurung. He said that
about 11 students reported to the Dagana BHU [basic health unit]
complaining of fever, headache, and throat pain on 18 Jul 2010. Since
then the numbers kept rising.

But the dzongkhag [district authorities] could not communicate and
send the blood samples to Thimphu to confirm if it was an [influenza]
H1N1 outbreak because of road blocks [due to landslides], erratic
power supply, and network connection problems. "We had to request the
police Hilux [Toyota four-wheel drive vehicle] to get the doctor from
Dagapela to Dagana," he said. The Dagapela doctor and health officials
were conducting routine blood test yesterday [24 Jul 2010] in Dagana,
which is still cut off from the rest of the country.

According to the vice principal, [a] few students complained of flu
like symptoms after they returned from their mid term break on 15 Jul
2010. Dagana dzongda Tashi Gyaltsen said that, since there was no
equipment to test whether it is H1N1 or not, the affected students
were given paracetamol and some antibiotics.

Meanwhile, in Tsirang, the district education office, on the advice of
health officials, kept Damphu LSS [lower secondary school] on break
for a week since [23 Jul 2010], after 3 of the 11 students tested
positive for the influenza A on [22 Jul 2010].

About 26 students from Damphu HSS became sick since [22 Jul 2010],
suffering from common cold.

Yesterday [24 Jul 2010], about 200 students from Damphu HSS and Damphu
LSS visited the district hospital for a check up. "But most of them
aren't sick, but came to hospital because they were scared," said the
district medical officer (DMO), Chibalal Adhikari.

According to the DMO, about 5 blood samples were sent to the public
health laboratory in Thimphu. "We might receive the results and also
rapid testing kits today [25 Jul 2010]," he said.

Meanwhile, all the 26 sick students were given H1N1 vaccination and
even the teachers were vaccinated. "But vaccinating all the students
isn't possible, since there are limited numbers of vaccine," said a
source.

Tsirang district education officer, Sonam Gyeltshen, said that the
education officials, along with dzongda [chief executive of the
district] and the DMO, visited schools and briefed the students on
H1N1. "It happened that one of the students, who tested positive, went
to Samtse for her mid term break, where there was an H1N1 outbreak,"
he said. She was given Tamiflu [treatment].

[Bhutan (Land of the Thunder Dragon) lies in the eastern part of the
Himalayas. To the west and east, rugged mountain ranges stand between
it and the hill districts of India and to the south it borders with
the northern plains of West Bengal and Assam Provinces of India.

It has not been confirmed that the outbreaks of illness in these
schools are due to influenza pandemic (H1N1) virus infection, or
indeed any other specific respiratory virus. The outbreaks are
sufficiently serious, however, to alarm the local authorities. Further
information from the region would be welcomed.
