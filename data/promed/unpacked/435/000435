Beijing reports 1st child death of hand, foot and mouth disease
---------------------------------------------------------------
BEIJING: Beijing's health authority on Wednesday [14 May 2008] confirmed
the first child death of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in the
capital. Deng Xiaohong, spokeswoman of the Beijing Health Bureau, said the
child, a 13 month old boy from northern Changping District, had died on the
way to a hospital last Sunday [11 May 2008]. She said the child had tested
positive for enterovirus 71 (EV71), a virus that causes the majority of
HFMD deaths in China.

The spokeswoman also confirmed that another child from north China's Hebei
Province had died of HFMD in a Beijing hospital, but she did not reveal
when the child died. "Under the disease counting regulations of the
Ministry of Health, the child from Hebei was not counted in Beijing's
disease toll," said Deng Hebei Province, which neighbors Beijing, had not
previously reported any child death from HFMD.

Beijing counting of HFMD infection ran up to 3606 as of 12 May 2008, up
from 1492 cases reported on May 4. The health bureau did not update the
figure by Wednesday morning. Deng said that Beijing's Chaoyang District has
so far the city's largest number of infections, followed by southern
Fengtai and northern Changping districts. The bureau's figures showed that
as of Wednesday, a total of 70 children remained in Beijing's hospitals for
the epidemic treatment. Among them, 55 were locals and 15 were from elsewhere.

The spokeswoman said the child deaths should not be seen as a signal for
the worsening disease control situation in the national capital. "Both
deaths should be attributed to the delay in getting hospital treatment by
the children's families. We again urged parents to send their children to
standard hospitals immediately after they find children to have likely
symptoms related to the disease," said Deng.

Many of Beijing residents are reluctant to send their children to
hospitals, which have also enrolled HFMD patients from other parts of the
country, said a doctor in Ditan Hospital, the largest hospital specialized
in contagious diseases in China. "Some parents refused to heed doctors'
advice to leave their children in hospital. They complained that we have
also taken in patients from outside Beijing, for example from Fuyang City,
where the disease first broke out," said Cai Gaochang, a doctor with the
information department of the hospital. The national capital has the best
hospitals and doctors in the country. Patients from around the country opt
for Beijing for treating complicated diseases.

Beijing's health authority has reinforced the viral epidemic control effort
in kindergartens. The Caoqiao Kindergarten in Fengtai District was ordered
to suspend classes this week for a thorough disinfection, after 2 children
were found to be infected with the virus. A teacher said that more than 200
children in the kindergarten have gone through disease prevention checks to
exclude the possibility of HFMD infection. At least 2 Beijing kindergartens
were suspended last week after children showed symptoms of the disease.
