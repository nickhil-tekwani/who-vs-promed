There is a confirmed outbreak of leptospirosis in Mumbai that has
killed about 100 people in 2 days. Recent stormy rains have wrought
havoc in this major Indian business city. No information is available
on the serovars involved, but it looks like the pathogens involved
are highly aggressive [and are capable of bringing] extremely high
mortality.
Serovars Ratnapura, Valbuzzi and Grippotyphosa have been recently
documented to have severe epidemic potentials in the Andaman and
Nicobar islands (Vijayachari P, Ahmed N, Sugunan AP, et al: Use of
fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism for molecular
epidemiology of leptospirosis in India. J Clin Microbiol. 2004;
42:3575-80).
We suspect similar serovars must be circulating even in Mumbai
because it is a port city, and vessels bringing food supplies to the
Andaman islands and those ferrying people might help rodent
populations migrate to and from the island and the peninsula.
The disease kills scores of people every year in this country.
Despite the availability of good treatment options, diagnosis is a
major problem in India.

Govt says epidemic in Mumbai, retracts
--------------------------------------
The Maharashtra government on Thu 11 Aug 2005 issued an epidemic
alert in Mumbai and then retracted it within hours. The Directorate
General of Information and Public Relations, in a press statement
sent late on Thu night, 11 Aug 2005, denied that there was any
epidemic in Mumbai.
Earlier, the Maharashtra government had said it declared an outbreak
of epidemic in the municipal areas of Mumbai and the Kalyan-Dombivli
region in the neighbouring Thane district.
66 people have died of suspected leptospirosis in Mumbai and Thane
district following torrential rains and subsequent floods last month,
Maharashtra Health Minister Vimaltai Mundada said in Mumbai on Thu,
11 Aug 2005. 37 cases of suspected leptospirosis were reported from
Mumbai alone, while 29 were reported in the Kalyan-Dombivli municipal
limits, she told reporters.
In view of the increasing [numbers of] cases of high fever and
suspected leptospirosis, the government has declared an epidemic in
these areas, the minister had said. However, within hours of the
epidemic warning, a DGIPR statement said: "This is to clarify that
the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) or the (Maharashtra)
state government has not declared Mumbai or any other area of the
state as epidemic threatened under the appropriate Act."

The Maharashtra government today, 11 Aug 2005, declared the outbreak
of an epidemic of suspected leptospirosis in Mumbai and the
Kalyan-Dombivali municipal areas.
Public Health Minister Vimaltai Mundada told reporters that as the
city was flooded after the July 26 torrential rains, there has been a
high incidence of leptospirosis cases in the 2 municipal areas.
"There are 37 deaths in Mumbai and 29 in Thane district, all due to
fever suspected of leptospirosis," she said.
"It's almost 15 days since the flooding took place and the next 4 to
5 days will be crucial, as leptospirosis has an incubation period
ranging between 4 and 21 days," the Health Minister said.
The minister said of nearly 1062 patients admitted to various
hospitals in Mumbai, 112 were cases of leptospirosis, 39 of dengue,
48 of typhoid, 183 of hepatitis, and 1127 of gastroenteritis. In
Thane district (particularly in Kalyan-Dombivali civic limits), 2648
persons have been admitted with high fever, and 1889 for
gastroenteritis, she added.
The Director General of Health Subhash Salunkhe admitted that some of
deaths in Kalyan-Dombivali areas took place as doctors in private
hospitals administered anti-malarial drugs for patients who had fever
suspected to be leptospirosis. "We have held an emergency training
of over 100 doctors from the region and worked out a case management
protocol for leptospirosis so that patients are treated well in
time," he added.

[ProMED thanks Dr Ahmed for his first-hand information regarding this cluster.
Whether this is an epidemic or not can be based on the change of leptospirosis
cases as compared to background numbers. Certainly the combination of extreme
flooding and a substantial rodent population will increase the level of the
disease. - Mod.LL]
