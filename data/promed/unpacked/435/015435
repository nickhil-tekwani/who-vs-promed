Authorities in China have ordered an investigation into a vaccination scandal as panic grows over product safety. Last week [week of Sun 15 Jul 2018] vaccine maker Changsheng Biotechnology Co was found to have falsified production data for its rabies vaccine. The firm has been ordered to halt production and recall rabies vaccines. There has been no evidence of harm from the vaccine, but the scandal has sparked a huge outcry in China.

Changsheng, which suspended trading in its shares for part of [Mon 23 Jul 2018], saw their value drop by 10 percent on the day. The shares have slumped 47 percent since mid-July, when news of the scandal first broke. On [Sun 22 Jul 2018], Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged severe punishment for the people involved, saying the incident had "crossed a moral line". "We will resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of peoples' lives, resolutely punish lawbreakers according to the law, and resolutely and severely criticise dereliction of duty in supervision," he said in a statement posted on a government website. Changsheng has apologised, saying that it was "guilty and embarrassed" and would co-operate with drug regulators to carry out a comprehensive internal investigation.

On [Sun 15 Jul 2018], China's State Drug Administration (SDA) announced that Changchun Changsheng had falsified production data during the production of its freeze-dried human rabies vaccine. According to a report by Xinhua, an official said the company had "fabricated production records and product inspection records", as well as "arbitrarily changed process parameters and equipment" during production. The China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) said the rabies vaccine had been recalled and that the company would be put under investigation.

Days later, Jilin province authorities announced a 2017 batch of the firm's diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine - or DTaP - was also substandard. According to state media outlet CGTN, more than 250 000 doses of DTaP in the batch had already been sold to disease control and prevention centres in eastern China. The company has now been ordered to pay a fine of 3.4m yuan (USD 510 000; Pound 387 957).

According to the CFDA, there is no evidence that anyone has been harmed by the vaccine. Concern has now shifted to the safety of the DTaP vaccine. The vaccine is subsidised by the government and is given to infants across the country. It is not known how many children have received the vaccine, but there have not been any reports of children falling ill after receiving the inoculation. The Chinese government has not said what impact the substandard vaccine could have on a person's health.

People are furious. "Thousands of mothers around the country are worried. Over 200 000 children could be affected. What kind of society am I living in?" asked one person on Weibo. "My son will be vaccinated next month [August 2018]. I don't know whether or not to let him," said another. Chinese censors have also identified the issue as highly sensitive. A widely circulated article pointing out murky practices in the vaccine industry in China was deleted. This is not the 1st time substandard vaccines have been produced in China. In 2016, an illegal vaccine ring which involved hundreds of people was uncovered. Some USD88m worth of vaccines were found to be inadequately refrigerated and were not transported in approved conditions.

The apparent human rabies vaccine manufacturing warning in China may now include recalls of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccines and various heart medications.

According to Reuters, on [Thu 19 Jul 2018], Changsheng Biotechnology told the stock exchange authorities it was being fined related to production concerns uncovered in 2017 of a DPT vaccine. Reuters reported that the defective DPT vaccine might not confer immunity, but would not affect human safety, provincial authorities had said in November 2017. Reuters' telephone calls on [Sun 22 Jul 2018] to Changsheng's headquarters went unanswered.

Additionally, Reuters reported Chinese authorities are implicating another company, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Co. Ltd, in substandard DPT vaccine production.

Separately, according to South China Morning Post, Zhejiang Huaihai
Pharmaceutical said on [Wed 18 Jul 2018], it was recalling a heart drug sold in the
United States after the European Medicines Agency found it [was] tainted with an impurity linked to cancer. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical is a major supplier of the active ingredient valsartan that it uses to make a generic drug to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. European regulators said the problem likely dates to changes in manufacturing processes at Zhejiang Huahai in 2012, suggesting that many patients could potentially have been exposed to cancer risk.

Zhejiang Huahai voluntarily suspended its supplies in the international market after detecting an impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in the valsartan product. NDMA is classified as a probable human cancer-causing substance and is not expected to be found in the drug. In response to this Zhejiang Huahai announcement, on [Tue 17 Jul 2018], the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alerted healthcare professionals and patients of a voluntary recall of several drug products containing the active ingredient valsartan.

The FDA said because valsartan is used in medicines to treat serious medical conditions, patients taking the recalled valsartan-containing medicines should continue taking their medicine until they have a replacement product. The companies listed are recalling all lots of non-expired products that contain the ingredient valsartan supplied to them by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals, Linhai, China. Zhejiang Huahai has stopped distributing its valsartan API and the FDA is working with the affected companies to reduce or eliminate the valsartan API impurity from future products.

"We've found that the valsartan sold by these specific companies does not
meet our safety standards. This is why we've asked these companies to take
immediate action to protect patients," said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director
of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Hundreds of thousands of vaccines provided for Chinese children have been found to be faulty, inciting widespread fury and prompting the country's President, Xi Jinping, to describe the incident as "vile and shocking."

China's Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has launched an investigation into vaccine manufacturer Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, revoking its license for human rabies vaccines and beginning a recall of all unused vaccines produced by the company.

A total of 5 senior executives of the company, including the chairwoman, were taken into custody for questioning by Changchun police, who announced they had begun an official criminal investigation into the company. In Chinese, the term Changsheng is a play on words meaning "long life." Online message boards have been inundated with hundreds of thousands of comments since the news broke [Sun 22 Jul 2018], with parents and consumers using the hashtag "#Changsheng bio-tech vaccine incident," to post reactions on Weibo, a Chinese platform likened to Twitter. "My home country, how can I trust you? You just let me down again and again," one user said. "Our trust has been overdrawn again and again, it's so irresponsible for everyone's life," said another.

Many of the defective vaccines were already on the market and being given to Chinese children, as part of the mandatory national vaccination program. A number have now been recalled, but there is no information at this stage as to how they could affect the health of those children who have already been injected. One mother, surnamed Zhen from Baoding, Hebei province, told CNN she had found out since the announcement her 6-year-old daughter was vaccinated with a Changsheng product. "I'm kind of at loss. I have to wait for official conclusions," she said over Wechat. Zhen said she'd been supportive of products made in China, unlike a number of her contemporaries who "worship" foreign products. "But this incident ... it also made me deeply concerned. It will be really hard to rebuild people's confidence in our national brands. After all, children are parents' lifeblood," she said.

At least 2 different vaccines -- rabies, and diphtheria and tetanus (DPT) -- manufactured by Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology are known to be defective. State-run Xinhua news agency reports that at least 113 000 doses of the company's rabies vaccine are affected. In a statement, the Jilin Provincial Food and Drug Administration said a total of 253 338 doses of Changsheng's DPT vaccine were faulty. This batch was sold to the Shandong Provincial Disease Prevention and Control Center.

It follows an earlier incident, in November 2017, when at least another 400 000 doses of the same vaccine, produced by a different, 2nd company, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, were found to be substandard.

Up to 8 provinces or cities immediately announced they would be stopping or suspending the use of human rabies vaccine from Changsheng, while another 4 claimed they had never used it. It is not known whether other regional disease control agencies have been affected.

The Changsheng vaccine issues 1st became public following an official government inspection of the company's facilities on [Sun 15 Jul 2018], in which authorities found that the company had fabricated production and testing records, falsified production specifications and equipment, CFDA officials said in a briefing on [Sun 22 Jul 2018].

Despite being overseas on [Mon 23 Jul 2018] on a visit to Africa, President Xi was briefed on the vaccine crisis and said ensuring the safety of drugs was the responsibility of the government and the Communist Party. He called for authorities to "scrape the poison off the bone" in their efforts to rectify the vaccine problems. On [Sun 22 Jul 2018], Premier Li Keqiang, the country's number 2 leader, announced a "thorough" investigation of China's vaccine production and sales process, saying the incident had "broke people's moral bottom line. Those involved will be resolutely punished with zero tolerance. (The government) will resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of people's lives," a statement released by China's Central Government said.

The vaccine crisis will undermine attempts by authorities to rebuild the public's trust in Chinese food and medicines after a series of wide-scale controversies in the past decade. In a statement released to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the management of Changsheng said it felt "very ashamed and guilty" over the vaccines. "The company will learn a lesson and take practical corrective measures and rectify thoroughly," the statement said. For their mistake, Changsheng was fined 3 442 887 yuan (USD507 843) by the Chinese government.

State-run tabloid the Global Times said in an unusually blunt editorial [Sun 22 Jul 2018] the provision of safe vaccines for the population was "a test of a modern country's governance." Another state media publication, China Daily, said in an editorial the same day transparency was needed if the public was going to be satisfied. "The authorities need to release whatever information they know about the incident to the public as soon as possible," the article said.

The vaccine scandal is just the latest in a series of controversies surrounding fake or defective products produced in China. In 2008, about 300 000 Chinese infants became sick after drinking tainted milk formula, triggering a countrywide rush to buy internationally-produced baby products in Hong Kong and abroad. Years later, almost half of Chinese food-processing plants still failed to meet internationally acceptable standards, according to a 2015 report. Even condiments such as soy sauce and spice mix haven't escaped the fake goods scares, after authorities in northern China busted several factories making counterfeit versions of the popular products in 2017.

[The news articles above mention 3 faulty medical products manufactured in China by Changsheng Biotechnology Co: Valsartan, DTaP, and freeze-dried human rabies vaccine that have now been recently recalled. The 2 vaccines, freeze-dried human rabies and DTaP, were said to be "substandard", implying that they may fail to elicit an effective immune response. We are also told in the news reports above that a 2nd vaccine manufacturer in China (Wuhan Institute of Biological Products) produced 400 000 doses of a "substandard" DTaP in 2017.

Valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker or ARB, is a drug used for treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, and to improve survival following a heart attack. The drug was originally developed by a Swiss pharmaceutical company marketed as Diovan, but it is now off patent and is used in a number of generic medicines. The Chinese product, which has been found to be contaminated with N-nitrosodimethylamine, a human carcinogen, has been recalled in 22 countries in Europe (https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/06/health/valsartan-heart-drug-recall-intl/index.html) and Canada (http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2018/67202a-eng.php). The recalled products in Europe are Sandoz valsartan and valsartan/HCT film-coated tablets and in the UK the recalled valsartan-containing medication are made by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. In the U.S., the FDA recall includes the versions of valsartan that are made by Major Pharmaceuticals, Solco Healthcare and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. as well as valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) sold by Solco Healthcare and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/health/valsartan-recall-fda-bn/index.html).

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age as part of the routine childhood immunization schedules. The upper-case letters in DTaP denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. The "a" in DTaP stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism. In the U.S., children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years of age. Hundreds of thousands of doses of a 2017 "batch" of defective DTaP had been distributed to multiple provinces in China. However, we are not told the number of children vaccinated with the defective vaccines, nor are we told if defective DTaP had been produced in prior years or if these vaccines were distributed outside of China.

Use of these defective DTaP vaccines will leave a substantial portion of the population susceptible to diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; but it will also undermine public confidence in the ability of government to safeguard the public and rekindle suspicions of corruption and abuse in the pharmaceutical industry. Also, it will engender further loss of confidence in the utility of vaccines in general as illustrated by parents' responses in the news reports above to the vaccine maker Changsheng Biotechnology Co's deceptive practices. - Mod.ML
