More than 1000 people have died, since November [2016], of the meningitis virus that has spread to northern Nigeria; but the epidemic is now under control, the National Center for Disease Surveillance (NCDC) said today [Thu 11 may 2017].

"As of [Tue 9 May 2017], 13 420 suspected cases of meningitis were registered in 23 states of the country, causing 1069 deaths, or an 8 percent of infected people," the NCDC said in a statement. The epidemic is thus present in half of the 36 states of Nigeria.

The 1st cases of infection with C-strain meningitis (reported for the 1st time in an epidemic in Nigeria) were reported in Zamfara State in November 2016. Then the disease spread to 22 other states before the authorities launched a mass vaccination campaign in this country of 190 million inhabitants, the most populous of Africa.

Meningitis epidemics are not uncommon in Nigeria, which is located on the "meningitis belt" running from Senegal to Ethiopia. By 2015, more than 13 700 people had been infected and more than 1100 had died in an outbreak in Nigeria and neighboring Niger.

[Nigeria has been experiencing an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis serogroup C that has spread across the country but is mostly concentrated in states in the upper northwest that fall within the African meningitis belt. This epidemic is different from past ones in that _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A, the previous predominant pathogen, has been replaced by meningococcus serogroup C, likely as a consequence of mass vaccination campaigns using a conjugate meningococcal serogroup A vaccine, the MenAfriVac-A. This vaccine reduced by over 90 percent the incidence of meningococcal meningitis due to serogroup A.

The last update posted by ProMED-mail on the Nigerian meningococcal meningitis outbreak (Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (07): fatal, sg. C 20170510.5027149) reported that as of the end of April 2017, there were 9646 suspected cases of meningitis serogroup C, with a total of 839 deaths since late 2016. The news report above now reports that as of [Tue 9 May 2017], there are 13 420 suspected cases of meningitis in 23 states of the country, with 1069 deaths.
