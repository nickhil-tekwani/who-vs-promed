HEPATITIS A, STRAWBERRIES - FORMER CZECHOSLOVAKIA
=================================================

PRO/EDR> Hepatitis A, strawberries - USA (04)]

Dr.Prikazsky and Dr.Plesnik from State Health Institutes in Banska Bystrica
(Slovakia) and Ostrava (Czech Republic) remember their personal experience
from very large epidemics in 1979. In Slovakia there were more than 8000
cases of Hepatitis A hospitalized.
[Only a] Very limited number of publications concerning these epidemics have
been published, and we are looking for them.
Epidemiological analysis of the epidemics showed links to the frozen creams
with strawberries produced by two plants, one in the Czech part and one in
the Slovak part of the former Czechoslovakia. A precise distribution area of
the plants was identified, and most of the cases indicated a favorite kind
of frozen product (frozen strawberry cream) bought in the stores in this area.
Strawberries originating from a large producer were picked mechanically,
washed and frozen right in the field. Frozen strawberries were shipped to
two processing plants.
Strawberries, packed in large containers for commercial use, were stored at
the plants and gradually transformed into the end product -- frozen creams
with strawberries, without pasteurization.
It has been suspected that on the fields of the producer contaminated water
was initially used and picking, washing and freezing followed some days
later. Washing of the strawberries in the machine before freezing was not
sufficient.
