Update of human avian influenza in Guangdong and reminder not to bring game, meat and poultry into Hong Kong
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (7 Mar 2015) closely monitoring 2 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Guangdong (GD) notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of GD Province (GDHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

Situation in GD
---------------
According to the GDHFPC, the 2 male patients, aged 62 in Foshan and aged 57 in Jiangmen, were hospitalised for management in critical and serious condition, respectively.

The activity of avian influenza viruses in the mainland remains high this winter and cases in GD are on the rise. To date, 599 cases have been reported by the mainland health authorities cumulatively since 2013, with 181 (30 per cent) from GD. In GD, 72 cases (40 per cent) with onsets since November 2014 have been reported, including 13 from Shenzhen, 8 each in Dongguan and Meizhou, etc.

The remaining cases in other areas were from Zhejiang (156 cases), Jiangsu (70 cases), Fujian (58 cases), Shanghai (45 cases), Anhui (24 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Xinjiang (10 cases), Jiangxi (9 cases), Shandong (6 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou and Hebei (1 case each).

Illegal import of game, meat and poultry
----------------------------------------
Apart from avoiding visits to live poultry markets during travel, the DH reminded the public not to bring any game, meat or poultry into Hong Kong without official health certificate issued by the food authority of the place of origin and/or without prior written permission granted by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which may be an offence under the Imported Game, Meat and Poultry Regulations (Cap 132AK). An offender shall be liable on conviction to a fine of USD 50 000 and to imprisonment for 6 months.

"Enforcement actions are ongoing at boundary control points by relevant departments, including quarantine detector dogs, against returning travellers and incoming trucks bringing raw meat illegally. As raw meat without a proper health certificate can be a health risk, members of the public should strictly observe the regulation," the spokesman said.

Local surveillance
------------------
"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," the spokesman said.

Health surveillance measures have been implemented at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers and the DH also conducts temperature checks by handheld devices. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry and other stakeholders are ongoing. ...
