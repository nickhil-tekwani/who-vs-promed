Five family members from a sheep and cattle farm near Inverness, Scotland
have been exposed to E-coli poisoning. The 27-year-old mother is in stable
condition in Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, and her two-year-old daughter
has a kidney complication. The woman's other two children, an 11-month-old
girl and a boy of eight, and her nephew, 12, are recovering at home.
The same strain of E coli 0157 has claimed 21 lives in Scotland in two
outbreaks in the past six months.
