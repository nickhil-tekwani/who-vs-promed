[1] Cholera - Congo DR: (Orientale)

Some 272 cases of cholera, including 8 deaths, have been detected since the
beginning of September [2007] in a north eastern district of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, a WHO official said on Fri 16 Nov 2007. The cases have
occurred in the Tchomia health zone within the Ituri district, said Eustace
Kyroussis, head of the WHO office in the area.

Numerous cases have been detected on the small island of Rukwanzi in Lake
Albert, recently inhabited by fishermen and their families, said local
official Dieudonne Rwabona. "On Rukwanzi, an island of 3 square kilometres
(1.2 square miles), there is no health center nor latrine," Rwabona said.

Congolese police have begun evacuating the families from the island and
sending them back to their villages of origin. The cholera outbreak in the
region has essentially been due to a lack of drinkable water, forcing
residents to consume non-treated water from Lake Albert.

part of the country. The island of Rukwanzi, located at the southern end of
Lake Albert, is disputed territory between Congo DR and Uganda, which has
been exacerbated by the recent discovery of oil under Lake Albert. - Mod.LL]

[3] Diarrhea, post-cyclone - Bangladesh

A shortage of fresh drinking water is causing an outbreak of diarrhea in
Bangladesh after last week's [15 Nov 2007] Cyclone Sidr lashed the country
leaving almost 3500 dead, local authorities said Wed 21 Nov 2007.

Local media said 2 children had died in the badly hit district of
Patuakhali, in southern Bangladesh, which hit the country on 15 Nov 2007.

"The sanitary situation is awful, we lack fresh water," a Bangladeshi food
and emergency ministry spokesman said. The cyclone, which was called "a
national calamity" by Fakhruddin Ahmed, the country's interim government
head, destroyed over 270 000 homes affecting up to 4 million people.
Bangladesh's leader added, "The destruction of houses, roads, trees, and
crops by the hurricane is unimaginable."

The Bangladeshi Red Crescent Society earlier said that the final death toll
could reach 10 000, as official statistics had failed to take into account
victims on coastal islands and in isolated areas. Relief workers are
struggling to distribute drinking water and food to affected areas and are
reported to be running out of supplies.

This is the worst storm to hit Bangladesh since 1991, when at least 139 000
people were killed along its coastline. In 1970, a cyclone claimed around
half a million lives in the country.

[4] Cholera, shellfish - Thailand

The Public Health Ministry is keeping a close eye on 12 provinces for signs
of cholera after several people died from eating half-cooked food. Disease
Control Department (DCD) director general Dr Thawat Suntrajarn said
yesterday [19 Nov 2007] checks had been made on the spread of cholera
across the country from January to November 2007. It uncovered 761 people
with severe diarrhea caused by cholera, 7 of whom had died.

Thawat said the ministry had brought the disease under control but close
monitoring was needed in Khon Kaen, Udon Thani, Sakhon Nakhon, Lamphun, Roi
Et, Maha Sarakham, Kalasin, Nakhon Phanom, Samut Sakhon, Nong Khai,
Ayutthaya, and Mukdahan. Most people in the provinces still ate half cooked
food like cockles, which was sometimes tainted with cholera bacteria.

Thawat said the Laos Public Health Ministry claimed it had found cholera
bacteria in fresh cockles imported from the north east Thailand. But he
rejected the claim, as Thailand had never exported fresh cockles to Laos.
He said the Fisheries Department also had not found any contamination in
cockle farms across the country. He believed the contamination found in
Laos might have occurred during transport after a merchant crossed the
border and bought cockles for shipment back to his country.

Dr Nguyen Duc Hien from the National Institute for Contagious and Tropical
Diseases said that the institute received up to 42 severe cases of
diarrhea, including 11 with cholera between 17 and 19 Nov 2007. 2 of them,
one from Hanoi and one from Ha Tay, are in serious condition.

In Ha Tay, the neighboring province of Hanoi, a cluster of cases occurred
at a party in Chuc Son town, where 12 people developed acute diarrhea,
including one with cholera.

According to the Health Ministry's Acute Diarrhea Epidemic Control Steering
Board, the total number of diarrhea patients in the country has increased
to 1912 so far, including 257 cholera patients.

Hanoi and Ha Tay are the key sites for acute diarrhea epidemics, and
account for 12 of the latest 17 cholera patients in recent days.
