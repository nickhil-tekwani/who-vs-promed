The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) has issued an alert to the public regarding a potential risk of exposure to hepatitis A from a food service worker at a restaurant in Emerald Park, just outside Regina.

The SHA is investigating and following up on a case of hepatitis A in a food handler who assisted with all meal preparation at Tim Hortons, 20 Great Plains Rd. The period of potential exposure for restaurant patrons is 27 Jan 2022 through 10 Feb 2022, according to an SHA news release.

"The risk of transmission is very low as the food handler wore gloves; however, the possibility of transmission still exists," notes the news release.

The eatery is located along a major Trans-Canada travel route frequently used by travellers. Anyone who may have eaten there during the dates listed is asked to contact HealthLine at 811 for additional information.

Anyone who ate at the restaurant or consumed take-out food during those dates is advised to receive a vaccination against hepatitis A from their local public health services if no more than 14 days have passed since the most recent meal they had in that restaurant, and they have not had a hepatitis A vaccine in the past.

Anyone who ate a meal during the dates listed, but it has been longer than 14 days since their most recent meal, should monitor for symptoms of hepatitis A infection for up to 50 days after exposure.

Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by a virus that is spread from person to person, and symptoms may include fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, light stool, tiredness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). More information on hepatitis A infection and vaccines is available on the SHA's website (https://bit.ly/33wBPnK).

[It is likely, but unstated, that there is a food handler index case here who was un-immunized, and any cluster of secondary cases could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. Two recent outbreaks of food handler-associated hepatitis A in the USA with fatalities bear witness to the fact that while the risk of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in food handlers may not be high, if infected the food handler represents a real risk to those eating in the restaurant. If such cases occur, the public relations and financial damage to the restaurant could be very significant. Although vaccine mandates in today's world are problematic, restaurant-associated food handler-related outbreaks of HAV are preventable. - Mod.LL
