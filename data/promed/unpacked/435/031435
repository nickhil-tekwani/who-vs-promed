Anthrax has claimed 3 lives and affected 2 more in Dhaiguda village under Dasmantpur block [Koraput district, Odisha state] in the last one week.

Locals said 3 cattle had died in the village 2 weeks back [around 15 Jun 2015] and some villagers had consumed its beef. The people who had consumed the meat fell ill with 3 of them succumbing last week. The deceased are JS, AJ, and SS of the village.

Two days back, a group of social workers informed the doctors of Koraput Hospital about the deaths and a health team visited the village on Sunday [28 Jun 2015]. The team found anthrax spores [sic; bacteria, presuming this refers to the 2 still alive, as corpses are promptly burned - Mod.MHJ] in blood samples of 2 of the affected persons. On Monday [29 Jun 2015], another medical team visited the village and again collected blood samples of all the residents of the village to ascertain presence of anthrax spores [sic] in their blood.

Koraput ADMO (Public Health) Arun Padhi said condition of the affected persons is stable and blood samples have been sent to Bhubaneswar for testing.

This, apparently, is not the 1st instance of anthrax deaths in Koraput this year [2015]. Seven tribals have died and 80 others have been affected by the disease in the last 3 months in different blocks of the district.

[Latterly, human outbreaks have been in the Laxmipur block. This points up the urgent need for a state-wide livestock anthrax vaccination programme, and urgently in the Koraput district.
