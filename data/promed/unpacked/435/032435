Confirming 4 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus infection] in
the city, officials on Friday [23 Sep 2011] said preliminary inquiries
had established that the patients did not travel to endemic areas in
the recent past and appeared to have contracted the virus in Delhi
itself.

The state government had directed MCD [Municipal Corporation of Delhi]
and NDMC [New Delhi Municipal Council] to conduct inquiries about 4
persons who had tested positive for JE [virus antibodies] in
serological tests conducted by the National Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC). Of the 4, 3 are children from Bawana and Jahangirpuri in North
West Delhi while the 4th is an HIV positive woman from Gole Market in
New Delhi.

Dr RP Vashisht, state programme officer of the Integrated Disease
Surveillance Project (IDSP), said: "None of the 4 patients is in a
serious condition. All of them are responding to treatment."

Dr VK Monga, chairperson of the MCD public health committee, said:
"After the JE virus enters the body, it only takes between 5-15 days
for the symptoms to manifest. This is known as the incubation period
of the virus. No patient appears to have travelled to any endemic area
in the last month." He said though 2 patients had travelled to UP
[Uttar Pradesh] in February and July [2011], the virus was contracted
in the last 15 days.

The vector-borne disease is carried by a female mosquito of the _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_ species. "The virus is found in pigs and cattle. A
mosquito which bites any infected cattle becomes a vector and can
spread it to human beings. [Cattle are not involved in the
transmission cycle of JE virus; wild birds are the reservoir. Pigs are
amplifying hosts. - Mod.TY]. It has a very high mortality rate of
20-40 per cent. This is the 1st time that cases have been confirmed in
Delhi, so we are worried," Dr Monga said.

Both MCD and NDMC said they have taken immediate measures to control
the spread of the virus. "We have carried out intensive fogging and
anti-larval treatment activities within a 2 km [1.2 mi] diameter of
the area of residence of the patients in North West Delhi on Friday
[23 Sep 2011]," Dr Monga said. NDMC health officer Dr PK Sharma said
similar measures had been taken in the Gole Market area.

[There have been scattered cases across India this JE virus
transmission season in 2011, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
states. If vector mosquitoes are abundant in Delhi, health authorities
there have a legitimate cause for concern.

This report does not indicate what type of serological tests were
done. Presumably they were single, not paired acute/convalescent
samples, since these were fatal cases and so it would not be possible
to demonstrate a significant diagnostic rise in antibody titer.
Interpretation of serological tests with flaviviruses such as JE virus
must be done with caution, due to confusing or misleading
cross-reactions with viruses within the flaviviruses.
