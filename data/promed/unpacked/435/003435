A 2-year-old Asian elephant named Mike died this week at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation.
The death of the center's youngest elephant from elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) happened very quickly, the center said in a release.

"No one knows why the virus manifests this way in some elephants, since most elephants harbor the virus and never become ill," Director of Veterinary Care Dr. Ashley Settles said. "Mike only began to show the slightest of symptoms on Saturday [23 Jan 2016] and was eating and drinking well as late as Sunday afternoon [24 Jan 2016], but the illness progressed very rapidly. "As soon as symptoms began, we started treating him, but by Monday morning [25 Jan 2016] there was nothing more anyone could do to prevent his passing." Mike died Monday morning [25 Jan 2016], the center said. Mike was born at the center on 27 Jun 2013, one of 26 endangered Asian elephants born there since its founding in 1995.

Both wild and captive elephants die from EEHV. About half the deaths of captive elephants are due to the virus, the center said. The center is working with the Smithsonian Institution's National Elephant Herpesvirus Laboratory to develop treatments for infected elephants. The virus has an 80 percent mortality rate in elephants, the center said.

[Elephants are intelligent and sensitive individuals. This is a tragedy. This disease is most often known as elephant herpesvirus.

Extensive viral DNA sequencing analysis carried out over many years primarily at the National Elephant Herpesvirus Laboratory and Johns Hopkins Laboratory Group has revealed a great deal of genetic variability amongst the herpesviruses that infect Asian and African elephants. This variability occurs at 3 distinct levels (genus, species and strain). Information about individual viral genomes comes predominantly from DNA samples extracted from viremic blood and necropsy tissue collected from numerous elephant calves with hemorrhagic disease. However, some data also comes from virus-positive lung nodules and skin biopsies, as well as occasionally from routine blood samples and trunk washes of latently infected, but otherwise healthy elephants that are undergoing low level systemic primary infection or secondary reactivated infections. Selected fragments of viral DNA are amplified by a process known as polymerase chain reaction (or PCR) and the order of A, C, G and T nucleotides along the DNA molecules is then read off from a special sequencing gel profile and compared by computer with all other known herpesvirus DNA sequences.

This insidious, elephant-specific disease has a mortality rate estimated between 80 and 90 percent and has been the cause of death of approximately 25 percent of the Asian elephants born in North America since 1978. It usually strikes when the calves are between 1 and 4 years old. [This conflicts with the statement in the last paragraph below. - Mod.JW] They most often succumb within 24 to 72 hours of showing the 1st symptoms. Various strains of the virus are found in Asian and African elephants in human care as well as in wild populations. There is no known cure or vaccine.

There is no true cure for herpesviruses in animals or in humans. Based on current knowledge from our ongoing research and from elephant care institutions that have experienced EEHV infections, the treatment protocols continue to improve, and detection and treatment recommendations continue to evolve. Current antiviral treatments suppress EEHV, and elephants can potentially recover if diagnosed and treated early. Of the elephants that have been treated, the success rate with anti-viral therapy against EEHV has been about 40 percent. To date, antiviral drugs have been used successfully in treating 9 Asian elephants in North America, and 7 of the most recent 8 elephants to get sick from EEHV have recovered with treatment. Veterinarians and scientists continue to collaborate to better understand this disease and develop more effective treatment options.

We know that EEHV is not just a disease of the captive Asian elephant in western countries. According to spring 2009 International Elephant Foundation progress report by EEHV experts, more than a dozen cases of EEHV have been identified in elephant populations in India and Cambodia -- 8 wild Asian elephant calves died within the past year [2015]. Moreover, these deaths only represent the cases in which necropsies were conducted in sufficient time to detect it.

Current research indicates that the elephant-specific herpesvirus may have been in elephant populations for tens of millions of years, just as human herpesviruses have been in human populations. Since this is a naturally occurring disease, every elephant in the wild and in human care probably carries one or more forms of elephant herpesvirus within them.

To date, scientists have identified 14 genetically different elephant herpesviruses (EEHV), 5 of which are known to cause hemorrhagic disease. The viruses found in symptomatic elephants at different zoos and other institutions are genetically distinct, which means that they are not all the same strain spread by the transfers of elephants between and among zoos. The most common cause of acute EEHV cases and deaths in elephants is the EEHV 1a strain.

Herpesviruses are widespread in all vertebrate taxa, including humans. While herpesviruses are usually species specific, they can affect closely related species. (EEHV does not pose a health risk to humans, though humans are host to their own strains of herpesviruses.) All herpesviruses do share common some features. Once inside a host, the virus can go into a latent (hidden) phase after causing only mild symptoms or no signs of disease at all. Scientists do not yet know where in the body EEHV resides during the latent phase.

For reasons unknown, an elephant herpesvirus can come out of latency and circulate throughout the bloodstream, causing disease. This is the only time when a herpesvirus can be readily detected in blood samples. Reliable tests are not yet available to detect a latent (hidden) infection. Most elephants are able to fight the virus and survive when it comes out of latency. Calves appear to be most susceptible to EEHV disease after they have been weaned, at a time when they are not protected by their mother's antibodies.
