Nipah virus claimed the life of a minor boy at Ghosgati village in Shalikha upazila on Sunday [10 Mar 2013]. A boy, aged 2, of the village died at Jessore General Hospital in the morning.

District Civil Surgeon Dr Muhammad Shafiqul Alam said the boy had fallen sick after drinking date [palm] juice on Thursday [7 Mar 2013]. He was admitted to Magura district hospital. Later, after his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to Jessore General Hospital on the same day, where he died on Sunday morning [10 Mar 2013]. The civil surgeon suspected that the victim might have been attacked by Nipah virus after taking date [palm] juice.

The victim's blood has been sent for laboratory testing at Mohakhali in Dhaka city, said hospital sources.

As of 12 Mar 2013: 19 Nipah cases were identified; among them, 17 died (mortality rate 89 per cent). These cases are from 13 districts (including Gaibandha, Natore, Rajshahi, Naogaon, Rajbari, Pabna, Jhenaidah, Mymensingh, Nilphamari, Chittagong, Kurigram, Kustia). Age distribution of cases are 8 months to 55 years; among them, 13 are male and 6 are female.

Human Nipah virus (NiV) infection, an emerging zoonotic disease, was 1st recognized in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 through May 1999. NiV is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus belonging to the genus _Henipavirus_. It is an enveloped RNA virus. The median incubation period of the secondary cases who had a single exposure to a Nipah case was 9 days (range 6-11 days), but exposure to onset of illness varies from 6-16 days. The median incubation period following a single intake of raw date palm sap to onset of illness is 7 days (range: 2-12 days) in Bangladesh.

Transmission: Drinking of raw date palm sap (kancha khejurer rosh) contaminated with NiV; Close physical contact with Nipah infected patients.

Surveillance: Nipah surveillance began in 2006. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in collaboration with ICDDR,B established Nipah surveillance in 10 district level government hospitals of the country where Nipah outbreaks had been identified. Presently, the surveillance system is functioning in 5 hospitals of the "Nipah Belt."

[It is very likely that the samples from the boy will test positive for Nipah virus, since Bangladesh is endemic for the virus; this is the transmission season there, and clinicians are familiar with the disease. There have been 19 reported deaths from Nipah virus infections in Bangladesh so far this year [2013].

The reservoir hosts of Nipah virus are giant fruit bats (_Pteropus_ species). They shed virus, particularly during the breeding season when pregnant or lactating. Because these sporadic cases occur in geographically scattered areas, increasing the degree of public awareness and either boiling the sap or preventing access to sap collection vessels by the bats by placing barriers around the jars are a major public health education challenge. Boiling is reported to adversely alter the flavor of the sap.
