MERS-CoV and N-linked sialic acid: a request for information
------------------------------------------------------------
The recent observation that upper respiratory tract (URT) swabs may not contain MERS-CoV, while the lower respiratory tract (LRT) can harbour the virus in the same patients, suggests an hypothesis that infection by MERS-CoV may be dependent on the variety of neuraminidase-linked sialic acid at receptor sites in respiratory epithelium, as is widely recognized in avian influenza [AI] virus. Successful airborne spread of AI appears to be more likely when the virus has adapted to attachment with alpha 2,6, N-linked sialic acid present throughout the human URT, from where the virus can be launched with remarkable efficiency through sneezes. (This was the case in the 1981, 1957, and 1968 AI pandemics). A/H5N1 however, is thus far adapted to alpha 2,3, sialic acid, (which can be found in human LRT, and especially abundant in duck enteric epithelium). This probably accounts for the absence of pandemic spread by H5N1 through coughs and sneezes, while allowing contagion via close (saliva/mucous) contact. Has any study been carried out thus far on the attachment preference (if any) of MERS-CoV with regard to N-linked sialic acid in the respiratory tract?

[The location in the respiratory tract of neuraminidase-linked sialic acid receptor sites appears to be a critical determinant of pathogenicity in influenza virus infections. The relative absence of MERS-CoV in swabs from the upper respiratory tract may be a reflection of a similar situation. Can any readers provide further information in this regard? - Mod.CP]
