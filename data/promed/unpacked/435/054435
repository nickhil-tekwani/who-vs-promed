Confirmation of circulation of West Nile virus in birds in the Far Eastern
region of Russia
-----------------------------------------------
[Contributed by V.A. Ternovoi, E.V. Protopopova, and V.B. Loktev, The State
Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology "Vector," Koltsovo,
Novosibirsk Region; S.G. Surmach, Institute of Biology and Soil Sciences,
FEB RAS, Vladivostok; and M.V. Gazetdinov and G.N. Leonova, Research
Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, SB RAMS,Vladivostok, Russia].
Frozen samples from dead birds collected in the Far Eastern Region of
Russia during 2003-2004 were analyzed by an anti-West Nile virus
MAb-modified immunoenzyme assay for antigen detection and by RT-PCR. 4
positive samples from cinereous vultures (_Aegypius monachus_) and 2
positive samples from the cattle egret (_Bubulcus ibis_) were found. The
samples were positive in ELISA and RT-PCR.
Sequencing of 400 bp fragments of the E protein gene showed high homology
with the WNV/LEIV-Vlg99-27889 strain of West Nile virus (isolated in
Volgograd, Russia, in 1999). Additionally, 4 positive samples from other
species of birds (_Ixobrychus eurhytmus_, _Pica pica_, _Corvus
macrorhynchos_, _Falco tunnuncules_) collected during the autumn of 2004
were found during screening with anti-West Nile virus MAb-modified ELISA.
These results confirm that WNV is circulating in the Far Eastern region of
Russia at present.
