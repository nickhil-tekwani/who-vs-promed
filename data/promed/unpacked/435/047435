_Balamuthia mandrillaris_ is a free-living soil ameba that was first reported in 1990 to cause amebic meningoencephalitis in both baboons and humans. _B. mandrillaris_ amoebic encephalitis (BAE) is more frequently found in warmer regions such as Southern California and South America.

Up till now, only over 200 cases of _B. mandrillaris_ infections have been reported around the world, and the mortality rate is over 95%. Very few cases have been reported in Asia, let alone in China.

In a report in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, researchers describe a fatal case in a 15 year old male from Guizhou Province, China. He was admitted in May 2019 due to fever and altered mental status over the past week. His symptoms, treatment and testing are described in detail in the paper. He did progress into a coma and died due to multiple organ failure.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say balamuthia infection is very rare. Balamuthia amoebae can infect the skin, sinuses, brain and other organs of the body. The disease may appear mild at first but can become more severe over weeks to several months. Often the disease is fatal, with a death rate of more than 95%.

Just as for _Naegleria fowleri_, a commoner cause of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, _Balamuthia mandrillaris_ is probably found worldwide in the environment, including soil and fresh water. Both amoebas are difficult to treat, and the mortality rate is high. - Mod.EP
