Taichung health officials announced yesterday [Mon 16 Jul 2012] 2 new cases of Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease, and urged the public to take precautions against mosquitoes during the disease's peak season.

Two women aged 30 and 42 developed symptoms of fevers and headaches in late June 2012. Both live near rice paddies, where mosquitoes carrying the virus are easily found, according to the central city's health bureau. They were later hospitalized for treatment after their conditions deteriorated, health officials said, adding that one had since been discharged, while the other was still receiving treatment.

The officials urged the public to get vaccinated as the best defense against the virus. There have been 23 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis around Taiwan so far this year [2012], according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control.

[Taiwan is within the broad geographical endemic Japanese encephalitis belt that extends from South Asia through Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the northern tip of Australia. Japanese encephalitis is the principal cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000 to 50 000 cases reported annually. Although most Japanese encephalitis virus infections are inapparent, they can progress to encephalitis and death, with neurological sequelae in some of those who survive. The virus is maintained in birds and transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes. Swine may serve as amplifying hosts.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease. The Japanese encephalitis season is from May-October, and although Japanese encephalitis infection has been infrequent in Taiwan, those that work in high-risk areas, such as rice paddies, livestock quarters, ponds, and irrigation ditches at dusk, when the mosquitoes are at their most active, should be vaccinated. To lower the chances of infection, long sleeves and pants should be worn, and mosquito repellant should be applied to exposed areas if activity in these places cannot be avoided.
