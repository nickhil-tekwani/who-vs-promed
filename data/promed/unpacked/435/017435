The Regional Sanitation Office has already detected 21 cases of
persons affected by onychomadesis, one adult among them, in Valencia
capital and in municipalities from its metropolitan area, according
to sources from this department. This condition leads to the
spontaneous separation of the nail plate from the matrix area, so the
nail sheds off.

Last week it was notified that 11 children from an elementary school
located in the northeastern part of Valencia were affected by this
condition, and 100 children from this institution and from 2 other
daycare centers underwent studies in La Fe Hospital in Valencia in
order to determine whether they were affected by coxsackievirus.

Sources from the Regional Sanitation Office pointed out that 80
percent of all the children studied "had been in contact with the
virus [one of the possible causes leading to this condition]," but
which children developed the condition cannot be confirmed until the
results of the studies become available.

After the 1st 11 cases were reported, the Public Health Office has
localized another "10 well defined cases," among them an adult
subject, that are spread through other municipalities in Valencia
province and areas within Valencia capital city, according to the
aforementioned sources, but no additional details have been revealed.

Onychomadesis is an inflammatory condition occurring in fingernails
and toenails that leads to nail cracking and sometimes shedding off,
and it occurs around 35 to 40 days after 1st contact with the virus.

According to the data sources, the initial epidemiological
investigation proposed as a hypothesis that there is a relationship
between onychomadesis and a history of a prior coxsackievirus
infection during the past 3 to 8 weeks. This virus is the causative
agent of a condition known as hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome.

This disease generally affects children less than 10 years old
staying in closed environments where there is much contact among
individuals, it also causes mild fever, a skin rash and some sores,
particularly in the palms and/or soles.

Hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome is a benign condition, but it is highly
contagious, it has spontaneous remission, and it is quite frequent
during spring, according to the data sources, which pointed out that
what is currently affecting Valencia children "is a very mild and
non-contagious form of the disease."

Health Ministry officers declared that it is possible that new cases
of nail shedding may occur as a consequence of transmissions
occurring in the past few days, and they explained that therapy is
restricted to aid new nail growth with a cream and to keep the
affected area disinfected.

The Regional Sanitation office pointed out that from the very first
moment, epidemiology areas informed both parents and teachers from
the affected schools about the disease as well as with respect to
therapy and adopted measures.

Dermatology services in La Fe, Peset and General Hospitals are
actively working in the identification of new cases.

200 cases of onychomadesis (falling nails) in children have been
notified to the Regional Sanitation Office by pediatricians and
family doctors from different healthcare centers in Valencia
Comunitat since the outbreak started more than one month ago, when 11
cases were identified in a children's day care center located in the
northeastern part of the city, according to sources from the Regional
Sanitation Office.

This is the largest outbreak ever described in the international
scientific literature. In fact, the Epidemiology area from the
Regional Sanitation Office has already submitted a report to a
specialized journal.

The same sources indicated that it is likely that in the following
days, figures may increase, since 4-5 children with onychomadesis are
brought every day to Valencia General Hospital.

This figure may increase considering non-reported cases, perhaps
because nails had already fallen out or because parents are quite
certain that this is a benign condition, as it has been previously reported.

Outpatient clinics from the General Hospital had already taken care
of 40 children, in which nail and hair samples had been taken; they
had also undergone urine and stool examinations, and their telephone
numbers have been recorded in order to request a blood sample from
them in La Fe Hospital; while in Doctor Peset Hospital, 2 children
with the condition have been seen.

Specialists taking care of children affected by onychomadesis, a
viral condition characterized by nail shedding that occurs between 30
and 45 days after an infection by coxsackievirus, will gather today
[7 Jul 2008] in Valencia in order to establish the cutoff line for
the epidemiological study (it is usually after 100 cases) and to know
the results of the studies being performed by the Microbiology center
at La Fe Hospital.

Dr. Gobernado from La Fe Hospital (microbiologist), Dr. Isabel Febrer
from the General Hospital, Dr. Amparo Marquina from Doctor Peset
Hospital and a representative from the epidemiology area of the
Regional Sanitation Office will attend the programmed meeting.

[The dictionary definition of onychomadesis is a shedding of the
nails beginning at the matrix and becoming complete. The association
of this condition with hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is tenuous
but not without precedent. HFMD is a contagious enteroviral infection
occurring primarily in children and characterized by a vesicular
palmoplantar eruption and erosive stomatitis.

Clementz and Manzini (Pediatr. Dermatol. 17 (1), 7-11, 2000 ) state
that nail matrix arrest has been associated with a variety of drug
exposures and systemic illnesses, including infections, and may
result in a variety of changes, including transverse ridging (Beau's
lines) and nail shedding (onychomadesis). They described 5 children
presenting with Beau's lines and/or onychomadesis following
physician-diagnosed HFMD by 3-8 weeks. Three of the 5 patients
experienced fever with HFMD, and none had a history of nail trauma,
periungual dermatitis, periungual vesicular lesions, or a significant
medication intake history. All patients experienced HFMD within 4
weeks of one another, and all resided in the suburbs of the Chicago
metropolitan area. In all patients, the nail changes were temporary
with spontaneous normal re-growth. The mechanism of the nail matrix
arrest was unclear, but the timing and geographic clustering of the
patients suggested an epidemic caused by the same viral strain.

According to Bernier et al. (Eur. J. Perdiatr. 160 (11), 649-651,
2001), onychomadesis is a rare disorder in children. Except for
serious generalised diseases or inherited forms, most cases are
considered to be idiopathic. Few reports in the literature concern
common triggering phenomena. However, Bernier et al. described 4
patients in whom the same benign viral condition in childhood
appeared as a stressful event preceding onychomadesis. In each case,
spontaneous complete healing of the nails was achieved within a few
weeks. They concluded that onychomadesis and/or onycholysis is a
newly recognised complication in the course of viral infections
presenting clinically as hand, foot and mouth disease, and because of
mild forms, is probably underestimated.

The clustering of cases of onychomadesis in Valencia has been
associated circumstantially with an outbreak of HFMD. The link is
tenuous and may be no more than fortuitous. HFMD can be a consequence
of infection by several different enteroviruses, and the current HFMD
epidemic in Asia is associated with enterovirus 71 infection. The
link with coxsakievirus infection, though suggestive, needs to be
supported by quantitative data. Further information would be
welcomed. - Mod.CP]
