A single case of atypical scrapie was confirmed in an Alberta sheep in January [2012].

Dr Bob Cooper, a veterinary program specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), said the case was discovered as part of the national surveillance program to eradicate scrapie in Canada.

The surveillance program tests samples of sheep and goats for scrapie in an effort to understand where the disease is found in Canada and how to eliminate it.

Scrapie is a fatal disease that affects the central nervous system of sheep and goats. It is in the same family as BSE [bovine spongiform encephalitis] in cattle and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk.

It is a reportable disease in Canada.

Unlike classical scrapie, atypical scrapie doesn't require that sheep farms be quarantined or the flock investigated. [One wonders what evidence led authorities to develop policy that for this disease does not require a quarantine.]

Cooper said there would be some follow up to determine where the sheep lived its life, but there will be no large scale investigation or quarantine.

The atypical scrapie case was posted on the CFIA website's monthly reportable disease update [see http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/2012/flocks-infected-in-2012/eng/1329724998646/1329725166676].

Canada has developed the national voluntary scrapie flock certification program in an attempt to eliminate scrapie from the national flock.

Alberta Lamb Producer chair Phil Kolodychuk was relieved the case was atypical scrapie and not classic scrapie.

"It's a bad disease. We'd like to get rid of it in our country," he said.

[Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), as are mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy/BSE) and chronic wasting disease (CWD). Both BSE and scrapie have an atypical form that differs from the normal TSE seen in these animals.

In 2003, an unusual type of scrapie in sheep, named Nor98, was described in Norway [1]. Affected sheep displayed predominantly ataxia in the absence of pruritus, and neuropathological findings were mainly restricted to the cerebellar and cerebral cortices, whilst vacuolation and PrPsc accumulation in the brainstem at the level of the obex was sparse or absent. Western immunoblot analysis showed a PrPres glycoprofile with a protein band of lower molecular mass than in previous scrapie cases. Similar "atypical" scrapie cases have since been found in many other countries [2-8] and mainly in sheep of PrP genotypes not usually associated with "classical" scrapie.
