[Earlier in 2007 ProMED-mail posted a description of a novel
polyomavirus present in respiratory secretions from human patients
with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. The virus was
initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate from a 3-year-old
Australian child diagnosed with pneumonia. Phylogenetic analyses
revealed that WU virus was a polyomavirus but divergent from all
known polyomaviruses. Subsequently WU virus was found in association
with acute upper respiratory tract infections in both Australia and
the USA. More recently a similar virus has been identified in
association with upper respiratory tract diseases in Chinese children
and the genome sequence of the virus deposited in GenBank under the
name CLFF virus.

However a research paper in the current issue of the Journal of
Clinical Virology, which is summarized below casts doubt on the
association of WU virus with upper respiratory tract disease. - Mod.CP]

No evidence for an association between infections with WU and KI
polyomaviruses and respiratory disease
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
WU virus (WUV) and KI polyomavirus (KIPyV) are newly discovered
related human polyomaviruses detected in respiratory samples. To
investigate their potential role in respiratory disease, we
determined their frequencies of detection, clinical presentations,
and epidemiological characteristics among samples referred for
diagnostic respiratory virus testing.

Methods
-------
Anonymised samples and accompanying study subject information were
obtained from the Edinburgh respiratory specimen archive. Samples
were screened by nested PCR [polymerase chain reaction] using 2 sets
of primers conserved between WUV and KIPyV, as well for other
respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenoviruses
[AdV], influenza A/B and parainfluenza viruses 1-3, human bocavirus, B19).

Results and conclusions
-----------------------
WUV and KIPyV were detected in 10 and 14 samples, respectively from
983 specimens (from 9 to 10 different individuals from 612 study
subjects). Infections occurred in 2 types of study subject; those who
were young (less than 2 years) with lower respiratory tract
infections (n=8), and almost invariably co-infected with other
respiratory viruses (RSV, AdV), and a 2nd, generally older group
either without respiratory disease (n=6) or with mild upper
respiratory tract infections (n=5), but who were generally clinically
severely immunosuppressed from leukaemia or transplant therapy.
Findings from either group do not support an aetiological link
between infection with WUV or KIPyV and respiratory disease.
