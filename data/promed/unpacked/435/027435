Madagascar: External situation report 04
----------------------------------------
Madagascar is experiencing a large outbreak of plague affecting major cities and other non-endemic areas since August 2017. Between 1 Aug 2017 and 15 Oct 2017, a total of 849 cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed) including 67 deaths (case fatality rate 7.9 percent) have been reported from 37 (32.5 percent) out of 114 districts in the country. Of these, 568 cases (67 percent) were clinically classified as pneumonic plague, 155 (18.3 percent) were bubonic plague, one case was septicemic plague, and 125 cases were unspecified. At least 39 healthcare workers have contracted plague since the beginning of the outbreak.

Of the 849 reported cases, 78 (9.2 percent) were confirmed, 304 (35.8 percent) were classified as probable after testing positive on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and 467 (55 percent) remain suspected. 11 strains of _Yersinia pestis_ have been isolated and were sensitive to antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.

Out of 22 regions in the country, 18 (81.2 percent), including traditionally non-endemic areas, have been affected. The district of Antananarivo Renivohitra has been the most affected, accounting for 57.1 percent of the reported cases. As of 16 Oct 2017, a total of 3745 contacts were identified, 79.2 percent (2967) of them were followed up on the day of reporting.

Plague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe district where the current outbreak originated. There is a seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, which occurs every year, usually between September and April. The plague season began earlier this year [2017] and the current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting non-endemic areas including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (the port city).

[The continued rapid rise of cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection with a predominance of pneumonic plague is quite worrisome as are the number of healthcare workers affected.

Although the WHO report above mentions 849 cases and 67 deaths, the Madagascar MOH indicates 878 cases and 80 deaths; I have made a moderator's decision to use the higher numbers.

A well-written review on the history of plague can be found at:
Butler T: Plague history: Yersin's discovery of the causative bacterium in 1894 enabled, in the subsequent century, scientific progress in understanding the disease and the development of treatments and vaccines. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014; 20: 202-9. doi: 10.1111/1469-0691.12540; http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(14)60858-2/fulltext

"Abstract
---------
The causative bacterium of plague was described and cultured by Alexandre Yersin in Hong Kong in 1894, after which transmission of bacteria from rodents by flea bites was discovered by Jean-Paul Simond in 1898. Effective treatment with antiserum was initiated in 1896, but this therapy was supplanted by sulfonamides in the 1930s and by streptomycin starting in 1947. India suffered an estimated 6 million deaths in 1900-1909, and Viet Nam, during its war in 1965-1975, accounted for approximately 80 percent of the world's cases; since then, African countries have dominated, with more than 90 percent of the world's cases in the 1990s and early 21st century. Serological diagnosis with fraction 1 antigen to detect anti-plague antibodies was developed in the 1950s. Vaccine development started in 1897 with killed whole bacterial cells, and this was followed by a live attenuated bacterial vaccine, leading to millions of persons receiving injections, but the benefits of these vaccines remain clouded by controversy. Plasmid-mediated virulence was established in 1981, and this was followed by specific DNA methods that have allowed detection of plague genes in skeletal specimens from European graves of the 6th to 17th centuries."
