Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - update
-----------------------------------------------------------
As of 25 April 2013 (16:30 CET), one laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with the virus has been reported by the Taipei Centres for Disease Control (CDC). The patient is a 53-year-old man who had been working in Jiangsu province from 28 March to 9 April 2013. He returned from Jiangsu via Shanghai on 9 April 2013, and became ill on 12 April 2013. The patient was laboratory confirmed with the virus on 24 April 2013.

To date, a total of 109 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 22 deaths have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored.

The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

A team of international and Chinese experts has completed its mission to visit Shanghai and Beijing and assess the avian influenza A (H7N9) situation, and to make recommendations to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

Jiangxi's first suspected H7N9 case detected
--------------------------------------------
NANCHANG: The Health Department of east China's Jiangxi Province on Thursday reported the province's 1st suspected human case of H7N9 avian influenza. In line with established protocol, the provincial center of disease control and prevention has sent the patient's samples to the national laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.

The patient, a 69-year-old man, has been admitted to the No. 3 Hospital in Nanchang, the provincial capital. The health department has not disclosed his condition. The city's disease control authority has quarantined 14 people who have had close contact with the patient. None of them have exhibited any abnormal symptoms.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its Wednesday update that the total number of H7N9 cases reported in the mainland stood at 108, including 23 cases that have ended in death. Most of the cases were reported in east China's Shanghai Municipality and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui.

Human infections with the emerging avian influenza A H7N9 virus from wet market poultry: clinical analysis and characterisation of viral genome
-----------
(By Y Yu Chen MD and others)

Background
----------
Human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 virus emerged in eastern China in February, 2013, and has been associated with exposure to poultry. We report the clinical and microbiological features of patients infected with influenza A H7N9 virus and compare genomic features of the human virus with those of the virus in market poultry in Zhejiang, China.

Methods
-------
Between March 7 and April 8, 2013, we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infiltrate, and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines. We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identified and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes.

Findings
--------
We identified 4 patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3 to 8 days before disease onset. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. 2 patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs.

The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken.

All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affinity for α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2.

Interpretation
--------------
Cross species poultry-to-person transmission of this new reassortant H7N9 virus is associated with severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in human beings. Monitoring of the viral evolution and further study of disease pathogenesis will improve disease management, epidemic control, and pandemic preparedness.

Most H7N9 patients had underlying conditions, animal exposure
-------------------------------------------------------------
The authors of a preliminary report on the epidemiology of the avian influenza A (H7N9) oputbreak in China [reference below] review data from 82 cases that were reported as of Apr 17. Since then, the outbreak total has grown to 109 illnesses, including 22 deaths. The country enhanced its surveillance for the disease after it identified the new virus in March. Among 664 hospitalized patients with unexplained pneumonia, 81 (12.2 percent) were infected with the new virus. Of 5551 respiratory specimens from outpatient surveillance for flulike illness, only 1 (0.02 percent) was positive for H7N9. Most of the patients who had confirmed infections were men (73 percent), and most lived in urban settings (84 percent). Of 71 patients with available information, 54 (76 percent) had underlying medical conditions. Among 46 of that group with available data, 40 (87 percent) were at increased risk due to their age -- either younger than 5 years or 65 or older. 4 of the patients were poultry workers: 3 slaughtered live-market poultry, and one transported poultry. All but one of the patients was hospitalized. As of the study cut-off date, 17 confirmed case-patients and 1 suspected case-patient had died of acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure.

Animal exposure
---------------
Details about animal exposure were available for 77 of the patients, and 59 (77 percent) said they had recent exposure to animals while working at or visiting a live-animal market: 45 to chickens, 12 to ducks, and 4 to swine. Other animals included pigeons, geese, quail, wild birds, pet birds, cats, and dogs. A history of animal exposure is unclear for 5 patients, and investigations are ongoing into their exposures.

The report also sheds new light on the type of contact and exposures that occurred in some of the family clusters, one of which involved some of the 1st patients who were reported in the outbreak, an 87-year-old man from Shanghai and his 2 sons.
The report said the index case in the cluster was a 57-year-old brother whose fatal infection was suspected but not confirmed. Within 2 weeks before he got sick, he had visited a live-poultry market where he bought a chicken, observed the slaughtering, brought it home, and cooked it. After he got sick, his father who lived with him and his 69-year-old brother who lived nearby cared for him, having prolonged unprotected contact before his hospitalization. The father and the brother got sick, and both had laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infections. The father died from his infection.

The report described another family cluster, a 60-year old man with a suspected infection and his 32-year-old daughter who lived in the same house with other family members. The father got sick, and his daughter cared for him at home and in the hospital before she got sick. Both of the patients are still critically ill. Tests confirmed H7N9 in the daughter and are still under way on the father. The woman did not raise poultry and had not had any animal exposures.

Contact tracing
---------------
Today's report also fleshes out more details about contact tracing. Of 1689 close contacts, excluding the cluster cases, 19 had respiratory symptoms during the 7-day surveillance period; 15 were healthcare workers, 1 was a patient in the same ward, 2 were household members, and 1 was a medical intern.

The investigators wrote that the current mortality rate is 21 percent, but they expect it to increase, given that many of the patients are still critically ill. So far the H7N9 virus appears more virulent to humans than are other H7 viruses, the group noted. Though extensive testing is needed to verify the source of H7N9, the Chinese authors strongly suspect poultry that don't show signs of disease. Until the source is confirmed, they said, control measures -- such as banning the sale of live birds at markets -- could help control the spread of the virus to humans.

Limited human-to-human contact remains a possibility, the scientists wrote, especially in blood relatives. Paired serum samples are being collected from contacts during the case-patients' acute and convalescent illness stages, they added. They recommend enhanced surveillance to clarify the clinical spectrum of the disease and the extent of asymptomatic infection, along with case-control studies to reveal more about the possible animal and environmental source.

China's bird flu outbreak: 3 good signs, 3 bad signs and 3 very bad signs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the new avian flu strain H7N9 began appearing in China earlier this year, it's infected over 100 people, killed 22, spread to five provinces plus Beijing and Shanghai and, as of Wednesday, is confirmed to have spread abroad to Taiwan. How worried should you be about this? How serious is the H7N9 outbreak? The simplest and most honest answer is that we don't know what's going to happen next, either with the virus, which may or may not mutate and become more transmittable, or with Chinese and international health-care authorities responsible for tamping it down. But there are some good signs, some bad signs and some very bad signs. Here are a few.

Three good signs:
----------------
1. China is being unusually transparent so far. Ten years ago, as the deadly viral respiratory illness known as SARS first spread across China, the government did not respond well. It suppressed information about the outbreak, making it that much harder to contain and study the disease, ultimately costing lives. This time, though, Chinese authorities have been sharing information about the disease's spread, and state media appear to be freely reporting on new cases. Chinese officials seem to take the disease seriously and want to combat its rise, even if it means overcoming more secretive instincts. All health care for H7N9 is now free in China, for example, to help encourage people to report cases.

2. The number of cases has largely flatlined in the last week. After weeks of rising cases, the number seems to have stayed stable at around 110 over the last week. Big caveats here that there might be cases we don't know about, and the count could change at any moment.

3. Shanghai has found some success limiting new cases. A lot of the cases started around Shanghai, but the city was able to reduce the number of new infections after it closed poultry markets, according to Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations covering health-care policy. The Wall Street Journal found the same thing.

Three bad signs:
---------------
1. It's spreading. With cases recently reported in Shandong province and now in Taiwan, the virus seems to be moving outward.

2. No verified human-to-human transmissions, but it's possible. Neither China nor the World Health Organization has documented human-to-human transmission, which would allow the virus to spread far more quickly and widely, but nor have they ruled it out. The Taiwanese case had no known exposure to poultry.

3. Tough to identify birds with the virus. World Health Organization officials say the virus is more difficult to detect in sick poultry than were previous strains because the birds do not show symptoms that are as clearly identifiable. This makes it tougher to keep sick birds off the market.

Three very bad signs:
--------------------
1. It's very deadly, with 18 percent mortality so far. For comparison, tuberculosis has a mortality rate of about 4 or 5 percent in China. Still, the avian flu virus that had its first outbreaks in China in 2006, known as H5N1, has a mortality rate of 60 percent and has killed hundreds of people on multiple continents. It's way too early to tell H7N9′s mortality rate, given that many infected patients have not yet fully recovered, but it's so far killed about 18 percent of patients.

2. "This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far." That's according to Keiji Fukuda, the World Health Organization's assistant director general for health, security and the environment, who added, "This is an unusually dangerous virus for humans." Fukuda said the WHO is still struggling to understand the disease, but he certainly seems to be sounding the alarm.

3. More easily transmitted than the 2006 avian flu outbreak. That's alsoaccording to the WHO's Fukuda, who says this new strain is more easily contracted than the H5N1 virus.

Isolation and characterization of H7N9 viruses from live poultry markets -- Implications
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(By JianZhong Shi et al.)

Abstract
--------
On 31 Mar 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced that human infections with a previously undescribed influenza A (H7N9) virus had occurred in Shanghai and Anhui Province, China. To investigate the possible origins of the H7N9 viruses causing these human infections, we collected 970 samples, including drinking water, soil, and cloacal and tracheal swabs of poultry from live poultry markets and poultry farms in Shanghai and Anhui Province. Twenty samples were positive for the H7N9 influenza virus. Notably, all 20 viruses were isolated from samples collected from live poultry markets in Shanghai. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the six internal genes of these novel human H7N9 viruses were derived from avian H9N2 viruses, but the ancestor of their HA and NA genes is uncertain. When we examined the phylogenetic relationship between the H7N9 isolates from live poultry markets and the viruses that caused the human infections, we found that they shared high homology across all eight ge segments. We thus identified the direct avian origin of the H7N9 influenza viruses that caused the human infections. Importantly, we observed that the H7N9 viruses isolated from humans had acquired critical mutations that made them more "human-like". It is therefore imperative to take strong measures to control the spread of H7N9 viruses in birds and humans to prevent further threats to human health.

Discussion
----------
We showed that similar H7N9 viruses were simultaneously prevalent in chickens, pigeons, and the environment in the live poultry markets of Shanghai when human infections occurred in Shanghai and Anhui Province, China. H7N9 viruses were only isolated from live poultry markets and not from poultry farms, indicating that the former might be the origin of the emergence of the novel H7N9 viruses. Live poultry markets could bring together a number of bird and poultry species from different sources in a high-density setting, thus providing an ideal environment for reassortment among avian influenza viruses of different subtypes.

The novel H7N9 viruses in the present study derived their 6 internal genes from the avian H9N2 viruses. Their HA genes are most closely related to duck H7N3 viruses isolated from Zhejiang Province in 2011, but share only approx. 95 percent homology. Due to this limited similarity, the origin of the HA gene of the novel H7N9 viruses remains unclear.

With respect to the NA gene, several H4N9 and H11N9 viruses obtained from duck or duck farm environmental samples during our active surveillance in Dongting Lake, China, showed considerable similarity to the NA gene of the novel H7N9 viruses. However, whether these Dongting Lake avian influenza viruses are the direct ancestor of the NA gene of the novel H7N9 influenza viruses remains unclear.

The only certainty we have is that the novel H7N9 viruses are the product of gene reassortment with the 6 internal genes derived from one donor and the HA and NA genes from one or 2 other donors.

Several molecular signatures predicted to be associated with the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans were seen in these novel H7N9 viruses. The 226L mutation, a critical residue in the receptor-binding sites of the HA protein, was already present in the avian and environment H7N9 viruses, which may have facilitated infection and replication of the novel H7N9 viruses in humans. Importantly, the 3 human H7N9 viruses all acquired the 627K mutation in their PB2 protein during their replication in human hosts, which is in clear contrast with the avian and environmental H7N9 viruses. This suggests that the novel H7N9 viruses can adapt well to humans. In fact, the adaptability of the H7N9 viruses appears to be superior to that of the H5N1 influenza viruses, which seem to acquire PB2 627K less frequently than the novel H7N9 viruses.

In past decades, H7 avian influenza viruses have caused large outbreaks in domestic poultry worldwide, resulting in severe economic losses for the poultry industry. During circulation in poultry, H7 influenza viruses can be directly transmitted from poultry to humans and cause disease. One example is the highly pathogenic H7N7 influenza virus that was prevalent in domestic poultry in The Netherlands in 2003. This outbreak resulted in the direct transmission of H7N7 influenza viruses to at least 89 people, with symptoms of conjunctivitis or a mild influenza-like illness and one death [26]. Furthermore, the circulation of low pathogenic H7 influenza virus in poultry could result in the emergence of a highly pathogenic influenza virus via the acquisition of multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, which has occurred with H7N1 influenza viruses during outbreaks in chickens and turkeys in Italy. Currently, the novel H7N9 influenza viruses lack the multiple basic amino acids at the HA cavage site but are already considerably pathogenic to humans. It will be disastrous if these viruses acquire the multiple basic amino acids during their continued circulation in poultry and humans.

The novel features that the new H7N9 viruses possess, including: previously unidentified HA and NA composition; wide prevalence in avian hosts and the environment; an exceptional adaptive ability in humans; and the potential to acquire multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site and evolve into a highly pathogenic form, are a major cause for concern with respect to public health worldwide. Forceful measures, such as continued surveillance in avian and human hosts, control of animal movement, shutdown of live poultry markets and culling of poultry in affected areas must be taken during this initial stage of virus prevalence to prevent a possible pandemic. It is also imperative to evaluate the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these H7N9 viruses, and to develop effective vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat them and reduce, if not eliminate, their threat to human health.

[6] Comment on air pollution and distribution of cases
Date: Thu 25 Apr 2013
From: Louis Murphy <lmurphy@nshcorp.org>


As there are no reports as of yet from any but the eastern provinces, has it been considered that other regions have indeed experienced the virus, but not with the same level of impact. The eastern provinces' extensive air pollution could be a contributing factor for patients by compromising their respiratory health before being exposed to the virus. Patients in other regions presenting with less serious symptoms could possibly be misdiagnosed as a seasonal influenza or other respiratory infection.
