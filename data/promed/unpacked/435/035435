Jenny Guerra, Regional Director of the Veraguas Ministry of Health confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Sona district.

Guerra said that the patient is a resident of the Trinchera community, but some 15 days earlier had been in the Pacora area, where investigations have been initiated by the Epidemiology Department.

The physician stated that in the province, 4 hantavirus [infections] have been reported with the death of one patient.

She insisted that residents must maintain sanitary measures in their houses and establishments, especially those places where grain is stored [to avoid rodents coming in].

[Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for this case is Choclo virus, as mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935. Of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
