ProMED-mail asked if the Department of Defense (DoD) could make a more
declarative statement regarding squalene in anthrax vaccine, especially in
relation to the Persian Gulf War. I gladly submit the following:
There is no squalene in any anthrax vaccine. There never was any squalene
in any anthrax vaccine. There never will be any squalene in any anthrax
vaccine, certainly not any used by the Defense Department. DoD has publicly
stated the same thing at its anthrax website <http://www.anthrax.osd.mil>
for well over a year, and at multiple other public fora.
Nobody (not Michigan Department of Public Health, not BioPort, not DoD)
tinkered with the formulation of anthrax vaccine beyond the recipe agreed
to by FDA. FDA gives no hint of suspecting the presence of squalene in
anthrax vaccine. The General Accounting Office (GAO) itself concluded in
1999 that there was no evidence of squalene in the vaccine. The recent
article by Drs. Asa, Cao and Garry in "Experimental and Molecular
Pathology" notes: "It is important to note that our laboratory-based
investigations do not establish that squalene was added as adjuvant to any
vaccine used in military or other personnel who served in the Persian Gulf
War era."
DoD contracted with SRI of Menlo Park, California, to develop an assay for
squalene (high-pressure liquid chromatography, if I remember correctly).
The limit of detection of this test is 70 nanograms per 0.5 ml, less than
the quantity of squalene in the natural oils in a human fingerprint. Their
reports finding no squalene in 14 of 14 lots appear at the DoD website. The
technical report on their procedure is nearing completion, at which point
the authors will seek publication in an appropriate journal.
Squalene is included in an influenza vaccine licensed in multiple countries
in Europe and presumably used widely there.

When we discuss squalene are we talking about the below, and if so are we
suggesting something may have triggered an autoimmune condition against self.

SQUALENE
DESCRIPTION : Squalene is a refined unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon found
in the liver oil of Aizame sharks which live in the cold waters of the
Western Pacific. The human body also contains 5 to 8 % of this substance in
human sebum which helps to keep the skin moist and free of dryness.
Squalene is also found in small quantities in olive oil, wheat germ oil,
rice bran oil, and yeast.
BIOCHEMISTRY: Squalene has the molecular formula of C30H50 with six double
bonds and belongs to the triterpenes. Squalene is an intermediate in the
biosynthesis of cholesterol. Squalene permeates into the skin at a rate of
2 mm/second.
PHYSIOLOGY: Squalene is produced by the human liver. Insufficient squalene
normally produced and secreted in sebum leads to rough skin, which is
susceptible to aging and dryness. Squalene has also been shown to help
wound healing, to enhance the immune system and to strengthen the
resistance to cancer. In addition squalene has the bactericidal effects
common to terpenes.
INDICATIONS: Squalene is used in cosmetic preparations to soften the skin,
to reduce small facial wrinkles, and as a bactericidal agent. A few drops
of squalene applied to the skin will keep the skin moist and wrinkle free.
Squalene has also been used to speed wound healing.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Apply a few drops daily to the skin or to affected
areas or take one 500 mg capsule daily.
TOXICITY, CAUTIONS & CONTRAINDICATIONS: No known toxicity

[While there are those who will reject it sight unseen, the military
anthrax vaccine website has an extended review, with numerous links, on
squalene. It is worth reading. <http://www.anthrax.osd.mil./> Click on the
