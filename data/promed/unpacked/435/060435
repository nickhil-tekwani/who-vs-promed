The Provincial Ministry of Health confirmed that the outbreak of
canine visceral leishmaniasis in Corrientes has affected more than 100
animals. The most recent cases of infected dogs were found in San
Martin community, where fumigation operations were carried out
yesterday [24 Sep 2011].

According to the registry of the Ministry of health, 101 dogs had been
reported as infected so far this year [2011]. Yesterday [24 Sep 2011],
a team of sanitation technicians and agents fumigated in San Martin
community households, specifically in Perugorria St., between
Gobernador Castillo and Guastavino streets. During this week,
interventions were performed in other affected communities, such as
Arazaty and Pio X; households were fumigated and persons were informed
in order to raise their awareness with respect to this condition.

Nearly 80 households had been fumigated in the past few days, aiming
to eliminate _Phelbotomus_ spp, the vector agent for this disease.

[The phlebotomine sandflies, _Phlebotomus_ spp (Old World sandflies)
and _Lutzomyia_ spp (New World sandflies), are members of the family
Psychodidae. These flies are confined primarily to the tropical and
subtropical regions of the world. Members of these genera are tiny,
moth-like flies, about 1.5-4 mm long. The legs are as long as the
antennae, comprising 16 segments that often have a beaded, hairy
appearance. They are commonly known as sandflies, moth flies, or owl
midges. The key morphologic feature for identification is that the
body of the sandfly is covered with fine hairs. The females have
piercing mouthparts and feed on blood of a variety of warm-blooded
animals, including humans. Many species feed on reptiles. Male
sandflies suck moisture from any available source and are even said to
suck perspiration from people. Sandflies tend to be active only at
night and, in contrast to black flies, are weak fliers; their flying
is deterred by air currents, even slight ones. During the day,
sandflies seek protection in crevices and caves, among vegetation, and
within dark buildings. They often seek protection within rodent and
armadillo burrows; these mammals can serve as reservoir hosts.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic, severe, protozoal disease of
humans, dogs, and certain rodents, characterized by cutaneous or
mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, anemia, lameness,
renal failure, and occasionally epistaxis or ocular lesions.

Canine leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease, and dogs act as a
reservoir of the parasite for humans where there is a competent
vector.

The incubation period is quite variable, ranging from 3 months to
several years. The clinical features vary widely; main clinical
presentations are skin lesions, loss of weight or poor appetite, local
or generalized lymphadenopathy, ocular lesions, renal failure,
epistaxis, lameness, and anemia. Occasionally, some dogs have chronic
diarrhea or liver failure. The most common cutaneous lesions are
alopecia with severe dry desquamation, usually beginning on the head
and extending to the rest of the body. Other animals develop chronic
ulceration, located particularly on the head and limbs. The signs
invariably show a slow, progressive evolution.

The results of blood and urine tests also vary greatly. Most animals
have a polyclonal hyperproteinemia. Non regenerative anemia is present
in 50 percent of dogs. Some animals show leukopenia, whereas others
have leukocytosis. In animals with renal lesions, it is also usual to
find increased plasma urea and creatinine, proteinuria, and
hematuria.

The most reliable diagnostic test for canine leishmaniasis is direct
observation of the parasite in bone marrow or lymph node smears. The
amastigotes appear as oval basophilic bodies (4 micrometer) in the
cytoplasm of macrophages. However, it is sometimes impossible to
detect the parasite in infected animals, especially in lymph node
smears. Serologic methods are useful in diagnosis; indirect
immunofluorescence and ELISA are widely used. The results of a
serologic test should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical
picture. Although these tests are reliable, a few infected dogs remain
seronegative, and there are also seropositive dogs that never develop
the disease.

For treatment, the drugs of choice are the pentavalent antimony
derivatives, particularly N-methylglucamine antimoniate (80-100
mg/kg/day, IM (intramuscular) or SC (subcutaneous) [not approved for
use in dogs in the USA]) and sodium stibogluconate (75 mg/kg, SC, bid
[available only from the CDC in the USA]). During the 1st month, the
dog is treated with either drug and allopurinol (20 mg/kg, PO
(orally), sid (once a day); during the next 5 months, the dog is
treated with only allopurinol, which is less expensive and less
toxic.

Amphotericin B given IV (intravenously, 0.5-0.8 mg/kg, diluted in
10-60 mL of 5 percent dextrose given over 45 seconds every 48 hours to
reach a total cumulative dose of 8-15 mg/kg) or SC 2-3 times/week
(0.5-0.8 mg/kg added to 500 mL of 0.45 percent saline and 2.5 percent
dextrose for a total cumulative dosage of 8-26 mg/kg) has also been
effective.

Relapses after treatment are common with either protocol. In endemic
areas, rapid treatment of infected dogs, control of stray and homeless
dogs, and action against the insect vectors are recommended methods of
control.

Controlling the sandfly is important. Insecticide spraying of larval
habitat is usually not possible because of the difficulty of accessing
their breeding sites. Removal of dense vegetation discourages
breeding. Spraying of residual insecticides on surfaces in the home is
the main way to control sandflies; however, this is ineffective for
species that bite away from the home. Generally speaking, populations
of sandflies have been reduced as a result of intense mosquito control
programs.

It is probable this disease is on the move, northward, and the
significance of canine involvement may keep the zoonotic cycle going
longer than had been hoped.
