There have been 950 confirmed cases of hepatitis A across Europe since 29 Sep 2017, warned the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). 22 countries have been affected by the outbreak, including England, Wales, France, Germany, and Italy.

Since the outbreak started in June 2016, 3813 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed. March 2017 had the highest number of reported cases so far, with 507, ECDC said. The viral infection was mainly affecting "men that have sex with men" [MSM], added the European health watchdog. "As of 18 Dec 2017, the monthly number of laboratory-confirmed cases remain significantly higher than in previous years," said ECDC. "Although decreasing in its intensity, the outbreak is still ongoing. More cases associated with this event are to be expected in EU/European Economic Area countries in the coming months."

In September [2017], ECDC reported 9 times as many men were infected by hepatitis A than women. But, over the past 3 months, only 6 times as many men were infected. "A considerable increase in the total number of hepatitis A cases in women has also been observed, with outbreak strains circulating in this group, too," it said.

The infection can be spread to other people by eating food prepared by someone who has the condition, and hasn't washed their hands properly, the NHS warned. Eating raw shellfish, drinking contaminated water, or having sex with someone who has the infection also increases the risk of infection.

Hepatitis A patients are most at risk from infection around 2 weeks before their symptoms appear. The symptoms usually pass within a couple of months.

In November 2017, 180 people at a Wales school were offered the hepatitis A vaccination, after a student was diagnosed with the infection. 7 people in the student's family were confirmed to have the condition.

[Although this ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A has primarily involved men who have sex with men, it seems that there is increased spillover into women. Potential reasons for this include household transmission and spread via infected food handlers.
