Preliminary report: outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the cities
of Ulm and Neu-Ulm in Germany, December 2009 - January 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rapid communications: H von Baum, G Haerter, A Essig, et al]

Currently an investigation is ongoing to explore and control an
outbreak of Legionnaires' disease affecting 65 people as of 22 Jan
2010, in the cities of Ulm and Neu-Ulm, southwest Germany. A hitherto
unidentified wet cooling system in these twin cities is considered as
the most likely source of infection.

On 5 Jan 2010, Ulm University Hospital informed the local health
office of a cluster of hospitalisations due to community-acquired
pneumonia caused by _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup (sg) 1. As of
Fri 22 Jan 2010, 65 cases including 5 deaths were under investigation
by the local and regional health authorities. With only a few
exceptions all cases were living or working in Ulm or Neu-Ulm in
southwest Germany. All cases are German residents aged between 27 and
96 years (median age 67 years).

The majority of patients identified as of 22 Jan 2010 had to be
hospitalised, n=61. All patients and, if the clinical condition of
the patient made an interview impossible, their family members, were
interviewed using a standardised questionnaire to investigate
potential sources of exposition, personal risk factors and the onset
of symptoms. For 40 cases the onset of symptoms was during the last
week of December 2009. All but 2 patients who were admitted to our
hospital had underlying diseases.

Clinical findings
-----------------
In 41 of the patients who had been admitted to the University
Hospital the following clinical symptoms were observed: fever in 35
of 41 patients, cough in 30 of 41 patients, abdominal pain and/or
diarrhea in 11 of 41 patients, and symptoms relating to the central
nervous system (confusion, somnolence or loss of consciousness,
fainting) in 27 of 41 patients. In all patients' chest radiographs
showed an infiltrate. All patients were treated with standard
antibiotic treatment consisting of a macrolide (clarithromycin), or
preferably a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) for at least 14 days (1).
4 patients required mechanical ventilation. 4 patients, 2 of whom had
received mechanical ventilation and who had been treated in the
University Hospital, died between several hours and 8 days after
admission. The other patients responded well to treatment and the
majority recovered promptly. The median length of hospital stay of
the patients who were discharged as of 22 Jan 2010 was 9.9 days
(range 4-16 days).

Laboratory investigations
-------------------------
For the investigation of the outbreak, the case definitions of the
European Working Group on _Legionella_ Infection were applied (2).

Results
-------
All patients with a microbiological workup in our laboratory had a
positive urinary antigen test. PCR for _L. pneumophila_ was positive
in the respiratory material of 10 patients. Four clinical isolates
belonging to sg1 were further subtyped by using monoclonal antibodies
(MAb). All these isolates were identified as monoclonal subtype
Knoxville (carrying the virulence associated epitope recognised by
MAb 3-1 monoclonal antibody) (3). Molecular identification of
cultured legionellae was achieved by 16S rRNA gene sequencing that
showed a 99 percent homology to _L. pneumophila_ in 3 isolates. So
far, one isolate was genotyped and belongs to sequence type (ST) 62 (4).

Epidemiological investigations and findings
-------------------------------------------
Epidemiological and environmental investigations are coordinated by
the local authorities in Ulm and Neu-Ulm, with support of the state
health offices in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria. Investigations are
in progress to identify the potential source of this outbreak by
comparing environmental isolates from the patients' [homes] and wet
cooling systems from the areas of both cities with the clinical
[isolates]. According to the patient interviews, the cases had no
common exposure to water supplies in public buildings, hotels, sport
facilities, or similar sources. Only living in, working in, or
visiting Ulm or Neu-Ulm appeared as a common characteristic of the
affected persons. Further epidemiological investigations are planned.

Conclusions
-----------
This is the largest community-associated outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease recognised in Germany so far. In dealing with the event
several important steps in outbreak detection and management were
confirmed: the importance of a rapid clinical diagnosis and thorough
microbiological confirmation and the immediate involvement of the
health authorities. The latter is necessary to initiate
investigations to detect the source of the outbreak, to raise
awareness of the problem in the community and to optimise
communication of all involved parties. Furthermore we realised that
an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease most likely related to wet
cooling systems is not restricted to the warm seasons.

Hospitals, general practitioners and the public have been informed of
the situation by the local authorities on a regular basis, starting
on 5 Jan 2010. As of 23 Jan 2010, health authorities have no
indication that persons from other countries have been affected. The
last clinical case was hospitalised on 13 Jan 2010. We would be
grateful for any reports of cases from other countries that could
potentially be linked to this outbreak.

[Legionnaire's disease is the acute pneumonic form of infection
caused by Gram-negative bacilli of the genus _Legionella_, which are
environmental microorganisms found in soil and water. About 80-90
percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immuno-suppression.
Pediatric cases of Legionnaires' disease are uncommon.

Usually a building's water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are embedded in a biofilm
that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and
containers. Concentrations of the organism in the water can be
increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols can
be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems, shower
heads, whirlpool spas, grocery store mist machines, decorative
fountains, respiratory therapy equipment, or industrial plants.

Some industrial plants, which can disseminate large volumes of
potentially contaminated water aerosols over long distances, could be
involved in community-wide outbreaks (see
