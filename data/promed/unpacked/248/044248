Rabies, raccoons - USA (Connecticut) 981126012544

From: Dardick, Kenneth <kdardick@wcmh.org>

With all due respect to Dr. Cumming's observations ("...Rabies is a new
thing up this way as of late...") - the rabies epizootic has been
well-described here in Connecticut and particularly in Northeastern
Connecticut since at least March 1991 (see MMWR 4/22/94, V43 No 15). It was
the re-introduction of wild raccoon rabies into Connecticut which prompted
the legislature to pass the law mandating rabies vaccination for all cats
(PA 91-46, 1991).
The raccoon die-off described from 3 years ago, was actually the second
wave of deaths among raccoons in this area as rabies-naive animals who were
not living in 1991-1993 matured and were infected and died. We can expect
similar waves every 3-5 years. It is critical from a public health
perspective to continue to teach rabies-awareness in our schools - this is
as important for the curriculum as sex education and proper nutrition!
Children and adults must be taught the critical importance of avoiding
contact with all wild animals and domestic animals which are not known to
be vaccinated. The "Disney syndrome" of petting cute wild critters must be
shown to be reckless and dangerous behavior.

[An additional reason for not petting wild animals is that it is very
stressful for them. Unless hand-reared they do not enjoy the experience and
are severely threatened by it. Adult animals will do a lot of damage to
naive humans if the latter insist on coming too close. - Mod.MHJ

An account of another highly inadvisable action (although kindly meant)
taken by some maintenance workers at a large company in Maryland a few
years ago ......
At a large chemical research company here, located on some several-acre
grassy campus surrounded by woods, some maintenance workers who
'brown-bagged' lunch, took to feeding leftover morsels to a couple of
raccoons. They were apparently enchanted by the fact that the raccoons
walked right up to them in broad daylight and would feed from the workers'
hands. They did not stop to think (as was later confirmed) that the
raccoons were acting highly out of the norm and were, indeed, rabid.

[We had a similar occasion here in east Baton Rouge two summers ago when a
lonely old lady was regularly feeding a bunch of feral cats and
free-loading raccoons. One of the latter was diagnosed with rabies. But

A comment is needed regarding the statement by Mod.MHJ "Any wild raccoon in
a public place in daylight is virtually pathognomonic for a very suspect
rabies case".
On Sanibel Island in Florida our raccoons are considered "tidal". Their
normal behavior is to forage for food during low tide whether that be
during the day or night. At 'Care and Rehabilitation For Wildlife' we spend
many hours each week reassuring our island visitors from northern states
that the raccoons passing through their yards during the day are not rabid
but simply hungry.
