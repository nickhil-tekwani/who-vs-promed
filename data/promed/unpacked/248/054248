Mandera county has reported an outbreak of measles after 140 children were infected with the disease.

The county department of health on [Sun 11 Dec 2022] launched a Measles-Rubella Vaccination Campaign even as the outbreak was reported across at least 2 sub-counties.

The 10-day campaign, which will be conducted across 6 counties of Mandera East, Mandera South, Mandera North, Mandera West, Banisa and Lafey targets to vaccinate 155 000 children aged between 9 months -- 5 years.

Speaking at Mandera County Referral Hospital during the launch, Public health director Issack Adan urged parents and guardians to ensure that their children receive the vaccine.

"I would like to advise all parents and guardians to ensure that their children take the vaccines as they will be brought to their doorsteps and public gatherings", he said. "The department will make sure all children in the county below 5 years get the vaccines by [19 Dec 2022] as we have sent our officers to all the villages across Mandera", he added.

Measles is a viral infection that's serious for small children but is easily preventable by a vaccine. The disease spreads through the air by respiratory droplets produced from coughing or sneezing.

"The disease can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surfaces, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected", stated Mr. Adan.

Central location senior chief Alinur Mohamed has encouraged the general public to adhere to the public health regulations to avert the spread of the disease. "We would like members of the public to maintain cleanliness and keep distance from those affected by the disease as guided by the ministry of health", he said

The vaccination exercise will end on [19 Dec 2022].

South Sudan on Sunday [11 Dec 2022] declared an outbreak of measles following a constant rise in the number of confirmed cases over the last 38 epidemiological weeks.

John Rumunu, director general for Preventive Health Services in the Ministry of Health, said 31 deaths and 2471 measles cases have been reported in 22 counties across the country.

"Based on the number of laboratory-confirmed measles cases across the country, the national ministry of health hereby declares a measles outbreak in South Sudan," Rumunu told journalists in South Sudan's capital Juba.

He said South Sudan has witnessed repeated outbreaks of measles since 2021 primarily due to the interrupted routine immunization services and inadequate implementation of supplementary immunization activities.

"The last national measles immunization campaign was conducted in 2020 with vaccination coverage of less than 85% which is below the 95% recommended target," he said.

Rumunu said they will conduct an immediate epidemiological investigation to determine the extent of disease transmission, strengthen routine immunization services across the country, conduct measles immunization campaigns, and manage complications arising from the disease.

Measles has made an unwelcome global resurgence from Ohio to Indonesia with cases rising around the world, and the worst of it is happening across India.

Health workers in the country that's home to 1.4 billion people are rushing to contain the world's biggest outbreak of measles, which presents itself through a distinctive dotted rash, coughing and a fever that can be deadly for children under the age of 5. More than 11 000 cases were registered in India between April and October this year [2022], the most globally, according to the latest World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

After India's health system was devastated last year by a brutal coronavirus wave, the country's authorities appear to have been taken off guard again by the return of another highly contagious virus in some of its most congested cities like Mumbai, the country's financial capital.

Though easily preventable through routine MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations, a 95% coverage rate is needed to halt community spread. The outbreaks appear largely due to delayed childhood inoculation campaigns caused by COVID-19 lockdowns. Almost 40 million kids across the world missed a measles shot last year [2021], according to a report published last month by the WHO and the US CDC.

In India alone, 2.5 million infants didn't receive their first dose. That figure was topped only by Nigeria, where 3.1 million children were left out of immunization coverage.

For some public health experts this latest outbreak has something of a retrograde nature, just like with recent flareups of polio. "So surreal to see this in 2022," Madhukar Pai, an epidemiologist at McGill University in Montreal, said on Twitter earlier this month. "In the 90s, during residency training in India, I hardly saw measles, thanks to vaccination."

India's central and state health ministries have been trying to stamp out the outbreak. In a repeat of tactics used during the COVID-19 pandemic, the southern state of Kerala is roping in religious leaders to urge their communities to get their children vaccinated.

It's a race against time, as measles isn't the only deadly disease likely to reassert itself following the largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in about 3 decades, the WHO and United Nations Children's Fund warned in July [2022]. At least 25 million kids didn't receive at least one vaccine dose against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in 2021.

"This is a red alert for child health," UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said at the time. "The consequences will be measured in lives."

[A 4-year-old girl died in Mumbai on Monday [12 Dec 2022] after contracting measles, taking the city's official death toll from the highly infectious disease to 16. According to a statement issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the girl had an acute respiratory failure due to bronchopneumonia with measles.

According to sources, 67 new patients with measles were admitted to city hospitals on Monday [12 Dec 2022] while 55 were discharged on recovery. According to official records, the city reported 25 cases of measles in 2020 and 9 in 2021.

"Reported measles cases are increasing. Mumbai-East is a high-risk area. A few other parts of Mumbai have also reported an increasing number of cases. A total of 22 outbreaks and nine deaths have been reported (in Mumbai)," BMC's executive health officer told ANI earlier.

The Columbus measles outbreak rose to 73 total cases [Mon 12 Dec 2022].

Columbus Public Health officials said 26 people have been hospitalized but no deaths have been reported. Approximately 70% of the cases are in ages 1--5.

Columbus Public Health said 67 of the cases are in those unvaccinated with the remaining cases involving partially vaccinated children or those whose vaccination status is unknown.

"As we continue to see community spread of measles among unvaccinated children, I urge everyone to make sure you are up to date on your vaccines to prevent serious illness and further spread," Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.

The chances of infection are 9 out of 10 people if unvaccinated, CPH said.
