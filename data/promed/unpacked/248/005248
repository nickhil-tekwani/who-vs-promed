[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), is an acute contagious disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. It affects mainly sheep and goats and occasionally wild small ruminants. Based on the fact that PPR has been reported on a few occasions in camels, cattle and buffaloes, those animal species are considered to be susceptible although their potential role in the circulation of PPR virus (PPRV) has not been formally established.

PPR occurs in Africa except Southern Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, throughout most of the Near East and Middle East, and in Central and South-East Asia. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.10_PPR.pdf

The following comment by Mod.AS, published in posting 20170111.4757542, is applicable here:

"PPR appeared 1st in northern Israel in January 1993 (notification in OIE's Bulletin of 29 January 1993, Vol. 6 - No. 3). The route of introduction (most likely, from Lebanon) has not been established. Since then, the disease has become endemic and controlled mainly by mass vaccinations.

"On [1 Jul 2016], Israel's State veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) published the discontinuation of compulsory, State organized PPR vaccinations, declaring further vaccinations as privatized and voluntary". - Mod.CRD
