Multistate Outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 Infections Linked to Romaine Lettuce
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information collected to date indicates that romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Arizona growing region could be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 and could make people sick. At this time, no common grower, supplier, distributor, or brand has been identified.

Advice to Consumers:
Do not buy or eat romaine lettuce at a grocery store or restaurant unless you can confirm it is not from the Yuma, Arizona, growing region.
Unless the source of the product is known, consumers anywhere in the USA who have any store-bought romaine lettuce at home should not eat it and should throw it away, even if some of it was eaten and no one has gotten sick. Product labels often do not identify growing regions; so, throw out any romaine lettuce if you're uncertain about where it was grown. This includes whole heads and hearts of romaine, chopped romaine, and salads and salad mixes containing romaine lettuce. If you do not know if the lettuce is romaine, do not eat it and throw it away.

Advice to Restaurants and Retailers:
Restaurants and retailers should not serve or sell any romaine lettuce from the Yuma, Arizona growing region. This includes whole heads and hearts of romaine, chopped romaine, and salads and salad mixes containing romaine lettuce.
Restaurants and retailers should ask their suppliers about the source of their romaine lettuce.

A nationwide outbreak of _E. coli_, tracked to romaine lettuce from Arizona, has sickened its 1st Alaska victims - all 8 of them at the state prison in Nome. Dr. Joe McLaughlin, with the Epidemiology Section at the state Department of Health and Social Services, said health officials had responded last week [week of Sun 8 Apr 2018] to an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria at the Anvil Mountain Correctional Center in Nome.

None of the 8 patients have died or been hospitalized, in cases which were noticed between [Thu 5 and Sun 15 Apr 2018]. All ate "significantly higher" numbers of salads than other people at Anvil Mountain, however, and have shown the same symptoms. "Bloody diarrhea is one of the symptoms that people most commonly presented with, along with abdominal cramping, nausea and vomiting," McLaughlin said.

Although no other Alaska cases have been reported, the outbreak is believed to be part of a larger one affecting at least 53 persons across 16 states. McLaughlin said the cause is believed to be romaine lettuce grown in Yuma, AZ., which produces much of the nation's romaine crop during the winter before spring romaine growing moves to Salinas, CA.

The CDC as well as the FDA are closely examining the epidemic, which may have widened in scope slightly due to the Alaska cases. "Our outbreak is the 1st one I know of nationally that's been associated with the consumption of whole heads of lettuce rather than chopped lettuce," McLaughlin said. "What this outbreak suggests is that the source of the contamination may actually be at the farm rather than the lettuce processing center."

The Associated Press reported that the CDC had expanded a warning about chopped romaine to whole romaine heads as well, based on information from the Alaska outbreak.

Jeremy Ayers, a program manager with the Department of Environmental Conservation's Food Safety and Sanitation program, said no other DOC facilities have seen any signs of contamination. "As far as we're aware they only get it as whole heads of lettuce," Ayers said. "A lot of the lettuce will come to Alaska as whole heads; it will last longer and have a longer shelf life."

DOC uses a dedicated lettuce provider, Ayers said, and authorities were quickly able to track it back to a potential source being confirmed by the FDA. Romaine lettuce from Yuma has been removed from state prisons' food chains. In addition, McLaughlin said, staff and inmates at the prison are paying greater attention to hand hygiene.

Although DEC isn't aware of any other recent _E. coli_ cases in Alaska, McLaughlin said, it isn't clear whether that was because none had occurred or none have yet been reported. In the meantime, authorities are recommending that people discard any romaine lettuce if they're not sure whether it came from Yuma, out of what McLaughlin called "an abundance of caution." Any preparation or storage areas for supplies of romaine should also be cleaned.

According to Ayers, some retailers like Fred Meyer have proactively removed romaine supplies from their shelves until they can find sources that aren't in Yuma. The CDC and the FDA are continuing to use the information from Alaska's cases to help isolate and end the outbreak.
"They'll use our traceback information and they'll use other states' traceback information to try and put the whole puzzle together," Ayers said.
