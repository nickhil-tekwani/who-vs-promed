"Migratory wild birds, especially waterfowl, are the natural host and reservoir of avian influenza viruses."

"The main wild species involved in the viral cycle of avian influenza are waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seems to pass easily between different bird species. Direct exposure of farmed birds to wild birds is a likely transmission route of the virus. Therefore, it is critical to limit their exposure to wild birds to lessen the risk of introduction of avian influenza into flocks."

"The transmission of avian influenza from birds to humans is usually sporadic and happens in a specific context. People who are in close and repeated contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments are at risk for acquiring avian influenza."
