[Curioser and curioser, as Alice (in Wonderland) said. How do you disinfect
110 hectares? I suspect a translation problem here; they must mean spraying
the countryside against ticks. Russian biologists have a theory of natural
foci of zoonotic disease [infections with animal reservoirs, which they
call "nidi." The area is a classic focus of CCHF, so it would be logical to
attack ticks there. My old friend & colleague, Dmitry Lvov, where are you?
I´m sure you could tell us what is happening down there.
Improving the sanitary conditions in the town will be good for the public´s
health but do nothing against CCHF, which is spread by the ticks on
migratory birds - Mod.JW
