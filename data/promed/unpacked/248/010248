I would call the reader's attention to a couple of additional points
regarding the graph from Gideon of measles in Africa [see: Measles -
Cameroon (02): (EN) 20090117.0191].

The countries are in Central, not Western Africa. Cameroon is part of the
Central African block of nations, at least in terms of the WHO African
Regional Office and several economic and financial treaties [A political
map of the countries of Africa is available at:
<http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/africa_map.htm>. - Mod.CP].

Declines to near zero can be observed for most countries in the period
after 2004, after the countries held nationwide measles vaccination
campaigns targeting children less than 15 years of age. Nigeria, Niger,
Chad, and Cameroon have all held such vaccination campaigns.

However, officials in those countries have noted that the widespread
population movements that traditionally occur in the region are associated
with measles outbreaks. See: Wiysonge CS, Mawo JN, Ticha JM, Nomo E, Shey
MS. Migration and measles. Int J Epidemiol 2005; 34(6): 1443-4.

A review of case numbers reported to WHO from 2000-2008 and population
estimates from the (US) Census Bureau for Cameroon show that incidence has
dropped from around 100 per 100 000 population before 2002 to around one
per 100 000 since 2006. Comparing these 2 years is a bit tricky, as the
country shifted from a clinical case definition in 2000 to one requiring
laboratory confirmation of all cases.

However, other reports looking at the trend in clinical cases show a sharp
reduction in incidence over this period.

See: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Effects of
measles-control activities--African region, 1999-2005. MMWR Morb Mortal
Wkly Rep 2006 Sep 22; 55(37): 1017-21.

Table of incidence of measles in Cameroon:

Year / Cases / Population / Estimated incidence per 100 000
2000 / 14629 / 15 421 937 / 94.9
2001 / 23934 / 15 803 220 / 151.5
2002 / 1448 / 16 184 748 / 8.9
2003 / 899 / 15 746 179 / 5.7
2004 / 358 / 16 380 005 / 2.2
2005 / 605 / 16 988 132 / 3.6
2006 / 196 / 17 340 702 / 1.1
2007 / 100 / 18 060 382 / 0.6
