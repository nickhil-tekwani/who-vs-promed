A teenager tested positive for the dreaded Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Karachi and admitted to an isolation ward at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on Monday, health officials said.

"A young man of 18-19 years of age had been brought to the JPMC yesterday [Sun 10 Jun 2018] with a high grade fever, rashes, bleeding from nose and mouth and on suspicion we got him tested for CCHF. The lab report confirmed that he is infected with the [Crimean-Congo hem. fever] virus," said Executive Director JPMC Dr. Seemin Jamali while talking to The News.

The patient, M.A., is a resident of Korangi Industrial Area and works at a tannery where labourers deal with hides of cattle, and sometimes they contract the viral disease which is spread through a tick found on the skin of cattle.

Dr. Jamali said this was the 3rd CCHF patient of the year [2018] who was brought to the JPMC in a critical condition, adding that the condition of 2 previous patients had improved and they were discharged from the hospital.

The CCHF is caused by the Congo virus, which is found on a tick that attaches itself to the skin of cattle. People who come into contact with these infected ticks or animals can contract the viral disease, which is highly contagious disease and has a 40-50 per cent mortality rate.

So far this year [2018], 2 persons, including a resident of Lyari, Karachi, and a woman from Mianwali have died due to the Congo viral infection in Karachi and Islamabad respectively, health officials said.

[This report mentions a young patient who is a resident of Karachi and works in a tannery, and the 4th confirmed case of CCHF (Punjab: 01-fatal), Sindh/Baluchistan: 03/01 fatal) in 2018. There is definite history of exposure to animal hides that may have ticks or blood/fluids containing the viral pathogen. All the more need to reach out to the high risk groups with advice on appropriate protective measures. - Mod.UBA
