A virulent strain of flu has swept northern China in the last seven days
with hospitals and clinics in Beijing and other cities packed with
sufferers complaining of high fevers and breathing difficulties. The
Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital reported four-fold increases of patients
as the particularly vicious A-type virus, identified by doctors as H3N2,
has China's northern population in its grip.
"However, compared with the B type, H3N2 can be much more harmful," said
Guo Yuanji, director of China's National Influenza Centre (NIC), while also
predicting that the week long outbreak may last ten more days.
Guo and his colleagues are trying to find out if the H3N2 strain is a new
mutation, which happens frequently with the flu virus, making preventive
measures more difficult than usual.
"We've received epidemic reports from provinces in northeastern and
northwestern regions of China in the last few days, which are similar to
the situation here in Beijing," Guo added.
There is no easily available flu vaccine in China so far but Guo Yuanji
said that the NIC is working closely with the Lanzhou Biological Research
Institute in an attempt to develop the country's first flu vaccine, which
he hopes will prevent another epidemic next year.
