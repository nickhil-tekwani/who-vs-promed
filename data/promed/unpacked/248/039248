Bird flu (H5N1) virus has once again been seen in the capital. The deadly H5N1 strain was confirmed at a Gothathar-based farm.

The contagion was confirmed on Monday [1 Jul 2013] after an investigation of the layer chickens at the poultry farm. A sample from the chickens was sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory after they started dying last week. Experts have been sent to destroy the chickens.

According to District Veterinary Office chief Dr. Bolraj Acharya, out of the 2000 chickens on the farm, 600 have already been culled, and the rest are also being killed. Acharya further stated that the District Veterinary Office is working on more strategies to stop the epidemic.
