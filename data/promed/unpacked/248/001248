Norovirus illnesses linked to oysters
-------------------------------------
The US Food and Drug Administration is advising consumers to avoid
eating oysters harvested from the San Antonio Bay on or after 16 Nov
2009 due to reports of norovirus-associated illnesses in some people
who had consumed oysters harvested from this area, which is located
on the Gulf of Texas.

The FDA, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas,
are investigating about a dozen reports of norovirus-related
illnesses from South Carolina and North Carolina consumers who ate
oysters recently harvested from the San Antonio Bay. Consumers who
purchased oysters on or after 16 Nov 2009 that have a label showing
they came from San Antonio Bay are advised to dispose of the oysters
and not eat them. At restaurants, consumers can ask about the source
of oysters offered as menu items. Restaurant operators and retailers
should not serve or offer for sale oysters subject to this advisory.
Restaurant operators and retailers who are unsure of the source of
oysters on hand should check with their suppliers to determine where
the oysters were harvested. No other seafood is affected by this
advisory. The Texas Department of State Health Services has ordered a
recall of all oysters harvested from the San Antonio Bay between 16
and 25 Nov 2009.

Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause gastroenteritis.
Symptoms of illness associated with norovirus include nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramping. Affected individuals often
experience low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a
general sense of tiredness. Most people show symptoms within 48 hours
of exposure to the virus. The illness typically lasts 1 to 2 days.
Norovirus typically is not life threatening and does not generally
cause long-term effects.

Consumers who ate oyster products on or after 16 Nov 2009 and have
experienced symptoms of norovirus [infection] are encouraged to
contact their health care provider and local health department.

The implicated oyster beds in the San Antonio Bay were closed by the
Texas Department of Health Services on 26 Nov 2009, and remain
closed. The FDA and CDC will continue working with health officials
in the affected states to track any additional cases of norovirus
illness. Persons with weakened immune systems, including those
affected by AIDS, and persons with chronic alcohol abuse, liver,
stomach or blood disorders, cancer, diabetes or kidney disease should
avoid raw oyster consumption altogether, regardless of where the
oysters are harvested.

[Norovirus contamination of oyster beds is a worldwide hazard. In
general, consumption of raw oysters and other filter-feeding mollusks
should be avoided. Although noroviruses may be destroyed by cooking,
people handling oysters from contaminated oyster beds may be at risk
of infection by noroviruses and other sewage-related agents.
