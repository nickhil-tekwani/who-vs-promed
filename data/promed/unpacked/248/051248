[1 A criminal case has been brought against Veterinarian of settlement
Kereit in the anthrax outbreak in Southern Kazakhstan. The vet properly
identified and killed the cow which was affected but delayed 10 days in
getting the entrails of the sick cow to the veterinary laboratory for
analysis. During that time the owner's brother took the meat to the sausage
factory.
[2 Three people from the settlement Achisay came to the infectious disease
hospital of the city Kentau, apparently a continuation of the outbreak that
began a few weeks ago. The sick animal had a certificate saying it was
vaccinated this spring; either the vaccine was bad [ineffective or the
certificate was fictitious. Incidentally, another incident of a supposedly
vaccinated animal getting sick happened in the settlement Kerit [?Kereit
above in Tyul'kubasskiy district. Of the 29 people who have gotten anthrax
in the past 1-1/2 months, 13 remain in the region's hospitals.

[An informed independent source in Almaty informs me that human anthrax was
confirmed in 26 out of 200 patients who were under observation. Either way
it seems that the Kazakh veterinary authorities may have a vaccination
problem. -Mod.MHJ
