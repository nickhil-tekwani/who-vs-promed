Subject: N.meningitidis W135 disease in a haj contact

We would like to report one case of _Neisseria menigitidis_ serogroup W135
infection in a 55-year-old lady who presented with infected arthritis. Her
husband returned from haj two weeks ago. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135
was isolated from joint aspirate as well as from blood culture. Although
she did have headache and high grade fever there were no signs of meningitis.
