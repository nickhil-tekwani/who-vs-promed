First report of _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ in France
------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Pathology Organisation] of France recently informed the EPPO Secretariat that, within the framework of a surveillance programme for _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ in solanaceous ornamentals, the presence of _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, TASVd) was detected in several garden centres located in different regions (Champagne-Ardenne, Pays-de-la-Loire, Picardie).

In July 2013, TASVd was detected in asymptomatic plants of _Brugmansia_ spp., _Solanum jasminoides_ and _S. lycopersicum_ (tomato). All infected plants were destroyed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2007 to 2012 surveys for the presence of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) in 299 ornamental plants of the family Solanaceae were carried out in Poland. The availability of a _Pospiviroid_ genus-specific primer pair for RT-PCR, has facilitated surveys of ornamental plants for pospiviroids.

Fifteen _Solanum rantonnetti_ and 21 _S. jasminoides_ plants were sampled randomly and tested. Samples originated from 7 different Polish provinces. The _Pospiviroid_ specific primer set was used to amplify a 262bp RT-PCR product. In addition, 3 positive samples were tested using PSTVd specific primers that amplified the 360bp product. The presence of both RT-PCR products of the expected sizes was confirmed in 2 _S. jasminoides_ samples, one from Zachodniopomorskie Province, the other from the Lubuskie region.

Sequence comparison revealed that both isolates were identical to each other and shared 98 to 100 per cent sequence identity with other PSTVd isolates described. In addition, the presence of the 262bp product was shown in one sample of _S. rantonnetti_ from Lubuskie and was identified as TASVd.

Sap from PSTVd- and TASVd-positive plants was used to inoculate tomato plants. After 3 weeks, most of the tomato plants displayed growth reduction and distortion, and obtained sequences were identical with original ones. 80 per cent of the inoculated plants tested positive. These results suggest that ornamental plants might act as a source of inocula for tomato or potato crops even if they do not display any visible symptoms.

TASVd-infected _S. rantonnetti_ was introduced to Poland from the Netherlands, while the origin of the PSTVd positive _S. jasminoides_ is uncertain. Official eradication measures were imposed due to the detection of viroids in ornamental plants in Poland.

[_Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (TASVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) has been included on the EPPO alert list. Until recently, very few data were available on its host range other than tomato. Symptoms in tomato are stunting, leaf distortion, reduced fruit size, and discolouration. Up to 100 per cent incidence with heavy yield losses has been reported. The viroid is transmitted with plant material, by mechanical means, seed and bumblebees.

_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd. It has been included on the EPPO A2 quarantine list.

Symptoms in tomatoes include leaf chlorosis and discolouration, leaf distortion, shortening of internodes, and stunting of plants; flower and fruit initiation stops. In potato, shoots are spindly and may show distortions and proliferations; plants are stunted, and tubers are small, elongated, cylindrical, spindle or dumbbell-shaped, with prominent eyes evenly distributed over the tuber; sprouting is slower than in healthy tubers. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, with no natural resistance to PSTVd available in either host. However, mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Spread occurs also with infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_, PSTVd can also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_). Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complex.

Both viroids are exceptionally stable and can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified viroid free planting material. The presence of pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries (see, for example, ProMED-mail posts below) and must be considered a threat to crops. It highlights the importance of systematic surveys and quarantine measures for these pathogens, even if there are no obvious problems with crops.
