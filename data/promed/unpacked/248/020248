Ten people have reportedly been infected with anthrax in Faridpur
upazila of Pabna, district health officials said yesterday [11 Jun
2011].

The infected persons are residents of Kenai village in the upazila. A
health team of Faridpur Upazila Health Complex led by Dr Md Khalilur
Rahman, upazila health and family planning officer, visited the
village yesterday [11 Jun 2011] and confirmed the disease. They also
provided free treatment to them.

Dr Khalil suspected that victims were infected by anthrax as they
slaughtered a sick cow and distributed the meat on 9 Jun 2011.
"Talking to the patients, we have become convinced that they
contracted the disease from the cow," he added.

Earlier, 17 people were infected with anthrax at Raut Nagdapara
village of the same upazila from 30 May to 8 Jun 2011.

[It continues. This outbreak is interesting because anthrax in humans
is a recent occurrence in Bangladesh, while bovine anthrax, admittedly
spotty for the past 15 years, has OIE records back to 1989, if not
further. - Mod.MHJ]
