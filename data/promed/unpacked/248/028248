Health officials are trying to learn where a Livingston county woman contracted a case of the measles, a sometimes deadly virus often found in the developing world but one that was considered eliminated from the U.S. by the year 2000.

"Most of our cases are imported cases, but she hadn't done any international travel so she had to have picked it up somewhere in the U.S.," said Dr. Donald Lawrenchuk, medical director for the Livingston County Health Department. "She lives in Livingston County but works in the Ann Arbor area."

The woman never became sick enough to require hospitalization, and she is expected to recover, Lawrenchuk said.

The strain she was carrying was identified as rubeola, sometimes known as hard measles. Lawrenchuk said it is one of the more dangerous types, with a fatality rate of 1-2% of patients who contract it. It's also highly contagious, infecting about 95% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to it.

Earlier this year [2017], another Livingston County resident who worked in Ann Arbor was diagnosed with the measles as well, Lawrenchuk said. Health officials have sent a sample of the virus from the most recent patient to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which can map the genome of the virus to see whether it matches the earlier case, he said.

Washtenaw County [and Oakland County health officials] warned people who had been at locations listed in the URL. "We have an obligation to inform the public, but it's not like you can never go to these places again," said Susan Cerniglia, spokeswoman for the Washtenaw County Health Department. "This is airborne. You really have to have been in the same place at the same time as the person who is contagious."

Cerniglia said people can be carrying, and spreading, the virus before their own symptoms even begin, so people need to be vigilant if they were in those places at those times.

Measles symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.

According to the CDC, the measles virus can live for up to 2 hours in the air near where the infected person coughed or sneezed, infecting others who breathe in that air.

Before a vaccine was introduced in 1963, the CDC logged about 500 000 cases annually in the U.S. causing between 400 and 500 deaths. But widespread vaccinations and other measures are credited with effectively eliminating it by 2000. The virus remains active in the developing world and can be brought to the U.S. by travellers.

The case is the latest in Metro Detroit of illnesses being linked to restaurants. In recent weeks, hepatitis has been found in restaurants in the Grosse Pointes and in Ann Arbor.

[2] Italy alarm

There is alarm in Italy over cases of measles and the anti-vaccination movement. Nearly 3000 cases have been recorded this year [2017], 324 only in the last fortnight.

The situation is of serious concern to Europe: Italy is experiencing an epidemic of measles that not only saw an increase in cases, but also hospitalization of 4 out of 10 children affected.

The problem is due to anti-virus movements. 89% of all cases were not vaccinated, and only 6% had received the 1st dose of the vaccine.

To the 2719 Italian patients, more than 500 cases in Germany and 6434 patients (and about 30 deaths) in Romania have to be added. In the heat of the growth of anti-vaccination movements, diseases that we believed (almost) forgotten are leading an alarming return.

The recent death of a child with otitis due to having been treated with homeopathy and the case of a boy who contracted tetanus after an accident because his parents refused to vaccinate him are clear examples of the damage that can be done by pseudo-therapies. But in the case of vaccination, it is even more outrageous because it not only puts the individual who is not vaccinated at risk but endangers all others, especially the most defenseless.

The obligatory nature of vaccines remains a very controversial issue, above all, by the ethical and social problems that it presents. What should you do with children who are not vaccinated? Should they be left without schooling as Germany, France and other countries are deciding to do? Should we remove custody (and parental rights) from their parents? Should we physically force them to be vaccinated? Many decisions are being debated in the world.

Indeed, the Italian government had no choice but to legislate in this regard on 19 May 2017 by making a dozen vaccines compulsory for all schools in the country. Other countries, such as Germany, force day-care centers to report on parents who do not vaccinate their children.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-europe-nearly-nine-10-cases-reported-unvaccinated-39564/


Since January 2016, some 19 000 measles cases were reported in Europe, including 44 deaths. (In 2016, 12 deaths occurred in Romania and one in the UK. In 2017, 31 deaths were reported from Romania, Italy [4], Bulgaria [1], Germany [1], Portugal [1], France [1] and Spain [1].)

The list of countries affected is long, with only Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta and Norway not reporting any cases in 2017.

The most heavily affected continue to be Romania (9539 cases, including 34 deaths with more than 7500 reported in 2017), Italy (4617 cases, including 4 deaths this year), and Germany (891 cases in 2017).

Of all measles cases reported across the one-year period from 1 Sep 2016-31 Aug 2017 with known vaccination status, 87% were not vaccinated.

The latest available figures on vaccination coverage collected by WHO (2016) show that the vaccination coverage for the 1st dose of measles was below 95% in 18 of 30 EU/EEA countries; for the 2nd dose of measles, it was below 95% in 20 of 27 EU/EEA countries reporting 2nd dose coverage data.

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in order to achieve the measles elimination goal, the vaccination coverage rates for children targeted by routine vaccination programmes should increase in a number of countries, as the vaccination coverage of the 2nd dose must be at least 95% to interrupt measles circulation and achieve herd immunity.

Almost 400 new measles cases have been confirmed in the last month in Romania, according to data from the National Center for Supervision and Control of Transmissible Diseases, quoted by News.ro.

This has brought the total number of confirmed measles cases in the country to more than 9600 since the authorities officially announced the outbreak of this epidemic, at the end of September 2016.

Half of the new cases in the last month have been reported in Brasov county, and a high number of new cases were also reported in Cluj, Satu Mare and Harghita counties.

Overall, in the last 2 years, over 1000 cases were confirmed in Timis county (1228), Caras-Severin county (1112), and Arad county (1014), all in Western Romania.

Since the start of the measles epidemic, 34 people died in Romania because of the disease. Nine deaths were reported Timis county, 6 in Arad, 7 in Dolj, 3 in Caras-Severin, and 1 in Bihor, Cluj, Calarasi, Neamt, Satu Mare, Vaslui, Galati, Mures, and Bucharest, each.

The disease has spread to 41 counties. Tulcea is the only county in Romania where no measles case has been officially recorded yet.

This July [2017], the Romanian Ministry of Health started a vaccination campaign against measles with the involvement of local authorities, which have to identify the children who have not been vaccinated yet and the places where they will be immunized.

Another person has been diagnosed with the potentially deadly measles virus, and Sydney's Sutherland Shire has emerged as a hotspot in the NSW [New South Wales] outbreak.

Health authorities are urging people to seek out the measles vaccine after the 29th person was diagnosed with the potentially deadly virus in NSW.

The latest infection is the 5th of a growing outbreak in the Sutherland Shire.

See URL above for places the infected individual visited.

"Our public health units are contacting people known to have been in contact with this latest case to offer preventive injections, where appropriate," NSW Health's director of communicable diseases Vicky Sheppeard said in a statement on Mon [16 Oct 2017].

"However, it will not be possible to identify and contact all people who may have been exposed. We encourage people who were in the same locations as the latest case to keep a close watch for symptoms and get vaccinated.

Dr Sheppeard said most of the state's 29 cases were aged between 20 and 50 years and the majority were unaware they were not completely vaccinated as children.

Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes, and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.

The following is excerpted from R Coombes. Europe steps up action against vaccine hesitancy as measles outbreaks continue BMJ 2017; 359:j4803 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j4803 (Published 16 October 2017):

As measles outbreaks continue to occur in Europe as a result of growing "vaccine hesitancy," countries are exploring best approaches to counteracting parental concerns over safety. The Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, "Andrea Ammon, said that governments and doctors need to engage head on with parents over safety concerns. She praised Denmark, where rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination have plummeted, for taking its message to social media in a campaign that is showing some early promise."

"Ammon said that mandatory vaccination policies were not necessarily the answer across Europe. 'People are watching what happens in France very closely. These changes have to be done in the context of the country, and it won't suit everyone.' Instead, she said that health authorities had to be prepared to be creative.

"We have to get out of our comfort zone and do something new. We may have to change our approach; we have so far focused on evidence in a transparent way, but we may have to think about how to add an emotional component," she said.

"Denmark has drawn praise for responding dynamically to people's concerns over HPV vaccination. Working with the Danish Medical Association and the Danish Cancer Society, the national health authority has signed up a network of doctors to take part in a campaign on Facebook, where they respond individually to parents who post concerns on the platform."

"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has issued a guide for healthcare workers to aid communication with parents and patients over vaccine decisions (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/immunisation-vaccines/childhood-vaccination/lets-talk-about)."

[This guide is aimed to help parents understand the importance of vaccination. Of course, some parents are not open to discussion, thus the healthcare community must find new creative ways to reach these individuals. - Mod.LK]
