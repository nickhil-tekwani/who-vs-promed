Rapid City is at the center of a state and federal investigation into
a salmonella outbreak that sickened people in South Dakota and at
least 3 other states. So far, health officials have confirmed 22
cases of a specific strain of the bacterial-borne intestinal disorder
in the 4 states. All of South Dakota's 11 cases, 9 adults and 2
children, were in the Black Hills area. Of the 11 victims 6 were
hospitalized, 5 at Rapid City Regional Hospital.

"Everybody's recovering," state epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger of the
South Dakota Department of Health in Pierre said Monday [14 Jan
2008]. "But since we've had so many of these cases hospitalized,
which is fairly unusual, it leads me to believe it is a fairly potent strain."

State health officials sent out a public notice in late December 2007
saying that salmonella cases were up slightly for the year and
encouraged proper precautions to reduce the chance of infection. At
that time, a Rapid City Regional Hospital official confirmed 5 people
had been hospitalized at the facility that month with _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Newport. On Monday [14 Jan 2008], hospital
spokeswoman Pam Stillman-Rokusek also confirmed that 3 other cases of
the Newport strain were detected in laboratory samples sent to
regional from other medical facilities for analysis.

Additional confirmed cases of the Newport strain since the
late-December [2007] announcement brought the total in South Dakota
and 3 other states to 22 cases and prompted state health officials to
issue another news release Monday [14 Jan 2008].

"On the surface, it looks like 22 different cases, but they have a
molecular fingerprint that's almost exactly the same," Kightlinger
said. "So we're looking for commonality in them." Kightlinger
declined to name the other states involved, but noted that one is a
South Dakota border state and the other 2 are "far flung." Because of
the molecular similarities of the cases in the 4 states, the states
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta
are investigating for links.

"Every time we get a cluster like this, I always consider it the tip
of the iceberg," he said. "Because you have so many people who would
get a bout of diarrhea and not go to a doctor; they'll just hunker
down and tough it out."

With additional news coverage of the investigation and more contacts
with West River doctors, Kightlinger hopes for new reports of cases
that could prove valuable in determining the cause of the illness.

Health officials have not identified a specific food, source, or
location suspected in the cluster of cases, nor is there a clear
connection, beyond the molecular similarities, between the cases in
South Dakota and the other states, Kightlinger said. "None of the
cases in the other states traveled to South Dakota during the
incubation period. None had food processed in South Dakota, that we
know of, or have a grandma in South Dakota that sent them Christmas
cookies or goodies," he said.

[It is unclear at this point whether these South Dakota cases are
related to the cluster of cases of serotype Newport related to ground
beef (see Salmonellosis, serotype Newport, ground beef - USA: alert
20071221.4105), the cluster of cases of salmonellosis of unstated
serotype in several other states (see Salmonellosis - USA: (MT, TX,

here are not stated in this posting. - Mod.LL
