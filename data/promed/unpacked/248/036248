Zambia: It's not Ebola!
-----------------------
The woman from Zambia who died in South Africa from a mysterious
disease was in fact afflicted by cerebral edema and multi-organ
failure, putting to rest suspicions that she was hit by the deadly
Ebola [haemorrhagic fever virus], experts have confirmed. 5 experts
who carried out the investigations on 2 of the 4 deceased people
revealed that the woman could have died from suspected viral
infection from a tick bite that she incurred in Lusaka. Experts from
Specialty Emergency Services (SES) Corpmed Medical Centre (CMC) and
Wilderness Safari said that the 1st victim of the disease, that had
so far claimed 4 lives, owned horses and attended polo matches in Lusaka.

The woman is known to have walked barefoot most of the time and
travelled within Africa frequently without seeking medical attention.
Between 6-8 Sep 2008, she attended a wedding in South Africa where
she might have had food poisoning along with 6 others all of whom had
developed diarrheoa, vomiting and headache. On 10 Sep 2008 she
developed rash, fever and chest congestion and was attended to by a
doctor at Care for Business Clinic, who told her that she had flu and
sent her home. The victim was flown to South Africa on 12 Sep 2008
after her condition deteriorated as she had seizures. She died on 14 Sep 2008.

Most of the people she came in contact with, including her family, 2
doctors and employees at CMC had not shown any symptoms of the
disease. But a paramedic who had spent time with her during her
seizure also died from multi-organ failure on 1 Oct 2008, almost 2
weeks after the meeting. He died at Morningside Hospital after being
flown there.

The 3rd victim was a nurse based at the clinic who had attended to
the 1st patient.

The 4th one, a cleaner at the same health institution, died in the
Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital.

Health Permanent Secretary, Simon Miti said in an interview yesterday
[7 Oct 2008] that the health authorities in the country [Zambia] had
been put on high alert against any symptoms similar to those that
afflicted the 4 dead people. Dr Miti said no such cases had been
reported from the health institutions anywhere in the country and
health officers were watching the situation. He said that apart from
putting health institutions on high alert, authorities had also
deployed officers at ports of entry to monitor the situation for
symptoms of the disease. He said that all the tests conducted in
South Africa on the deceased people were negative to the initial
suspicions and that the disease remained a mystery. "We still have no
trace of the disease in Zambia and, therefore, the nation should be
calm," he said.

Yesterday, the South African media reported that a 51-year-old woman
was on Monday [6 Oct 2008] admitted to the Chris Hani Baragwanath
Hospital in Johannesburg with symptoms of the unknown disease. The
Independent Online (IOL) reported that the hospital authorities
could, however, not say whether the woman was related to the 4 earlier victims.

[This Zambian account of the events preceding the 4 fatalities does
not emphasize the occurrence of significant haemorrhage, and no cases
of haemorrhagic fever have been recorded in Zambia prior to or
subsequent to the illness of the index case. The index case fell ill
2-4 days after returning from a visit to South Africa and could have
contracted her illness there rather than in Zambia. The final results
of laboratory testing in South Africa are still pending.
