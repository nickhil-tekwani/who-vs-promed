This is in response to the note regarding _Aedes aegypti_ in Arizona [the ProMED-mail post of 1 Aug 2015, archive no. 20150802.3553587]. Actually, _Aedes aegypti_ has been in Arizona for a number of years. A collection from Cochise County was reported to CDC Fort Collins by staff of Arizona State Health Dept. in 1999. CDC received another report of _Ae. aegypti_ in Maricopa County in 2000. Since then, additional new county records have been obtained, either through personal contact or through CDC's ArboNET program, for Graham, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz, and Yavapai Counties. Basically the entire southeastern 3rd of the state has reported the species, so it seems most likely that it has moved northward from Mexico.

It may be of interest to this group that a large number of researchers recently collaborated to produce a global database of records for both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. 2 publications are now available: The 1st describes the database, which is freely available: Kraemer, M. U., M. E. Sinka, K. A. Duda, A. Mylne, F. M. Shearer, O. J. Brady, J. P. Messina, C. M. Barker, C. G. Moore, R. G. Carvalho, G. E. Coelho, W. Van Bortel, G. Hendrickx, F. Schaffner, G. R. W. Wint, I. R. F. Elyazar, H.-J. Teng, and S. I. Hay. 2015. The global compendium of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ occurrence. Scientific Data 2:150035. DOI:10.1038/sdata.2015.35. A 2nd publication maps the likely current maximum distribution of these vectors under current environmental conditions: Kraemer, M. U., M. E. Sinka, K. A. Duda, A. Q. Mylne, F. M. Shearer, C. M. Barker, C. G. Moore, R. G. Carvalho, G. E. Coelho, W. Van Bortel, G. Hendrickx, F. Schaffner, I. R. Elyazar, H.-J. Teng, O. J. Brady, J. P. Messina, D. M. Pigott, T. W. Scott, D. L. Smith, G. W. Wint, N. Golding, and S. I. Hay. 2015. The global distribution of the arbovirus vectors _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. eLife 4: e08347. DOI: org/10.7554/eLife.08347.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Moore for this overview of _Aedes aegypti_ in Arizona and the references on the distribution of this mosquito and of _Ae. albopictus_. ProMED welcomes these contributions from experts in their fields, in this case that of invasive vector mosquitoes, which are an increasing threat to public health. It is interesting to learn that _Ae. aegypti_ has been present in Arizona for some time but, fortunately, without causing dengue outbreaks there.
