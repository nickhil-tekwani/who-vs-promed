Celebrate One Health Day!
-------------------------
Today [3 Nov 2017], we celebrate the 2nd global One Health Day, held annually on 3 November. From One Health student lectures in Baku, Azerbaijan and the One Health Week at the University of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, to the National One Health-One Medicine conference in Italy and the National One Health Steering Committee symposium in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Individuals and groups from around the world are implementing One Health educational projects and awareness events, as shown on the One Health Day Events map. (https://www.onehealthcommission.org/en/eventscalendar/one_health_day/event_listing_2017/).

The events, however, need to be held in an academic or government setting. The Back to Nature team in Sitges, Spain, calls on volunteers to pick up trash at the beach and a passionate student in the US made this inspiring video to raise awareness about One Health and One Health Day:

Officially launched in April 2016 by 3 leading international One Health groups -- the One Health Commission, the One Health Initiative Autonomous pro bono Team, and the One Health Platform Foundation -- One Health Day answers the urgent need for a One Health trans-disciplinary approach towards solving today's critical global health challenges. It is a timely initiative that gives scientists and advocates a powerful voice for moving beyond current provincial approaches to emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, environmental pollution, food safety, comparative/translational medicine, and many other problems, to a holistic default way of doing business. Today, this initiative has grown into an annual, sustainable platform for One Health supporters around the world.

5th International One Health Congress: program update
-----------------------------------------------------
The congress will be held in Saskatoon, Canada, from 22 to 25 Jun 2018. To capture the multifaceted One Health paradigm, the Congress will have distinct program tracks on One Health Science (zoonoses, climate change, food and water safety), antimicrobial resistance, and translational science. Check the updated program or register for the congress at https://onehealthplatform.com/iohc/programme

Abstracts for the congress will be accepted until 15 Feb 2018.

Bat rabies education in the Americas
------------------------------------
The One Health Commission's Bat Rabies Education Team (BRET) is conducting a survey on current awareness and educational activities about bat rabies. This team is passionate about raising awareness around the need for bat rabies education in the Americas and utilization of free educational resources. Its 1st survey is meant to gather information in the Americas from professionals and health organizations who may be doing bat rabies education or have first-hand knowledge and wisdom that can be used to further these educational efforts.

How can you help? If you live in the Americas and work in the health sector (human, animal, environmental), please consider participating in this 1st survey of by clicking here:

The survey itself will only take 5 to 10 minutes. Responses will not be released publicly but will only be used for the purposes of improving the Bat Rabies Educational program.
