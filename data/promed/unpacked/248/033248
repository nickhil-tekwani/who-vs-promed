A deadly disease killing white-tailed deer in northeast Wyoming has now infected a cow in the same region. The cow survived and is recovering from the virus called epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD]. The disease lives in biting midges and spreads most often to white-tailed deer, said Bob Meyer, assistant state veterinarian for the Wyoming Livestock Board. It does not pose a health risk to humans.

The disease is endemic in areas of the United States, including north east Wyoming. Its impact is more severe in drought years when animals gather in large groups around scarce water. The recent case of EHD is likely due to this summer's [2012] drought, which caused cows and deer to comingle near water, Meyer said.

EHD does not infect cattle as often as deer and is rarely as deadly. In cows, it is more like the flu virus in a human. The virus runs its course and with adequate care and water, the cow recovers, Meyer said.

Clinical signs in cows and deer include lethargy and drooling, caused by ulcers in animals' mouths. Animals can also look lame because of infections in their hooves.

State veterinary officials ask any cattle producers to report cases of oral lesions or drooling to their local veterinarians. Symptoms of EHD can mimic those of much more serious diseases like foot and mouth disease [FMD]. If a cow is drooling or has ulcers in its mouth, the state veterinary lab will want to run tests, Meyer said.

No cure or vaccination exists for EHD. The disease will be subdued after the 1st hard frost kills most biting midges, Meyer said.

This may be the 1st reported case of EHD in a cow in Wyoming. Because EHD cannot spread from cow to cow, the infections should end with cold weather, said Michael McDole, US Department of Agriculture veterinary services area veterinarian in charge of Wyoming.

Officials have also found EHD in deer and cattle recently in Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Colorado.

EHD may be causing one of the largest die-offs of white-tailed deer in decades in the northern Black Hills, said Sundance Game Warden Chris Teter.

[When I first saw this article and others like it, I was concerned the journalist had mixed up epizootic hemorrhagic disease and bluetongue (BT) virus. These diseases are closely related but clearly and distinctly separate.

I sought out the assistance of a colleague, Dr Jim Logan, Wyoming state veterinarian. He provided me with the following information, which I am sharing with his permission:

Samples were sent to Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Both diseases were tested for and EHD was positive but BT was negative. Tests used were AB-ELISA [antibody-ELISA] for BT, which was negative. AGID [agar gel immunodiffusion] and RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] were used for EHD and were positive. Tests were also run for vesicular stomatitis and FMD and were negative.

Nebraska and South Dakota also have found EHD in bovines. I don't know what tests were run, but I believe their samples were also sent to Plum Island Animal Disease Center.

I am grateful for Dr Logan's rapid and helpful response to my queries.

For more information with regard to the differences between EHD and BTV readers are encouraged to read the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail 20120908.1286824
