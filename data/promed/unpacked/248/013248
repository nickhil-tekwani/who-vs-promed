German prosecutors on Monday [14 Feb 2022] said the poisoning of a group of people in Bavaria was due to consumption of champagne spiked with Ecstasy.

A 52-year-old man died and several others fell seriously ill on Sunday [13 Feb 2022] night after apparently consuming contaminated drinks at a restaurant in the Bavarian city of Weiden, police said. According to initial findings, all of the affected drank from the same bottle they had ordered. Subsequently, they felt symptoms of poisoning.

By the time police and emergency responders arrived, many of the affected patrons had collapsed to the floor. Eight people between the age of 33 and 52 were rushed to various hospitals. The 52-year-old from the district of Schwandorf died later the same night. The rest of the victims are out of immediate danger and undergoing treatment, the Upper Palatinate police said.

What did the toxicological tests show?
"There were things in it [the bottle of drink] that normally are not in champagne," senior prosecutor Gerd Schafer said. "It had a toxic, a poisonous effect."

Schafer added that tests showed the poisonous substance "in considerable concentration" in the champagne was Ecstasy. He said it was still unclear how the drug got into the bottle.

Negligent homicide?
Investigators suspect a case of negligent homicide, a police spokesperson told public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR).

While there was no suspect yet and no assumption of intent, police are investigating in all directions, BR reported. Some of the injured had been questioned by Monday [14 Feb 2022] afternoon, Schafer said.

Schafer confirmed that there was a suspicion of negligent homicide, but he said it did not appear that the poisoning was a targeted attack. He did not elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.

[Ecstasy is MDMA.

"What is MDMA?

"3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic drug capable of altering mood and perception (awareness of surrounding objects and conditions). It is chemically similar to both stimulants and hallucinogens, producing feelings of increased energy, pleasure, emotional warmth, and distorted sensory and time perception."

While this article does not tell us how the Ecstasy got into the bottle of champagne, other ways the drug is ingested are via pills (capsules or tablets) or liquid. There is also a crystal form, the crystalized drug commonly known as Molly. The crystal Molly is occasionally encapsulated. Molly (the crystal form) is also mixed with other drugs such as synthetic cathinones, which are referred to as "bath salts."

MDMA, or Ecstasy, has a number of effects on the body, especially on 3 key receptors of the brain, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The receptors have the following effect in the body:

"Dopamine: produces increased energy/activity and acts in the reward system to reinforce behaviors
"Norepinephrine: increases heart rate and blood pressure, which are particularly risky for people with heart and blood vessel problems
"Serotonin: affects mood, appetite, sleep, and other functions. It also triggers hormones affecting sexual arousal and trust. The release of large amounts of serotonin likely causes the emotional closeness, elevated mood, and empathy felt by those who use MDMA.

"Other health effects include
- nausea
- muscle cramping
- involuntary teeth clenching
- blurred vision
- chills
- sweating

"MDMA's effects last about 3 to 6 hours, although many users take a 2nd dose as the effects of the 1st dose begin to fade. Over the course of the week following moderate use of the drug, a person may experience
- irritability
- impulsiveness and aggression
- depression
- sleep problems
- anxiety
- memory and attention problems
- decreased appetite
- decreased interest in and pleasure from sex"

"Adding to MDMA's risks is pills, capsules, or powders sold as Ecstasy, and supposedly 'pure' Molly may contain other drugs instead of or in addition to MDMA. Much of the Molly seized by [law enforcement] contains additives such as cocaine, ketamine, methamphetamine, over-the-counter cough medicine, or synthetic cathinones ('bath salts'). These substances may be extremely dangerous if the person does not know what he or she is taking. They may also be dangerous when combined with MDMA. People who purposely or unknowingly combine such a mixture with other substances, such as marijuana and alcohol, may be putting themselves at even higher risk for harmful health effects."

What is mysterious about this situation is how did the ecstasy get into the bottle? How much Ecstasy was in the bottle? Was the bottle opened prior to the patrons getting the bottle? Was the bottle not opened in the presence of the patrons? If it was opened, could someone in the establishment have spiked the bottle? If it was opened in their presence, when was the drug put into the bottle? When was the bottle was filled and corked? Was a tiny hole drilled into the cork and the drug added to the bottle of champagne via a needle? Or perhaps it happened at the bottling facility and there are more "spiked" bottles? Hopefully there will be a follow-up on the outcome of this champagne bottle or bottles. - Mod.TG]
