Probers eye new angle in Bohol deaths: focus shifts to pesticide
--------------------------------------------------
As hysterical parents started burying their young, tragic victims from
Wednesday's (9 Mar 2005) mass poisoning, a new pall of gloom started
swirling around this grieving town as the suspected cause of the tragedy
swung from the innocent to the sinister.
Originally thought to be caused by ill-prepared "pichi-pichi," a delicious
snack made from the potentially lethal root crop cassava, authorities
investigating the incident that killed 30 grade school pupils and downed
more than 100 others have swung their attention to the possibility that
real poison may be involved.
This after police who visited the home of 1 of 2 vendors who sold the snack
during recess at the San Jose Elementary School in this sleepy town on the
eastern seaboard of Bohol found several empty bottles of pesticide common
in farming communities throughout the Philippines.
Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit said investigators from Manila are focusing
on 2 theories, that the inherent cyanide content in cassava may have been
activated during preparation, or pesticides may have accidentally been
mixed with the root crop during cooking.
"There appears to be a trace of organophosphate poisoning, meaning that a
component of a pesticide or an insecticide contaminated the food. We are
presuming it could have been in the process of preparation," said Dr.
Harold del Gallego, administrator at a hospital in Talibon town where some
of the victims were taken.
Dr. Troy Gepte of the National Epidemiology Center in Manila also tended to
look in that direction, citing the swiftness with which the children
succumbed to the poison. "There were some children who died after just a
few minutes of eating the cassava."
Aside from the 30 pupils, aged 7 to 13, who perished in the tragedy, up to
70 other children were taken ill and are being treated in various hospitals
and clinics in the outlying towns. An additional 70 other children were
also taken ill but did not require medical attention.
Gepte said the cassava root contains naturally occurring cyanogens,
compunds that contain cyanide, a highly lethal poison. If not properly
removed by proper cleaning, any remaining cyanogens ingested into the body
can be converted into active cyanide once they come into contact with
enzymes during digestion.
Cyanide is so highly lethal it has been used in gas chambers. Spies during
the Cold War have been known to carry cyanide pellets to take their own
lives in the event of capture.
Most of the fatalities in Wednesday's tragedy never made it alive to the
hospital, proof of how toxic the substance was that may have been in the
cassava snack.

Authorities launched on Fri, 11 Mar 2005, a criminal investigation after at
least 27 schoolchildren died in a mass food poisoning in the central island
of Bohol. Blood and food samples and traces from a cooking oil container
were sent to Manila for analysis after the tragedy, blamed on cassava
sweets sold outside the children's school.
A special investigating team, including doctors and toxicologists, was
meeting in Bohol and the Justice Department's National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) was looking into the case.
A health official said the sweets could have been contaminated by
pesticide, rather than cyanide, which can occur in cassava if not prepared
correctly. "Based on the signs and symptoms, it points to organophosphate
poisoning," said regional health assistant director Susana Madarieta,
adding that the sick children did not show signs of cyanide poisoning.
At least 27 children died and 103 others, mostly young people, were
hospitalized on Wed, 9 Mar 2005 after eating caramelized cassava sweets
bought from street vendors at the gates of the San Jose Elementary School
in this remote, impoverished town.
The deaths and illnesses of so many children, aged 7 to 13, has traumatized
this small town of about 27 000 people, which was ill-prepared to deal with
so many sick and dying.
2 street vendors were identified as having sold food to the children before
they became ill. One vendor is in hospital herself after consuming some of
her own snacks while the other is under NBI custody to protect her from
possible revenge attacks.
Madarieta said it was still unclear how pesticides could have infected the
cassava, suggesting it may have happened during the preparation process or
when farmers sprayed trees growing above the tubers.
Cassava or manioc is a tropical food crop widely grown around the Asian
region. In many impoverished Philippine towns, like Mabini, it is a
substitute for rice, the staple cereal. It is traditionally boiled, or
processed as an ingredient for native cakes and delicacies in the
Philippines. The most popular form among school children is deep-fried
cassava coated with sugar.
Education Secretary Florencio Abad said in a radio interview that he would
order restrictions on schoolchildren buying food from street vendors,
saying they should use school canteens instead. But he conceded that San
Jose Elementary School did not have a canteen for its 267 students and that
the 2 vendors had been selling food to the kids for years without incident.

[At this point, it is yet to be established if the illnesses were related
to cyanide or pesticide, and the published symptoms are not elaborated
enough to clarify the diagnosis.
Regarding organophosphates, they form an irreversible bond with the
cholinesterase enzyme. Cholinesterases rapidly hydrolyze the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine into inactive fragments. Acetylcholine (ACh)
is found in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia and in the terminal
nerve endings of postganglionic parasympathetic nerves at the motor
endplates of nerves in the skeletal muscle. Inactivation of the enzyme
allows ACh to accumulate at the synapse, leading to overstimulation and the
disruption of nerve impulses. The excess of ACH affects muscarinic and
nicotinic peripheral receptors of ACh as well as central nervous system
(CNS) effects.
Muscarinic findings may include the following: salivation, lacrimation,
urination, defecation and/or diarrhea (SLUD), wheezing and/or
bronchoconstriction, pulmonary edema, increased pulmonary and oropharyngeal
secretions, sweating, slow heart rate, and abdominal cramping and
intestinal hypermotility.
Nicotinic findings may include the following: muscle fasciculations
(twitching), fatigue, paralysis, respiratory muscle weakness, diminished
respiratory effort, and high blood pressure.
CNS findings may include the following: anxiety, restlessness, confusion,
headache, slurred speech, lack of muscle coordination, seizures, and coma.
Predominant symptoms and signs vary according to the age of the affected
person. Children, particularly young children, present with altered levels
of consciousness rather than the classic salivation, lacrimation,
urination, defecation, GI distress, and emesis (SLUDGE) syndrome that is
more commonly observed in adults. - Mod.LL]
