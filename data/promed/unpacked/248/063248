Reappearance of CCHF Cases in Kazakhstan
----------------------------------------
ALMATY: The state Emergency Situations Agency (AES) told
Interfax-Kazakhstan today that 3 people were admitted to hospital on Wed 2
May 2001 with suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the
Zhambyl Region of southern Kazakhstan.
According to the AES, they had all been bitten by ticks during the period
23-28 Apr 2001. In total, from the start of the year, 4 people in the
region have been hospitalized already as suspected victims of this
dangerous disease.

[In 1999 10 cases of CCHF, 2 of them fatal, had been recorded by early
March in southern Kazakhstan. The somewhat later appearance of cases in
this region this year suggests that the increase in the tick population
observed further west in the Stavropol region is not reflected here. - Mod.CP
