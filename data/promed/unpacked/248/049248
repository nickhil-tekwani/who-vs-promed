Q-fever infection in Hilvarenbeek, Esch, and Liessel
----------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 dairy goat farms, in Hilvarenbeek, Esch and Liessehave,
been declared as Q-fever infected. In Hilvarenbeek, this refers to a
farm including 1050 dairy goats, in Esch 3000 and in Liessel 1030
dairy goats. The declaration followed the identification of the Q
fever bacterium in each of the 3 farms in 2 separate tests, performed
in both the Animal Health Service (GD) laboratory as well as in the
Central Veterinary Institute (CVI), in 2 different milk samples.

The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) has placed warning
signs on the farms. The full addresses and the locations of the
infected farms will be made public on the web-site of the VWA.

[In total, 71 dairy farms have been found infected with _Coxiella
burnetii_ in the Netherlands since October 2009, of which there are
70 goat farms and one sheep farm. The total number of commercial
dairy goat and sheep farms in the Netherlands is approximately 450.

All pregnant animals on the 1st 68 infected farms have been culled,
to be followed by the pregnant goats in the 3 newly-added farms.
These 3 farms are located in the province North Brabant, the Dutch
province with the highest density of dairy goats. The total number of
culled animals will have exceeded, by now, 40 000.

The detailed list and map of 68 Q-fever infected farms, as of 8 Feb
2010, are available at:
<http://www.vwa.nl/portal/page?_pageid=119,2025799&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_document_id=932575&p_node_id=2167182&p_mode=BROWSE>.
Bulk milk tests (PCR) of dairy goat and sheep farms with more than 50
milking animals have become compulsory in the Netherlands as of 1 Oct
2009. On 14 Dec 2009 it became a requirement to perform the sampling
and test every 2 weeks instead of the previously requirement of every
2 months. The change was explained by the possibility that the
excretion of the bacterium may be intermittent.

According to the official policy, initial testing is carried out by
the regional animal-health service (GD) laboratory; if found
positive, a visit is paid to the farm, the issue explained to the
owners, guidelines provided and a 2nd sample taken, sent for
confirmation to the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad. If
confirmed, the farm is declared officially infected.

The Netherlands notified the OIE of 63 Q fever outbreaks in dairy
goats on 13 Jan 2010; the reason for notification was "unexpected
increase in incidence of a listed disease." The immediate
notification is available at:
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8842>.
