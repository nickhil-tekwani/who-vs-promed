We (at the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute, Thai Red Cross Society,
Bangkok) provide between 25-40 visitors and local residents with JE vaccine
weekly. 3 injections one week apart are given. Some subjects only come
for 2 injections due to their travel schedule or because they had received
the first shot in their home country. We use the product made in Osaka,
Japan and have done so for almost 10 years. None of our staff at the
vaccination clinic have seen any adverse reactions short of some local
minimal discomfort at injection sites and one patient who fainted and was
revived with "smelling salts" immediately after injection. In contrast, we
see considerable local and mild systemic adverse reactions from tetanus
toxoid and the old typhoid vaccines (discontinued two years ago and
replaced with oral typhoid vaccine). Even though JE vaccine is made from
suckling mouse brains at the University of Osaka plant, it is a highly
purified product made from very young "myelin free" suckling mice. We are
aware of the published reports from Australia concerning asphyxiated
reactions among recipients of JE vaccine but we have never seen one at our
Institute. I agree with all the other statements made by Dr. Campbell
concerning JE which is transmitted in most of Asia including, though
rarely, in cities and has an expanding range Eastward as well as South into
Pacific Islands.

[I spoke with Dr. Ted Tsai, CDC/Ft. Collins, about all this because Ted has
considerable experience and knowledge of JE vaccines. He confirmed the
following:
1. There are two vaccines produced in Japan. One is prepared from the
Nakayama strain of JE virus, the other from the Beijing-1 strain of JE
virus. Both vaccines are inactivated and given by the subcutaneous route
of inoculation; 1 ml for the Nakayama strain vaccine, 0.5 cc for the
Beijing-1 strain vaccine.
2. The Nakayama strain vaccine is distributed by BIKEN to Australia and US
(Europe also?). The Beijing-1 strain appears to be somewhat more
immunogenic (more brisk antibody responses, broader antibody responses) and
is distributed in Japan (other parts of Asia?).
3. For further references, see:

Inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine. Recommendations of the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR 1993;42 [RR-1:1-15.
Plotkin and Mortimer chapter in the book "Vaccines" and various issues of
the journal "Vaccine".
It appears that the Nakayama strain vaccine is somewhat more reactogenic
than the Beijing-1 strain vaccine. Angioedema and urticaria are seen in
about 0.5% of those administered the Nakayama strain vaccine. There is
some evidence that this reactogenicity may be due to an allergy to gelatin
in vaccine.
Because reactions often have delayed onset, it may be a question of
surveillance when reactions are not seen. Alternatively, they may not be
occurring. Depends on the vaccine type.
Let's cut the string here, unless something compelling appears. Thanks to
Henry and Ted for the discussions and information. - Mod.CHC
