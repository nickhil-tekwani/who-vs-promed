US guidelines aim to reduce CJD risk from dura mater by Steven Mitchell
Despite WHO recommendations not to use dura mater and the report from Japan
in November, 1997, of 43 people who contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) after cadaveric dura-mater allografts, such transplants are still
allowed in the USA. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration is
rapidly developing guidelines to minimise the risk of transmitting CJD
through infected dura mater. The FDA's transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE) advisory committee ratified the proposed safety
measures at a meeting held in Bethesda, MD, USA, on April 16.
The committee concluded that the risk of CJD transmission would approach
zero if the proposed guidelines were followed, even though the infectious
agent seems capable of surviving procedures, including sterilisation,
pasteurisation, and ultraviolet irradiation, that kill most other pathogens.
The committee agreed that requiring dura mater to come from risk-free donors
-- defined as having no evidence of neurological disease and no family
history of neurological degenerative disease -- would make it almost
impossible for an undetected case of CJD to become a donor. However,
additional precautions would help to reduce the risk further.
Because of mounting, although not conclusive, evidence that an abnormal
conformation of prion protein (PrP) is the infectious agent in CJD and
other TSEs, the committee agreed that immunocytochemistry for Prp would
help eliminate infected tissue. But a full brain autopsy, including gross
and histological examination, for tissue that passed the PrP test was
necessary to completely rule out CJD.
Disinfection of dura mater with 1 M sodium hydroxide for 1 hour can
substantially reduce the amount of infectious agent, but does not completely
remove it, the committee heard. Finally, the committee agreed that archiving
a sample of dura mater and a 5-10 g portion of the frontal lobe of the
donor's brain at -70Â° C would help future analysis.
