According to Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service on Customers' Rights
Protection and Human Well-Being Surveillance], 9 people in Krasnoyarsk
krai have been infected by _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ since the
beginning of this year [2011].

The clinical picture was variable, and the local public health
services consider the situation to be of no major concern. There have
not been any outbreaks of pseudotuberculosis in Krasnoyarsk since
2007. Since the main source of local infections is rodent-contaminated
vegetables, the specialists recommend against consuming vegetables
kept in cellars over the winter.

[_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ is a non-lactose fermenting
facultative gram-negative coccobacillus that grows slowly on blood,
chocolate, MacConkey and eosin-methylene blue (EMB) agar plates.
Growth is enhanced at lower temperatures (e.g., 4 C cold enrichment in
buffered saline). Isolation of the organism from stool is difficult
given its slow growth and overgrowth of normal fecal flora. However,
stool culture yield may be increased with cold enrichment, and special
culture media (e.g., cefsulodin-Irgasan-novobiocin [CIN] agar, a
differential and selective solid medium).

_Y. pseudotuberculosis_ causes food-borne outbreaks, often in
children in day-care centers and schools, primarily in the northern
hemisphere (e.g., Northern Europe, Russia, and Japan). Transmission of
this zoonotic pathogen of wild and domestic mammals (particularly
rodents) and birds occurs by ingestion of fecal contaminated drinking
water or food, or through direct contact with infected animals.
Clinical illness is characterized by fever and acute abdominal pain
caused by mesenteric lymphadenitis that is often clinically
indistinguishable from acute appendicitis. Postinfectious
complications include erythema nodosum and reactive arthritis. The
illness is often self-limited.

Because _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ does not produce iron-binding
compounds, patients with iron-overload states such as hemochromatosis,
hemolytic anemia, and cirrhosis are at risk for bloodstream infection,
as are patients with underlying immunosuppressive illness or therapy.
Certain strains of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ cause a syndrome called Far
East scarlet-like fever (FESLF), because of its resemblance to scarlet
fever caused by group A streptococci. The clinical picture of FESLF
includes a scarlet fever-like erythematous skin rash and desquamation,
hyperemic tongue, and toxic shock syndrome
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17784789). FESLF may be related
to Izumi fever in Japan, which can resemble Kawasaki syndrome (Sato K,
Ouchi K, Taki M: _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ infection in children,
resembling Izumi fever and Kawasaki syndrome. Pediatr Infect Dis
1983;2: 123-26.).

The diagnosis of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ infection is difficult
because stool cultures are frequently not requested in many patients
who have only fever and abdominal pain, and because routine stool
cultures may not detect _Yersinia_ species.

Krasnoyarsk Krai, with a population of almost 3 million in 2007, is
Russia's 2nd largest administrative unit by area (13 percent of the
country's total territory)
(http://www.answers.com/topic/krasnoyarsk-krai). The krai lies in
the middle of Siberia and belongs to the Siberian Federal District.
The administrative center of the krai is the city of Krasnoyarsk,
which can be found on a map available at
