China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced on Tuesday [24 Sep 2013] that foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] infections have been confirmed in cattle in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

The infections were first spotted in 2 head of cattle, which were raised by a local farmer, according to the MOA.

The National FMD Reference Laboratory on Tuesday [24 Sep 2013] confirmed the cases as type-A foot-and-mouth disease.

To prevent the disease from spreading, local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where 22 sick head of cattle have been culled and safely disposed of, according to the MOA.

[The outbreak above has been reported to the OIE in China's follow-up report no 4, dated 24 Sep 2013 (see, with map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14145). The outbreak's location is given as "Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps", where 2 clinical cases have been recorded in a group of 22 susceptible cattle; all 22 destroyed. Reportedly, vaccination is being applied in Xinjiang; so far, 67 969 head of cattle and 27 159 sheep/goats have been vaccinated.

The FMDV-A epizootic in Xinjiang started on 8 Apr 2013. According to OIE's updated summary, a total of 4 outbreaks have, so far, been reported from Xinjiang, with the following totals:
Species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
Cattle / 1208 / 136 / 0 / 1208 / 0
Sheep & goats / 59 / 0 / 0 / 59 / 0
Sheep / 176 / 0 / 0 / 176 / 0
The summary, with map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014145_20130924_171801.pdf.

The FMD serotype A virus strain has been, reportedly, spreading in China since early 2013. In addition to the 4 outbreaks reported from Xinjiang, 9 additional outbreaks, caused by the same strain (designated "new strain"), have been reported by China as separate outbreaks from each of the following 3 (distant) provinces:

Province / species / Start of outbreak / no. outbreaks as of 25 Sep 2013
Guangdong / swine / 18 Feb 2013 / 1
Qinghai / cattle / 15 Mar 2013 / 2
Tibet / cattle / 12 Apr 2013 / 6 [reportedly, the virus subtype is "SEA 97 G2").

The same virus has been identified in outbreaks in Russia (Amur) since March 2013. Genotyping results are included in the following 2 reports of the WRLFMD, Pirbright:

1. WRLFMD Ref No: A/QHXN-CHA-2013-B
Sample from cattle, QingHai, collected 15 Mar 2013, batch no: WRLMEG/2013/00009, serotype A, topotype: ASIA, genotype/strain: Sea-97

An outbreak of FMD, later serotyped A, was reported by Kazakhstan to the OIE in May 2013; it was located in the East, on the border with China. The genotyping results indicate this strain to be identical (99.21 percent) to the Chinese (and Russian) strains; see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00017%20A%20Kazakhstan%202013.pdf.

For the control of this "new strain," China applies stamping-out policy; as now reported, vaccination is also applied. - Mod.AS
