Washington State health officials have closed additional
oyster-growing areas to commercial harvesting for raw consumption,
after the number of shellfish lovers sickened by local oysters rose to 63.
The culprit is the naturally occurring bacterium _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_, said Nancy Napolilli, director of the Department
of Health's Office of Food Safety and Shellfish. The recent heat wave
and extremely low tides have combined to create an ideal environment
for bacteria to multiply.
The state closed some oyster-growing areas last week -- including the
Totten and Eld inlets near Olympia and a portion of Hood Canal. On
Tue 25 Jul 2006, the state closed a much larger area of Hood Canal
from Sunset Beach to Point Whitney, with the exception of Annas Bay.
The restrictions will remain in place until the state gets 2
consecutive samples from affected areas at least 4 days apart with no
trace of the bacteria.
Napolilli urged oyster lovers to avoid eating raw oysters and instead
cook them to kill the bacteria.

[It is not clear whether the increase in the number of cases reflects
newly occurring or newly reported infections. That more oyster
harvesting sites have been closed suggests the former. Weather in the
area has cooled off after a heat wave, which brought the daily high
temperature to over 90 F between 21 and 24 Jul 2006. Today's (26 Jul
2006) high is predicted to be in the mid 70s. - Mod.LL]
