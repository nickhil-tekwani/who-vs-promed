Ministry issues rabies alert: Officials fear fishermen's dogs may
reintroduce disease
--------------------------------------------------
The government has taken the unusual step of telling prefectural
governments to prevent the spread of rabies by dogs that have not been
quarantined before entering the country from Russian ships, sources said
Fri, 27 Dec 2002.
The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has compiled a 6-point
counter-rabies blueprint for all 47 prefectural governments, including
instructions to stop dogs on foreign vessels from disembarking illegally,
to capture stray dogs, and to provide specific medical treatment for
victims bitten by stray dogs, the sources said. Many physicians in the
country are reportedly unfamiliar with rabies treatment.
The Ministry apparently has been alarmed by the growing likelihood that
dogs possibly infected with rabies may have escaped the legally required
quarantine process and landed from foreign-registered vessels at ports
nationwide, observers said.
No cases of rabies, which is communicated by mammals and can be fatal for
humans not vaccinated against it, have been reported in the country since
1957. However, the World Health Organization says that 35 000 to 50 000
people succumb to rabies in other parts of the world every year.
According to the ministry and other concerned authorities, the number of
Russian-registered vessels arriving in Japanese ports in 2000 was about
8200. While those docking at Wakkanai, Hanasaki, and Otaru ports in
Hokkaido and Fushiki-Toyama port in Toyama Prefecture accounted for about
80 percent, a number of Russian vessels also entered ports in Chiba and
Yokohama.
The Rabies Prevention Law prohibits the entry into the country of dogs that
do not undergo quarantine. At Wakkanai port -- where the largest number of
Russian vessels docked in 2000, about 3700 -- the Wakkanai public health
center has confirmed that 230 dogs went ashore from such vessels between
1998 and 2000 without being quarantined.
In May, a customs official who boarded a Russian ship at Hanasaki Port in
Nemuro, eastern Hokkaido, was bitten on a foot by a dog kept aboard by
Russian fishermen. Fortunately, the official did not suffer any injuries,
as his shoe protected his foot. However, the dog ran ashore at the port and
fled.
In the case of Fushiki-Toyama Port, a local veterinarians' association has
reported to the Toyama prefectural government that local residents had
bought or bartered goods for Russian fishermen's dogs 9 times in the 5
years up to last year.
A survey mainly conducted by a ministry study group headed by a senior
veterinary researcher at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases has
found that about 60 percent of Russian fishing boats carry dogs as
traditional good-luck mascots. Some alarming facts have surfaced. Every
year, for example, at least 10 dogs are infected by rabies in coastal areas
of the Russian Far East, where the home ports of many Russian fishing boats
are located. In addition, only about 25 percent of Russian dogs registered
with the proper authorities reportedly are vaccinated against rabies.
The situation is also disturbing on the domestic front. Under the Rabies
Prevention Law, each dog owner is required to register canine pets with
local governments and have them vaccinated against rabies once a year. In
fiscal 2000, about 5.78 million dogs were registered nationwide, of which
about 4.61 million, about 80 percent, received antirabies vaccinations.
In reality, however, a far greater number of dogs are unregistered.
According to a survey by an industrial association of pet-food
manufacturers, about 10.05 million dogs were kept in 2000. Calculations
based on the vaccination ratio of the registered dogs reveal that more than
50 percent of the dogs were not vaccinated that year.
In response to such findings, the ministry has mapped out the
counter-rabies blueprint with the cooperation of the Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries Ministry, which has jurisdiction over animal quarantines.

[Japan is one of the islands regarded free of rabies (see list in
ref 19990119.0083). To maintain this advantageous situation, Japan (and
Taipei, China -- unlike the other listed territories) requires, on top of
other measures, annual dog vaccinations.
The collected detailed Japanese data on the realistic dog-registration and
vaccination rates might be useful for studies making comparisons with other
countries that have similar rabies prevention policies. - Mod.AS]
