So far in 2008, botulism has been confirmed in 6 of 7 cases of
disease recorded in Tatarstan. In all cases the disease was
associated with smoked or dried fish of domestic preparation or
purchased by individuals in [unlicensed stalls] near markets, shops,
or public transportation stops.

The same statistics were recorded in 2007 but for the entire year.
Those cases were connected with pickled mushrooms, canned vegetables,
and canned and dried fish of domestic preparation.
