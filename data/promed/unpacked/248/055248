----------------------------------------------------------------------
Urogenital chlamydia infection was integrated into the Danish national reporting scheme in 1994. Increasing disease rates have also been encountered in Sweden and Norway, and have been characterized by a growing percentage of male patients (see graphs). [1,2] online (http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Denmark-Chlamydia.jpg; and http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Denmark-Chlamydia2.jpg)

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 1.3 per cent of women above age 30 in Aarhus county (2003 publication)
- 5.0 per cent of men seen in general practice (2005 publication)
- 15.7 per cent of women seeking abortion in Aarhus (2008 publication)

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
23 per cent of women with tubal factor infertility, and 36 per cent with a self-reported history of PID [pelvic inflammatory disease] attending fertility clinics (Aarhus, 2007 publication)
