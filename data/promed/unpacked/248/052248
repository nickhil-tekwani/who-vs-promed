The occurrence of the Uganda Variant of East African Cassava Mosaic Virus
(EACMV-Ug) in western Democratic Republic of Congo and the Congo Republic
defines the westernmost extent of the CMD pandemic in East/Central Africa

Following reports of the occurrence of severe cassava mosaic virus disease
(CMD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Congo Republic, we
investigated the possibility that the severe disease was caused by the
Uganda variant of East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV-Ug) (family
Geminiviridae; genus Begomovirus), which causes unusually severe CMD symptoms.
Cassava leaves with severe CMD symptoms were collected in August 1999 from
9 fields in Lekana, N'Sah, and Abala-Ndolo in the central part of Congo
Republic, and ... in December 2000 ... from 30 CMD-affected plants
expressing ... various ... symptoms from 12 fields in Kinshasa and
Bas-Congo Provinces of DRC.
Samples from the Congo Republic were preserved in alcohol and tested for
the presence of cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) at IITA-Ibadan by PCR
using non-specific EACMV primers and specific primers for African cassava
mosaic virus (ACMV), EACMV and EACMV-Ug (Harrison et al., 1997; Zhou et
al., 1997). For samples from the DRC, whole plant DNA was extracted
locally, but viruses were identified by PCR using specific primers for ACMV
and EACMV-Ug in Uganda.
7 of the 9 samples from the Congo Republic contained both ACMV and
EACMV-Ug, one contained EACMV-Ug alone and one produced a product with
general but not specific EACMV primers, results suggesting it was a strain
of EACMV. Of the DRC samples, 9 contained both ACMV and EACMV-Ug and 6 of
these were from plants with very severe CMD symptoms. Sites in the DRC from
which EACMV-Ug-infected samples were collected were distributed throughout
the area surveyed.
Our results confirm the occurrence of EACMV-Ug in West/Central Africa and
suggest that the area affected by this virus variant, initially described
in association with the East African CMD pandemic, extends much further
westwards than previously recognised (Legg, 1999).

[Considering the westward movement of EACMV-Ug, the virus may be present in
Cameroon and Gabon. According to FAO statistics for 2000, Cameroon and
Gabon produced about 2.1 and 0.2 million metric tonnes of cassava,
respectively. Do any of our subscribers know if surveys for CMD have been
conducted in either of these countries? - Mod.DH
