Since the beginning of 2007, the HPA's Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens
(LEP) has received 45 isolates of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Senftenberg from cases of infection not reporting foreign travel. This
compares with 10 in the same time period in 2006. A total of 34 (76 per
cent) of these isolates have been received since week 15 (8 Apr 2007).
A case was defined as a resident of England and Wales infected with a
confirmed or provisionally confirmed isolate of fully sensitive _S._
Senftenberg received by LEP on or after 8 Apr 2007. Cases reporting foreign
travel or close contact with a person with gastrointestinal disease
symptoms in the 5 days prior to the onset were excluded from this
definition. A total of 27 cases fulfilled the case definition. Onset dates
are available for 14 cases and ranged between 27 Mar and 12 May 2007.
Females accounted for 63 per cent and males 37 per cent. Most of the cases
are adults and have been reported from laboratories in all HPA regions and
Wales.
A UK study of the microbiological quality of retail fresh herbs carried out
by the Health Protection Agency (HPA Centre for Infections -CfI- and
Regional Microbiology Network [RMN]) and the Local Authorities Coordinators
of Regulatory Services (LACORS) began in May 2007. To date, 7 samples of
pre-packed fresh basil, grown and packed in Israel, have tested positive
for _Salmonella_ spp by HPA RMN Food, Water, and Environmental Laboratories
in Newcastle, London, Bristol, and the NPHS-Wales Microbiology Carmarthen.
Results are available for 4 of the 7 isolates, which have been confirmed as
_S._ Senftenberg.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was carried out on 2 of the basil
isolates, which was given the PFGE profile SSFTXB.0014 (1). Of the human
isolates tested so far and received after week 15, 14 (50 per cent) are
SSFTXB.0014.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a food alert on 25 May 2007, warning
consumers not to eat basil from the same batches that were found to be
contaminated at the time (2).

Officials from the Israeli Ministries of Health and Agriculture are
investigating whether a shipment of basil grown in Israel is responsible
for several cases of salmonella infection in Europe.
On Mon 4 Jun 2007, the ministry received reports of the discovery of the
Senftenberg strain of salmonellosis infecting several dozen people in
England, Scotland, Denmark, and Holland within a few months. An
epidemiological inquiry led researchers abroad to suspect that the source
of the poisoning was basil originating in Israel.
Following the report, the Ministry of Health located all Israeli exporters
who sent basil shipments to the locations in question during the estimated
time window and narrowed the investigation to 3 exporters.
Agricultural officials are currently examining soil and product samples
from all 3 and the results are expected on 6 Jun 2007. Health officials
have already finished testing the irrigation water for the fields in
question and no abnormalities were found.
"The salmonella bacteria, along with an additional bacteria called
_Shigella_, is one of the leading causes of intestinal diseases," said Dr
Alex Levinthal, head of the ministry's public health department. Dr
Levinthal said he seriously doubted that the alleged strain of salmonella
would have caused such serious morbidity.
Professor Manfred Green, the director of Israel's Center for Disease
Control, told Ynet that "there is absolutely no health risk to the Israeli
public."

[Serotype Senftenberg has been described causing outbreaks of salmonellosis
associated with community (1) and hospital spread (2).
Of note, a strain of this organism (775W), originally isolated from
pasteurized egg yolk, was found to be considerably more heat resistant than
other salmonellae including other strains of Senftenberg (3, 4).
It certainly appears that the Israeli basil is involved, given the finding
of matching PFGE profiles of salmonella from basil and stool specimens.
These postings do not state the degree of distribution of the basil.
A picture of the herb can be found at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil>,
where a discussion includes "The word basil comes from the Greek
_basileus_, meaning "king", as it is believed to have grown above the spot
where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The Oxford
English Dictionary quotes speculations that basil may have been used in
'some royal unguent, bath, or medicine'."
