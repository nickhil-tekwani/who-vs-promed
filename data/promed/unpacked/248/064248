As many as 11 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been detected in Arunachal Pradesh, a statement from the health department said on Monday [15 Jul 2019].

JE is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by mosquitoes. JE is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year.

Lobsang Jampa, the state's senior statistical officer for integrated disease surveillance programme said that 5 positive cases have been detected in East Siang district and 3 from the Papum Pare district. He also said 3 other patients, each from Upper Subansiri, Lohit and Kra Daadi districts, have tested positive for the viral disease. However, no deaths have reported from anywhere in the state till date due to JE. All the 11 patients who have tested positive with JE virus are under treatment in various hospitals, Jampa said.

"There is no cause of alarm. Any cases of fever with stiffness of body, drowsiness, etc. should be reported to health facilities for confirmation and treatment," Jampa said. He said the state's department of health and family welfare has initiated all preventive measures and other necessary steps in the wake of the rising cases of the mosquitoborne disease in neighboring Assam. Meanwhile, the medical officers of all the districts have been alerted and asked to step up their surveillance, anti-vectors measures and information, education and communication (IEC) activities.

[Although the number of JE cases in Arunachal Pradesh state is not increasing as much as in neighboring Assam state, nevertheless, cases have increased from 7 reported 2 days ago to the 11 reported above. This is the season for transmission of JE virus in north eastern India, including Arunachal Pradesh, where JE cases have been reported before. Interestingly, no mention is made of non-JE acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in this report above or in the previous one from the state, although there are hundreds of AES cases reported in neighboring Assam state currently. - Mod.TY
