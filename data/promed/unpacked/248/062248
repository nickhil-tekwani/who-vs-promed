Historically speaking, the "classic" causes of epidemic gangrenous lesions
are ergotism and typhus. The Serbian typhus epidemic of World War I caused
large numbers of cases of gangrene, sometimes symmetrical, and typically on
the extremities and distal areas. I wonder also, lacking full information,
whether toxic alimentary aleukia is a possibility, although that should be
easy to rule out epidemiologically, and would seem doubtful given the
locale and season.

[The only description of the current illness available to us from a
newswire report is an illness characterized by blackening of the hands and
feet followed by high fever and death. Dave's correlation of epidemic
gangrene with outbreaks of typhus and ergotism are on target.
The mention of alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) is an interesting hypothesis.
ATA is a disease characterized by nausea, vomiting, and hemorrhagic
phenomenon associated with bone marrow suppression and ultimate aplastic
anemic (total bone marrow failure) associated with fungal contamination of
grain resulting in the production of a T-2 mycotoxin. Mycotoxins are
naturally occurring substances produced by fungi as a secondary metabolite.
Many of these toxins are pathogenic to animals and humans. The T-2
mycotoxin (a trichothecene mycotoxin) is elaborated from the fusarial
species of fungus. The T-2 mycotoxin has been used as a biological weapon.
An outbreak of ATA occurred in the Orenburg district of Russia during World
War II. As most men in the village were fighting in the war, the wheat crop
was left unharvested, resulting in the crop remaining in the fields over
the winter. It was harvested in the spring and eaten, causing an outbreak
of ATA, with reported mortality rates from 10 to 60 per cent. Of note,
ProMED-mail posted a concern about fungal contamination of wheat in
Pakistan in 2001 - additional food for thought here.
At this point we are left with speculations and would greatly appreciate
more informed information on this current outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
