[1] Convalescent plasma
Date: Thu 22 Oct 2020
Source: MSN, CNN report [abridged, edited]
https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/convalescent-plasma-did-not-reduce-covid-19-deaths-or-keep-patients-from-severe-illness-in-new-study/ar-BB1ajdcp?ocid=uxbndlbing


In a new study, convalescent plasma did not reduce deaths among COVID-19 patients or prevent moderate disease from becoming severe. The study, conducted in India and published in the medical journal the BMJ [see reference below] on Thursday [22 Oct 2020], suggests that "as a potential treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19, convalescent plasma showed limited effectiveness."

Convalescent plasma is the antibody-rich serum taken from the blood of people who recovered from COVID-19. The idea is that the plasma can help the immune response of patients still fighting the disease.

In August [2020], the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of convalescent plasma as a treatment option for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, data were still being collected in randomized controlled trials -- the gold standard -- to study the safety and effectiveness of the treatment. Last month [September 2020], a National Institutes of Health panel said there's no evidence backing the use of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus patients and that doctors should not treat it as a standard of care until more study has been done.

Randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients are still underway in the United States. The new study, called the PLACID trial, included data on 464 adults with moderate COVID-19 in 39 hospitals across India. Among them, 235 patients were randomly selected to receive convalescent plasma along with standard care for treatment and 229 patients received only standard care. The new study showed that a higher proportion of patients who received convalescent plasma saw improvements in their symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath compared with those given standard care, but there was no difference between patients when it came to resolving fever and cough. The proportion of patients who needed invasive ventilation did not differ among the 2 groups, and overall, the researchers found that 34 patients who received convalescent plasma, or 15%, had died -- compared with 31 who were given standard care, or 14%.

The study had some limitations, including that it was an "open label design" so the physicians treating the patients knew who was given convalescent plasma and who wasn't. Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of patients in other parts of the world.

Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, called the new study "a blow" to the use of convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment. "While this is a blow to the use of plasma therapy for COVID-19, it should not be abandoned, there may be ways to refine it as a treatment and deliver solid, demonstrable benefits," Clarke said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre.

"Use of someone's blood plasma that contains antibodies against a virus or bacteria to treat an infection in someone else, is not a new technology and although usually safe, is not entirely without risk," said Clarke, who was not involved in the new study. "The PLACID trial was able to show a small effect on the rate at which patients were able to rid themselves of the virus, but this was not enough to improve their recovery from the disease," he added. "In simple terms, there were no clinical benefits to the patients."

Martin Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, noted that convalescent plasma is "quite literally, a mixed bag." Some donors in the new study had lower levels of key antibodies, which may mean the therapy wouldn't be as effective.

And while this is the largest randomized trial of convalescent plasma to complete so far, Landray said, it's still too small to give clear answers. Landray co-leads a large COVID-19 treatment trial, the Recovery Trial, which is also studying convalescent plasma [see below]. Larger trials are needed for clear results, he said in a statement, "and even then there would still be questions about whether different types of patients respond better or worse. For example, one could well imagine that the treatment might work particularly well in those earlier in the course of the disease or who have not been able to mount a good antibody response to the virus of their own," Landray said. "But such speculation needs to be tested -- we can't just rely on an educated guess."

Kai Kupferschmidt retweet of Martin Landary https://mobile.twitter.com/MartinLandray/status/1319683110859165697 reporting on a trial with 2000 patients evaluating convalescent plasma as a treatment compared to standard care by National Health Service (NHS, UK).
"An update: By yesterday morning [22 Oct 2020], RECOVERY had enrolled the 2000th patient into the comparison of convalescent plasma vs. usual NHS care alone. That is 1000 patients in just 17 days. It is too early to have results - remember the primary outcome is 28-day mortality.
"1st report: RECOVERY trial has just passed 1000 patients randomised to convalescent plasma vs. usual NHS care alone; the largest trial of this treatment in the world convalescent plasma has been widely used in some countries but we don't know if it works. RECOVERY will tell us the answer."

Hopefully, the RECOVERY trial with 2000 patients and a control group will address the problems in the earlier studies that lacked a control group and/or had a small sample size. See https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/immune-based-therapy/blood-derived-products/convalescent-plasma/, dated 9 Oct 2020:

"Currently, there are insufficient data from well-controlled, adequately powered, randomized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. However, more than 70 000 patients in the United States have received COVID-19 convalescent plasma through the Mayo Clinic's Expanded Access Program (EAP), which was designed primarily to provide broad access to investigational convalescent plasma and thus did not include an untreated control arm. Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Mayo Clinic performed retrospective, indirect evaluations of efficacy by using the Mayo Clinic EAP data, hypothesizing that patients who received plasma units with higher titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies would have better clinical outcomes than those who received plasma units with lower antibody titers. The results of their analyses suggest that convalescent plasma with high antibody titers may be more beneficial than low-titer plasma in nonintubated patients, particularly when administered within 72 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis.

"The FDA determined that these findings -- along with additional data from small randomized and nonrandomized studies, observational cohorts, and animal experiments -- met the criteria for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issuance.2,3 Despite meeting the "may be effective" criterion for EUA issuance, the EAP analyses are not sufficient to establish the efficacy or safety of convalescent plasma due to the lack of a randomized, untreated control group and potential confounding. There is no widely available and generally agreed-upon best test for measuring neutralizing antibodies, and the antibody titers of plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are highly variable. Furthermore, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may already have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers that are comparable to those of plasma donors, potentially limiting the benefit of convalescent plasma in this patient population. Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials of COVID-19 convalescent plasma are ongoing." - Mod.LK]

[2] Europe resurgence
Date: Sun 25 Oct 2020

In Spain on Sunday [25 Oct 2020], government officials declared a state of emergency. In France, deaths were rising as hospitals struggled to keep up a rising tide of patients. And Italy, the 1st Western country to impose a general lockdown early in the pandemic, officials announced new restrictions they hoped would preclude the need for a 2nd.

It was a grim weekend for Europe, which once seemed to have put the virus in check after some countries imposed stringent restrictions. "The reality is that Europe and Spain are immersed in a 2nd wave of the pandemic," the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez said after a meeting of cabinet officials on Sunday [25 Oct 2020]. In addition to declaring a state of emergency, the government ordered a nationwide curfew to begin on Sunday [25 Oct 2020] that will limit Spaniards' movement between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., except in the Canary Islands, where there are fewer new cases. The new emergency powers also mean regional officials can impose harsher restrictions on movement between areas and limit gatherings to 6 people.

Spain last week became the 1st Western European country to surpass a million confirmed cases, and Mr. Sanchez said he would ask Parliament to approve the state of emergency until May [2021].

In France, which quickly caught up to the million mark, the numbers seemed to just be climbing. On Sunday [25 Oct 2020], the authorities announced a record 52 010 new cases, the 4th day in a row they exceeded 40 000. After months of falling intensive care numbers, French health workers are back in the trenches. In the Loire, which has been badly hit by the virus, the authorities struck a reassuring tone. "The situation is indisputably disturbing, and very tense in the hospitals, but we have it under control," one health official told Agence France-Presse.

The French government last week expanded its nightly curfew to 38 more regions and Polynesia.

In Poland, which has been combating one of the most severe outbreaks in Europe, President Andrzej Duda has tested positive for the coronavirus just days after the deputy prime minister entered quarantine after exposure to somebody who was infected.

And in Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also tightened restrictions on Sunday [25 Oct 2020], ordering early closures of bars and restaurants and the total shutdown of gyms, swimming pools, theaters, cinemas, and concert halls. For the next month [?through November 2020], bars, pubs, ice cream shops, pastry shops, and restaurants will be allowed to stay open on weekends but will have to shut down at 6 p.m. The government also "strongly recommended" that employers increase remote work, and that citizens avoid leaving their home districts as much as possible. Italians, Mr Conte said, must be willing to make "small sacrifices" like eating dinner at home and giving up on theaters or concerts. "If we don't think like this, we won't be able to keep the curve of contagion under control and manage the pandemic," he said. "These measures are necessary, and I hope sufficient."

[3] China: Xinjiang "silent" outbreak
Date: Sun 25 Oct 2020
Source: Yahoo News, Reuters report [edited]
https://www.yahoo.com/news/mainland-china-reports-15-coronavirus-014559558.html


China detected 137 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases on Sunday [25 Oct 2020] in Kashgar in the northwestern region of Xinjiang after one person was found to have the virus the previous day -- the 1st local new cases for 10 days in mainland China.

All 137 new cases were linked to a garment factory. The parents of a 17-year-old girl who was found on Saturday [24 Oct 2020] to have the virus but showed no symptoms worked there, an official from Xinjiang health commission told a press briefing.

The new cases marked mainland China's 1st local infections since [14 Oct 2020], when one was detected in Qingdao. Xinjiang was the site of a local cluster in August [2020], but no new cases had been found in the region since [15 Aug 2020].

Kashgar launched a testing programme on Saturday night [24 Oct 2020] covering the region's 4.75 million people. As of Sunday afternoon [25 Oct 2020], more than 2.84 million people had been tested and the rest would be covered by Tuesday [27 Oct 2020], the city government said in a statement.

The Kashgar government said on Sunday [25 Oct 2020] all schools except universities will be closed through Friday [30 Oct 2020] but supermarkets and shopping malls would remain open.

Four towns in the Kashgar region were identified as "high-risk" areas, according to a statement from Kashgar city authority on Sunday night [25 Oct 2020], and stringent controls such as travel restrictions are expected.

China's national health commission dispatched experts on Sunday to guide coronavirus control work in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar.

The novel coronavirus was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year [2019]. As of Saturday [24 Oct 2020], mainland China had 85 790 confirmed coronavirus cases, the health authority said. The COVID-19 death toll stands at 4634.

[As mentioned in the media report above, Xinjiang was the location of an outbreak back in August 2020 that involved 831 cases (see COVID-19 update (361): tuberculosis, pandemics, selected countries, WHO, global 20200816.7683792), although Kashgar was not heavily affected in that outbreak. The obvious question is, where did the index case infection come from? Have there been importations into Xinjiang that have gone undetected due to false negative tests? The impressive information is the identification of 137 asymptomatic infections after identification of the 17-year-old. The fact that all infections were found in individuals working in a garment factory where the parents worked suggests that the garment factory may well have been the "incubator" for enhanced transmission.

A map of China showing provinces can be found at https://www.travelchinaguide.com/images/map/overall.jpg. (Kashgar is also known as Kashi and is called that on the map). Kashgar is known as a trading center and was a major hub on the Great Silk Road. (https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/kashghar). - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 217.

Data by country, area, or territory for 25 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct25_1603659088.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 36.5% of daily case numbers and 48.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 19.4 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Chile 1636, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic.

- The European region reported 42.6% of daily case numbers and 25.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 9.2 million. Countries not reporting cases today (25 Oct 2020) include Spain, Ukraine, Israel, Kazakhstan, Sweden, Switzerland, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Norway. France is dominant (45 388), followed by the UK, Italy, Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Armenia, Croatia, and Turkey. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Slovenia, Georgia, Portugal, and Bulgaria.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4% of daily case numbers and 10.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.9 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Morocco, Iraq, Jordan, Tunisia, UAE, and Lebanon. Libya, Pakistan, and Kuwait, each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman, Somalia, and Yemen did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.0% of daily case numbers and 1.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.29 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Angola, Madagascar, Mozambique, Uganda, and Cabo Verde.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.94% of daily case numbers and 0.58% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.70 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 13.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 13.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.8 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Even though this is a decreased reporting period ("weekend artifact") and 9 countries with known transmission ongoing that did not report in the European region, there are still 19 countries in the European region that were reporting more than 1000 new cases in 24 hours and 7 countries reporting more than 10 000 cases. The Americas region combined with the European region account for almost 80% of daily reported cases and almost 75% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

[There are now 8 countries that have reported more than 1 million cases: the USA, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia. In the past 24 hours, the USA (61 247), France (52 010), and India (45 158) have been dominant. A global total of 4239 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (24-25 Oct 2020), probably reflecting a decrease related to weekend reporting artifact. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Pakistan, Sweden, Kazakhstan, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Tunisia.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (16 countries) include the USA, France, India, Italy (21 273), UK (19 790), Spain (not reported in last 24 hours), Belgium (17 709), Russia (16 710), Brazil (12 904), Poland (11 742), Netherlands (10 202), Germany (9829), Argentina (9253), Colombia (8174), Czech Republic (7300), Iran (6191), and Ukraine (6088). A total of 10 countries reported more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours, 7 of which were in the European region. A total of 45 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 45 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 were from the Americas region, 8 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 4 were from the South East Asia region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 20.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.2%. In the USA, the 7-day average differences in case counts have increased by 26.7% and daily reported deaths have increased by 14.8%. Iran has had an increase of 27.1% in average daily case counts and 17.9% in daily reported deaths.

To get a sense of the magnitude of the situation in Europe, Coleman Schaefer has created growth curves from the Worldometer data set we maintain. The region is divided into 3 curves based on the order of magnitude of cumulative case counts, from highest to lowest.
Curve 1: https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/usa-pdf/Europe%20growth%20curve%201%2025%20Oct%202020_1603683651.pdf

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Europe is once again the 2nd region in terms of cumulative case counts, surpassing the South East Asia region once again. Note that the cumulative case count has surpassed 43 million as predicted. - Mod.MPP]
