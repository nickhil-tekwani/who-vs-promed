Unexplained neurological illness in cattle and sheep - assessing the
potential risks to human health
----------------------------------------------------
Following a recent announcement by the Department of the Environment Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) concerning cattle and sheep with an undiagnosed
encephalitic illness, the Health Protection Agency were tasked with
convening a group of experts to assess the potential risk to human health.
At the meeting, which was held on 21 Jun 2004, experts reviewed information
about the original case in a heifer, another unrelated case in a bull, and
20 cases in sheep which had occurred over a 10 year period. They were also
informed of a further 7 adult cattle submitted under BSE Orders between
2000 and 2003. Recent laboratory investigations from the original case in a
heifer identified an enterovirus as the most likely cause of infection,
which is unlikely to pose a threat to human health. Samples from the other
cases will now also be tested for enteroviruses.
Dr Dilys Morgan, who led the group on behalf of the Agency, said; "It is
reassuring that the cause of illness in the heifer has been identified.
Enteroviruses are a common cause of illness in both animals and humans,
however they do not usually cross between species. This combined with the
fact that animals are examined prior to slaughter by a veterinary surgeon
and any with symptoms of acute viral disease are prevented from entering
the food chain, and that enteroviruses are killed by heat, means that this
case is thought unlikely to pose any risk to human health".
In considering the available data on all the cases, the group of experts
agreed that for a variety of reasons they also didn't pose a significant
risk to human health. These reasons included the fact that there was no
increasing trend in the low number of samples being submitted for testing
from cows and sheep with neurological illness over the last 10 years, and
that no apparent link has been identified between these cases and the cases
represented a variety of clinical and pathological findings.
Dr Morgan concluded, "As more evidence becomes available we will continue
to assess the risk, but the information we have so far suggests that these
cases are unlikely to pose a significant risk to human health."

The recent case of what is described as a type of cattle poliomyelitis in a
young cow in Britain is reminiscent of similar cases reported in the 1970s
in the USA and in Germany. In 1995 a paper (1) by a German group described
the isolation of a viral agent from brain explants of a 15 month old heifer
with clinical signs of sporadic encephalomyelitis. The nucleocapsid
structures were reminiscent of those of paramyxoviruses, and positive
fluorescence reactions were obtained with sera obtained from sub-acute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) patients and with rabbit hyperimmune
anti-rinderpest virus antiserum.
In 1979 a similar paper was published detailing a case from the USA(2). The
virus was found in an animal experimentally infected with malignant
catarrhal fever virus. Again in indirect fluorescence tests, the agent
reacted with both measles and rinderpest virus antisera, and the authors
stated that this was the 1st report of a morbillivirus isolation from North
American cattle.
In 1994, during the course of a project to complete the sequence of the
rinderpest virus genome (3), we found very major differences in the
sequence of the matrix (M) protein gene derived from our virus isolate from
that which had been published by an American group (4). The difference in
isolates was that Limo & Yilma had sequenced the purported wild type virus
and we had sequenced the vaccine strain derived from this virus. Curiously
all the other genes of the 2 viruses showed >97 per cent identity. We
independently sequenced the wild type strain derived from a different
source and found it to be almost identical to our vaccine strain sequence.
The conclusion we came to was that the American sequence was derived from a
contaminating virus present in the primary bovine cells used to culture the
virus for sequencing, which was most likely related to the unknown
morbillivirus-like viruses found in the previous bovine cases. In addition,
it was noted that one of the unvaccinated control animals used in a vaccine
trial to test vaccinia recombinant viruses at the Plum Island laboratory in
New York (5), had cross-neutralizing antibodies to rinderpest virus prior
to challenge, indicating exposure to another morbillivirus. The animal was
not protected from rinderpest, however. A similar virus could be the
causative agent of the current meningoencephalitis case.

[The DEFRA announcement, and Dr Barrett's comment, taken together, suggest
that the identity of the causative agent remains uncertain, and it cannot
be assumed that the same agent is responsible for these rare cases of
poliomyelitis-like illness in cattle and sheep.
Enteroviruses are ubiquitous small RNA viruses that multiply in the
gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals but can also multiply in other
tissues, including neural tissue. In humans, clinical manifestations
include mild meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, myocarditis, and
conjunctivitis. However, infection may frequently be asymptomatic:
currently, more than 30 different human echoviruses are recognized that
have no association with any known disease. Less is known about the
diversity of animal enteroviruses, the foot and mouth disease viruses
apart. Consequently, the detection of an uncharacterized enterovirus in a
single case is difficult to evaluate in the absence of other corroborating
evidence.
Tom Barrett has drawn together some disparate observations, well-supported
by experimental data, which suggest that a previously unsuspected
morbillivirus-like paramyxovirus may be prevalent in some domestic animals.
The morbilliviruses -- which include the distemper viruses of carnivores,
rinderpest of bovines, and the human measles viruses -- are all associated
with neurological disease. The final diagnosis is still some way off. On
the other hand, DEFRA's interim conclusion, that these cases are unlikely
to pose a significant risk to human health, seems reasonable on the basis
of the information available so far. - Mod.CP]
