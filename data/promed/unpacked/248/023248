Spain's Health Ministry has warned against consuming sunflower oil
following the discovery of a contaminated batch from Ukraine,
national radio said on Friday [25 Apr 2008].

The oil was said to be contaminated with aliphatic hydrocarbons. The
Ministry said there was no risk to the public but urged caution until
it could determine which brands were affected and recall all oil concerned.

Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.

Contaminated rapeseed oil was blamed for the death of some 1200
people in 1981 in Spain's worst food poisoning epidemic. Victims and
their families were still claiming compensation and holding
demonstrations 20 years later.

[This article is fairly vague by not providing more about what the
contamination is. An aliphatic hydrocarbon is a very broad category.
It simply means it does not have a benzene ring in its structure. But
some aliphatic hydrocarbons include, such things as methane, ethane,
acetylene. Some of these may be quite flammable.

How is someone to be cautious except to avoid all the sunflower oils
until more information is released.

The toxic oil poisoning in 1981 may have been a variety of
contaminants in the cooking oil, but aniline was the only agent
mentioned. - Mod.TG]

[More information on the nature of the contamination would be greatly
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
