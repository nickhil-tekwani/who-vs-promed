Ducks Died Of Fungal Infection
-----------------------
State and federal officials have confirmed that about 2,500 mallard
ducks found dead southeast of Burley, died of an acute fungus
infection.
The official cause of death is acute aspergillosis, a respiratory
tract infection caused by a fungus commonly found in soil, dead
leaves, moldy grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation.
Test results from University of Idaho's Caine Veterinary Teaching
Center in Caldwell confirmed the presence of the fungus in tissue
samples taken from the ducks this week. The results confirm
preliminary diagnoses at two other wildlife health labs in Washington
and Wisconsin.
The fungus can cause respiratory tract infections in birds that
inhale the spores. The most likely source of the spores for these
ducks is moldy grain, but no specific site has been found as the
source.
Waterfowl die-offs are common and many happen in the United States
every year. During the past six months, 16 events each involving more
than 1,000 birds occurred. Testing for diseases is a routine part of
the investigation of waterfowl die-offs.
The first dead ducks were found by a hunter Friday, December 8, along
Land Creek Springs near Oakley. Idaho Department of Fish and Game was
notified, and conservation officers found 10 dead ducks near the
spring and along the stream's edge.
Officers returned to the area on December 10 to find more than 500
dead ducks. By the end of clean-up operations Thursday morning, the
number had grown to about 2,500. Though a small proportion of the
duck population in Idaho or the United States, the number of dead
birds in this die-off is unusual for Idaho.
Officials initially considered it unlikely that avian influenza was
the cause of this die-off. Widespread testing of waterfowl in fall of
2006 has not found the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1
in the United States.
Tissue samples from dead birds were not consistent with avian
influenza, but as a precaution samples were sent to U.S. Geological
Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin for testing.
Results from the first group of ducks tested confirmed that they did
not have the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 that is
currently of concern in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Results from additional tests are pending.
The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, Department of
Agriculture and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service helped with the
investigation of this outbreak.
Hunters are advised not to kill any obviously sick animals, including
ducks and other waterfowl.
