Outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease caused by coxsackie A16 virus in
a childcare centre in Croatia, February to March 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Ljubin-Sternak S, Slavic-Vrzic V, Vilibic-aavlek T, et al]

Summary
-------
We describe an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in a
childcare centre in a district of Zagreb county, north west Croatia. A
total of 11 cases of HFMD occurred in the childcare centre and another
9 were reported from nearby areas in the district. Coxsackie A16 virus
[CA16] was diagnosed in 13 clinical specimens obtained from 11
symptomatic and asymptomatic children. All cases resolved without
complications.

Outbreak description
--------------------
On 2 Mar 2011, the Department of Epidemiology of Zagreb County
Institute of Public Health was contacted by a health professional from
a childcare centre in Bregana, Samobor district, reporting 4 children
with vesicular stomatitis and rash (hand-foot-mouth disease, HFMD) in
the weeks before. The centre cares for 160 children at 2 locations and
comprises 8 classes (7 classes in the main building complex and one
class in a house nearby). 3 cases were from one class at the 1st
location and a 4th case was from the nearby house.

On the same day that the cases were reported, the epidemiologist
found another 2 children with the same symptoms in the same class of
the main building complex. The epidemiologist immediately reported the
cases to the Reference Epidemiology Centre at the Croatian National
Institute of Public Health. The day after, mouth swabs and stools were
collected for viral culture from all children in the 2 affected
classes. After active case finding (parent questionnaire,
paediatrician reports), another 5 cases were found in other classes of
the same childcare centre (11 cases in total). In this investigation,
only symptomatic individuals were considered as cases, irrespective of
laboratory-confirmation. All cases presented with a mild clinical
picture of disease, with no complications, and only 4 of the 11
children attending the childcare centre stayed at home until they
recovered. The affected classes were neither closed, nor were infected
children separated. The management of the childcare centre was rather
instructed to carry out an extensive cleaning and disinfection of all
surfaces, toys, furnishings, toilets, and other objects, while parents
were given written materials on disease transmission and how to avoid
it. No further cases occurred in the childcare centre after 14 Mar
2011.

The epidemiologist also identified 9 cases, outside the childcare
centre, retrospectively by active case finding. These cases were also
preschool children, aged 1 to 4 years, living in the Samobor district,
which comprises about 43 000 inhabitants. The 9 cases were all
diagnosed by 4 primary care paediatricians taking care of most of the
children in the area. After the outbreak in the childcare centre was
recognised, the epidemiologist in charge of the investigation checked
with them all the records and asked to report further cases. None of
the cases outside the childcare centre were laboratory-investigated.

HFMD is a syndrome characterised by vesicular stomatitis and
cutaneous lesions of the distal extremities and it is usually caused
by CA16 or enterovirus 71 (E71). These viruses are genetically closely
related and are both serotypes of the human enterovirus A (HEV-A)
species, _Picornaviridae_ family. HFMD has a worldwide occurrence.
Outbreaks occur frequently among groups of children in childcare
centres and schools. Transmission is by faecal-oral route and by
exposure to throat discharges or fluid from blisters. In the absence
of cutaneous lesions, oral lesions of HFMD may be mistaken for
aphthous ulcers or herpes simplex gingivostomatitis. Although
described, neurologic complications of HFMD caused by CA16 are rare
when compared to the disease caused by E71. Diagnosis of HFMD is
usually based on the clinical picture alone. Laboratory diagnosis is
usually performed by virus isolation of cell culture from throat swabs
and stool specimens.

Enterovirus infections are notifiable diseases in Croatia. Usually,
there are few reports of sporadic cases of HFMD each year, diagnosed
based on the clinical picture alone. There are also several different
serotypes of enteroviruses isolated in Croatia each year but
laboratory confirmed cases caused by CA16 virus have not been
registered until now.

Discussion
----------
CA16 and E71 are prevalent in many parts of the world, especially in
south-east Asia, but also in European countries. In Croatia CA16
infections have not been documented until now, although these occur in
neighbouring countries. The traditional technique for detecting and
characterising enteroviruses, also used in this laboratory, relies on
viral isolation in cell culture followed by neutralisation using
reference antisera. However, no single cell line exists that is
capable of growing all human enteroviruses. In 2004, RD(A) cells were
introduced into the routine laboratory diagnostic algorithm for
enterovirus culture together with previously used GMK and L20B cells.
This has resulted in the detection of HEV-A viruses including CA16 and
E71, which grow poorly, if at all, in the other 2 cell lines used in
our laboratory. Immediate collection of clinical specimens by the
epidemiologist during the investigation of this outbreak also
contributed to the successful isolation of CA16.

CA16 and E71 are associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks of
HFMD, and rare cases of acute neurological diseases. The HFMD outbreak
reported here confirmed the previously observed characteristics of
CA16 infection. An outbreak occurred in a childcare centre in children
aged 1.5 to 5.5 years, who seem to be the most susceptible age group
for CA16 infection. A seroprevalence study in Germany showed that 2/3
of children aged 1 to 4 years do not posses neutralising antibodies to
CA16. HFMD is a highly contagious disease, but the manifestation rate
of infection is low. A large number of exposed children in this
outbreak were infected as by laboratory confirmation (11/35). Most of
the infected children were asymptomatic (8/11). The illness is usually
mild without complications, as confirmed during this outbreak. The
number of positive stool specimens versus throat swabs in symptomatic
as well as asymptomatic children in this report confirmed that stool
is the most appropriate clinical specimen for enteroviruses in which
they survive for a long period.

In conclusion, a prompt reaction of the Epidemiology Service and the
thorough investigation that followed, allowed the successful
implementation of control measures, which prevented further spreading
of the HFMD outbreak in the childcare centre. CA16 appeared to have
been circulating in the Samobor area from February [2011], but as
symptoms are mild or absent in most cases, many parents may not have
sought medical help for their children.

Coxsackie viruses are separable into 2 groups, A and B, based on
their effects on newborn mice (coxsackie A results in muscle injury,
paralysis, and death; coxsackie B results in organ damage but less
severe outcomes). Type A viruses cause herpangina (painful blisters in
the mouth, throat, hands, feet, or in all these areas).
Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is the common name of this viral
infection. Coxsackie A 16 causes the majority of HFMD infections in
Europe and the Americas. It usually occurs in children (age 10 and
under), but adults can also develop the condition. Type A also causes
conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyelids and white area of the
eye). Type B viruses cause epidemic pleurodynia (fever, lung, and
abdominal pain with headache that lasts about 2 to 12 days and
resolves). Pleurodynia is also termed Bornholm disease.

Both types of viruses (A and B) can cause meningitis, myocarditis,
and pericarditis, but these occur infrequently from coxsackie
infections. Infection usually is spread by fecal-oral contamination,
although occasionally the virus is spread by droplets expelled by
infected individuals. Items like utensils, diaper-changing tables, and
toys that come in contact with body fluids that contain the virus may
also transmit them to other individuals. Although people of any age
can get infected, the majority of patients identified with coxsackie
infection are children (see MedicineNet.com
http://www.medicinenet.com/coxsackie_virus/article.htm).
