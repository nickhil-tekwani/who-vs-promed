There have been at least 20 000 cases of flu in Australia this season, more than double last year's [2013] number, with the traditional September spike still to come. Young mothers have been identified as the group most at risk of catching influenza, with experts saying the official numbers are "only the tip of the iceberg" when it comes to how many cases of the flu there have actually been this year [2014].

There have been 20 979 lab-confirmed cases this year [2014], according to the Influenza Specialist Group (ISG), but influenza expert Dr Alan Hampson said doctors only sent influenza swabs to the labs for very serious cases, so a big chunk of flu cases -- people who did not see the doctor when they had the flu or people who went to the doctor but did not have an extreme case -- was missing from the data. "The numbers fluctuate from year to year. It depends on a range of things. This particular virus circulating is the so-called swine flu, and it's interesting that this virus has a greater impact on younger people, including younger healthy people," he said.

Hampson said the latest strain of flu was similar to what had been experienced in the northern hemisphere and had come over on "jumbo jets." He said women made up the majority of cases in the statistics, and young women were highly represented. "This either means they are getting the flu more than men, or they are getting more serious cases than men," he said.

The majority of recorded cases of influenza have been in Queensland, where there have been 5959 lab-confirmed cases. New South Wales has had 5375, Victoria 2473, South Australia 1797, Western Australia 1722, Northern Territory 331, Tasmania 197 and the Australian capital Territory 284. Hampson said there were still about 6 weeks left of what is colloquially known as "flu season," and it was likely people still had time to get the vaccine, but at this stage, it is more important to avoid crowded places and make sure people wash their hands.

He said take-ups of the flu vaccine were relatively low even among at-risk groups, so the general population was not protected at all. He said women were more likely to get the flu as they often had more contact with children, who were notorious carriers of germs.

[According to the most recent information [see: WHO Global Update [Influenza (20) in ProMED-mail, and WHO Update 216 covering Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2014_07_28_surveillance_update_216.pdf?ua=1], both Australia and New Zealand reported an increase in ILI (influenza-like illnesses) and the number of influenza detections suggesting the influenza season has started. The above report from Australia provides additional support. The main virus detected was reported to be influenza A(H1N1)pmd09.

In Australia, ILI activity had begun to increase during the previous week, and overall activity remained consistent with the expected seasonal trend. The notification of laboratory confirmed cases had also begun to show an increase during the last few weeks. In New Zealand, the ILI consultation rate was above the seasonal threshold, but remained below the New Zealand average epidemic curve with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 the most frequently detected influenza virus. In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with a decreasing trend observed in several islands. However, in American Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, and Vanuatu, ILI activity increased. It is likely that, as in Australia, an overall increase in influenza cases will be observed. Despite the enhanced number of cases in Australia and its neighbours, there have been no reports of novel human influenza viruses, and the new Northern Hemisphere vaccine should be effective against the next Northern Hemisphere epidemic. - Mod.CP
