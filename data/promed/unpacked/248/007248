South Korea has confirmed a 16th wild boar infected with African swine fever (ASF) near the inter-Korean border in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province. The National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) under the Environment Ministry said on Tue [29 Oct 2019] that a wild boar found dead on Sunday [27 Oct 2019] in an area 3.5 km south from the Civilian Control Line tested positive for the virus.

A NIER official said that the carcass was found about 900 meters from an area where a similar ASF case was confirmed on 20 Oct 2019.

The official added that the latest case was found just outside an area around which electric fences were already installed and that additional fencing will be erected as soon as possible.

[The above 16th wild boar confirmed as ASF-infected near the inter-Korean border has been notified to the OIE in follow-up report No. 18, submitted and published on Tue 29 Oct 2019. Links to the said and to the 18 previous reports (including the immediate notification) are available in OIE's summary of the ASF event in S. Korea, which started on 16 Sep 2019, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31778. The summary includes also an interactive map presenting the locations of the 30 accumulated outbreaks, of which 14 were in domestic pigs (12 on farms, 2 in backyards) and 16 in wild boars.

No new outbreaks in domestic pigs have been reported since 2 Oct 2019.

According to Korea's media, the government has recently decided to establish fences across the country from east to west, namely from the western border city of Paju to Goseong in the east coast, to stop the penetration of ASF-infected wild boars from North Korea, where the virus is suspected to have become widely spread since its (solitary) report, notifying the disease, dated 30 May 2019 (20190530.6494781).

The S. Korean authorities also decided to expand the areas where hunting of wild boars is allowed as part of broader measures to prevent the further spread of the disease; see the report at http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20191027000259. - Mod.AS
