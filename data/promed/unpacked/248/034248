Moderator JW noted that: "It is striking that in contrast to the
situation in Asian, African countries, no deaths have been reported
among these thousands of cases in Europe and the USA."

In fact, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported one death
due to measles-related pneumonia as well as 8 measles cases with
neurological complications in France this year [2011].

Summary
-------
During late 2010, a previously unrecognised strain of measles
genotype G3 virus was identified in 5 different European countries by
the World Health Organization Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network.
Apart from one, none had a travel history to south-east Asia, the
usual source of G3 viruses, although epidemiological links could be
established between some of the cases. This case series illustrates
the value of genotyping and sequencing in tracking measles infections,
and identifying otherwise unrecognised chains of transmission.

Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (LabNet)
----------------------
As Europe adopts its resolution to eliminate measles by 2015 [1],
confirmation of clinically diagnosed measles and characterisation of
circulating viruses become increasingly pertinent. The World Health
Organization (WHO) Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (LabNet) was
established in 2002 with the primary purpose of providing laboratory
confirmation of suspected cases of measles and rubella using
standardised ELISA-based IgM detection in serum or oral fluid. As of
July 2010, the LabNet consists of 690 laboratories in 183 countries,
all of which follow a standardised set of testing protocols and
reporting procedures with a strong focus on quality assurance. The
LabNet is structured in 4 tiers of laboratories: sub national (n=507),
national level (n=161), regional reference (n=19), and global
specialised (n=3).

The LabNet also supports genetic characterisation of currently
circulating strains of measles viruses and is responsible for
standardisation of the nomenclature and laboratory procedures that are
used for genetic characterisation of wild-type measles and rubella
viruses [2-4].

This agreement of a standard nomenclature and classification for
describing measles virus has been instrumental in allowing comparison
of viruses in different countries, and also for documenting spread
within countries, monitoring viral transmission pathways and in
providing evidence of progress towards measles elimination [5].

For molecular epidemiologic purposes, the WHO currently recognises 8
clades (designated A to H), and within these clades, there are 23
recognised genotypes, designated A, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3,
D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, E, F, G1, G2, G3, H1, and H2. There is
considerable genetic variability within some genotypes (e.g. B3 and
H1), and related viruses are referred to as clusters. The WHO
recommends that the 450 nucleotides coding for the carboxyterminal 150
amino acids of the nucleoprotein (N-450) are the minimum amount of
sequence data required for assigning a measles genotype [2-4]. A WHO
Measles nucleotide sequence database MeaNS ([6],
http://www.who-measles.org) was set up as a repository for sequence
information, with tools to allow genotyping and phylogenetic analysis
of measles viruses sequences found globally.

Genotyping and sequencing of measles viruses is recommended by the
WHO for at least 80 percent of all laboratory-confirmed outbreaks [7]
and in countries where measles is no longer endemic and is encouraged
for all sporadic cases. Molecular characterisation of such cases
provides the information necessary to determine whether they are part
of a single cluster or due to multiple importations and to identify
sources of infection. However, unless appropriate samples are
collected (generally throat swab, urine sample, or, increasingly
commonly in Europe, an oral fluid sample), genotype information is not
always available. In the past 3 years, 6 different genotypes of
measles virus have been identified in Europe (B3, D4, D5, D8, D9, H1),
with large outbreaks associated with B3, D4 and D5 in many countries
[8].

Recent infections with measles virus G3 in Europe
-------------------------
Measles genotype G3 is generally associated with measles infections
in south-east Asia, or in sporadic cases with links to south-east Asia
[4]. There had been no reported cases of measles G3 in Europe since
2006. However, in the last 4 months of 2010, there have been a total
of 25 sporadic (i.e. epidemiologically unlinked) or epidemiologically
linked cases, all with viruses with identical sequence belonging to
genotype G3, in several different countries in Europe.

The 1st case, Patient A was a non-vaccinated German adult who was on
a roundtrip from Germany to south-east Asia during the 1st half of
September 2010 and returned to Germany via London on 17 Sep 2010.
Patient A remembered that a passenger sitting one row in front of them
had influenza-like symptoms and was coughing frequently, but otherwise
had no known contact with potential infectious measles virus carriers.
Ten days later, Patient A felt ill, developed a rash after 2 more
days, and was hospitalised. Measles was confirmed by detection of
measles virus RNA in oral fluid and urine sample [9]. During the same
period of symptom onset for Patient A, cases of measles were also
detected in Spain, England and France.

The Spanish case (Patient B) returned to Spain on 20 Sep 2010 after
having travelled to London. Like Patient A, Patient B developed the
prodrome on 27 Sep 2010, with rash onset on 3 Oct 2010. These dates
indicate a potential infection of both cases in London around 17 Sep
2010.

The 3rd case was a college student in London (Patient C) with no
history of travel outside the United Kingdom (UK) who became unwell on
28 Sep 2010 and who had rash onset on 2 Oct 2010. Patient C
subsequently infected 2 students at the same college in London
(Patient D, onset date 12 Oct 2010, and Patient E, onset date 14 Oct
2010). Patient D had travelled to Switzerland and became unwell and
was diagnosed with measles there. Subsequently, there were 2 further
cases of measles G3 virus infection, a household contact of Patient D
(Patient F, onset date 27 Oct 2010) and another case (Patient G, onset
date 29 Oct 2010) with no identified links, but living in the same
town.

A 4th patient in the UK (Patient H) also developed measles with a G3
genotype at the beginning of October 2010. Patient H had spent
holidays in North Africa and returned to the UK on 20 Sep 2010. The
prodrome began on 1 Oct 2010 with rash onset 4 days later, suggesting
infection at the time of travel or shortly after, and although this
case did not live in London, they had travelled through London on the
way home. Subsequently, over the next 2 months, there were 4 further
sporadic G3 measles cases, all with no history of travel outside
south-east England. There were no further cases in the UK for the rest
of 2010.

The French patient (Patient I) was a one year-old non-vaccinated
infant who lived in the area of Paris, and developed rash on 29 Sep
2010. Like Patient C, there was no history of recent travel or known
epidemiological link to anyone with measles. On 16 Oct 2010, there was
a 2nd G3 measles confirmed case in France (Patient J), although no
links between the 2 cases could be determined. Subsequently, there
were a further 9 sporadic cases of G3 measles identified in France up
to the end of 2010, but given the widespread measles activity in
France [10], links between these cases have been difficult to
identify.

Lastly, a visitor from Canada with a history of one dose of
measles-containing vaccine as an infant, (Patient K) travelled to
London on 10 Sep 2010 and then spent holidays in London, Paris and
Amsterdam. Patient K also developed measles with a G3 genotype, with
onset of rash on 4 Oct 2010, suggesting infection around 20 Sep 2010
before having returned to Canada.

Sequence analysis
----------------
Genotyping and sequencing was performed by the respective national
laboratory on a variety of samples from these patients. Sequencing of
the recommended minimum 450 nucleotides [3] was performed and
confirmed that they were all G3 sequences. Comparison of the sequences
confirmed that all the samples, including the one from the German
patient with travel links to south-east Asia, were 100 percent
identical over the N-450 nucleotide sequence window.

Interestingly, there were no other identical sequences in the WHO
MeaNS database or GenBank. Two viruses with similar sequences (5
nucleotides difference) had previously been identified in cases in
Singapore in early 2010 and had links to Indonesia.

The cluster described in this paper highlights a number of important
points. Not only is it essential to have an agreed standard
nomenclature for describing viruses, both at genotype and at sequence
level, but it is also critical that this information is shared. Within
the WHO laboratory network of national, regional and global
laboratories, genotype information is shared by regular reporting to
the WHO Regional Offices of the sequencing results, and depositing
sequence information in the WHO MeaNS database or GenBank. The MeaNS
database is not only a repository for all reported measles sequences,
but it also allows ready identification of identical or similar
sequences in different countries, as in this case series. All
laboratories performing measles genotyping and sequencing should be
encouraged to submit their sequences in a timely manner to facilitate
identification.

The cases described here also highlight how quickly measles viruses
can spread, and become widely disseminated. Judging by the estimated
dates of infection, it could be hypothesised that the person
travelling on the plane with Patient A was in the early stages of
measles, and transmitted infection to the German co-passenger and then
to other cases in London, but that does not explain the index case in
France. It is more likely that there were at least 2 independent
importations of this G3 genotype to Europe (to France and the UK), and
some early G3 infections have been missed. Almost certainly, the
pocket of G3 measles infection in France has continued, with ongoing
identification of G3 measles cases in France, as well as 3 further
cases of G3 measles in the UK and 2 cases in Russia in February and
March 2011, all with epidemiological links to infection in France.
Similar small clusters of G3 measles cases have also recently been
reported in Germany and the West Indies island of Saint Martin.

Conclusions
---------
The number of identified G3 measles cases underestimates the true
level of G3 measles activity in Europe, because not all infected
individuals seek medical advice, and because in most countries,
samples suitable for genotyping are not routinely collected from all
cases, and, therefore, sequence information is not available. Routine
collection of oral fluid from all cases with clinically suspected
measles does allow confirmation of infection by serological or
molecular methods and offers the potential for widespread genotyping
to identify sources of importations and tracking of infection.
Genotyping and molecular characterisation of circulating measles
viruses are of increasing importance in confirming the absence of
endemic infection in each country as Europe aims for the elimination
of measles by 2015 [1].

The Institut de Veille Sanitaire (INVS) has just updated the
epidemiological data on the measles epidemic now raging in France.
Since 1 Jan 2008, over 14 500 cases of measles have been reported in
France. The increase in the number of cases reported since October
2010 signaled the 3rd wave of the epidemic, which is continuing in the
early months of 2011. This 3rd wave is very large, with over 9000
mandatory notification forms received at the InVS concerning cases
that occurred between October 2010 and March 2011. Over 3000 cases
were reported in March 2011 alone.

In 2010, 8 cases with neurological complications
(encephalitis/myelitis) have been reported, and 2 patients died (one
as a result of encephalitis and one with pneumonia). So far during
2011, a total of 13 cases with neurological complications have been
reported (12 cases of encephalitis and one case of myelitis and
Guillain-Barre syndrome) and 2 deaths (as a result of pneumonia).

The median ages of reported cases were 11 years of age in 2008, 12
years of age in 2009, 14 years of age in 2010, and 15 years of age for
the 1st 3 months of 2011. For the 1st 3 months of the year, the median
age was 18 in the northern region of France and 15 for the southern
region (Source: Institut de Veille Sanitaire).

The measles outbreak that began in Rute less than a month ago is the
1st in Cordoba in the past 7 years, according to the head of the
Public Health Office of Health, Francisco Antonio. "The epidemic index
has been almost nil in recent years" he stressed. In Rute, at least 30
children have been affected by measles, and the Office of Health has
altered the town's age of protection against this infection. Across
the province, this is regulated from immunization records for school
children to ensure that vaccination is effective.

In Seville, measles has infected 800 people, some with serious
consequences. A woman died 2 days ago at the Virgen del Rocio of
Seville 4 days after admission as a consequence of cardiac arrest.

The reason for the recurrence of these outbreaks of measles is
largely because sections of the population either refuse to have their
children vaccinated for religious or ideological reasons or simply
from negligence.

In some situations, like those in Seville, the outbreaks of the
disease are concentrated in depressed neighborhoods, like South Range,
Litany and La Plata, among others, although there have also been
isolated outbreaks in other districts. Childhood vaccination is often
deficient, and there is inadequate monitoring of the "Healthy Child"
programme, especially in areas with low socioeconomic status.

According to the opinions of several pediatricians polled by ABC: "A
large proportion of the child population has not attained the age for
vaccination (15 months) and is very exposed, especially children who
are in contact with others in day care groups."

According to Juan Luis Perez Navero, the head of the department of
Pediatrics at the University Hospital Reina Sofia: "Fortunately, there
has been no clinical crisis in the capital so far. Fortunately, the
onset of summer weather may impair the transfer of the virus.
Nonetheless, to neglect provision of vaccination against measles and
all other childhood diseases would be foolhardy."

http://www.kentnews.co.uk/p_12/Article/a_13314/Cases_of_measles_in_Kent_on_the_rise_with_the_majority_in_the_west,_according_to_latest_figures_


Parents have been urged to immunise their children against measles,
as cases of the potentially killer disease are on the increase, public
health experts have warned. The rise has been put down to outbreaks in
[continental] Europe as well as a significant number of youngsters
only being partially immunised against measles, which can lead to
pneumonia and encephalitis. Across Kent and Medway last year [2010],
there were just 7 cases of measles, including 5 in west Kent. However,
this year [2011], there have already been 19 infections county-wide,
with 13 of those in the west, from January to 6 Apr 2011.

Dr Faiza Khan, consultant in public health at NHS [National Health
Service] West Kent, said: "Make sure your child gets the best
protection from illness and disease. Even if your child has missed an
immunisation and is older than the recommended ages, it is never too
late to get immunised. Too many children across west Kent are
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps and
rubella vaccine]. This not only means there is a real risk of a large
measles epidemic, but children who haven't been vaccinated could be at
risk of serious illness such as pneumonia, encephalitis, or even
death."

The increase in cases this year [2011] has also been put down to
outbreaks in European countries popular with UK holidaymakers and
people bringing back the disease from abroad. Parents planning to
travel abroad during the school holidays should check that their
children are up to date with their MMR vaccinations before they
travel, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in the South East warned.

Dr Graham Bickler, regional director of the HPA South East, said: "We
are still seeing cases of measles in many parts of the region, and the
only way we are going to eliminate these infections is by working with
parents, schools, universities and other education institutions to
encourage MMR uptake. To ensure at least 90 percent immunity, young
people have to have 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. The MMR jab is
routinely given in the UK at the age of 13 months and again at
3-and-a-half years. Measles complications affect one in every 15
children and can include eye and ear infections, pneumonia, seizures
and, rarely, encephalitis.

At least 20 children died of measles, and 200 others were reportedly
infected with outbreaks of the disease in 5 Mro communities in the
far-flung Poamuhuri area under Alikadam upazila [sub-district] of the
hill district over the last 2 weeks. [The Mros are the 2nd largest
tribal group in Bandarban District of the Chittagong Hill Tracts: see,

A government source, however, confirmed only 11 deaths in the wake of
the outbreaks of the disease in the backwoods area bordering Myanmar.
Locals said measles has already turned into an "epidemic" at the
remote village of Poamuhuri and is spreading alarmingly in the
adjacent areas due to a lack of proper preventive measures and
transportation problems. "Following the deaths, panic has gripped all
of the inhabitants of the hilly area," one of the sources said.

According to Bandarabn Civil Surgeon Dr Md. Shakhawat Hussain, a
total of 4 teams drawn from upazila, zila, army and civil surgeon
offices have been working in the affected areas since Tuesday [26 Apr
2011] morning "to check the spread of the disease."

Public health officials in the Quebec City region are dealing with a
minor outbreak of the measles. Of the 36 cases reporting in the
province, 19 are in the capital region, and officials are now warning
people who have not been vaccinated for measles to make an
appointment. The vaccination rate in Quebec is 95 per cent, according
to Dr. Horatio Arruda, the head of prevention for Quebec's public
health department. Arruda said he didn't expect the current outbreak
to spread, as it did in the 1989 measles epidemic when 10 000
Quebecers became sick and several died.

The Americas were declared "measles-free" in 2002, and in Quebec,
there are usually only one or 2 cases of measles a year, according to
the health Ministry's website. Officials said the disease was brought
to Canada by people who travelled to France, where 4937 cases of
measles were reported between January and March [2011]. France has a
vaccination rate of 60 per cent.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that is spread from person to
person by droplets and direct contact with nasal and throat secretions
from an infected person. People who get measles generally recover
fully after 10 days of sickness, but there can be complications. They
include pneumonia and diarrhea, and can be more severe for infants,
the elderly and pregnant women.

The Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) has
received a report of a laboratory confirmed case of measles (rubeola).
The patient is a 2-year-old male child who recently returned to Guam
from off-island travel to the Philippines and Singapore with his
family. Epidemiologic investigation has determined that exposure most
likely occurred while off-island in the Philippines.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that spreads from person
to person through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. Symptoms
are characterized by a generalized rash lasting 3 days or longer, with
fever (101 F or higher) and cough, or coryza (runny nose), or
conjunctivitis (red eyes).

The DPHSS is encouraging parents to check their children's
immunization (shot) records to ensure they have received their MMR
(measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The current recommendation from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is to receive 2
doses of MMR vaccine, with the 1st dose given at one year of age or
older and dose 2 given in the age range between 4-6 years.

Furthermore, all health care providers are urged to review and update
the immunization status of all children and adolescent patients they
see. If vaccination is contraindicated because of illness, a follow-up
appointment should be scheduled to update vaccination as soon as the
illness is over.

http://www.nj.com/camden/index.ssf/2011/04/man_with_probable_case_of_meas.html


The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services has
identified a Camden County man with probable measles who may have
exposed an unknown number of people at public locations in South
Jersey between 21-24 Apr 2011. The man had been exposed to an infected
woman who recently traveled here from Italy.

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can cause serious
medical complications. As a result, the Department of Health and
Senior Services recommends that anyone who was in the following
locations, which were visited by the Camden County man during the
incubation period for measles, contact a health provider immediately
to discuss potential exposure and risk of developing the illness:

- On 21 Apr 2011, anyone who visited the Pop Shop, 729 Haddon Ave.,
Collingswood, between 6:30 and 9:30 p.m.

- 22 Apr 2011, anyone who visited the Home Depot, 2160 Route 70,
West Cherry Hill, between 8 a.m. and noon

- 23 Apr 2011, anyone who visited Kohl's, 2133 Route 38, Cherry
Hill, between 6 and 9 p.m.

- 24 Apr 2011, anyone who visited: Magnolia Nursery, 405 S. White
Horse Pike, Magnolia between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Toys R Us, 500 New
Jersey 38, Cherry Hill, between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Walmart, 500 New
Jersey 38, Cherry Hill, between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Home Depot, 2160
Route 70, West Cherry Hill, between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Lowe's, 122 W.
Oak Ave., Lawnside, between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Anyone who suspects an exposure is urged to call a health care
provider before going to a medical office or emergency room. Symptoms
-- according to medical experts -- may develop as early as 26 Apr 2011
or as late as 15 May 2011. Measles symptoms include rash, high fever,
cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.

"We urge everyone to check to make sure they and their family members
are up-to-date on measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine and all other
age-appropriate immunizations. Getting vaccinated not only protects
you, it protects others around you who are too young to get the
vaccine or can't receive it for medical reasons. Measles can cause
serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of
the brain) in 20 percent of patients, especially children under 5 and
adults older than 20. Measles infection in a pregnant woman can lead
to miscarriage, premature birth or a low birth weight baby.

The Camden County man is considered a probable case because he has
measles symptoms and documented exposure to a confirmed measles case,
but no laboratory confirmation at this time. Laboratory test results
are pending. The vaccine status is unknown for the infected woman who
had traveled to the U.S. from Italy.

Utah officials who are fighting a measles outbreak have asked about
40 people so far to quarantine themselves because they might have been
exposed to the virus when they attended either of 2 recent community
events in Salt Lake City, a Utah Department of Health (UDH) spokesman
said today [26 Apr 2011].

On 21 Apr 2011, the department announced that a person who was
infectious with measles attended both events, potentially exposing
many others present. The agency wanted to talk to those who attended
so it could determine whether they were properly vaccinated against
measles and, if not, could ask them to quarantine themselves. Those
who attended the events, at a college and a university, were asked to
call the Utah Poison Control Center.

The UDH estimates that about 1000 people attended the 2 events,
department spokesman Tom Hudachko told CIDRAP News today [26 Apr
2011]. As of yesterday [25 Apr 2011], about 120 people had called to
report they were present, he added. "We have advised 40 individuals
who attended one of the community events to quarantine themselves as a
result of being unvaccinated, under-vaccinated, or not knowing their
vaccination status," Hudachko said. "We have not been keeping tabs on
whether individuals agree to quarantine, but anecdotally, I can tell
you most of those we speak with are understanding and cooperative," he
added.

Nine measles cases have been confirmed in the Utah outbreak, which is
the state's 1st since 2005 and the largest since 1996, when there were
119 cases, Hudachko reported.

The 2 events in question were a lecture by author Nicolas Kristof at
the Salt Lake Community College's South City Campus on 11 Apr 2011 and
the Entrepreneurial Challenge Final Awards Event at the University of
Utah's Rice Eccles Stadium on 13 Apr 2011. The health department said
those at risk for measles in connection with the events would be asked
to quarantine themselves at home until the end of their infectious
period, which is 29 Apr 2011 for the community college event and 1 May
2011 for the University of Utah event. "This means no school, work,
church, outside contacts, or community events," the agency said.
Hudachko said the UDH effort to contact attendees at the 2 events is
unusual for its scale. He reported that Utah's state epidemiologist
told him that he "was not aware of us having done anything on this
scale for this type of issue.

The infectious person who attended the 2 events was not aware of
having measles at the time, according to a UDH spokeswoman who was
quoted in a 21 Apr 2011 Salt Lake Tribune story.

Poker players who were at Club Menai on Sat 16 Apr 2011 should be on
alert for measles symptoms. NSW Government public health director, Dr
Philippa Binns, said a poker player from the tournament had contracted
measles and that other people who played that day should be careful.

"This very contagious disease is currently circulating in our
community and can have serious complications. But it can be
prevented," she said. "We are also reminding people that if they have
any illness with a fever, cough or runny nose, it is very important to
stay home from school or work and not go out in public. Measles
symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed a few days
later by a rash.

People are being urged to be vigilant if they suspect they could have
measles after a new case was confirmed in Auckland late last week.
Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) said it believed the
person may have caught measles while on a recent trip to Melbourne,
where several other cases were also confirmed.

Earlier this month [April 2011], ARPHS reported the end of an
outbreak which saw 24 people diagnosed with measles since mid-January
[2011]. But outbreaks of measles were likely to reappear again, as it
was still present in other parts of New Zealand and the world.

Measles must be taken very seriously, said medical officer of health
Brad Novak. "This disease spreads easily through the air, especially
from coughing and sneezing, and it is highly infectious. It commonly
causes ear infections and pneumonia and may lead to other serious
complications. It can, in some cases, also be fatal.

"Our clinical team of public health doctors and nurses is contacting
a large number of people who may have come into contact with the
person while they were infectious but before measles was diagnosed,"
Novak said.

Prompt identification can help limit the spread of measles to others.
Common symptoms are a red rash that starts on the face and moves to
the rest of the body, runny nose, cough, sore eyes or fever. Anyone
with these symptoms should seek immediate medical help. People are
advised to phone ahead before visiting a doctor to minimise the spread
of infection to others in the waiting room. It is also important that
anyone who suspects they may have measles -- or who has had contact
with someone suspected to have measles and who is not immune -- remain
in isolation to limit the spread of the disease. People born before
1969 or who have received 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine (MMR) or who have had measles in the past are considered to be
immune.

Immunisation is the only effective way to protect against the
disease, says Novak. Anyone who is not up to date with immunisations
should contact their GP or practice nurse and arrange to catch up as
soon as possible. MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine is given in
2 doses, normally at 15 months and 4 years of age, giving over 95
percent protection.

Four cases of measles have been reported to Auckland Regional Public
Health Service in a 10-day period, which says it's likely more cases
will be diagnosed in the next few days.

Earlier this year [2011], an outbreak occurred in which 24 cases
surfaced. Medical Officer of Health Cathy Pikholz says the latest
cases, reported in the 10 days from 20 Apr 2011, occurred in various
parts of the city.

She says immunisation is the only effective way to prevent outbreaks,
but people should be aware of symptoms, which include a red rash, sore
eyes, a runny nose and a fever. She says there is a period of 10 days
during which someone with measles is infectious.
