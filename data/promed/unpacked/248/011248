Tuberculosis, lions - South Africa (Mpumulanga) 20010116.0128
Date: 17 Jan 2001
From: Anita Michel <Anita@moon.ovi.ac.za>

In response to the previous report on tuberculosis (TB) in lions in
Mpumalanga, for which unfortunately no author was identifiable, I would
like to comment in the following way.
In Mpumalanga, TB has been diagnosed for the first time in 1990 in African
(!!) buffalo in the Kruger National Park (KNP). The disease has, since
that time, spread to a variety of wildlife species such as lion, cheetah,
hyena, leopard, kudu -- to name a few -- but definitely not to wildebeest.
It is absolutely true that lions contract the disease mainly by feeding on
infected animals, which makes it so difficult to understand the presence of
infected lions in the apparent absence of an infected reservoir host such
as buffalo.
The chronic disease character of TB allows for infected animals to remain
undetected for extended periods of time, and even to be transported to a
different reserve where their disease status may or may not be
diagnosed. Under these circumstances, infected lions can serve as a source
of infection in an otherwise TB-free ecosystem. Our research has shown
that _M. bovis_ (the causative agent of TB in wildlife) can remain viable
for several weeks in the local environment.
Bearing this in mind, one could argue it is perhaps more advisable to
remove infected animals as soon as possible and in so doing protect 4 of
the Big Five (NOTE: African buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, lion, leopard).
The
situation in private game reserves that are geographically completely
separated from the KNP simply cannot be compared with that in the KNP.
The main reservoir and source of TB in the KNP are the highly-infected
herds of African buffalo. Removal of infected lions would have no effect
on this at all.
