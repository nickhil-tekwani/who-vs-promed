Texas achieves cattle brucellosis-free status
---------------------------------------------
Texas beef and dairy cattle producers, cattle feeders, and markets
operators achieved a long-sought victory Fri 1 Feb 2008 when the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that Texas has achieved
cattle brucellosis-free status.

For nearly 50 years, Texas cattle producers battled brucellosis, or "Bangs
Disease", the bacterial disease that is caused by _Brucella abortus_. The
disease can cause cows to abort, deliver weak calves, or produce less milk.
Cattle brucellosis is a zoonotic disease (can be spread from animals to
man) that caused significant human disease incidence until the eradication
program reduced the incidence of the disease in cattle, and, sanitary
practices and pasteurization procedures for milk were implemented to reduce
transmission to humans. All other states in the United States are
classified brucellosis-free, some for more than 25 years.

"Texas was the last state to achieve the 'free' status. We have more herds
and more cattle than any other state -- 14 million at last count. We also
had more brucellosis infection to fight. In 1959, when Texas officially
joined the national eradication program, we had more than 20 000 of the
country's 100 000 infected herds," said Dr Bob Hillman, Texas' state
veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the
state's livestock and poultry health regulatory agency. "This victory for
the cattle industry did not come easily or without hardship," said Dr
Hillman. "For many cattle producers in the early days of the program, it
meant losing a herd with only salvage value payment, or having the herd
under quarantine and being unable to sell animals for long periods of time.
Some producers' herds became re-infected. In recent years, infected herds
were purchased from owners and depopulated whenever possible, to quickly
wipe out infection."

Dr Hillman credited the 2006 Brucellosis Eradication Working Group with
re-evaluating all aspects of the Texas brucellosis program, in preparation
for the USDA review, which was conducted in summer 2007. The group was
comprised of about 25 cattle industry members. "I also want to thank TAHC
and USDA staff for their long days of testing cattle, consulting with
producers, keeping detailed test records, and handling tense situations
when herds had to be quarantined. The efforts by the industry, the TAHC and
USDA have brought us to a great place -- disease eradication.

"Now we must ensure that the disease is not reintroduced, or if it is
lingering undetected, we must find the infection and eradicate it quickly.
If 2 infected herds are detected within the next 2 years, we could lose
this hard-earned, well-deserved status, so we must do everything to protect
the health of our herds," said Dr Hillman.

"To this end, we must continue testing our cattle at the first-point of
concentration and change of ownership for the next couple of years," said
Dr Hillman. "This procedure is part of the national brucellosis program
standard and was included in the program as a means of assuring that states
that have just acquired free-status could identify infected herds should
the disease have been left undetected in a herd or is re-introduced into a
state. Additionally, brucellosis slaughter surveillance will continue for
many years to come to assure that the disease is completely eradicated from
cattle herds in Texas and other states of the United States."

"Decades of hard work are now paying off with this incredible
accomplishment. I commend the cattle industry of the state and the Texas
Animal Health Commission for working together to establish Texas as cattle
brucellosis-free," Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples said.

"Texas ranks first in the nation in the number of cattle and calves and the
industry is a USD 16 billion business for the Texas economy. This new
status will positively improve the industry and help our dedicated cattle
producers," commissioner Staples said.

"Hearing the words 'cattle brucellosis-free' is music to the industry's
ears," said Mr Ernie Morales, chairman of the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC). "While in the short term we will have to continue
testing our cattle, there is a tremendous benefit for cattle producers to
be able to market their cattle as cattle from a brucellosis-free state.
This status designation will provide cattle producers and trading partners
additional assurance that Texas cattle do not pose a disease risk."

"This tremendous achievement could not have been accomplished without the
combined efforts of state and federal agencies and industry," said Bruce
Knight, under secretary for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs
mission area. The interim rule declaring Texas as brucellosis free was
published in the 1 Feb 2008 Federal Register and became effective upon
publication.

"We must now focus our efforts on eradicating brucellosis from the
free-ranging elk and bison populations in the Greater Yellowstone Area in
order to protect our national cattle herd against future outbreaks of this
disease," said Under Secretary Knight. He said the presence of brucellosis
in free-ranging bison and elk in Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton
National Park still threatens cattle health in surrounding states.

Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples has received notice from the US
Department of Agriculture that Texas has been declared brucellosis-free.
This news means for the first time in the 74-year history of the
brucellosis program, all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands
have simultaneously achieved Class Free status.

"Today is a landmark day for the nation's number one cattle state. Decades
of hard work are now paying off with this incredible accomplishment. I
commend the Texas cattle industry and the Texas Animal Health Commission
for working together to establish Texas as brucellosis-free," commissioner
Staples said.

For nearly 5 decades, Texas cattle producers have battled brucellosis, a
bacterial disease that poses no threat to food safety, but can cause
decreased milk production, weight loss, infertility, loss of young, and
lameness in cattle. There is no known treatment for brucellosis, and
depopulation of infected and exposed animals is the only effective means of
disease containment and eradication.

There are 14 million head of cattle in Texas, more than half of the state's
people population and cattle production is the number one agriculture
commodity in Texas in terms of cash receipts. Bottom line, the cattle
industry is big business in Texas.

"The Texas cattle industry is a USD 16 billion business for the Texas
economy. This new brucellosis-free status will positively improve the
industry and help our dedicated cattle producers," commissioner Staples said.

This is historic news but the work is not over. Brucellosis-free status is
based on a state finding no known brucellosis in cattle for 12 months. A
state's status can change if brucellosis is found in more than one herd of
cattle in a brucellosis-free state within a 2-year period.
