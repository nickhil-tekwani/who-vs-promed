The number of dengue cases recorded in Bahia between 1 Jan and 22 Aug
2009 has practically tripled, compared to the number of cases
registered during the same period in 2008. The [case] number is also
the highest since 1995, when dengue was considered for the 1st time
as epidemic and began to be counted in the state. The information was
provided by the state Secretariat of Health of Bahia (SESAB), which
recorded 103 788 [dengue] cases in the 1st 8 months of this year
[2009], compared to 34 125 [cases] registered during the same period
last year [2008], an increase of 204 percent.

According to SESAB, dengue is present in 402 of the 417
municipalities in Bahia, and the municipalities of Itabuna, Jequie,
Salvador, Feira de Santana, Irece, and Ilheus had 41 percent of the
cases. As for the most serious cases of the disease, SESAB recorded
1028 cases in 120 municipalities of Bahia, among which there were 60
confirmed [dengue] deaths.

The coordinator of Epidemiological Surveillance of the state of
Bahia, Jesuina Castro, attributed the increase in the number of cases
to the discontinuance of the policy of fighting dengue in some of the
municipalities in Bahia. She said this factor was fundamental to the
increase in the number of reported dengue cases this year [2009],
which would be a direct result of dismantling dengue control teams
after the change of government occurred in several municipalities in
2009. "It is extremely important that this does not happen in the
coming years when there is a change in government," she emphasizes.

The coordinator also said that we must be alert in the coming years
to a possible increase in the number of cases of the more severe
[type of] dengue. According to her, "even though the number of cases
decreases, there will be a large group, especially young people, who
had no contact with the form of the disease, which can facilitate the
transmission of the virus.

eliminated, it illustrates the political difficulty of maintaining
preventive programs in the absence of an immediate health emergency.

In the new bulletin addressing the dengue cases in Mato Grosso,
released the Wednesday morning (2 Sep [2009]) by the state
Secretariat of Health (SES/MT), the coordinator of Health
Surveillance of the State Secretariat of Health noted that there were
36 339 dengue cases recorded in the state from January to the present
[date], of which 1095 were recorded as being serious cases of the
disease. With relation to the number of deaths caused by dengue
[virus infection], 34 were recorded with 28 [of these] now confirmed
and 6 still under investigation.

Just in Cuiba, 10 841 dengue cases were registered, of which 420 are
serious cases. Of the 420 serious cases, 322 were confirmed and 98
are under investigation. Of the deaths registered in Cuiba, 8 were
confirmed as being serious cases of the disease and 5 are under
investigation. Currently in Vareza, 3825 cases were reported. Of
these, 440 were reported as being serious cases of the disease, with
274 confirmed and 166 under investigation.

In relation to the same period in 2008, in 2009 Mato Grosso had an
increase of 248 percent of notified dengue cases. Between [1 Jan and
2 Sep 2008], 10 453 dengue cases were registered.

Senator Luis Daniel Muniz asked today [28 Aug 2009] of the newly
appointed secretary of the Department of Health, Lorenzo Gonzalez,
that he promote a massive fumigation plan for the entire island to
avoid the spread of dengue [virus transmission].

Muniz's demand comes after seeing the most recent Health report
relating to dengue, according to which in the past week there were a
total of 150 new suspected dengue cases, bringing the total of
possible carriers of the virus in Puerto Rico so far this year
[2009], to 3256. "We cannot focus only on the transmission of the A
(H1N1) [influenza] virus while the dengue cases continue to increase
in Puerto Rico," stated Muniz, who underscore also that fumigation is
a frequently used resource in many countries for prevention and
control of dengue. Muniz indicated that he hopes that the
implementation of this massive fumigation plan which, in his opinion
will avoid the deaths of people, "victims of a bad [disease] which
could have been avoided in time, will not "fall on deaf ears."

The press reported today [28 Aug 2009] the presumed [dengue] death of
a 9-year-old child, a student in the Cidra locale -- in the center of
the island -- although the data has not been confirmed yet by the
Health Department.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of Atlanta, USA,
confirmed this past April [2009] the 1st death attributed to dengue
in Puerto Rico so far this year [2009], an 8-year-old girl in the
Caguas area, in the center of the Island.

[Although fumigation (fogging) with insecticides is a dramatic and
visible approach often favored when authorities are under public
pressure to "do something," the reduction of dengue vector mosquitoes
is temporary and less effective over the long-term than elimination
of water catchments in and around houses and other buildings that
serve as breeding sites of _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

<http://www.bigmedicine.ca/bioscitech.htm#0902_Shift_in_age_distribution_of_dengue_fever_in_Thailand_explained>


Decreases in birth and death rates explain the shift in age
distribution of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Thailand, according
to a new paper in this week's open access journal PLoS Medicine.
Analyzing data from Thailand's 72 provinces to investigate why an
increase in the average age of DHF cases has been observed in the
country, Derek Cummings from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
USA and colleagues find that a reduced birth rate and a shift in the
age structure of the population can explain the shift in the age
distribution of cases, the reduction of the force of infection (the
rate at which susceptible individuals become infected), and the
increased time between epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Clinical guidelines should consider the impact of continued increases
in the age of dengue cases in Thailand, say the authors.

In an accompanying commentary, Cameron Simmons and Jeremy Farrar
(uninvolved in the research) from the Oxford University Clinical
Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam discuss the changing
patterns of dengue epidemiology and the implications for clinical
management and vaccines. Because the clinical management of dengue in
children differs from that of adults, the increase in the number of
adults in the case mix of dengue patients presents new challenges for
clinicians. As a result, Simmons and Farrar argue that it must be a
priority to build upon Cummings and colleagues' work in Thailand and
to "understand if other dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia
and Central and South America are experiencing similar temporal
associations between demography and dengue epidemiology, and if so, why."

The number of dengue cases has risen to 24 857 while 245 people have
died of the disease in Sri Lanka so far, the Epidemiological Unit of
the Health Ministry said on Tuesday [1 Sep 2009].

The Epidemiological Unit said in its latest statistics that of the 24
857 cases, the highest number of patients were reported in June
[2009] totaling 7048. It is followed by July [2009]with 6872 cases
being reported.

Over 500 suspected patients of dengue virus have reported in various
hospitals of Karachi while the Health Department has [not] made the
dengue [unit] fully functional yet. According to sources the exact
number of dengue cases cannot be determined, as the dengue cell is
still non-functional.

The health experts have said that cases of dengue affected patients
have started appearing in Karachi. The majority of these patients are
being treated in private clinics and hospitals and a very small
number is coming to government hospitals.

The number of dengue patients is feared to rise following the recent
heavy rains. The health experts have advised the people not to let
water stand anywhere in their houses and streets.

The rapid growth of crowded cities has helped spread and increase the
transmission of dengue around the world, health experts said on
Tuesday [1 Sep 2009], warning up to 3 billion people were already at risk.

They also disputed reports that climate change could become a factor
in the spread of the disease from tropical areas because the mosquito
that carries dengue has reached temperate regions due to rising temperatures.

"Climate change has very little effect on the disease," Duane Gubler,
director of Asia Pacific Institute of Tropical Medicine and
Infectious Diseases at the University of Hawaii, told Reuters on the
sidelines of a 3-day dengue symposium in Manila.

Scientists and health experts are meeting to exchange practices and
strategies to combat the disease that infects 50 million people every
year, causing tens of thousands of deaths, mainly among children.

"As early the 1980s, dengue fever had reached epidemic proportions in
some countries in Asia long before climate change became an issue.
Rapid urbanization, increase in air travel, and lack of mosquito
control are the main drivers of the disease." Gubler said dengue
spreads quickly in crowded cities with inadequate basic services,
such as potable water, sanitation and waste-management, and weak
public health infrastructures.

In the 1950s, when the 1st dengue outbreak was reported in Manila,
only 10 countries in Southeast and South Asia had dengue problems but
the disease has now spread to about 100 states in the Pacific
islands, Latin America, and Africa due to rise in air travel.

About 57 percent of people across the globe are now living in cities,
Gubler said, adding most urban areas in the region now have a
population of over 5 million.

Gubler said only about 50 million people traveled every year in the
1950s, but the figure has risen to about 2 billion in the last 6
decades, helping spread the disease.

He said the disease could only be controlled if governments worked
closely with the science and health sectors to improve public health
services, make more people aware of the disease, and eliminate
mosquito breeding grounds.

Gubler said the world is rushing to develop an anti-dengue drug by
2012 and a vaccine in 5-7 years, citing 7 pharmaceutical and biotech
companies that were at various stages of clinical tests to produce
the drugs and vaccines.

[With or without climate change, dengue spread advances in tropical
and subtropical areas of the planet, especially in cities without
basic services to meet the needs of their increasing populations. In
the absence of specific treatment or vaccination, the only strategy
to combat dengue is prevention, with sustained action to combat the
[mosquito] vector: elimination of breeding sites and areas of
reproduction and fumigation campaigns. Certainly, in many places
there is a lack of political will to implement and execute the
prevention strategies mentioned, given that many governments consider
health campaigns to be a "cost", rather than an investment. - Mod.JG]

[And it has been difficult to sustain vector control through breeding
site reduction or treatment in those few countries where vigorous
efforts were successful, such as Cuba and Singapore. It has not been
possible to maintain the level of active vigilance necessary for
continuous vector control at the household and community levels, and
dengue has reappeared. - Mod.TY]
