While the moderator does correct the news article regarding the
appropriate species in the comment section (i.e. Bison, not Buffalo),
the title of the posting is misleading and should have also been
corrected. There are growing numbers of true buffalo (_Bubalus
bubalis_) in the US, and the distinction is important.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

30 years ago, the National Zoo and the Bronx Zoo reported Mycoplasma
infection in lowland gorillas associated with arthritis and renal
failure with immune complex glomerulonephritis. Lewis Thomas of
"Lives of the Cell" fame had described similar chronic and
progressive disease in domestic turkeys caused by species of
Mycoplasma.
Perhaps the epidemiology of enzoonotic Mycoplasma infections with
chronic and devastating impact has to do with the conditions of
domesticity and the introduction of the infection into a species
previously not domesticated, and thus infrequently exposed.

[Both of these postings make excellent points. There is a difference
between buffalo, an inappropriate term used in America for bison, and
bison. Furthermore, it is likely that non-domesticated animals are
less frequently exposed to some of the diseases of domestic animals,
and that may well be the reason that our non-domesticated animals are
more affected by these diseases. Thanks to Drs. Agnew and Lee for
pointing out these important points. - Mod.TG]
