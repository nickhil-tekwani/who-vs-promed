The National reports that 6 people are dead and more than 1000 people
are gravely ill in 4 isolated villages in Erave, Southern Highlands
province of Papua New Guinea, because of an outbreak of typhoid.
A health official in Mendi said the disease had taken a hold in the
villages of Mt Tawa, Bolo, Tono and Warakai. The number of positive
diagnoses of the disease in the area so far is 1200: 460 men, 350
women, 280 boys and 110 girls.
Health workers and community leaders in the villages recorded the 1st
diagnosis on 25 Feb 2006 and the 1st death on 28 Feb 2006. The 6
confirmed deaths were of 2 adults and 4 children. The health official
who spoke to The National said the only way to contain the spread of
typhoid was by immunization.
An immunization patrol team must be sent to Erave as soon as possible
to prevent more deaths, the official said. "The outbreak was not
contained and the situation needs a team on the ground now. Health
centers in the area have run out of drug supplies due to the high
number of cases."

[In addition to immunization, the availability of clean water is
vital in preventing both epidemic and endemic typhoid. The large
number of cases certainly suggests water-borne transmission. A map

Health officials advised residents to boil water for drinking and to
cook food well in the wake of reports that 100 typhoid fever cases
have been monitored in 2 villages here for the past several months.
Quoting a provincial epidemiological surveillance unit report, Dr.
Purita Danga, regional health director, said 22 suspected typhoid
cases were recorded in Barangay Baculod here in Mar 2006.
Village officials said more than 100 cases were recorded from Jan to
Mar 2006. No fatality was reported. Mayor Delfinito Albano, however,
assured residents that preventive measures had been put in place to
contain the outbreak.
Danga said the Center For Health Development-Cagayan Valley workers
have also been watching Nagtipunan town in Quirino; Alfonso Castaneda
town in Nueva Vizcaya and Baggao town in Cagayan for malaria. Health
officials distributed bottles of chlorine for deep wells and toilet
bowls.
