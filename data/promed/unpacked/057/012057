Controversy over elephant's burial
----------------------------------
The burial of an elephant, which reportedly died of anthrax in
Perumbavoor on Thursday [3 Sep 2009], has kicked up a controversy.
There are allegations that the pachyderm was buried, near the
Muvattupuzha river, unscientifically and could pose a threat of
polluting the river, a source of potable water in the district.

The Elephant Lovers Association has demanded an inquiry into the
death of the elephant. Unnikrishnan, an elephant owned by a saw mill
owner in Perumbavoor, died on Thu 3 Sep 2009]. The Forest Department
doctors confirmed that the elephant died of anthrax.

"According to the rules, the carcass is the asset of the government
and so the owner of the elephant will lose the right of ownership as
soon as it is dead. So the animal should have been buried in the
forest nearest to the place where the elephant died," said VK
Venkitachalam, of the Elephant Lovers Association. "Moreover, if the
elephant died of anthrax, burying the elephant near the river could
pollute drinking water used by millions. The anthrax bacterium can
live for more than 2 decades," he said. "We alerted the forest
officials, but no necessary steps were taken to ensure that the law
was upheld," he added.

But the officials with the forest department said that they acted
according to the rules. "We called the veterinary doctors of the
department and they confirmed that the pachyderm died of anthrax.
Later, the carcass was buried at Arakkuzha near Muvattupuzha as per
the instructions of the doctors," said P Biju, range officer, Kodandu
range. The forest officials say that there was nothing illegal in
allowing the owner of the elephant to bury it at his expense. But
those opposing this argument say that it was against the directive of
the Union Government.

"According to the directive of the Union Government, the body of the
elephant is the property of the government. So the officials should
not have handed over the carcass to the elephant owner," said AG
Babu, member, State Animal Welfare Board. The doctors with the forest
department say that the carcass would not pose any threat to the
public health if it is buried in a scientific manner. "If the carcass
is buried, it should be in a pit at least 6 feet [2 m] deep. It
should be placed on a bed made of lime, said Dr Easwaran.

[Elephant carcasses are the very devil to dispose of, even in the
best of times. They are large so burying them is difficult and
expensive. In Africa the best that is often achieved is to cover them
with thorn brush to keep scavengers away.

Burying this carcass was a good decision even if apparently near a
river bed. The carcass will decompose quickly and the interior will
become acid. This drop in pH is lethal for the vegetative cells of
_Bacillus anthracis_ and they will die. As the interior of the
carcass is anaerobic they cannot sporulate. Therefore the risk of
soil contaminated with anthrax spores is minimised.

Unfortunately the bad news is that if the carcass was buried near a
river system it can result in water pollution as the carcass rots --
note that the news reports "allegations" as to the site of burial.
During the 2001 FMD epidemic in England there were reports of ground
water running red with blood from buried cattle, documented by
various newspapers with pictures. Digging the carcass up would not be
a good idea as it would just increase the amount of ground
contamination and the carcass would surely break apart. In about 3-6
months the grave surface will be concave as the carcass rots away
leaving a void. The owner of the land would be wise to add soil to
the site so that it does not become a rainwater pond.
