The ministry has announced the removal of lockdown restrictions on farms affected by the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Only 3 confirmed cases of FMD have been reported in the latest outbreak, with the last case reported on 6 Aug 2014, it said. About 2000 pigs have been culled since the 1st confirmed case was reported on 23 Jul 2014.

[South Korea experienced a major FMD epizootic from November 2010 to April 2011. It was very severe and affected both pigs and cattle. The causative agent was serotyped O and genotyped as topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. A total of 3748 farms were confirmed FMD-infected; 3 479 866 animals were culled, of which 322 654 pigs and 8441 cattle in 155 holdings were officially reported to the OIE as infected. One of the main decisions undertaken by the authorities was to implement a general vaccination policy, which has been maintained since 2011 and included vaccination of domestic ruminants and pigs.

The recent outbreak was swiftly attended and controlled. The FMDV serotype O strain, which caused the 3 outbreaks in pig farms in 2 provinces, has been genotyped by the WRLFMD (World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Pirbright Institute, UK) as similarly being topotype SEA, genotype/strain Mya-98, most closely related to recent Chinese strains. It can thus be assumed that the vaccine applied is matching the current strain, safeguarding continued prevention of further spread.

The genotyping results, including a dendrogram, are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2014/WRLFMD-2014-00027%20O%20South%20Korea%202014.pdf.
