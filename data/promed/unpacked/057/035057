Looking at total global case counts, 2022 has more cases of WPV1 associated AFP than identified in all of 2021, and more cases of cVDPV associated AFP than to date in 2021. As I have mentioned previously, 2022 to date continues to be a good year for the viruses but not for eradication efforts.

[Both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), continue to be identified in multiple countries. While Afghanistan hasn't reported any AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection, the positive environmental samples confirm that the virus is circulating in the country. In the past week cVDPV2 associated cases have been confirmed in Chad, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria, and positive ES identified in Algeria.

Note that the WHO statement about Indonesia not having evidence of cVDPV2 (with the emphasis on the "c") was made before the announcement of 3 additional infected individuals in the community.

Looking at total global case counts, 2022 has more cases of WPV1 associated AFP than identified in all of 2021, and more cases of cVDPV associated AFP than to date in 2021. As I have mentioned previously, 2022 to date continues to be a good year for the viruses but not for eradication efforts.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at <https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Indonesia: 3 children positive for poliovirus
Date: Thu 24 Nov 2022
Source: Tempo [edited]
https://en.tempo.co/read/1660793/3-children-confirmed-positive-for-polio-in-acehs-pidie


The Health Ministry's spokesperson Muhammad Syahril reported that 3 children were confirmed positive for polio in Pidie District, Aceh. The children were suddenly paralyzed without showing any symptoms.

The finding was based on the results of a follow-up examination of children aged less than 5 years in the region after the authority detected 1 polio case in early November [2022]. "From the results of examinations of 19 children, 3 children are found positive for the poliovirus," said Syahril in a written statement, Thursday [24 Nov 2022].

In early November 2022, the Health Ministry declared an extraordinary occurrence (Kejadian Luar Biasa; KLB) of polio right after detecting 1 case in Pidie. Thus, an epidemiological search was launched in the region in 19 healthy children who had no contact with the initial case in order to assess whether or not virus transmission had occurred in the community.

The examination was conducted by applying the targeted healthy stool sampling method as recommended by WHO. However, according to WHO guidelines, the 3 children were not included in the case criteria because they did not suffer sudden paralysis.

The Health Ministry keeps monitoring the region, including screening house to house, to ensure there are no additional cases of unreported paralysis. Polio is a highly dangerous disease for children because of its permanent impact. Moreover, there is no cure for the disease to date.

However, the poliovirus could be prevented through complete polio vaccination, both bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). "Thus we must protect the future of our children by providing complete polio immunization," said Syahril, adding that a clean and healthy lifestyle is the second key to preventing polio transmission in the community.

[The identification of additional infected individuals confirms the virus is circulating. It remains unclear as to whether these were asymptomatic infections or paralytic disease associated. I will stick my neck out and speculate these were asymptomatic infections.

Aceh province is located in the north of Sumatra island, and Pidie district is located in the northeast of Aceh province. (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Location-map-of-Aceh-province_fig1_287726164)

The province (Aceh) is the westernmost province of Indonesia. Banda Aceh is the capital. The province has a special autonomous status. It is a religiously conservative territory and the only province in Indonesia that officially practices Sharia law. There are 10 indigenous ethnic groups in this region, the largest being the Acehnese people, accounting for approximately 80% to 90% of the region's population.

Historically, "Aceh is where the spread of Islam in Indonesia began, and was a key factor of the spread of Islam in South East Asia. Islam reached Aceh (Kingdoms of Fansur and Lamuri) around 1250 AD. In the early 17th century the Sultanate of Aceh was the most wealthy, powerful and cultivated state in the Malacca Straits region. Aceh has a history of political independence and resistance to control by outsiders, including the former Dutch colonists and later the Indonesian government" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceh). - Mod.MPP]

[3] Indonesia: background and vaccination outreach

https://en.antaranews.com/news/262417/ministry-carries-out-immunization-to-cut-polio-spread-in-aceh


The implementation of the National Immunization Week (PIN) in Aceh following the extraordinary event (Kejadian Luar Biasa; KLB) of polio infections in Pidie district is part of efforts to accelerate polio eradication in Aceh, the Health Ministry has said. According to the ministry's acting director of immunization management, Prima Yosephine the Outbreak Response Immunization (ORI) will start in Pidie next week [week of 28 Nov 2022] and will be extended across Aceh province on 5 Dec 2022. "This is a sub-PIN because the case is specific in Aceh. We must do it immediately to break the chain of polio transmission. We hope this effort will be successful," she said in Banda Aceh, Aceh province, on Friday [25 Nov 2022].

The coverage of complete basic immunization in Aceh has been quite low in the past few years, she noted. This has also put children in Aceh at high risk of contracting diseases that can be prevented through immunization.

This has been proven by the discovery of cases of polio or withered paralysis among children in Mane sub-district, Pidie district, she said. In fact, the poliovirus has also infected healthy children who have not completed their basic immunization. Thus, the implementation of Sub-PIN in Aceh is very important, she added. "We hope that this activity will immediately stop the spread of the poliovirus. This virus has been circulating in the region, and we have found healthy children infected with polio as well," she added.

Data from the Health Ministry show that the immunization coverage per antigen in Aceh until October 2022 was quite low. The coverage for BCG vaccinations was around 48.90%, HB0 67.1%, polio 46.8%, IPV 18.8%, DPT-HB-Hib 3 39.3%, and CR 43.7%. Furthermore, IDL coverage stood at 39.8%, DPT-HB-Hib 4 just 17.3%, and CR2 only 21.9%. The coverage of each antigen has yet to reach the target. [https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/schedule-by-country/idn.html?DISEASECODE=&TARGETPOP_GENERAL= shows schedule. "HB0" and "CR" are unfamiliar to me. - Mod.SH]

"Sub-PIN will depend on us. The coverage for success is at least 95%. Therefore, it needs support from other sectors. Our target is around 100 000 children in Pidie," Yosephine informed.

Earlier, the Aceh Health Service recorded 4 cases of polio in Aceh's s Mane sub-district, Pidie district. One of the 4 children is still undergoing therapy at the Zainoel Abidin Regional General Hospital in Banda Aceh. The 4 children who were infected with the poliovirus did not complete their basic immunization. Therefore, they were at a very high risk of contracting the virus.
