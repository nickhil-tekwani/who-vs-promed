A Robertsdale woman has tested positive for _Vibrio vulnificus_ [see moderator comments that follow - Mod.JH] after she contracted the flesh-eating bacteria from Fairhope Municipal Beach.

Baldwin County Public Health Department has confirmed they are working 2 cases of _Vibrio vulnificus_ this year [2018], including Hallman's. One of those cases began Wednesday [13 Jun 2018].

Hallman spoke on News 5 to warn everybody about the dangers that are in the water. "If I didn't act fast, I could have very easily lost my foot," said Hallman. "I was chasing after [a 2-year-old] and he touched the water, but I was more in the water on my left side, and I have a small cut on the back of my foot from a couple of weeks ago. My foot was extremely swollen, double the size that it should be. It was inflamed red and was burning. It felt like a sunburn but 10 times worse."

A 3-day stay in the hospital would follow. She is being treated for _Vibrio vulnificus_, the flesh-eating bacteria that thrive in brackish water.

"This is a mid-port [IV infusion device], and that is how I was getting my antibiotics. It is staying in until I see the infectious disease doctor Friday [15 Jun 2018] just in case I have to be put on stronger antibiotics."

The exact name of the bacteria is _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which is different from _Vibrio vulnificus_ [see moderator comment below].

Vibrio usually shows up in the summer months. It's a bacterium that is naturally occurring in warmer water. Those exposed to it will see symptoms within 24-72 hours. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, blisters around the wounded areas, swelling, and redness. In extreme cases, the affected area needs to be amputated. We have also seen deaths occur from Vibrio.

Experts warn everyone to be on high alert if they plan to get in the water this summer and make sure that all shellfish and oysters are cooked properly.

[The posting leads with calling the organism _V. vulnificus_ but then calls the organism _V. parahaemolyticus_. Both are halophilic human pathogens. _V. parahaemolyticus_ classically causes a gastroenteritis rather than skin and soft tissue infection. However, it can also cause infections similar to the [_V.] vulnificus_ species as highlighted by:

Howard RJ, Pessa ME, Brennaman BH, Ramphal R: Necrotizing soft-tissue infections caused by marine vibrios. Surgery. 1985 Jul;98(1):126-130.

Abstract
Halophilic, noncholera marine Vibrio bacteria can cause septicemia, gastroenteritis, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. We describe 6 patients with necrotizing fasciitis and review 12 cases described previously. The 18 patients included 14 men and four women. Their ages ranged from 32 to 79 years (average 58.1 years). Eleven patients were older than 55 years. Nine infections were caused by _V. vulnificus_, 3 by _V. parahaemolyticus_, and one by _V. alginolyticus_. In 5 cases, the Vibrio species was not identified. Twelve patients had associated conditions that might have made them more susceptible to these infections, such as cirrhosis, steroid therapy, hemochromatosis, and multiple myeloma. These infections usually occur in apparently insignificant wounds (puncture wounds, insect bites) exposed to sea water or fish. Treatment is by debridement and antibiotic therapy.

As a reminder, the following about _V. vulnificus_ is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
