The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed yesterday [3 Jul 2019] it found _Senecavirus A_ (SVA) on an Ontario farm on 29 Jun 2019.

The disease does not pose a risk to public health or food safety, though it can cause blisters or ulcers on pigs' heads and along the coronary band just above their hoofs. They may develop fevers, appear lethargic and become lame. The virus can even increase pre-weaning mortality slightly, Dr. Christa Arsenault, a lead veterinarian with Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), told Farms.com.

"Like most viruses, SVA likes to spread pig to pig," she said. "It can also spread indirectly through contaminated objects like equipment, footwear, clothing, transport trailers or anything that might have contact with the virus and then with pigs."

OMAFRA considers SVA to be "immediately notifiable," which means veterinarians must report suspected cases to the CFIA as soon as they rule out foreign animal diseases.

The disease hadn't been detected on any Ontario farm before 29 Jun 2019, though the virus was previously found in Ontario assembly sites. The sites have constant contact with [products from the USA], where the disease has infected herds for more than 30 years, but there is no way to know how the virus made its way onto Canadian soil.

No licensed vaccine or treatment exists for infected pigs, and researchers aren't sure how long it can survive outside of a host. "There's a lot we don't know about this virus," Arsenault said. "It is worth noting SVA doesn't cause as much damage as other viruses so they may have taken priority."

The CFIA collected samples from the infected Ontario farm after the herd's veterinarian told the agency the animals were off feed, developing lesions and saw an increased rate in pre-weaning death. The samples tested negative for diseases with similar signs, such as foot-and-mouth disease, but came back positive for SVA.

"Associated farms" are being tested and observed, a government notice says. Farmers should train their staff to recognize SVA's clinical signs and make sure they disinfect any potential viral transport vehicles, Arsenault said. "The quicker (the virus) is detected, the quicker we can react," she added.

[_Senecavirus A_ (SVA; previously known as Seneca Valley virus) in swine -- Breeding herd cases

Background
------------
- SVA is a non‐enveloped single‐stranded RNA virus of the family _Picornaviradae_. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) are also members of this same viral family.
-- This type of infection in swine resulting in snout and coronary band vesicles has also been termed idiopathic vesicular disease in swine.
-- It was proposed that SVA is the etiological agent of idiopathic vesicular disease, but this relationship is yet to be confirmed.
- Disease has been reported in the USA, Canada, Australia, Italy, New Zealand and most recently in Brazil. Farm outbreaks in the USA are sporadic (fewer than 20 have occurred in the past 3 decades), but have been recognized in multiple regions.
- In the past 5 years, SVA has been found in North Carolina and Illinois.
-- SVA has been identified in swine cases from California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, and North Carolina between 1988 and 2001.

Clinical presentation -- Breeding herd
------------------------------
Neonatal pigs:
- An acute increase in mortality in litters less than 7 days of age.
-- Appear to be infected shortly after birth.
-- May or may not have diarrhea associated with it.
--- May be confused with SECD (PEDV, TGE, PDCoV), PRRS, E. coli, Rotavirus, and/or _Clostridium_.
-- Morbidity and mortality estimates are 30%-70% for a short time period.
--- Clinical signs usually resolve quickly in 4‐7 days.
- Most of the time, the pigs will be found to have milk in their stomach when necropsied.

Breeding females (sows and gilts):
- Inspection of the sows of the affected litters may demonstrate any of the following lesions:
-- Vesicles (intact or ruptured) on the snout or in the oral mucosa (any mucocutaneous junction).
-- Lesions on the feet around the coronary bands.
--- May see ulcerative lesions on or around the hoof wall.
--- May see deep nail bed hemorrhages.
- Breeding females that are not feeling well (anorexia, lethargy and/or febrile).
-- Some sows will be off feed or not cleaning all of their feed up.
-- In the early course of the disease, fevers up to 105 deg F have been reported.

What to do if you see or are made aware of clinical signs similar to this?
- If you see any signs of vesicular disease:
-- Immediately contact the State Veterinarian and/or the USDA APHIS Assistant District Director responsible for your state or region.
--- They will decide if a Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) investigation is warranted and how to proceed as well as what samples to collect.
--- Temporarily halt any movements from the farm until directed by State and Federal Authorities.
- If just the neonatal pig presentation is observed (high morbidity and mortality in pigs less than 1 week of age) with NO signs of vesicular disease on the farm:
-- Collect complete sets of tissue for diagnostics (see below) and list SVA as a differential.
--- Include serum on neonatal piglets

Samples to collect (in order of best samples to collect listed at the top):
- Vesicular fluid (aspirated with small-gauge needle and syringe) and transfer to Falcon tube
- Dacron/polyester (non‐cotton) swabs from erupted vesicles
-- Placed in 1‐2 mL of PBS or sterile saline
- Skin scrapings (with scalpel blade) around erosion margin or around blanched coronary bands
-- Placed in 1‐2 mL of PBS or sterile saline
- Oral fluids
- Nasal swabs or oral swabs (buccal swabs -- around lesion if present)
-- Place in 1 mL of PBS or sterile saline
- If post‐mortem samples are collected, then get fresh and fixed tissues:
-- Any lesion
-- Regional lymph nodes
-- Tonsil
-- Spleen
-- Liver
-- Lungs
-- Kidney
-- Heart
-- Intestines (large and small)
-- Brain and spinal cord (if possible)
