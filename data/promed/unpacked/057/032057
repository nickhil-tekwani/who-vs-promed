A 4-year-old Quarter Horse gelding from Anadarko, Oklahoma (Caddo County) presented to a referral hospital 5 Aug 2016 with a temperature of 103.5 [deg F/39.7 deg C], ataxia, and depression. The horse was not current on vaccinations and died, according to an update from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC).

Brain samples submitted to the Oklahoma State Department of Health were positive for rabies virus by direct fluorescent antibody testing on 11 Aug 2016.

According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, dogs, coyotes, and cats are the likely suspects. Other animals like otters and ferrets are also high risk. Mammals like rabbits, squirrels, rodents, and opossums are rarely infected.

Rabies infected animals can appear very aggressive, attacking for no reason. Some may act very tame. They may look like they are foaming at the mouth or drooling because they cannot swallow their saliva. Sometimes the animal may stagger (this can also be seen in distemper). Not long after this point they will die. Most animals can transmit rabies days before showing signs.

Initially, like in many diseases, the symptoms of rabies in people are non-specific; fever, headache and malaise. This may last several days. At the site of the bite, there may be some pain and discomfort. Symptoms then progress to more severe: confusion, delirium, abnormal behavior, and hallucinations. If it gets this far, the disease is nearly 100 percent fatal.

Although worldwide it is estimated that there are more than 69 000 deaths due to rabies annually, human rabies cases are extremely rare in the United States, which averages less than 5 human rabies cases annually.

Human rabies is prevented by administration of rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin.

There are rabies vaccinations approved for horses. Horses can also expose humans through a bite, or cause a human being serious injury because of the infected animal's aggression. If you interact with animals, regardless of whether they are equine, bovine, feline, canine, or other, please vaccinate them against rabies. - Mod.TG]

[2] South Dakota: skunk, human exposure

[CO] had hoped to see some shooting stars during the meteor shower on Thursday night [11 Aug 2016]. Instead, she wound up with shooting pains in her foot from the bites of an attacking skunk.
That meant a late-night trip to the hospital and the start of a series of injections to protect her from the life-threatening rabies virus.

[The woman] had just settled in with her husband [W], daughter [A], son-in-law [H] and grandsons [V], 7, and [H], 5, in the dark of their Meade County [South Dakota] ranch to watch the Perseid meteor shower, when she felt sharp pains in her right foot just after 10 pm. "Something's chewing on me," she yelled.

In spite of the near total darkness on their ranch, located near the Belle Fourche River 26 miles [about 42 km] northeast of Sturgis, [she] knew right away the identity of her assailant. "I looked down and I could see the white stripe, even though it was dark," she said. "I said, run everyone, run."

The family scrambled for safety as the skunk first chased [CO] across a deck toward their house, then disappeared into the darkness. [The woman] was taken to the Sturgis Regional Hospital emergency room where she was treated for deep bite wounds to her foot. She also received the 1st of a 5 shots series, the beginning of a which is a rabies immunoglobulin and then 4 rabies injections over a series of several days.

Left untreated, rabies can lead to fever, headache, and confusion, and later to anxiety, hallucinations, paralysis, and excessive salivation before eventually causing death.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rabies killed more than 100 people annually at the turn of the 20th century, with the virus mostly in domestic animals prior to 1960.

The injections, while painful, have been almost completely effective in stopping the virus. Now most cases are seen in wildlife and unvaccinated pets.

According to the CDC, most human deaths, 1 or 2 per year since the 1990s, are suffered by those who fail to seek early treatment, many because they don't realize they have been bitten or scratched by an infected animal.

In South Dakota, skunks, raccoons, and bats are primary carriers of rabies, according to state epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger of Pierre. "60 percent of the skunks we test are rabid," Kightlinger said. "It's an ever-present, year-round danger."

[CO] had detected the smell of a skunk around the ranch in recent days and had mentioned again a slight odor before she was attacked Thursday night [11 Aug 2016].

A whiff of skunk odor is a common occurrence in rural areas. [Her daughter] initially joked about [CO] just trying to frighten everyone when she reported the pungent smell on [Thu 11 Aug 2016]. "I had never seen an animal do that before, just come up and start biting someone," she said.

Kightlinger said aggressiveness is another indication of rabies. Rabid skunks will bite and even chase people into a building, clawing at doors, he said.

"A normal skunk will just run away from you," he said. "Rabid skunks can be vicious."

Kightlinger said of 421 skunks tested in the state from 2006 to 2015, 206 were found to be infected with rabies. That includes 12 rabid animals reported in Meade County and 4 rabies cases in Pennington County over that period.

He said of 13 cases of rabid animals reported in South Dakota thus far in 2016, 7 were skunks.

Anyone bitten or scratched by a skunk will almost automatically be subjected to rabies injections, he said. "You don't guess, because the likelihood is that the skunk is going to be rabid," Kightlinger said.

Kightlinger urges anyone encountering a potentially rabid animal attempt to have it captured for testing, but only if it can be done safely.

Since [CO] is already undergoing treatment for presumed exposure to rabies, catching the skunk that attacked her is a moot point, except to confirm the presence of the virus.

The [family] plans to set traps to prevent another attack. "I hope we catch it," [CO] said.

[3] Illinois: bat, possible human exposure

http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-palos-hospital-bats-st-0816-20160815-story.html


A bat found in the obstetrics unit at Palos Community Hospital has tested positive for rabies, according to the Cook County [Illinois] Department of Public Health.

Two bats found earlier this month [August 2016] in the OB were tested, Deanna Durica, a spokeswoman for the Health Department, said [Mon 15 Aug 2016].

As a precaution, vaccines intended to prevent rabies are being administered to people who may have been exposed to the bats, she said. It was not clear how many people were receiving the series of vaccines and whether it included hospital staff and patients.

The hospital, in a statement last week [week of 8 Aug 2016], had said that at "no time were patients ever in contact with the animals and they have been given a full update on the situation."

After the discovery of the bats, the OB unit was closed and obstetrics patients were relocated to another area of the Palos Heights hospital while an evaluation was made of how the bats got into the building.

Although there was apparently no human contact with the bats, the Health Department has "established protocols" for reducing the risk of rabies possibly being transmitted, Durica said. She said hospital officials and the department have "cooperated well together."

It wasn't clear [Mon 15 Aug 2016] whether the obstetrics unit at Palos had reopened.

[This article is a little confusing as it states that PEP (postexposure prophylaxis) is being given to those who may have been exposed -- the article clearly states it could include patients and staff -- but then the article concludes by saying there was no human contact with the bat. If there is no exposure why is PEP being given? CDC and most states recommend PEP only when inapparent exposure may have occurred, for example, if an individual is asleep or unconscious and a rabid or potentially rabid bat was present. PEP is also recommended when a rabid or unknown bat is found in a room with an infant or small child who can't communicate an exposure. Bite marks and scratches caused by bats may be too small to detect. - Mod.TG/LM

http://www.wyff4.com/news/pet-cat-exposes-4-to-rabies-health-officials-say/41261824


What happened to the latest South Carolina rabies victims is a cautionary tale for any pet owners.

A pet cat exposed 4 people to the potentially deadly virus, the Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] said [Thu 18 Aug 2016].

The 4 victims have started post-exposure treatment, officials said.

They reported to officials that the cat began to show abnormal behavior last [Thu 11 Aug 2016]. The victims were bitten or exposed to saliva while trying to provide care for the animal, officials said.

The cat died on [Fri 12 Aug 2016], and DHEC's scientists confirmed on [Mon 15 Aug 2016] that it had rabies.

"Pets, particularly those that stay outdoors, have the potential to come in contact with wild or stray animals," officials said in a release. "If unexplained, visible wounds are found on your pet, immediately seek veterinary treatment and inform your local DHEC Environmental Health Services office."

They also advised keeping pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination.

"Rabies is a deadly virus that is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body, usually through a bite or contact with an open wound or areas, such as the mouth or eyes," said Sandra Craig, of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services.

The cat is the 5th animal in Greenwood County to test positive for rabies in 2016, according to DHEC. There have been 67 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide this year, compared to last year when seven of the 130 rabies cases in South Carolina were in Greenwood County.

[5] Minnesota: fox, human exposure

http://www.startribune.com/fox-suspected-in-two-lake-harriet-attacks-tests-positive-for-rabies/390746811/


The fox suspected of attacking 2 people this week near Lake Harriet [Minneapolis, Minnesota] has tested positive for rabies, authorities said [Fri 19 Aug 2016].

The animal was captured and euthanized Wednesday morning [17 Aug 2016] shortly after sinking its teeth into the leg of a 2nd victim, who was taking an early morning jog by the lake's south beach.

Minneapolis Animal Care and Control officers found the fox near the corner of Lake Harriet and West Minnehaha parkways, within a block of where the 1st person was bitten Tuesday afternoon [16 Aug 2016]. At the time of its capture, the aggressive fox showed signs of rabies but had to be tested at the University of Minnesota to confirm the infection.

Everyone who came in contact with the fox, described as a female weighing under 10 pounds [4.5 kg], received a series of vaccination shots for rabies. [This would be a post exposure prophylaxis - Mod.TG]

[A 51-year-old woman] of Eagan, was removing her bicycle from the rack on her vehicle around noon [Tue 16 Aug 2016] when she suddenly felt something around her feet. Then the fox latched on for about 8 seconds.

She had to pry it off her calf as she screamed for help. Bystanders ran to her aid and poured water on the bleeding wound before she drove herself to the hospital.

Residents told emergency responders that foxes are common in the area and that a woman in the neighborhood "may be feeding [and] allowing foxes to live under her deck," the incident report said.

Animal Control officials have been patrolling the area of the attack, and the department's staff intends to investigate possible illegal feeding of foxes.

[Not long] after the 1st attack, [MS] was taking his daily sunrise run around Lake Harriet when he stopped to stretch. As he put his hand on a wooden sign to sturdy himself, he felt a bite on his left leg, according to the incident report. [He] had to kick the fox to loosen its grip. When it started to charge at him again, he took off running until he lost sight of it.

Rabid mammals are rare in Minneapolis, and it's unusual for a fox to venture so close to a human, said Animal Control deputy director Caroline Hairfield.

Skunks and bats are the wild animals most commonly carrying rabies in the state, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Domestic animals are typically infected after being bitten by a rabid skunk. Officials recommend making sure your pets' vaccinations are up to date, and they discourage ever feeding wild animals.

Animal control officials have confirmed Cary's [in Wake and Chatham counties, North Carolina] 1st case of rabies this year [2016] after a fox attacked a jogger and 2 dogs.

Officials tell local media outlets that the attack happened at around 7 am [Wed 17 Aug 2016]. Police euthanized the animal and took it to the State Laboratory of Public Health, where testing confirmed the fox was rabid.

The jogger is receiving medical care, and both dogs had current rabies vaccinations and received booster shots.

The town's last reported case of rabies was in October 2014.

[7] New York: bait packets

The fight against rabies is a constant battle. The [New York] Erie County Health Department is taking that fight to the skies.

Peter Tripi, the Senior Public Health Sanitarian with the Erie County Department of Health said, "Approximately 400 000 bait packs will be placed throughout Erie County, Erie County Department of Health Vector Control Staff plan on dropping 5000 to 6000 by hand."

Over the next couple of days you might see small green packets scattered around the area. Tripi says those baits will help protect wildlife -- which will in turn help protect us and our pets.

"The primary target is raccoons, however, raccoons, skunks, and fox are always an issue for us with rabid animals, as well as bats, but a bat cannot eat this vaccination."

If you come across one of these baits, you should leave them alone, unless they're in area where children or pets play.

"If you can, use a glove or a stick to kick them back into a wooded area, If a pet comes into contact with it, for example if a dog eats one it's not going to hurt it, but you can certainly feel free to contact your veterinarian."

The rural areas will be covered by planes. Helicopters will take care of the suburban areas -- and a ground team will place the baits the more urban areas. Niagara County is also undertaking their own drops as well.

Tripi says he wants to remind people that they can help in the fight by getting their pets vaccinated.

"It is the law in Erie County, and in New York State, as well as across the nation to vaccinate our pets, that's why we don't have people dying of rabies or our pets dying of rabies, because of these mandatory vaccinations."

[8] Alberta: bat, human exposure

After a pair of confirmed bat bites in southern Alberta, [Alberta Health Services] (AHS) is reminding residents to report all wild animal bites as bats, foxes, coyotes, raccoons and skunks may be rabies carriers.

AHS says there were 2 bat bites in the South Zone last week [week of 8 Aug 2016]. It's prompting a reminder for residents to report ALL wild animal bites as bats, foxes, coyotes, raccoons, and skunks may be rabies carriers. AHS is also encouraging people to vaccinate pets against rabies, avoid contact with stray dogs or cats, and avoid contact with bats. Officials say household pets and indoor animals rarely get rabies due to vaccination and lack of exposure, but each year a number of bats and occasionally other animals, like outdoor cats, do test positive for rabies. AHS did not say exactly where those 2 confirmed bat bites took place in southern Alberta.

This is a plea to vaccinate your pets, whether they are your horse, your show steer, or a dog or cat. Vaccination may save your animal's life and even your own, or that of a family member or a friend. Vaccination of domestic animals is the 1st line of defense against this disease.

According the Centers for Disease Control the rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) schedule for persons not previously vaccinated against rabies is:

- Wound cleaning: all PEP should begin with immediate thorough cleansing of all wounds with soap and water. If available, a virucidal agent (such as povidone-iodine solution) should be used to irrigate the wounds. Follow the cleaning with human rabies immunoglobulin.

- Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG): administer 20 IU/kg body weight. If anatomically feasible, the full dose should be infiltrated around and into the wound(s), and any remaining volume should be administered at an anatomical site (intramuscular [IM]) distant from vaccine administration. Also, HRIG should not be administered in the same syringe as vaccine. Because RIG might partially suppress active production of rabies virus antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be administered. Follow the HRIG with the vaccine.

- Vaccine: human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) 1.0 mL, IM (deltoid area*), 1 each on days 0**, 3, 7 and 14.

* The deltoid area is the only acceptable site of vaccination for adults and older children. For younger children, the outer aspect of the thigh may be used. Vaccine should never be administered in the gluteal area.
** Day 0 is the day dose 1 of vaccine is administered

Further, according to the CDC:
Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shot at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.
