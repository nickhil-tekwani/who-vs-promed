Ebola DRC - Special communication from the minister of health on the epidemiological situation in North Kivu province
-----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has just published this Ebola DRC - Special communication from the minister of health on the epidemiological situation in North Kivu Province.

Special Communication from His Excellency the minister of health regarding the epidemiological situation in the Province of North Kivu on [Wed 1 Aug 2018]

Dear Compatriots, Ladies and Gentlemen:

On Sat 28 Jul 2018, the Provincial Health Division of North Kivu notified to the Ministry of Health 26 cases of fever with haemorrhagic signs, including 20 deaths, in the health zone of Mangina located in the health zone of Mabalako, territory of Beni, in the Province of North Kivu.

Six samples were taken from hospitalized patients who arrived in Kinshasa on Tue 31 Jul 2018 and were analyzed by the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB). Of the 6 samples analyzed, 4 were positive for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Sequencing is in progress at INRB to identify the strain of the virus.

Dear compatriots, ladies and gentlemen:

Just a week after announcing the end of the 9th epidemic of EVD in the Equator Province, the DRC is facing a new epidemic. At this stage, there is no indication that these 2 epidemics, separated by more than 2500 km [1553 mi] are related.

As EVD is endemic in several parts of the country due to the equatorial forest ecosystem, the Ministry of Health has already strengthened its epidemiological surveillance system in all risk areas, including North Kivu.

Although we did not expect to face a 10th epidemic so early, the detection of the virus is an indicator of the proper functioning of the surveillance system put in place by the General Directorate for Disease Control.

A team of 12 experts from the Ministry of Health based in Kinshasa will arrive in Beni this Thu 2 Aug 2018 to set up the various components of the response. This team of laboratory technicians, epidemiologists, clinical psychologists, and doctors for medical care will carry a mobile laboratory of the INRB and personal protective equipment.

Dear compatriots, Ladies and Gentlemen:

The Ministry of Health is taking all necessary steps to quickly and effectively contain this new outbreak of EVD.

All the usual components of the epidemic response are activated, namely laboratory, medical care, epidemiological surveillance, social mobilization, and logistics.

In addition, due to the security situation in the affected areas, a new security component has been put in place to ensure the protection of the deployed healthcare providers and the population.

Therapeutic molecules are already available in the country. The ethics and scientific committees will determine the most appropriate curative and preventive treatments for this 10th epidemic.

We invite people, especially those in the Beni territory and neighboring areas, to remain calm and stay in their health zone in order to benefit from adequate care and treatment during transport. Further information will be communicated in a transparent manner as the situation on the ground progresses.

Thank you.

[This news comes just one week after the DRC declared an end to its 9th Ebola outbreak. Whether the 2 are related is not yet known. Ebola has been suspected and is now confirmed. This is a very serious situation because of the rainforest habitat and the danger of working in the region. North Kivu was formerly a "sub-region" in the region of Kivu. The region was the scene of much fighting during the Second Congo War (1998-2003) and the Kivu conflict (2004-present). The Kivu conflict began in 2004 in the eastern Congo as an armed conflict between the military of the DRC (FARDC) and the Hutu Power group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in the DRC. It has broadly consisted of 3 phases, the 3rd of which is an ongoing conflict. Prior to March 2009, the main combatant group against the FARDC was the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP). Following the cessation of hostilities between these 2 forces, rebel Tutsi forces, formerly under the command of Laurent Nkunda, became the dominant opposition to the government forces. They have operated as the Botswana Defense Force since they commenced operations in late December 2016 (Wikipedia).

The province is near Congo's border with Uganda, making spread of the virus a possibility. Prophylactic vaccination of the population should commence immediately. Nurses were on strike delaying the news release, according to North Kivu provincial health minister, Martial Kambumbu. Let's hope they come to work immediately to respond to this emergency, if they have not done so already.

One has to wonder whether the sick and dead patients in the DRC whom the medical missionary who returned to the USA and became ill was treating, were Ebola patients (see ProMED-mail Ebola update (56): northeast Congo DR, Ebola-like cases, US negative, RFI http://promedmail.org/post/20180730.5936610)

Ebola outbreak 30 km [18.6 mi] from Beni: Already 20 suspicious deaths
-------------------------------------------
The 10th Ebola outbreak was declared on Wed 1 Aug 2018 in the DRC. According to data from the Ministry of Health, 26 cases of fever with hemorrhagic signs, including 20 deaths, were reported in the health area of Mangina located in the health zone of Mabalako, Beni territory, in the province of North Kivu.

Of the 6 samples analyzed on Tue 31 Jul 2018 and analyzed by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB), 4 were positive for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The strain of the virus is not yet determined, and the link between this new outbreak and that declared over in Equateur province is not (yet) determined.

"A team of 12 experts from the Ministry of Health based in Kinshasa will arrive in Beni this Thu 2 Aug 2018 to put in place the various components of the response. This team of laboratory technicians, epidemiologists, clinical psychologists, and doctors for medical care will carry a mobile laboratory of the INRB and personal protective equipment," says a statement from the Ministry of Health that adds it will take all useful provisions "to quickly and effectively contain this new EVD epidemic."

The Congolese government declared on Tue 24 Jul 2018 the end of the EVD epidemic that officially broke out on Tue 8 May 2018 in the Province of Ecuador. A total of 54 cases were identified, including 33 deaths and 21 survivors.
