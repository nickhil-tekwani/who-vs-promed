Foot-and-Mouth Tests Negative
--------------------------------------
The first 13 humans tested for foot & mouth disease have all been
cleared, but 2 more suspected cases are being investigated, the Public
Health Laboratory Service said Saturday.
The last confirmed human case in Britain was a man infected in 1966.
Human infections of foot & mouth disease are extremely rare, and
victims recover quickly.
The Ministry of Agriculture said 13 new cases of foot & mouth disease
in
livestock were confirmed in the 24-hour period ending Friday evening,
raising the total to 1495 since the first case was confirmed on 20 Feb
2001.

[Thanks also to H. Larry Penning & others who sent in the negative
results as they were reported.
Even if one or both of the remaining cases pending turn out to be
positive, these results show that human cases of FMD remain extremely
rare -- which is encouraging in view of the massive exposure to the
virus of many of those involved in culling & carcass disposal. -
