Canadian scientists have shown that the deadliest form of Ebolavirus could be transmitted by air between species.

In experiments, they demonstrated that the virus was transmitted from pigs to monkeys without any direct contact between them. The researchers say they believe that limited airborne transmission might be contributing to the spread of the disease in some parts of Africa. They are concerned that pigs might be a natural host for the lethal infection. Details of the research were published in the journal Scientific Reports [Hana M Weingartl et al. Transmission of Ebola virus from pigs to non-human primates. Scientific Reports 2, Article number 811, doi:10.1038/srep00811; http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/121115/srep00811/full/srep00811.html].

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the infection gets into humans through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, and other bodily fluids from a number of species, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelope. The fruit bat has long been considered the natural reservoir of the infection. But a growing body of experimental evidence suggests that pigs, both wild and domestic, could be a hidden source of Zaire Ebolavirus, the most deadly of the Ebolaviruses. Now, researchers from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the country's Public Health Agency have shown that pigs infected with this form of Ebolavirus can pass the disease on to macaques without any direct contact between the species.

In their experiments, the pigs carrying the virus were housed in pens with the monkeys in close proximity but separated by a wire barrier. After 8 days, some of the macaques were showing clinical signs typical of Ebolavirus [infection] and were euthanised. One possibility is that the monkeys became infected by inhaling large aerosol droplets produced from the respiratory tracts of the pigs. Pigs could act as a host and amplify Ebola-like viruses. One of the scientists involved is Dr Gary Kobinger from the National Microbiology Laboratory at the Public Health Agency of Canada. He told BBC News this was the most likely route of the infection. "What we suspect is happening is large droplets; they can stay in the air, but not long; they don't go far," he explained. "But they can be absorbed in the airway, and this is how the infection starts, and this is what we think, because we saw a lot of evidence in the lungs of the non-human primates that the virus got in that way."

The scientists say that their findings could explain why some pig farmers in the Philippines had antibodies in their system for the presence of a different version of the infection called Reston Ebolavirus. The farmers had not been involved in slaughtering the pigs and had no known contact with contaminated tissues. Dr Kobinger stresses that the transmission in the air is not similar to influenza or other infections. He points to the experience of most human outbreaks in Africa. "The reality is that they are contained, and they remain local; if it was really an airborne virus like influenza is, it would spread all over the place, and that's not happening."

The authors believe that more work needs to be done to clarify the role of wild and domestic pigs in spreading the virus. There have been anecdotal accounts of pigs dying at the start of human outbreaks. Dr Kobinger believes that if pigs do play a part, it could help contain the virus. "If they do play a role in human outbreaks, it would be a very easy point to intervene," he said. "It would be easier to vaccinate pigs against Ebolavirus infection than humans."

Other experts in the field were concerned about the idea that Ebolavirus was susceptible to being transmitted by air even if the distance the virus could travel was limited. Dr Larry Zeitlin is the president of Mapp Biopharmaceuticals. "It's an impressive study that not only raises questions about the reservoir of Ebolavirus in the wild but, more importantly, elevates concerns about Ebola as a public health threat," he told BBC News. "The thought of airborne transmission is pretty frightening."

The abstract of the paper reads as follows:

"Ebola viruses (EBOV) cause often fatal hemorrhagic fever in several species of simian primates including humans. While fruit bats are considered the natural reservoir, involvement of other species in EBOV transmission is unclear. In 2009, Reston-EBOV was the 1st EBOV detected in swine with indicated transmission to humans. In-contact transmission of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV) between pigs was demonstrated experimentally. Here, we show ZEBOV transmission from pigs to cynomolgus macaques without direct contact. Interestingly, transmission between macaques in similar housing conditions was never observed. Piglets inoculated oro-nasally with ZEBOV were transferred to the room housing macaques in an open, inaccessible cage system. All macaques became infected. Infectious virus was detected in oro-nasal swabs of piglets and in blood, swabs, and tissues of macaques. This is the 1st report of experimental interspecies virus transmission, with the macaques also used as a human surrogate. Our finding may influence prevention and control measures during EBOV outbreaks."

These experiments are interesting in that they demonstrate the susceptibility of pigs to Zaire Ebolavirus and that the virus from infected pigs can be transmitted to macaques under experimental conditions by an aerosol route. They fall short of establishing that this is a normal route of transmission of Ebolavirus in the natural environment. The evidence that pigs play a role in the transmission of Ebolavirus, other than Reston Ebolavirus, remains circumstantial but something that should be pursued with urgency. It is curious that transmission between macaques in similar housing conditions was never observed. - Mod.CP

Clearly Ebolavirus is very contagious but there is only weak circumstantial evidence that transmission from pigs occurs via the porcine breath aerosol. Anyone who has been around pigs knows that they urinate and not in dribbles. Splashing urine (+ Ebolavirus) could readily produce a urine mist that could make its way to an immediately adjoining cage with macaques and in their grooming themselves get infected. - Mod.MHJ
