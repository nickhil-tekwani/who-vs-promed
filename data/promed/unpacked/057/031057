The Costa Rican public health ministry announced Saturday that
leptospirosis has increased in the country in the last three years. The
ministry's statistics show that the disease has gone from 27 cases in 1997
to 112 so far this year. The communities of Limon, Turrialba, San Carlos
and Golfito have reported the biggest number of such cases.
The symptoms of leptospirosis include intense shivering, fever, severe
myalgia, lumbar pain and infections. This disease is transmitted by contact
of skin with contaminated water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been
soiled by urine of infected animals.
Experts said that animals are the main source of the leptospirosis
contagion. Sanitary authorities have recommend preventive measures such as
abstaining from swimming in waters that might have been tainted,
immunization of farm animals and isolation of pets.
