'Millions of people in Asia potentially exposed to health risks of popular herbal medicines'

Scientists from King's College London are warning that millions of people may be exposed to risk of developing kidney failure and bladder cancer by taking herbal medicines that are widely available in Asia.

The medicines, used for a wide range of conditions including slimming, asthma, and arthritis, are derived from a botanical compound containing aristolochic acids. These products are now banned in the USA and many European countries but the herbs containing this toxic acid can still be bought in China and other countries in Asia and are also available worldwide over the internet.

The scientists reviewed worldwide cases of aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) -- a type of kidney failure caused by the intake of these acids. They explain the clinical basis for the disease and propose strategies to help doctors identify it and treat patients more effectively. They suggest that there may be many thousands of cases across Asia that are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. With the outcome of their study, the researchers hope to raise awareness of the risks of aristolochic acids and reduce the global disease burden from this severe condition.

Lead author Professor Graham Lord, Director of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, said: 'We have found evidence that many millions of people continue to be exposed to significant health risk due to these herbal medicines, widely used in China and India.' He added: 'There is also a striking lack of good quality evidence that might help guide the diagnosis and management of AAN.'

The paper, published in Annals of Internal Medicine today [19 MAR 2013], indicates that regulatory measures that have so far been adopted by national and international agencies may be inadequate in preventing harmful exposure to aristolochic acid. The compound is linked to many cases of kidney diseases and urothelial cancer, a form of cancer of which bladder cancer is the most known variant.

The authors reviewed the latest data on the epidemiology of AAN. They used several search engines to include all publications that are about or refer to aristolochic acid and Chinese herbal nephropathy and identified 42 different case studies and one trial relating to the management of the disease.

While explaining the origin and development of the disease, they propose a protocol which should make it easier to diagnose AAN. In addition, they suggest a new disease classification to help international clinicians better identify AAN patients and draft guidelines for the treatment of these patients.

The research team consisted of an international collaboration of scientists from Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany and the UK. Dr Refik Goekmen, co-author from King's, said: 'This research is a great demonstration of how international scientific collaboration is vital in helping to describe how a toxin used in widely available products can lead to cancer.'

The study was funded in part by the Association for International Cancer Research and Professor Graham Lord is supported by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London.

Abstract
--------
It has been 20 years since the 1st description of a rapidly progressive renal disease that is associated with the consumption of Chinese herbs containing aristolochic acid (AA) and is now termed aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). Recent data have shown that AA is also the primary causative agent in Balkan endemic nephropathy and associated urothelial cancer. Aristolochic acid nephropathy is associated with a high long-term risk for renal failure and urothelial cancer, and the potential worldwide population exposure is enormous. This evidence-based review of the diagnostic approach to and management of AAN draws on the authors' experience with the largest and longest-studied combined cohort of patients with this condition. It is hoped that a better understanding of the importance of this under-recognized and severe condition will improve epidemiologic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies to reduce the global burden of this disease.

Scientists in Britain have pulled together previous studies about an ingredient in some herbal medicines that can cause severe kidney disease and cancer.

The research is a wake-up call to users of some traditional remedies and to governments that could regulate use of the herbs.

In the early 1990s, an epidemic of kidney disease broke out in Belgium among young women who had been treated with Chinese herbal medicines at a weight-loss clinic. The herbs come from a family called _Aristolochia_. They are used to treat skin conditions, joint pain, and other symptoms.

Graham Lord of Kings College London says the ailment was traced to aristolochic acid, an ingredient in some of the herbs. "It binds to DNA and causes kidney disease," Lord says. "It causes cancer in areas where it's most concentrated, which probably explains why the cancers are mostly focused around the urinary tract and the kidney."

Lord is the lead author of a new paper describing the kidney disease, now known as aristolochic acid neuropathy (AAN), and suggesting standardized diagnosis and treatment protocols.

Herbs containing aristolochic acid are banned from Europe and the United States, and the resulting form of kidney disease is now mostly found elsewhere. "Import bans, working with the herbal practitioners that in the past have used this drug, can be extraordinarily effective," Lord says.

In places where use of these herbs is common, cases of AAN persist. "In Chinese Taiwan, there's epidemiological surveys suggesting that tens if not hundreds of thousands of people have been exposed to this particular herb," says Lord, who acknowledges it's hard to know how many people are actually getting kidney disease from these herbs. A definitive diagnosis requires advanced testing to differentiate from other kinds of kidney disease.

In his review of 2 decades of published medical literature, Lord found reports of the disease in Europe, North America, and Asia. But nothing in other areas of the world where herbal medicines are widely used. "That's probably because we've not looked in a systematic manner," he says. "It would surprise me if there wasn't an incidence of this disease in Africa and in South America as well."

Treatment of AAN usually requires dialysis or even kidney transplant. Lord says it's important to identify kidney disease caused by aristolochic acid, so doctors can monitor the patient for cancer, which is more likely than with other causes of kidney failure.

While India is known world over for its alternative healing therapies right from Ayurveda, Unani, Naturopathy, Siddha Vaidya, and homeopathy, the news that these 'natural remedies' may be causing more harm than good is quite alarming.

The compound in question is aristolochic acid. It has been found that the compound is now capable of causing a condition called aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) (a type of kidney failure caused by the consumption of medicines that contain this compound), kidney diseases and urothelial cancer.

The FDA [Food and Drug Administration] has banned the substance from being used in a number of herbal medicines and even issued a list of herbal medicines that might contain this deadly drug. They have clearly stated that if your herbal medicine bottle contains the ingredients such as 'Aristolochia,' 'Bragantia', or 'Asarum' listed as ingredients on the label; you must discontinue its use immediately.

A common component in Chinese medicine, it is usually used for weight loss, diarrhoea, to improve the immune system, to provide relief from cough and joint pain. It is also used to relieve the pain during child birth.

The ill effects of this acid first came to light in the 1990s when a group of Belgian women, developed end stage kidney disease. It was later found that all of them were following a weight loss regime in which the herbal drugs they were consuming contained aristolochic acid. The disease was then called Chinese herb nephropathy. Later, a 2nd disease called endemic Balkan nephropathy was discovered to be due to the same compound. The cumulative name for all the damage the compound caused was called AAN or aristolochic acid nephropathy.

To get better ideas on how crucial this compound is in Indian herbal remedies, we talked to Anusuya Suresh, a pharmacologist by profession. She is well known for her book 'Industrial Pharmacognosy', based on the subject of plant based medicines. Here are excerpts from our interview:

Pavitra: Is aristolochic acid widely used in most or all herbal drugs? Is it some sort of base used in all medicines?

Anusuya: No, it is not a base. Aristolochic acid is found in herbal products prepared using the herb _Aristolochia indica_, also called Ishwari in Hindi. 2 such products sold in India include Mahavishagarbha Taila, Gorocanadi Gutika. There are other species of this plant that are used in herbal products in China (_Aristolochia fangchi_) as well as in other countries (_Aristolochia serpentaria_ in North America).

Pavitra: Can this component cause conditions such as aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), kidney failure, and other cancers?

Anusuya: Yes, it can. Research studies have found that presence of aristolochic acid is associated with permanent damage to the kidney and kidney failure and urinary tract cancers. The USFDA advises customers against buying herbal products that contain this compound.

Pavitra: And at what concentration is this compound dangerous?

Anusuya: Mere micrograms of aristolochic acid are sufficient to induce damage.

Pavitra: Are there any principles in preparation of herbal medicines that govern the use of this compound?

Anusuya: Aristolochic acid is not something that is a chemical compound added to all herbal medicines; if a herbal product contains any extract or part of the herb of _Aristolochia_ species, it is likely to contain aristolochic acid.

Pavitra: Generically, which conditions can be treated using medication that contains aristolochic acid?

Anusuya: It was being used in traditional Indian medicine as an antidote against snakebite and also to prevent infections (in the mother) following childbirth and as an anthelmintic (agent that kills intestinal worms). In Chinese medicine, it is used as a painkiller and anti-inflammatory agent against rheumatism.

Pavitra: How important is this compound in the herbal medicine? Does it increase efficacy or any other important function a drug might have?

Anusuya: Again, it is not something that will be there in all herbal medicines, only a few, which include _Aristolochia_ species herbs. Just like all allopathic medicines will not contain paracetamol, only particular products where it has been added will contain it.

What is most important in all of this is that the consumer has to be more aware about what medicines are being prescribed. Blind faith in 'natural remedies' may serve some people well, but not all 'remedies' are capable of solving every problem.

Myanmar researchers confirm that herbal medicine Indian birthwort is deadly. A plant commonly used in herbal medicine contains a cancer-causing substance and has been found to cause kidney damage in laboratory tests on mice, a researcher at the department of medical research said.

Dr Khin Chit, from the department's pharmaceutical toxicology research division, said long-term use of Indian birthwort, known scientifically as _Aristolochia indica_ (Linn), can cause kidney failure. It also contains the carcinogenic substance aristolochic acid, Khin Chit said.

In Myanmar the plant is used to treat hepatitis B and C, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers, according to botanist Thida Swe from the department of traditional medicine.

Three health ministry departments have investigated the pharmacology of the plant since last November [2012]: the department of traditional medicine, the department of medical research (Lower Myanmar), and the pharmaceutical toxicology research division.

Researchers investigated the plant's toxicity by feeding extracts to white mice. 40 white mice were divided into 4 groups, one of which did not receive the extract. 3 remaining groups of 10 mice each were given different amounts of the extract over 14 days: one group of mice was fed 300 mg/kg of the extract; a 2nd group was fed 2 gm/kg; and, a 3rd was fed 5 gm/kg, researchers said.

Although none of the mice died, those that were fed the most extract were more likely to develop kidney problems, researchers said. Blood samples of the mice showed rising levels of substances urea and creatinine in those that had been fed 2 and 5 gm/kg doses of extract, researchers said. Higher levels of these substances indicate kidney damage, they said. Biopsies of kidney tissue also showed inflammation and internal bleeding among the mice that had been fed 5 gm/kg of extract.

The research team also sought to measure effects on the mice's brains, hearts, lungs, gall bladders, stomachs, duodenums, and colons.

The herb contains flavonoids, polyphenols, tannins, and saponins, which are used in herbal anticancer drugs, antioxidants, spermicides, sedatives and expectorants. However, it also contains cyanogenic glycoside, which releases hydrogen cyanide, a substance that is extremely poisonous.

Health authorities in Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States have been warning for more than a decade that the herbal medicine can cause kidney failure and cancer.

[While this posting is long, it was decided that there is much information in each piece presented with minimal repetition. This problem has been around for a few decades but now the reason, as well as other aspects of the plants and products it is found in as well as some local uses, are presented.

As always the dose makes the poison, but this is a clear case of let the users beware and all users of herbal products should educate themselves on the expected and unexpected results of using these products. Natural product does not mean safe. Natural products can be just as reactive and toxic as manufactured products. - Mod.TG]
