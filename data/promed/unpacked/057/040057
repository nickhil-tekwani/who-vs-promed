[ref: C Kannan, et al. _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ causes a damaging dieback
of cocoa in India. BSPP New Disease Reports 2009 (Feb-Aug); 19]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Cocoa (_Theobroma cacao_) is mainly grown as a mixed crop in
coconut/arecanut gardens in India. In September 2000 a rapid dieback of
cocoa was first observed in Hunsur Taluq of Mysore district, Karnataka,
India. Affected trees show sudden yellowing and browning of leaves (fig 1)
followed by rapid dieback of branches from the tips. Infected twigs have
brownish, short vertical streaks in the vascular tissues. Affected trees
continue to decline for several days and they soon die, although new
flushes still develop at the collar regions during the monsoon (fig 2).
Pods do not develop in diseased trees but if formed earlier become
mummified. Trees are affected at all growth stages and throughout the year.
Mortality is most severe from March to May.

Investigations of the disease began in 2003 but it was not until 2007 that
the cause was consistently associated with a fungus isolated from affected
twigs (fig 3) and confirmed as _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_. Sterile cotton
swabs containing _L. theobromae_ mycelium were rubbed on pre-wounded stems
of 8 month old seedlings. Typical vascular streaking (fig 4) and dieback
symptoms appeared within 20 days, exhibiting a similar aggressive response
to _L. theobromae_ on cocoa in Cameroon [see link below]. _L. theobromae_
was reisolated from the inoculated seedlings. Control swabs with sterile
water did not produce symptoms.

_L. theobromae_ is a non-prominent pathogen of 60 plant hosts in India and
is the cause of charcoal pod rot of cocoa. This is, however, the 1st report
of a damaging dieback and death of cocoa plants, as witnessed in Mysore
district. Currently confined to an area of 260 ha [643 acres], the
incidence of the disease in cocoa gardens varies from 10 to 56 per cent.
With the rapid expansion of cocoa in India under way, this disease is a
potential threat to future production.

[The fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was first reported in Cameroon in
1895 associated with charcoal pod rot of cocoa, but was subsequently found
to have a wide host range of more than 280 species of tropical trees and
shrubs. Symptoms may include wilting, dieback of branches, gummy exudates,
vascular discolouration, complete defoliation, and death of the host. It is
thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may
increase the susceptibility of some hosts. Fungicides may be helpful in
disease management if applied quickly enough. Affected crops include citrus
and grapevine, and the fungus is also associated with sudden decline of
mango, which quickly kills the trees.

Charcoal pod rot of cocoa appears to occur more frequently during dry
seasons and affects pods of all ages. Symptoms include pale yellow spots
starting from the ends of the pod, which enlarge until the entire pod
appears dark brown. Eventually, the pod develops a charcoal black sooty
appearance due to formation of fungal spores. Considerable yield losses due
to the disease have been reported from some cocoa producing areas,
including the Indian state of Kerala.

Recently, a new lethal dieback of cocoa due to the same pathogen has been
described in Cameroon where _L. theobromae_ is becoming a major constraint
to cocoa production. The report above now indicates that the same dieback
disease is also present in India. Similar increases in pathogen virulence
have also been reported on other crops such as mango and kumquat in other
countries. These developments would suggest that new, more virulent strains
of the fungus may be emerging and/or spreading.
