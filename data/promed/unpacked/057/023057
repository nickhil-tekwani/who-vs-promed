["European foulbrood (EFB) is a brood disease caused by the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_.

"Larvae of all ages are susceptible to infection and become infected after ingesting food contaminated with the bacteria. The bacterium then multiples in the mid-gut of the larvae and competes for larval food, resulting in the larvae dying of starvation. EFB is characterized by patchy brood with uncapped brood cells where the dead or dying larvae appear curled upwards, and are brown or yellow, making the larvae appear to be 'molten' in the cell.

"The incidence of EFB is generally higher when the colony is under stress, which may be caused by hive movement, climatic conditions such as cool and wet weather conditions, or poor nutrition. Heavy infestations will affect a large percentage of the brood, weakening the colony over time, and possibly leading to the death of the colony".
