The National Institute for Virology, South Africa has confirmed 7 cases
(one case was previously reported in Update 9) of Marburg haemorrhagic
fever from the Watsa Health Zone in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Onset dates of illness range from late-December 1999 to mid-February 2000.
All of the 6 new cases occurred in adult males and three of these have
died, but it is not known at this time if the cases were gold miners
working in Durba. Marburg infections in miners in Durba were first
diagnosed in April 1999, but are believed to have begun as early as
November 1998.
