In an apparent response to objections raised by Kenya's Director of Medical
Services, James Mwanzia, and Director of Fisheries, Mathias Wafula, the
European Union has relaxed its ban on fish imported from Kenya, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Uganda. Frozen and processed fish products from these
countries will, however, be subjected to a microbiological examination
designed to detect the presence of salmonellae. The ban was initially
imposed in response to ongoing cholera outbreaks in East Africa.
