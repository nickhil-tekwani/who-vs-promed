State health officials now say there are 13 confirmed cases of blastomycosis connected to the Little Wolf River in Waupaca County.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services [DHS] issued a statement on Friday [14 Aug 2015], saying that another 13 cases are probable. Officials believe exposure happened starting with Memorial Day weekend [23-25 May 2015] and continued at least through July [2015]. DHS says they anticipate more cases to be confirmed.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], blastomycosis lives in soil and decaying organic matter, like leaves and wood. When the soil is disturbed, the fungal spores become airborne. Breathing in those spores can cause people to become ill.

Health officials say that if you're experiencing symptoms of blastomycosis and you visited the Little Wolf River during the estimated exposure time to contact your health provider. Symptoms include fever, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue, which may progress to weight loss, chest pain and a persistent cough.

DHS will be updating case numbers weekly on its website.

[ProMED-mail previously reported that 4 cases of blastomycosis had occurred among friends following their tubing in late June 2015 on the Little Wolf River in the US state of Wisconsin. (See ProMED-mail post Blastomycosis - USA: (WI) tubing, RFI 20150802.3553390). The above news report now says there are a total of 13 confirmed cases and 13 probable cases of blastomycosis linked to the Little Wolf River in Waupaca County, Wisconsin. Their exposure likely started on Memorial Day weekend (23-25 May 2015) and continued at least through July 2015. More confirmed cases are anticipated. However, we are not told whether these additional cases were linked to tubing on the Little Wolf River or to some other type of activity. More information would be appreciated in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

The Wisconsin Division of Public Health (DPH) reports that 90-100 cases of blastomycosis occur in the state annually. Although cases of blastomycosis have been reported from all areas in Wisconsin, there appears to be an increase in the number of reported cases occurring in the northern and central counties (https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p4/p42030.pdf). An outbreak, said to be the largest ever reported, occurred in Marathon County, Wisconsin during the 10-month period between September 2009 and June 2010, in which outdoor activities were not apparently a risk factor. This outbreak involved 55 people, 70 per cent of whom were hospitalized, 2 (5 per cent) died, and 20 (45 per cent) were Hmong people (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23735332). The reasons for the large number of Hmong affected were unclear but may have involved genetic predisposition. Marathon County is located in north-central Wisconsin, near Waupaca County, the location of the Little Wolf River, said to be the site of the current outbreak.

A map showing the location of the Little Wolf River tubing campground in Waupaca County, 6 miles west of the town of New London, can be found at https://goo.gl/bLtUWg. A map of Wisconsin showing the location of its counties can be found at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/wisconsin.shtml. The length of the tubing trip is either 1.5 or 4 miles down the not very rapid Little Wolf River (http://wolfrivertrips.com/river-trips/first-time-tubing-useful-info/).
