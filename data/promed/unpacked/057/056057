Ludhiana city is shocked by a startling revelation by the blood banks
of big hospitals. It has been found that hepatitis C is rapidly
spreading among the masses in the city. The most interesting part of
the story is that the people who donated blood on a voluntary basis to
various hospitals in the city were not aware of the fact that they
were suffering from hepatitis C. But when the blood was tested in the
laboratories, the hospital authorities were amazed. This startling
fact has also rung alarm bells in the corridors of the Punjab State
AIDS Control Society (PSACS).

The PSACS has advised all the blood banks in the city to spread
awareness among the masses about this disease [virus infection]. The
society has also ordered the blood banks to dispose of the infected
blood safely under the Biomedical Waste Management Act to prevent the
further spreading of infection.

The surprising part of the story is that the national average of
hepatitis C infected donated blood is only 0.44 percent, whereas it
ranges between 0.81 and 2.13 percent in case of Ludhiana.

[The USA CDC states that [edited]: "HCV is transmitted primarily
through large or repeated percutaneous (i.e., passage through the
skin) exposures to infectious blood, such as
- Injection drug use (currently the most common means of HCV
transmission in the United States)
- Receipt of donated blood, blood products, and organs (once a common
means of transmission but now rare in the United States since blood
screening became available in 1992)
- Needlestick injuries in health care settings
- Birth to an HCV-infected mother
HCV can also be spread infrequently through:
- Sex with an HCV-infected person (an inefficient means of
transmission)
- Sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, such as
razors or toothbrushes (also inefficient vectors of transmission)
- Other health care procedures that involve invasive procedures, such
as injections (usually recognized in the context of outbreaks)"
(http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/HCVfaq.htm#section2).

It is not clear which route (routes) of infection are most likely in
the affected population mentioned above.
