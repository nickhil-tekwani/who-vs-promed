Thousands of emus and chickens will be killed after an outbreak of bird flu in regional Victoria. Veterinarians from Agriculture Victoria are on the farm in Kerang, 3 hours north of Melbourne, to euthanise the emu chicks.

The dramatic move came after 200 birds came down with avian influenza earlier this week, spreading to the emu farm in Kerang and an egg farm in the Golden Plains Shire. The detection of bird flu at the 2 new farms takes the total number of affected farms to 6, since the 1st farm detection on 31 Jul 2020.

"The H7N7, H7N6, and H5N2 types of the virus are not a risk to the public as it rarely affects humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds. Properly cooked poultry products including chicken and eggs are safe to eat," Agriculture Victoria advised.

The emu farm is under quarantine. Victoria's chief veterinary officer Dr Graeme Cooke said Agriculture Victoria was acting swiftly to contain the outbreaks. "The Golden Plains egg farm has been placed under quarantine after being confirmed as having high pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza. It has about 37 000 birds on site within the existing Restricted Area." Agriculture Victoria has been undertaking regular surveillance at the property as part of its response. "Agriculture Victoria will undertake the appropriate actions to depopulate and decontaminate the site," Dr Cooke said.

The emu farm near Kerang reported sick birds to Agriculture Victoria and subsequent testing has confirmed low pathogenic H7N6 avian influenza. The farm, which has around 8000 emus, is under quarantine and authorities have agreed to send the remaining emu eggs to a different farm where they will stay under surveillance and hopefully be born influenza-free. There are hopes the emu eggs can be saved.

Agriculture Victoria said the 2 different outbreaks were not linked. "Thank you to the property owners who notified us quickly when they noticed sick birds," Dr Cooke said. "Avian influenza viruses occur naturally among wild birds and can be difficult to detect as they may not show signs but can cause infections in our domestic bird populations. These detections are a reminder for bird owners to be vigilant: follow restrictions and movement controls for Restricted and Control Areas, monitor your birds' health, and have in place best biosecurity practices at your property."

The 6 farms affected by the disease include 3 in Golden Plains Shire, all confirmed to have high pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza, and 3 with the low pathogenic strain, with 1 in Golden Plains Shire, 1 in Bairnsdale, and the emu farm in Kerang.

Bird flu is a highly contagious disease predominantly affecting chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, and ostriches. While wild birds can typically carry the virus without signs, the disease can occasionally spread to domesticated birds, causing significant death.

Agriculture Victoria is calling on locals around the Golden Plains Shire, Kerang, and Bairnsdale to report any sick birds.

[Victoria now has reported low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 in turkeys in East Gippsland and LPAI H7N6 in an emu farm in Kerang and an egg farm in Golden Plains Shire. High pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 has been diagnosed in 3 egg farms in Golden Plains Shire.

With both high and low pathogenic forms of avian influenza in the same state, biosecurity must be at the top of every operations activity. Biosecurity is not a catchphrase; it is a serious term used to mean "disinfect everything possibly having come into contact with infected material." This includes vehicles, vehicle tires, boots, coveralls, the outside of feed sacks, hands, etc.

Between 1976 and 1997, 7 outbreaks of HPAI occurred in Australia. HPAI viruses caused clinical disease in commercial poultry in Victoria in 1976 (H7N7), 1985 (H7N7), and 1992 (H7N3); in Queensland in 1994 (H7N3); and in New South Wales in 1997 (H7N4), 2012 (H7N7), and 2013 (H7N2). Each time, there was severe disease in affected chicken flocks. All had obvious or circumstantial evidence of contact with wild waterfowl or surface water contaminated by wild waterfowl, or with free-range farmed ducks. There is some evidence that, initially, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may have been involved in the outbreaks in 1976, 1992, and 1997 (Selleck, et al. 2003).
