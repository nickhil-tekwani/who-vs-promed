There is no mention whether it is _Salmonella_ Typhi or _S._ Paratyphi A in Fiji. This should be determined and reported as it has epidemiological and clinical significance. Current subunit vaccines to "typhoid" fever are inactive against paratyphoid A, which represents at least 50 percent of enteric fever in India, China, Nepal, and Indonesia. Bangkok hospitals used by tourists have seen several patients with enteric fever due to _S._ Paratyphi A who had a complete subunit vaccine series. This should be pointed out to travelers who must use special attention to food and water intake in such regions and not rely on vaccination efficacy alone.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Wilde for his comments.

The definitive diagnosis of typhoid fever depends on the isolation of _Salmonella_ Typhi from blood, stools, urine, or other bodily fluids.

Infection caused by Paratyphi A is on the rise in Asia among the indigenous population and among travelers returning from countries of endemicity (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/241.long) and can be quite similar to illness due to _S._ Typhi. Currently, 2 licensed vaccines against typhoid fever caused by Typhi (parenteral Vi polysaccharide and oral attenuated live Typhi strain Ty21a vaccines) are available. Because _Salmonella_ Typhi, but not Paratyphi A, express the Vi antigen, the Vi vaccine will not protect against these pathogens.

In a report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed to have distinct routes of transmission (1). Typhoid was associated with factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the house), whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the household, such as food from street vendors and flooding.
