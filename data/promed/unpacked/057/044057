According to the spreadsheet data I have been keeping, the most recent information available is current as of [20 Mar 2018]:

There have been a total of:
1814 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
734 reported fatalities [reported case fatality rate of 40.5 per cent]
1061 recoveries, and
18 currently active cases [those who have not been reflected in reports of fatalities or recoveries]

Since the last update (through 13 Mar 2018) there have been:
3 newly confirmed cases
1 newly reported death
1 newly reported recovery
[the newly reported fatality is extrapolated from MOH figures but no information on the fatality was available. - Mod.MP]

Information on newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections (3 cases):
- none of the 3 were healthcare workers

1 - reported on 20 Mar 2018: a 67 year old expat female from Jeddah [Makkah region] noted to be in a stable condition. Classified as a secondary case in a household contact.
https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-03-20-001.aspx

2 - reported on 20 Mar 2018: a 62 year old Saudi female from Madina [Al Madinah region] noted to be in a stable condition. Classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.
https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-03-20-001.aspx

3 - reported on 19 Mar 2018: a 43 year old Saudi male from Riyadh [Riyadh region] noted to be in a critical condition. Classified as a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.
https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-03-19-001.aspx

Information on newly reported recovery:
- reported on 20 Mar 2018: a 74 year old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Rafhaa [Al Ḥudūd ash Shamāliyah region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 17 Feb 2018 at which time she was noted to be in a stable condition. - Mod.MPP]. Classified as a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

[Cases continue to be report in Saudi Arabia with 3 newly confirmed cases in the past week. These cases come from 3 different regions, and 3 different modes of transmission were mentioned. One was a household contact of a previously confirmed case, one had a history of direct contact with camels, and one was classified as a primary case but full high risk exposure history is still under investigation. It has been 14 days since the last report of nosocomial transmission in Riyadh (7 Mar 2018), so hopefully this indicates interruption of the transmission cycle there.

Maps showing the locations of the 3 newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL. The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5702309,131. - Mod.MPP]
