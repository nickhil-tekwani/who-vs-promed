CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg infections. Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that perform molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

Since 4 Jun 2012, a total of 124 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._Heidelberg have been reported from 12 states. Most of the ill persons have been reported from 2 states, Washington (56) and Oregon (38). At this time, CDC is not releasing the names of the other states until it is determined how these illnesses are linked to this outbreak.

Among 124 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 4 Jun 2012, to 6 Jan 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 94 years, with a median age of 23 years. 55 percent of ill persons are female. Among 97 persons with available information, 31 (32 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Ill persons continue to be reported at lower levels in the most recent months, which may represent a "winter lull" in salmonella infections.

Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that consumption of chicken is the most likely source of this outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg infections. Washington and Oregon have identified Foster Farms brand chicken as the most likely source of the infections in their states. Approximately 81 percent of ill persons interviewed report consuming chicken in the week before becoming ill. Investigations are ongoing to determine the specific type and source of chicken that might be linked with illness.

FSIS is currently conducting an investigation to determine the source of infections in this outbreak. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FSIS is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation.
