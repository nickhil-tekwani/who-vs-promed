[1] WHO: Denmark's COVID-19 in mink, epidemiology, public health, risk assessment
Source: WHO - Emergencies preparedness, response: SARS-CoV-2 mink-associated variant strain - Denmark [edited]

Since June 2020, Danish authorities have reported an extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, on mink farms in Denmark. On 5 Nov [2020], the Danish public health authorities reported the detection of a mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a combination of mutations not previously observed (referred to as "Cluster 5") in 12 human cases in North Jutland, detected from August to September 2020.

To date, Statens Serum Institut (SSI) in Denmark has identified 7 unique mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 among variants co-circulating in mink and humans. SSI cultured the "Cluster 5" variant with 4 amino acid changes in the spike protein, which was identified in mink and isolated from the 12 human cases reported in North Jutland. Preliminary findings suggested that there was a lower capability of antibodies to neutralize the Cluster 5 strain, which requires further investigation.

Following public health measures implemented by Danish authorities, the incidence of COVID-19 in North Jutland decreased from 100 per 100 000 population in the week beginning 16 Nov [2020] (week 47) to 60 per 100 000 population in the week beginning 2 Nov [2020] (week 45). Over the past weeks, Danish authorities have conducted mass testing of 111 447 individuals in North Jutland using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and are planning to conduct genetic sequencing for all positive samples.

In November 2020, 349 cases were reported among people associated with mink farming, an increase from 200 cases in October 2020. Since June 2020, a total of 644 people associated with mink farming have tested positive. Furthermore, there have been at least 338 cases reported among people working with mink pelting, in 6 factories and 2 small facilities, which suggests that there is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in people who are involved in farming, culling, and pelting of mink. As of 1 Dec 2020, a total of 289 mink farms have been affected, which accounts for approximately 20% of all mink farms in Denmark. [Table and map at https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Dyr/Dyr-og-Covid-19/Mink-og-COVID-19/Sider/Kort-over-kommuner-med-smittede-minkfarme.aspx].

From the week beginning 6 Jun 2020 (week 24) to the week beginning 16 Nov 2020 (week 47), 10 386 COVID-19-positive samples from unique individuals underwent whole-genome sequencing, which accounted for 17.6% of all positive samples in the corresponding time period. Of these sequenced samples, 750 were virus variants associated with infected mink. In addition, at least 2 new SARS-CoV-2 variants were recently detected in Southern Denmark that were not genetically related to the original Danish mink-associated variant strain.

In North Denmark, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 mink-associated variant strains among all sequenced samples decreased from 60% and 51% in weeks 41 and 42, respectively, to 26% and 31% in weeks 46 and 47, respectively; in Central Denmark, the proportion increased from about 3% in weeks 41 and 42 to over 30% in weeks 46 and 47; in South Denmark, the proportion increased from 0% in weeks 41 and 42 to 11% and 21% in weeks 46 and 47, respectively, while noting that there are differences in sequencing frequency and practices among various regions. In areas with no affected mink farms, human cases infected with the mink-associated variant have occurred sporadically. As of 20 Nov 2020, no new human cases of the Cluster 5 strain have been detected by genetic sequencing, and authorities assessed that the Cluster 5 variant is no longer circulating in humans.

Mink have previously been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, including in 2 outbreaks on large mink farms in the Netherlands in April 2020 [for the actual number of outbreaks in the Netherlands see item 2]. Additionally, the Netherlands have reported human infections with mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 strains that were not Cluster 5 strains. To date, 8 countries, namely Denmark, Lithuania, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Italy, Greece, and the United States of America, have reported COVID-19 in farmed mink to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

Public health response
----------------------
On 4 Nov 2020, Denmark decided to cull all farmed mink in Denmark. This decision was made following information that it had not been possible to prevent the spread of infection from farm to farm, or from animals to humans, and mink are acting as a reservoir and contributing to the ongoing transmission in Denmark [comment 1]. On 5 Nov 2020, movement restrictions were introduced in the affected areas in North Jutland. On 6 Nov 2020, Denmark shared the full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from humans to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) platform, and 133 sequences from mink on 18 Nov 2020. On 19 Nov 2020, restrictions were lifted in North Jutland due to decreased incidence and the absence of new cases of the Cluster 5 variant identified in the affected areas.

By 25 Nov 2020, mink on all 289 affected mink farms, and farms within an assigned zone, were culled. Additionally, mink farming has been banned in Denmark until 31 Dec 2021, including import and export of live mink. Economic support packages have been established for those affected.

Danish authorities have continued to work with the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group and have agreed to share the Cluster 5 variant SARS-CoV-2 with the COVID-19 Reference Laboratory Network for further studies and testing.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
It is expected that all viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time. SARS-CoV-2 strains that are infecting mink and subsequently transmitted back to humans, may have acquired unique mutations to adapt to the mink host. Advanced laboratory studies are required to fully understand the impact of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 on viral properties such as transmissibility, clinical presentation, and effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. These studies are long and complex and are done in close collaboration with various research groups.

While public health and social measures implemented by Denmark have led to positive developments, recent findings of other mink-associated variants among human cases in mid-Jutland and the detection of some 200 human cases among workers are of concern.

WHO advice
----------
This event highlights the important role that farmed mink populations can play in the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the critical importance of robust surveillance, sampling, and sequencing of these viruses by employing a One Health approach, especially around areas where such animal reservoirs are identified. The global relevance of the preliminary findings by Denmark is potentially significant, and WHO recognizes the importance of prompt sharing of epidemiological, virological, and full genome sequence information with other countries and research teams, including through open-source platforms such as GISAID.

WHO advises the following measures:

1. Conduct further virological studies to understand the specific mutations described by Denmark and to investigate any changes in transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus;
2. Countries, particularly those with mink and other fur farming, to increase the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from human and animal samples where possible and share sequence data, including if the same mutations are found [see comment 2];
3. Countries to increase surveillance for COVID-19 at the animal-human interface where susceptible animal reservoirs are identified, including on mink and other fur farms;
4. Countries to strengthen farming biosafety and biosecurity measures around known animal reservoirs, particularly on mink farms, to limit the risk of zoonotic events associated with SARS-CoV-2. This includes infection prevention and control measures for animal workers, farm visitors, and those involved in animal husbandry or culling;
5. Remind communities and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections by:
a. Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
b. Washing hands frequently, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
c. Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals;
d. Practicing cough etiquette, such as maintaining distance, covering coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and washing hands, if experiencing symptoms of acute respiratory infection;
e. Enhancing standard infection prevention and control practices in health-care facilities, especially in emergency departments of hospitals.

WHO recommends the health measures listed above for all travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry.

WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions for Denmark based on information currently available in relation to this event.

[1. Following the announcement by the Danish prime minister of the total banning of mink farming nationally (20201105.7918210, 20201106.7922587, 20201109.7929573), the media published conflicting information about the timetable, even questioning its very application. Formal updated information about the said will be useful. Denmark's last update on COVID-19 in minks, notifying the general culling decision, was submitted to the OIE on 5 Nov 2020 (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Update_6_Letter_to_the_OIE_on_Sars-CoV-2_in_Denmark_5_november2020.pdf).

2. To follow and fulfill WHO's advice (measures 2, 3, and 4, above) pertaining to "surveillance for COVID-19 at the animal-human interface where susceptible animal reservoirs are identified, including on mink and other fur farms," as well as "sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from animal samples" and "strengthen[ing] farming biosafety and biosecurity measures around known animal reservoirs, particularly on mink farms," enhanced efforts are required. The establishment, preferably by an international animal health institution, of an updated list of mink-farming countries, including information on their respective COVID-19 surveillance activities, is essential for such objectives. The absence of data from leading mink-farming countries such as China and Poland is of particular concern. - Mod.AS]

[2] Netherlands: approaching the termination of mink farming
Date: Mon 30 Nov 2020

Mink is currently present at only 4 farms. Agriculture minister Carola Schouten announced this to the House of Representatives on Monday [30 Nov 2020] evening during the debate about the early termination of fur farming.

It is expected that all animals, including the dams, will be culled in the course of next week. At that time there are no longer any minks present in the Dutch mink-farming sector. Minister Schouten said she was grateful that the mink farmers are cooperating in this and that all animals are pelted [comment].

Due to the corona outbreak, the minister wants the ban on fur farming to take effect 3 years earlier [than initially planned]. Originally, the ban was due to take effect on 1 Jan 2024. The minister wants to prevent mink farms from serving as a reservoir for the coronavirus and thus posing a risk to public health.

70 companies/farms were cleared at an earlier stage because the coronavirus was found on those companies [see footnote]. Mink farmers are entitled to compensation from the government because of the mandatory stopping earlier than planned.

It is possible that mink farmers will receive an advance on the compensation after the entry into force of the law.

[The birth period of minks in Europe normally takes place late April to mid-May. The kits are weaned when 8 weeks old. By the end of August, the physical development of the mink is more or less complete; continued weight gain consists primarily of fat. The selection of animals for the following year's breeding stock begins at the end of October. This is when the animals' size, behaviour, health, and pelt quality are evaluated. Animals not selected for breeding are pelted. The pelting season begins in November/December. During the pelting process, the skin is prepared in such a way that it can keep for up to a year without being dressed. The skins are placed on drying boards in order for them to maintain their shape during the drying process. The said timetable is presented as background to Minister Schouten's remark about the early completion of the current year's pelting.

Footnote:
An earlier posting, published 27 Nov 2020 (20201125.7972425), included item "[1] Netherlands: 70th outbreak, Gelderland." This was subject to a note from the Dutch Veterinary Services, which said: "There was not a 70th outbreak in the Netherlands in mink. The positive PCR that was found in the EW samples was not followed by a confirmation in the official samples taken by the Competent Authority. The animals have been culled precautionary because of a severe suspicion in a new region in the country." We are grateful for the correction of the said media-derived information. - Mod.AS
