An 18-year-old given an electronic cigarette for his birthday is thought to be the 1st person in Belgium to die from vaping.

[RP], from Brussels, died less than a month after getting pneumonia, which doctors attributed to vaping. "He played rugby, so he was a strong boy," said his father [TP]. In one week, however, I saw him decay into a wreck. And after 26 days in a coma, we had to bury him."

Doctors said the death was most likely caused by his e-cigarette or its liquid filling, which a friend had given him as an 18th birthday gift.

"I hope the death of my son can help prevent other victims of the e-cigarette," [TP] said.

On [Mon 11 Nov 2019], it was reported [EF], a British 16-year-old, needed life support after developing a vaping-linked respiratory disease.

[To date], 39 deaths have been linked to vaping in the United States but British health regulators say it is far less dangerous than smoking.

[RP] was struggling with what appeared to be an innocent cough, which escalated to shortness of breath. In a matter of days, he was admitted to hospital with severe respiratory problems.

His levels of oxygen were so low he was put into a medical coma but after 26 days, with his lungs "petrified", the decision was made to turn off his ventilator on 6 Nov 2019.

"To find the cause of the pneumonia costing [RP] the life, the doctors examined all possible causes. The only hypothesis remaining is the e-cigarette or its filling," [TP] told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper.

[RP] used a legal liquid filling containing CBD [cannabidiol], the non-psychoactive part of cannabis.

"We suspect inhalation from the e-cigarette is responsible for the pulmonary affliction and the subsequent death of [RP]," Dr Luc-Marie Jacquet, of the Saint-Luc University Hospital in Brussels, said.

There are estimated to be about 300 000 users of e-cigarettes and about 2 million smokers in Belgium.

Europe does not appear to be experiencing an outbreak of the "vaping sickness" gripping the US.

It's not clear anyone would know if it was.

US President Donald Trump on [Wed 23 Oct 2019] moved to finalize a ban on flavored e-cigarettes in light of the country's outbreak of a vaping-related illness having made 450 people sick and resulted in at least 6 deaths. With the US Food and Drug Administration urging people to avoid buying unregulated vape products, other US experts say people should avoid all e-cigarettes until the cause is clear.

In European countries like the UK and France, which have voluntary reporting systems, there's not much evidence of this problem, and experts cite tighter e-cigarette regulations in Europe than the US. [Tighter controls, but with only voluntary reporting, the reporting may be very lax to almost non-existent. Fear or misunderstanding could also contribute to a lack of reporting. - Mod.TG]

"We have not seen anything like what we've seen in the US recently in Europe, to my knowledge as a scientist, and I'm pretty aware of the field," said Constantine Vardavas, the European Respiratory Society's scientific relations director with the EU.

But while several EU and national agencies said they are monitoring the US situation, they weren't always able to say who's keeping track on this side of the Atlantic. An EU-wide reporting system is still in the works, and a broad analysis of e-cigarette safety is only due in the fall of 2020. [The fall of 2020 is a long way off if deaths may be looming from the use or misuse of vaping. - Mod.TG]

Some EU experts say there's no reason to think this side of the Atlantic will be immune.

Though the cases are currently limited to the US, the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology said in a statement [Wed 23 Oct 2019] that "they are likely to arise in other countries, including Portugal," given the widespread availability of e-cigarettes. "The use of electronic cigarettes is dangerous and not recommended," the society said.

The lesser evil
---------------
This debate has extra resonance in the UK, where the government has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to wean people off tobacco.

There, officials say the worst thing people could do is go back to regular cigarettes out of fear vapes could land them in the hospital with a major lung malfunction.

"You're terrifying people who are benefiting from vaping by not smoking," said Clive Bates, a former chief of the UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and a strong defender of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool.

Bates argued authorities should be delivering more targeted warnings about unregulated products. Instead, he said the US medical establishment is creating one of the "darkest episodes in American public health ... They have lost all their moorings with evidence and good practice."

The UK has the world's 3rd-highest uptake of e-cigarettes, and government health officials promote vapes as a way to wean people off more harmful tobacco. Over the past year, according to the country's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), only 12 incidents of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes have been reported to the regulator's voluntary system.

Among those, 7 involved respiratory problems, and none of the cases were considered serious or required hospitalization. (Even in these cases, it's not known if the e-cigarette was the cause of the reported problems.)

But there are some major caveats leaving room for concern. The UK has seen at least one case having key similarities with the US "vaping sickness," which is essentially lipoid pneumonia -- the accumulation of fat particles in the lungs. Doctors suspected the patient's vaping liquid was to blame.

The case, discussed in the BMJ [https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2018-224350], does not appear to have been logged with the UK regulator. A separate system to report problems with illicit drugs is still in a pilot phase.

Meanwhile, the cases in the US increasingly appear to involve vape liquid containing THC [tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal psychoactive compound in cannabis], which is still illegal in the majority of EU countries (as well as most US states). This may mean reporting systems aren't taking all the products people actually use into account. The MHRA's system accounts only for nicotine-based vapes.

Martin Dockrell, head of tobacco control at Public Health England, was quick to offer reassurances about the safety of legal vapes. "What little we know of recent reports from the US is the devices used appear to be linked to 'home brews' of illicit drugs and not legitimate vaping products," he said. "Unlike the UK, which has strict regulation ... on e-cigarette safety, the US has no regulation."

Only in America?
----------------
US regulators inspect some vape manufacturing sites and bar some ingredients from e-cigarette liquids. But the oversight is considerably less comprehensive than the EU's Tobacco Products Directive, which restricts ingredients and limits the level of nicotine in products.

EU regulations also put the burden on manufacturers and importers to look out for health problems and address them.

Manufacturers have to notify in advance the contents of e-liquids -- meaning officials at least know which legal products contain oils that could collect in the lungs, making them easier to recall if necessary.

Yet when it comes to home brews, "that, of course, is difficult to regulate," said Vardavas.

Around the EU, poison control centers seem to be the most regular go-to outlet for documenting safety concerns. A 2017 analysis of 10 countries found kids ingesting the vape liquid is the most commonly reported problem.

In France, "investigations are underway" to determine whether there are any cases similar to the US, a spokesperson for the ministry of health said. So far, there've been no reports. Professional societies have been asked to trace cases, the spokesperson said in an email.

The EU is gearing up for a more coordinated approach. Vardavas is involved in an EU-funded project to help countries enforce the Tobacco Products Directive, and among their goals is to create a common reporting sheet for adverse events, he said.

The European Commission said it has asked a panel of outside scientific advisers to issue an opinion about the health risks of e-cigarettes to feed into a report due in May 2021 -- making that the earliest date at which data is likely to be available.

In announcing his plans [Wed 23 Oct 2019], Trump said, "We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected." "People are dying from vaping, so we're looking at it very closely," he said during an Oval Office appearance with senior US health officials.

Deborah Arnott, ASH's chief executive, noted 480 000 people die in the US each year from tobacco-related conditions.

While Public Health England wouldn't comment directly on US recommendations, John Newton, its director of health improvement, stressed: "There is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping."

[If the reporting system is voluntary, then who reports cases possibly linked to vaping? There is likely some commonality between the USA and the EU, and there are likely many differences as well. It seems that pooling of knowledge may be helpful. We certainly hope a solution to this situation in all countries is found quickly. - Mod.TG]
