More chickens culled
--------------------
Over 6000 chickens were culled yesterday [Mon, 26 Mar 2007], around
4000 at 3 poultry farms in Jamalpur and 2110 chickens at a farm in
Narayanganj, following confirmations and fears of bird flu infections
at those farms. Meanwhile, 400 chickens died at a farm in Gazipur due
to "unknown reasons". Free-ranged chickens in a 1km radius of those
farms will also be culled, livestock department sources said.
Earlier, around 40 000 chickens were culled at poultry farms in
Gazipur and Savar, Dhaka after bird flu was detected there.
The livestock sources said they could not cull any free-ranged
chickens near the Gazipur and Savar farms yesterday due to fund
shortages as they buy those chickens and kill them. "Today, we do
not have money to buy free-ranged chickens near the Gazipur farms.
Hopefully we will start again tomorrow," said a high-ranking official
working with the livestock department requesting
anonymity. Free-ranged chickens of different sizes, near the Gazipur
farm where bird flu was detected, were bought at Tk 80 [USD 1.18], Tk
60 [USD 0.88] and Tk 15 [USD 0.22] on Sunday and killed.
Sources working with the livestock department said a team comprising
high-ranking officials and experts from Dhaka drove to Sharishabari
upazila [Sub-District] in Jamalpur to conduct chicken culling. Fani
Bhusan Majumdar, deputy director of livestock department Dhaka
division led the team.
A correspondent from Jamalpur reports that a team from Dhaka reached
Sharishabari's bird flu infected farms -- Hasan Poultry Farm and Naz
Poultry Farm -- in Kuranipara. Under the supervision of the team of
experts from Dhaka, local officials and farm owners packed jute sacks
with chicken and buried those in a large ditch at Kuranipara.
The correspondent also said the chickens of those farms became sick
around a month and a half ago. Since then no less than 5000 chickens
have died, the report quoting local sources said. There are about
112 farms with layer chickens in Sharishabari upazila.
Our Narayanganj correspondent reports that the government issued
instructions to kill all chickens at the Sonakanda Poultry Farm
yesterday, although the authorities did not mention anything about
bird flu in Narayanganj. Recently, more than 5000 chickens died at
the farm within a very short period of time.
The farm sources said they collected 10 000 chicks from Phoenix
Poultry Farm in Savar and most of those have already died.
Emdadul Haq, upazila livestock officer, told The Daily Star yesterday
that they have received directions to kill 2110 chickens at the
Sonakanda Poultry Farm.
Around 400 chickens died at a poultry farm in Bhabanipur Bazar near
Jirani Bazar area in Gazipur, our Gazipur correspondent reports. The
chickens were instantly buried and samples were sent to Central
Disease Investigation Laboratory (CDIL), Phulbaria, Dhaka to find out
if they died of bird flu, Mirza Abdul Bari, upazila livestock officer
told The Daily Star.
Gazipur district livestock officials yesterday with the help of the
army surveyed 47 poultry farms in 5 upazilas of Gazipur. They checked
64 634 layer chickens and broiler chickens but did not find any new
cases of avian influenza infection.
The deputy commissioner of Sylhet district held a meeting there and
formed a District Task Force Committee to keep watch over poultry
farms in the district, our Sylhet correspondent reports. The meeting
also decided not to allow any [trade] in poultry products unless the
task force approved it.

The above newswire, from a national Bangladeshi newspaper, adds some
local tint to the previous media reports addressing the avian
influenza situation and the attempted control activities. According
to this source, the disease in poultry had already started at the
beginning of February 2007. Official notification, including the
recorded timeline and laboratory test results, is anticipated.
ProMED-mail's published on 17 Feb 2007 a request for information,
following media reports on undiagnosed human illness in northern
Bangladesh (see reference below). So far, no further information on
the said cases has been received. - Mod.AS]
