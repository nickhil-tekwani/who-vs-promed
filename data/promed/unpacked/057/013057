Detection of Asian soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) in yam bean
crops in Papantla, Veracruz, Mexico
-----------------------------------
In the middle of January 2007, the Plant Health General Directorate
received samples of yam bean (_Pachyrhizus erosus_) crop foliage
from the communities of Agua Dulce and Pajapan, in Papantla township,
in the state of Veracruz. These samples showed signs and symptoms of
Asian soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_).
The samples were analysed and processed by technical personnel of the
National Center for Phytosanitary Reference Mycology Laboratory, to
determine the pathogen. To this end, it was necessary to analyse the
morphology of its reproductive structure, as well as to conduct a
molecular analysis. The results of these analyses confirmed the
presence of the disease called Asian soybean rust.
Through the Plant Health Committee of Veracruz, the SENASICA
[Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria]
did a follow-up of the detected outbreak, taking immediate actions to
prevent the spread of the disease to other hosts by applying triazole
and strobiruline fungicides. Furthermore, given the importance of the
disease, yam bean growers carried out a phytosanitary survey as a
culture measure in the areas where the disease was more advanced, to
minimize the inoculation source for the next cycles of the crops.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902
as the cause of soybean rust. It can cause premature defoliation,
with yield losses of up to 70 percent reported in farms in Asia. It
is widespread in Asia and Africa, but data are lacking concerning its
establishment in Europe. The 1st detection of _P. pachyrhizi_ in the
New World was in Paraguay in 2001, and it was introduced into the USA
in 2004. The 1st detection in Mexico occurred in 2005, on soybean
(_Glycine max_) in Tamuin, State of San Luis Potosi, and in Altamira,
State of Tamaulipas.
New strains of _P. pachyrhizi_ with increased virulence are emerging
and weed species can serve as pathogen reservoirs. A less-virulent
related species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in South America and also
causes rust symptoms.
Yam bean (also called Jicama, Mexican potato) is a leguminous vine
native to the tropical Americas that can reach a length of several
meters. Roots can weigh up to 20 kg (44 lb) and are usually eaten
raw. Seeds are eaten cooked.
