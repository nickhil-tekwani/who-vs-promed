RIFT VALLEY FEVER, HUMAN, BOVINE - COMOROS (02)

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Renaud Lancelot for provision of
background information relating to our RFI (Request for Information)
concerning the background to the human case of Rift Valley fever
(RVF) on the Comoros. - Mod.CP]


So far, we did not receive any sample from the Comoros archipelago
for RVF tests at CIRAD.

Comoros livestock traders import live cattle from Kenya and Tanzania
(and Madagascar) to overcome local meat needs. This may have caused
animal-health problems in the past: see "An outbreak of East Coast
fever on the Comoros: a consequence of the import of immunised cattle
from Tanzania?" By R. De Deken et al., Veterinary Parasitology, 1443,
245-253, 2007. Most cattle importation is made in Ngazidja, the
largest island of the archipelago. Because of these importations and
the RVF epidemics that occurred in Kenya/Tanzania in 2006/2007,
Ngazidja was at risk of RVF during this period. This is now the rainy
season in Comoros. If the RVF virus is there, rainfall might trigger
mosquito proliferation, and an RVF epidemic could occur. I am also
worried about the situation in Madagascar, which experienced at least
2 RVF epidemics in 1990 and 1991 (J. Morvan et al., Res Virol, 142,
475-482, 1991; J. Morvan et al., Res Virol, 143, 407-415, 1992).
However, the Pasteur Institute in Tananarive is well equipped for the
diagnosis of RVF and other arboviruses.

[Unfortunately, this has become one more lamentable situation when
humans play the role of RVF sentinels for animals. - Mod.AS]
