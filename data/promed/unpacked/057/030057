Satellite tracking suggests wild birds may spread H5N1 in Asia
--------------------------------------------------------------
Satellite tracking of wild birds in Asia suggests they may be spreading
H5N1 avian influenza from India or Tibet to Mongolia when they fly north in
the spring, according to a recent report from the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The 16 Nov 2010 issue of FAO AIDE News, the agency's avian flu newsletter,
says this conclusion comes from the tracking of waterfowl that frequent
China's Qinghai Lake, where more than 6000 wild birds died of H5N1 in 2005.
Since that outbreak, researchers with the FAO and the US Geological Survey
have mounted GPS transmitters on 525 waterfowl in 11 countries to track
their migrations, the FAO said. About half of the birds that died in the
Qinghai Lake outbreak were bar-headed geese.

The FAO said the satellite tracking has shown that most of the bar-headed
geese tagged at Qinghai Lake spend their winters in the Lhasa region of
Tibet or in India. There, wild birds are exposed to domestic poultry, and
since those areas have had H5N1 outbreaks, the virus may spread between
domestic and wild birds, according to the FAO.

"If this is so, wild waterfowl on the eastern portion of the Central Asian
Flyway may in fact be helping spread H5N1 HPAI [highly pathogenic avian
influenza] into Mongolia each spring as they across the Qinghai-Tibetan
plateau to the north and east," the article says. "Most interesting is that
this repeatable pattern of wild bird outbreaks at the northern end of their
migration pathway each spring does not appear to be occurring in other
major flyways, thus demonstrating the complexity surrounding the role of
wild birds in the disease epidemiology," it adds.

A chart in the FAO newsletter shows that Mongolia reported its 1st H5N1
outbreak in August 2005 and its latest one in May of this year (2010).
Reports from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) say that
Mongolia also reported H5N1 outbreaks in 2009 and 2006. All outbreaks
reported there have been in wild birds.

An FAO fact sheet on wildlife and H5N1 says that in 2009 large numbers of
birds died at Qinghai Lake after the spring migration northward from India
and Bangladesh and that more wild birds died weeks later at the northern
end of the flyway in Mongolia and Russia, which "strongly supports the
spread of the virus from infected wild birds." However, the fact sheet says
the overall global pattern of avian flu spread since 2005 "suggests that
wild birds are not the primary spreader of H5N1 HPAI but that human
movement of virus through trade, marketing, and fomites likely accounts for
the significant spread of the virus."

In other information, the FAO newsletter says that Egypt had 26 outbreaks
of H5N1 in October 2010, prompting the culling of 1433 birds. The outbreaks
were scattered among 12 governorates, and all involved household poultry
flocks. Only one household had any history of vaccinating its birds.

In Indonesia, an avian flu surveillance program that covers 71 249 villages
reported an H5N1 incidence of 0.7 villages per 1000 villages under
surveillance in September 2010, according to the FAO publication. The
finding was based on surveillance in 1386 villages, or 1.9 percent of those
involved in the program.

In related developments, the FAO said scientists from more than 30
countries met last week in Rome to discuss strategies for tracking and
controlling animal influenza viruses. In a 19 Nov 2010 statement, the FAO
said the meeting drew experts on equine, swine, avian, and human flu,
including representatives from the OIE, World Health Organization, and the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "The meeting focused on
identifying priorities for research and further actions to improve and
coordinate global surveillance and control," the FAO said.

The meeting produced several results, including an agreement by animal
health and public health experts to "collaborate on a landmark initiative
to look at ways of predicting emerging threats by examining genetic
sequences of viruses collected through global animal influenza
surveillance," the statement said. "Gaps in surveillance mean that
questions about the exact origins of H1N1 remain unanswered."

Without giving any details, the FAO said the meeting produced several other
results, including an OFFLU (OIE-FAO network of expertise on animal flu)
research agenda for swine, poultry, and wild birds; a mechanism for global
coordination of swine flu surveillance; a network for laboratory
proficiency testing; and an expert group to monitor virus mutations.

[A preliminary report on the bar-goose tracking and related H1N5 flu
outbreaks was reported in 20101118.4180. The inconsistency of this apparent
lateral transmission elsewhere means that the mechanism for it at Qinghai
lake needs clarification, which might then point up other places where the
necessary factors may be in place, and thus the need for targeted
surveillance at those places. - Mod.MHJ
