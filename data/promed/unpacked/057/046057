TICK-BORNE ORGANISMS, BLOOD SUPPLY - USA
****************************************
Date: Thu, 3 Jul 1997 17:28:03 -0400
From: George Robertson <grobertson@mail.ncifcrf.gov>
The Food and Drug Administration is advising the public of a voluntary recall
of certain blood products collected by United Blood Services (UBS), also
known as Blood Systems Inc. (BSI) at the Fort Chafee, Arkansas military base.
The products are being recalled as a precautionary measure because donors of
the products may have been exposed to a tick-borne disease which
theoretically may be transmitted through blood transfusions.
Persons exposed to ticks at Fort Chafee between April and September are
advised against donating blood or plasma for four weeks after leaving that
area.
Some of the donors became ill 1-3 days after donating blood. The exposed
persons may have one of a number of infectious diseases caused by ticks
including ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and possible borrelial
infection.
All of these infections cause fever, as well as headache and muscle pain
and in some cases, a rash. The majority of infections are asymptomatic or
mild, but a small percentage can be serious and even fatal. Doxycycline or
other antibiotics can be used effectively to treat the infection if treatment
is started as soon as possible.
The blood products involved in the recall were collected during three
separate blood drives this summer: May 29, June 11, and June 25. Some of the
products that may have been distributed before the problem was identified
include red blood cells, platelets and recovered plasma. The following
states may have received the recalled blood products: Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas. Approximately 700 blood
components may have been distributed before this recall was initiated. The
recall involves products collected since April 1997 when the tick season
started.
Hospitals should immediately remove these recalled products from
inventory and return them to their local UBS blood center. Physicians of
patients who received any of the recalled products should be notified. A
"Dear Doctor" letter is available from UBS to help advise physicians regarding
patient treatment. Recipients of the recalled blood products should be
notified and told to report any illnesses to their physicians.
Health professionals should report any adverse events associated with these
products to MedWatch, FDA's adverse reporting program, at 1-800-FDA-1088
and to the company. In addition, questions regarding diagnosis or treatment
can also be directed to state health departments or the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [TEL: (404) 639-1075].

[The indicator cases were reservists who return to Iowa and became sick
there; tick-borne diseases are rare in Iowa. A likely etiologic agent of
infection is _Ehrlichia chafeensis_, although we await definitive laboratory
diagnosis. Ehrlichia are coccoid, ellipsoidal, or pleomorphic organisms that
develop within membrane-bound vaculous. As they multiple within these
vacuoles, they form characteristic grapelike clusters, or morulae. Ehrlichia
primarily infect circulating lymphocytes but some species, including _E.
chefeensis_ primarily infect monocytes. _E. chafeensis_ is the etiologic
agent of human ehrlichiosis and _E. risticii_ is the etiologic agent of
monocytic equine erlichiosis. _Amblyomma americanum_ ticks are the likely
vector for _E. chafeensis_. The first identified case of human ehrlichiosis
occurred in Arkansas in 1986 (Walker DH and Fishbein DB. 1991. Epidemiology
of rickettsial diseases: 4th international symposium on rickettsiae and
rickettsial diseases. Eur. J. Epi. 7:237-245.). We wish the recallers of the
blood units the best of luck in their efforts. -- Mod CHC]
