BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan: A woman from rural Kyrgyzstan has been diagnosed with
anthrax and nearly 300 people have been exposed to the infectious disease,
officials said Thursday. S.K., 51 years old, was hospitalized with anthrax
on 23 May 2001 and 3 others have been hospitalized with symptoms resembling
the disease, said Viktor Shevchenko, the Health Ministry's chief infectious
disease specialist. Shevchenko said the patient became ill after a sick
horse was put to death in her village and the meat was distributed among 28
families. In total, 298 people had contact with the infected meat, he said.

[Human anthrax cases following exposure to home-killed meat from sick
animals not inspected by a veterinarian seems to be the rule now in Central
Asia and parts of Russia. Of course, while noteworthy in the newspapers,
such reports ignore the large numbers of livestock cases not related to
human cases. It is the control of the former that prevents the latter. -
