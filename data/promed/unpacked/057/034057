An emergency team has started a campaign to kill fleas and rats in a bid to
control the outbreak of the infectious pneumonic plague that has hit
Masindi district, killing 10 people.

The group is made up of officials from the health ministry, the Uganda
Virus Research Institute, the Centres for Disease Control (USA), the World
Health Organization, district health officials, and the epidemic control
task force.

The commissioner of health services, Dr Sam Okware, said they were
destroying the rats that carry the fleas, through spraying. He revealed
that the disease had been confirmed as pneumonic plague after tests in
laboratories in Kenya and Egypt. "We are sensitising the communities that
this disease is related to poor hygiene. We are teaching them to keep their
environment clean."

Okware pointed out that West Nile and Masindi were the focal areas but
added that the possible source of plague was the DR Congo. He also stressed
that they had enough drugs to deal with the situation. "In fact we don't
expect more than a few hundred cases. We reacted fast enough to the
disease," Okware noted.

The Masindi district director of health services, Dr John Turyagaruka, said
no new cases had been reported while those admitted were improving.
However, he complained that there was a shortage of gloves, masks, and
boots needed for the exercise.

[Plague is endemic in Uganda and annual outbreaks have been reported over
the past several years (see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below).

Masindi is located in the north west of Uganda near Lake Albert. (Lake
Albert is situated on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC)). The prior outbreaks of plague in Uganda reported on
ProMED-mail were also located in the north west of the country near the
border with the DRC (see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_pol_2005.jpg> and
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/uganda.pdf> for maps of
Uganda).

As both the DRC and Uganda are endemic for plague, in the absence of
information on the index case in the outbreak, it is hard to point a
definite finger as to whether the outbreak began in Uganda or was imported
from the DRC.

For background information on plague, see the WHO fact sheet at:
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/> (excerpted below).

"Plague is a zoonotic disease circulating mainly among small animals and
their fleas. The bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ can also infect humans. It is
transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas,
direct contact, inhalation, and rarely, ingestion of infective materials.
Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio
of 30-60 per cent if left untreated.

"Infected persons usually start with "flu-like" symptoms after an
incubation period of 3-7 days. Patients typically experience the sudden
onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches, and weakness, vomiting and
nausea. Clinical plague infection manifests itself in 3 forms depending on
the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.

"* Bubonic form is the most common form of plague resulting from the bite
of an infective flea. Plague bacillus enters the skin from the site of the
bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node.
The lymph node then becomes inflamed because the plague bacteria, _Y.
pestis_, will replicate here in high numbers. The swollen lymph node is
called a "bubo" which is very painful and can become suppurated as an open
sore in advanced stage of infection;

"* Septicaemic form of plague occurs when infection spreads directly
through the bloodstream without evidence of a "bubo". More commonly
advanced stages of bubonic plague will result in the presence of _Y.
pestis_ in the blood. Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and
from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin.

"* Pneumonic form of plague is the most virulent and least common form of
plague. Typically, pneumonic form is due to a secondary spread from
advanced infection of an initial bubonic form. Primary pneumonic plague
results from inhalation of aerosolized infective droplets and can be
transmitted from human to human without involvement of fleas or animals.
Untreated pneumonic plague has a very high case fatality ratio."

Plague is endemic in many countries in Africa, in the former Soviet Union,
the Americas, and Asia. In 2003, 9 countries reported 2118 cases and 182
deaths. Of [the total number of] cases and deaths, 98.7 per cent and 98.9
per cent, respectively, were reported from Africa. Today the distribution
of plague coincides with the geographical distribution of its natural foci.
