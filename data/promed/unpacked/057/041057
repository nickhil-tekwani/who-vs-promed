Health Minister K. Rosaiah has confirmed the incidence of chikungunya
in Anantapur, Kurnool, Kadapa, Chittoor, Nalgonda, Prakasam and
Guntur districts and Hyderabad city.
He told a press conference on Tuesday that out of the blood samples
collected in these areas recently by experts of the National
Institute of Virology, Pune, 139 tested positive for chikungunya, 6
for dengue and 15 for both.
The Minister said the incidence of chikungunya was last reported at
Madras in 1965.
The mysterious fever with joint pains found its way into the State in
December 2005.
Though fever subsides after treatment, joint pains continue. Any
sufferer of these symptoms must approach the nearest primary health
centre for treatment. The Minister said that 25 754 cases of
chikungunya were reported from the affected districts as of yesterday
but confirmed only 2 of the 3 deaths reported, both from Kadiri in
Anantapur district -- Annapurnamma and Yezdhani. One resident of
Tirupati, however, died due to renal failure.
Chikungunya virus is transmitted by the _Aedes egypti_ mosquito which
breeds in artificial accumulations of water in and around dwellings
-- in discarded tins, broken bottles, flower-pots, coconut shells,
earthen pots, tree holes, air-coolers and overhead tanks.
The mosquito, whose lifespan is 8 to 34 days, flies [in a range of
barely] 100 metres. It is a day biter, the Minister said. Mr Rosaiah
said preventive and curative steps had been taken up in a big way.
"There is no dearth of funds, drugs or the will to work."
