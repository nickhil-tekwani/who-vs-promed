In response to the outbreak of pertussis in Australia (Pertussis -
Australia: (SA) 20091107.3842), the moderator discusses the duration of
vaccine-induced immunity. Whenever outbreaks of pertussis occur, this
subject is rightfully brought up, but whether limited public resources
should be used for more and more boosters is another matter. Perhaps we
need better vaccines.

Surprisingly, the pathogen is generally left out of the picture. There are
now many studies which show that outbreaks of pertussis are often
associated with changes in the _B. pertussis_ population. Most recently, we
have shown that more virulent (P3) strains have appeared which we believe
to be (partly) responsible for the outbreak in the Netherlands. The P3
strains have emerged worldwide. Any discussion on the causes of sudden
upsurges in infectious diseases should include changes in the pathogen
population. This is even true for pertussis.

[Indeed, it is important to keep the pathogen per se in perspective as
Professor Mooi suggests. This moderator thanks Professor Mooi for pointing
out this recent publication from his group in the Netherlands. - Mod.LL]
