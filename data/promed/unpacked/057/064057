A letter sent to a Kenyan citizen from Atlanta [USA which originally
tested positive for anthrax spores, has retested negative,
investigators said Tuesday. "It is believed that the tests were
conducted on a mildew or fungus," according to a joint news release
from the FBI and the US Department of Justice, explaining the
recipient told authorities "the letter arrived late and was damp."
