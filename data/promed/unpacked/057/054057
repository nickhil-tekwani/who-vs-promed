Chilean producers of avocado are on tenterhooks because of a disease called sunblotch. The cause of the turmoil lies within a document that the Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) has on public consultation related to the entry of Peruvian Hass avocado.

The problem, according to Chilean producers, is the terms for this massive opening because there is no mention of the disease in the health protocols, thus there would be no required health checks. The disease, that is not present in Chile, affects Peru.

Enrique Camet, President of the Association of Peruvian Producers and Agro-exporters' Guilds (AGAP), affirmed that while Peruvian Hass avocados contain the sunblotch "virus", it is also present in the United States, Mexico, Chile and other avocado producing countries.

"In my case, we imported Hass avocados from Chile in the year 2002/2003, from a very prestigious nursery in Chile, and 40 percent of them contained sunblotch, according to analyses conducted at Senasa [National Service for Health and Food Quality] and the International Potato Center (CIP)."

[Avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd; type member of genus _Avsunviroid_) affects avocado and a few other members of the family _Lauraceae_. It causes one of the major diseases of the crop, with serious reductions of yield (up to 95 percent losses), fruit quality, and tree vigour. Symptoms may include yellowish, depressed streaks on young growth twigs and on fruits, which can look like they are sunburnt ('sunblotch'), as well as, occasionally, vein yellowing on leaves and bark cracking. However, symptoms may not be visible in some trees, but these still show significant yield reduction and act as pathogen reservoirs.

ASBVd is transmitted with infected budwood or rootstocks for grafting, by cutting tools, pollen (via pollinating bees), and with seed. Asymptomatic trees have an extremely high rate of seed transmission of up to 100 percent, and the resultant infected seedlings are also asymptomatic. Disease management relies on the use of certified viroid free grafting material and seeds. Reliable diagnosis requires molecular techniques. Orchards should be tested every 3 years and pathogen reservoirs, with or without symptoms, must be removed.

In the argument above it is not really relevant whether ASBVd is present in both countries or not. Even for areas were the viroid is already present, introduction of new strains or spread to new areas within a country must be avoided. Since germinating seed of purchased avocado fruit is easy, for example for the home garden, and considering the extremely high rate of seed transmission of ASBVd, introduction of the viroid from an infected area by traded fruit would be almost a certainty over a period of time. To protect national avocado industries, regular molecular testing and certification of source orchards would be a minimum requirement to lower the risk of commercial trade of avocado fruit between countries.
