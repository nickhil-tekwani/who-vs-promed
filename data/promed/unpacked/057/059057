I feel it should be pointed out when you are giving background info on
ethylene glycol that it can and should only be purchased with a
bittering agent added. This is to prevent accidental poisoning of both
animals and humans.

The sooner we start demanding only ethylene glycol with a bittering
agent, the sooner that is all that will be produced and sold at
retail.

There are numerous state and local laws under consideration to require
a bittering agent be added to all ethylene glycol products sold at
retail as well.

[While putting a bittering agent, usually BitrexTM / Denatonium
Benzoate is usual in the USA, I am not certain that is the case in
other countries. However, the bittering agent does NOT prevent animals
from ingesting antifreeze. For one thing, we do not know how stable
the agent is after being run through a hot engine. Also many cooling
systems run with a 50 percent mixture of ethylene glycol and water. So
while the bittering agent seems to have some efficacy, it is by no
means foolproof. - Mod.TG
