A total of 33 spotted deer have died of rabies in the National Zoological Park here since January this year [2016], Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave said today.

Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Dave said, Central Zoo Authority has carried out an inspection of the zoo after these 33 deaths and recommended several measures such as installation of CCTVs in the feeding/retiring cell as well as the paddock area of the enclosure to identify the feral animal species responsible for the spread of disease.

It has also been suggested that all staff involved with upkeep and management of rabies be vaccinated, he said. "Zoological Information Management System should also be utilised as a tool to get the expert advice from zoos abroad on disease diagnosis and treatment of animals," Dave said.

The remaining 80 spotted deer are in healthy condition but have been vaccinated for rabies as a precautionary measure, he added.

[These episodes at Delhi zoo have been going on since February 2016. There have been suspicions that the source of this outbreak could be mongoose bites.

Mongooses are indigenous to Africa and Asia and have been introduced in many parts of the world (for a picture see http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-An9rL-UEn1Q/TxPlECH_SaI/AAAAAAAAAH0/J4yi1XhIX00/s1600/MONGOOSE.jpg). In Cuba, Puerto Rico, Grenada, and South Africa they are the major reservoir of rabies.

Other likely source could be stray dogs. In Delhi, mongoose rabies accounts for only 0.4 percent of the human cases of rabies, while dogs are responsible of 96.7 percent of them (Ref: Chhabra M, Ichhpujani RL, Tewari KN and Lal S: Human rabies in Delhi. Ind J Pediat. 2004; 71:217-220, abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080408). - Mod.PMB
