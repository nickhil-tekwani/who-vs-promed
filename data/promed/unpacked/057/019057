Cereal Rust Bulletin, Report No. 1
---------------------------------------
- Wheat leaf rust is present at low levels in fields and plots in the
southern U.S.
- Wheat stripe rust is present at low levels in fields and plots in the
southern U.S.
- Traces of oat stem rust were found in Louisiana plots.
- Oat crown rust is present at low levels in the southern U.S.
- Barley stripe rust was found in Arizona plots.
- Wheat stem rust has not yet [March 2006] been reported in the U.S. in 2006.
By early March [2006], cultivars growing in plots in southeast Louisiana
had up to 70 percent leaf rust severity. The high leaf rust infections
were observed on cultivars that were not vernalized properly and are not
commonly grown in Louisiana.
Stripe rust development in Texas is at a much lower level than last year
[2005] on the same date.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_). These are
wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P.
triticina_ aka _P. recondita f. sp. tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P.
striiformis f. sp. tritici_), all caused by species of the fungus Puccinia.
Severe losses that can occur due to wheat stem rust have been abated in the
USA since the 1960's by effective resistance breeding, though the knowledge
of resistance breaking strains of the pathogen, such as Ug99 in Uganda, is
a concern [note "see also"]. Severe losses are still a possibility with
leaf rust. As recently as 1993, leaf rust destroyed over 40 million
bushels of wheat in Kansas and Nebraska. In 1985, Texas and Oklahoma lost
95 million bushels of wheat to leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease
Laboratory St. Paul, MN publishes regular reports on cereal rusts in the
USA during the crop season. 10 were published between March and September
2005. Each report gives detailed state-by-state information, including a
summary map, all in pdf file format [see link to main article]. Wheat is
not doing well in early 2006 in southern states because of drought, e.g. in
Texas and Oklahoma. This condition is also not conducive for leaf rust,
which partly explains the low levels of incidence reported so far [March]
in 2006.
