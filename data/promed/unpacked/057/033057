----------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax was endemic only in the Chithoor district earlier. Now cases of anthrax are reported from all over the sheep-rearing areas of northern coastal Andhra Pradesh [AP], Godavari districts, and Krishna districts. The disease is peracute in sheep. Most of the sheep in coastal districts of AP are nomadic and this disease is suspected to be spreading to new areas. The peracute nature of disease in sheep, the nomadic nature of sheep rearing, and the tendency of the shepherds to leave the dead carcasses in the open, precipitate these outbreaks.

Human cases are due to the habit of eating dead animals, and [this risk is compounded when] preserving the meat for [later] human consumption by sun drying after salting. [This latter action] results in disease in humans [months] after the [initial livestock] disease outbreak has been controlled.


The Veterinary Biological Research Institute (VBRI) Hyderabad has the facilities to diagnose anthrax and it is not clear why samples [from this series of cases] were sent to the defence research laboratory. This clearly stresses the need for strong collaboration between the human and animal health divisions of the state.
