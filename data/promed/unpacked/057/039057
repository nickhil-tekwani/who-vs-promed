A total of 7 people in Capira [district, Panama province] are suspected of being infected with bovine brucellosis, a potentially deadly disease detected in cattle from 6 farms the area and in Darien.

The cases include 2 children, aged 2 and 6, and a 17 year old, and were detected after the Ministry of Health (MoH) took blood samples from 22 residents of the community of Monte Oscuro, in the village of Cermak, to see if they had the zoonotic disease (transmitted by animals to humans). Bredio Velazco, Veterinarian and Animal Health deputy director of the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA), confirmed to FOX Report that there are 6 affected animal farms, but denied that it was passed to humans.

The secretary general of the MoH, Felix Bonilla reported that they are awaiting for results of confirmatory tests from Gorgas Memorial Hospital reports La Prensa,

The 22 examined in October [2013] are working on the farms El Pensamiento and Los Mangos, located 30 minutes from downtown Capira. The [detection of bovine brucellosis] in Capira Resume took place in October 2013, when 72 cattle were slaughtered on 3 farms, 2 dairy and 1 meat, in Monte Oscuro, and the valley was quarantined. Despite the measure, which banned the movement of cattle, Velazco confirmed that 2 animals were infected with brucellosis in Darien, on a farm whose owner is the same as that of one in Capira, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of the quarantine. "129 animals were sacrificed," Velazco told local television.

The official did not seem concerned said La Prensa. "I foresaw more cases," he said. "We are mitigating the situation," he added. But for the Association of Dairy Producers (Aprogalpa), the cases are "worrying" because it is a highly contagious disease and especially as the origin of the outbreak is still unknown.

The last time Panama had bovine brucellosis was in 2004, and human cases in 2009, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The spread of brucellosis to humans is through consumption of unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat, or contact with secretions from infected animals. It produces abortions in animals and in humans, fever, weakness, and general pain. "It is an extremely infectious zoonosis" warns the OIE.

[The following moderator comments regarding _Brucella abortus_ in bovines are taken from ProMED-mail "Brucellosis, bison - Canada: (AB)," archive number 20110730.2294:

"Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time, in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time." - Mod.LL
