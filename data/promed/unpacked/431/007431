Health authorities in Cote d'Ivoire are investigating an acute illness in a
northern village that has claimed the lives of 31 people and sickened at
least 73 others.
People began to fall ill in the village of Diobala in the 3rd week of
December [2006], with symptoms including headache, high fever, neck and
chest pain, and respiratory problems, according to a report by the Ministry
of Health and Public Hygiene obtained by IRIN [UN Integrated Regional
Information Networks.] The illness progressed rapidly over the course of 3
to 5 days and the 1st death was reported on [18 Dec 2006], the report said.
Villagers delayed reporting the illnesses to health authorities until [5
Feb 2007]. By then, 31 people had died among the 104 who had fallen ill,
the report said. Victims in the village of 1500 included men and women,
young and old.
"Almost every family was touched" in the village, an official with the
Seguela health department told IRIN. Seguela, 44 km. [27 miles] away, is
the largest town near Diobala. Seguela is 450 km. [280 miles] north of the
main city, Abidjan.
Local health authorities reported the deaths to officials in Abidjan and
investigators went to Diobala [13-17 Feb 2007]. The team included
specialists from the Pasteur Institute and the Ministry of Health and
Public Hygiene.
They discovered that beginning in October [2006] animals in the village had
begun falling ill. The report said 90 per cent of the village's poultry, as
well as about 500 goats and sheep, had died. Villagers ate sick animals,
but it was not immediately clear if this was how humans contracted the
illness. Health authorities said patients treated with antibiotics
responded well.
"They did an investigation and took blood samples and nasal swabs of the
people, the poultry, the goats and the sheep," the Seguela health official
said. Water samples were also taken. "Surveillance is continuing to see if
other cases come up," he said.
The last cases of human illness were reported on [14 Feb 2007]. There have
been no reports of illness in neighbouring villages. People in the area
have been told to quickly report any illnesses to local health authorities.
Cote d'Ivoire has been divided between a rebel-held north and
government-run south since a brief civil war in 2002. As a result,
humanitarian agencies say health and sanitary conditions in the north have
deteriorated.

[Given the above description of a livestock die-off (including poultry,
sheep, and goats) preceding morbidity and mortality of the human
population, one automatically thinks of zoonotic diseases that might be
consistent with this picture. Adding to the picture is a reported case
fatality rate (CFR) of 30 per cent (31/104), with an estimated attack rate
of 7 per cent (104/1500) with all age groups affected. When one checks
GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network
<http://www.gideononline.net>) for the clinical picture associated with
contact with animals, one gets 3 main possibilities -- Q fever, ornithosis,
and bunyaviridae. Of the bunyaviridae family, one does think of Rift Valley
fever (RVF) as consistent with this clinical picture, but the involvement
of poultry rules this out, as the RVF virus does not affect avians. Gideon
also gives a "1st case scenario", where it "ignores" the geographic
location of the outbreak in the event that this is a new geographic
extension of an otherwise known pathogen. In this case, the GIDEON program
suggested Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).
The above report mentions individuals improving with antibiotics. This
suggests a clinical diagnosis of a bacterial disease, such as Q fever, but
the reported CFR in this outbreak is way above that seen with Q fever (Q
fever has a 1-2 per cent mortality associated with untreated cases).
If one decides that the animal outbreak information is a red herring, and
repeats the GIDEON search omitting an ongoing epizootic, the following
comes up as most likely candidates: Leptospirosis, Q fever, legionellosis,
Ebola, Lassa fever, ornithosis, and brucellosis to mention a few -- and
when one looks at the "1st case scenario" plague is on the list.
Anthrax is not on the list provided by GIDEON, but it too could possibly
meet the clinical definition, although one might expect to hear of more
gastrointestinal symptoms.
This moderator has now "mused out loud" probably more than would have been
prudent, so at this point appeals to sources knowledgeable on the findings
of the investigation to enlighten and educate us on what has been going on.
