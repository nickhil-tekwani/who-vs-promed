The Oklahoma State Department of Health announced today [29 Nov 2008]
that the Country Cottage restaurant in Locust Grove, Oklahoma has
undergone a rigorous inspection process and has been cleared to
resume normal business operations. The restaurant had been closed
since 25 Aug 2008 after being identified as the source of a large
foodborne outbreak in northeastern Oklahoma resulting in severe
diarrheal illness.

The restaurant passed an inspection conducted by state and local
health inspectors on 12 Nov 2008. The inspection included
environmental swabbing of 35 locations within the restaurant, and no
_E. coli_ O111 contamination was identified.

The outbreak was linked in August 2008 to contamination by _E. coli_
O111, a rare toxin-producing bacterium not normally associated with a
foodborne outbreak of the magnitude experienced in Oklahoma. While no
single food item was found to be the source of illness at the
restaurant, the Oklahoma State Department of Health believes several
different foods became contaminated with the _E. coli_ O111 bacteria,
leading to exposure of restaurant customers from 15-24 Aug 2008.

Health officials note that toxin-producing _E. coli_ are notoriously
difficult to culture from food or the environment. This provided a
challenge throughout the investigation. Despite testing numerous
surfaces within the restaurant, various food items, stool specimens
from food handlers, and well water specimens, no specimen yielded the
_E. coli_ O111 bacteria.

A total of 341 outbreak-related cases were reported; 56 were children
less than 18 years of age. The age range of cases was 3 months to 88
years. 72 persons were hospitalized; one person died.

[This outbreak underscores the relevance of non-O157 strains of
verotoxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have
been associated with VTEC (verotoxin-producing _E. coli_) disease
include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones
such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from
sheep and cattle and, although they cause as many as 30 percent of
outbreaks of VTEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or at least more
variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).
In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups,
it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have
unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The
serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and
O103 (6), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this
outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify
VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157
strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the
University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed
for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme
immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4
strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody
stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom
duration. Five (18 percent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of
the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157
strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate
performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with
a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and
most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to
non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will
become over time is unclear.

Recently (see
<http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/11/19/113182/overuse-of-antibiotics-favours-e-coli-superbug.html>),
a report documented the recognition of a non-O157 VTEC strain (an
O26) in some UK cattle that was multi-antimicrobial resistant by
virtue of producing an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). No
human cases of infection with this strain were reported. Because of
the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in VTEC infections treated
with antimicrobials (9), antimicrobials are not used for known acute
cases.
