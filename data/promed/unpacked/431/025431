Edmonton-area farms are the epicenter of a new and devastating
plant-disease outbreak that is threatening the country's CAD 11
billion-canola industry, authorities say. Provincial and county
governments are taking swift action to contain the rapidly spreading
and incurable soil-borne disease called clubroot.
"It is terrible, terrible, terrible," said Greg Porozni, chairman of
the Alberta Canola Producers Commission. "It is the biggest single
threat we have in the canola industry right now, bar none. There's no
question." Porozni's producer-funded commission is working with
Alberta Agriculture and the University of Alberta to pay for research
aimed at stopping the threat to this province's CAD 3.2
billion-canola industry.
Meanwhile, a move by the province this spring to declare clubroot a
pest under its Agricultural Pests Act gives counties and
municipalities the right to take drastic measures to slow the
disease's spread. Counties can now test farmland for the disease and
order farmers not to plant their lucrative canola crops on infected
fields for at least 5 years.
Clubroot is spread through resting spores in the soil that can
survive for up to 20 years. Infestations are usually carried to new
locations when farm equipment, or sometimes oilfield equipment, moves
contaminated soil.
Clubroot has traditionally affected cole crops such as broccoli,
Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and kale, mostly in market
gardens in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. Those strains of
clubroot had no effect on canola crops, said clubroot expert Stephen
Strelkov, assistant professor of plant pathology at the University of Alberta.
But suddenly, clubroot appeared on canola in the St. Albert area in
2003. It was the 1st report of clubroot on canola in Canada,
according to Alberta Agriculture. The discovery sparked immediate
concern and lots of research, said Strelkov. "We have a very nasty
strain of clubroot here, I guess," he said. "Since that initial
discovery in 2003 of about a dozen (12) fields, now there are several
hundred fields that are known to be infested with this disease."
There is no way producers can buy insurance against clubroot, which
is deemed to be a crop-management issue, Porozni said. A report last
year [2006] from the Canola Council of Canada pegged canola's
economic impact in Alberta at CAD 3.2 billion. Alberta is the
2nd-largest canola producer, behind Saskatchewan's CAD 3.8 billion
industry. Canola is worth about CAD 11 billion to the Canadian economy.

A devastating disease called clubroot is threatening Alberta's CAD
3-billion-a-year canola crop and forcing government officials to ban
dozens of farmers from growing the oilseed. "It could be a very huge
threat unless we can get a handle on how to prevent the expansion of
areas being infected," says Rod Scarlett, executive director of Wild
Rose Agricultural Producers, Alberta's largest farm group. "If it
impacts a tremendous amount of land, that will limit the
opportunities for growing canola in Alberta and Western Canada."
Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld says clubroot could have a
terrible impact in Alberta. "We're working with the canola people and
saying, 'Hey, this is a big problem and let's not drag our feet.
Let's pull out all the stops."'
Clubroot may have gone undetected in the province's canola crops for
several years, Groeneveld says. "I think we've been misdiagnosing it,
probably for quite a while, giving it a chance to get a foothold
here," he said Monday [24 Sep 2007] in an interview. "It's going to
be darn tough on the canola industry." Groeneveld said the disease
"has the potential to move south very quickly."
[A man], who farms about 650 hectares (about 1606 acres) near Leduc
just south of Edmonton, said he discovered rotting roots on his
canola last year [2006]. He is among 50 farmers in the region who
have been ordered to stop growing canola. [The man] is hoping that
researchers can come up with a solution. "Science hasn't developed
anything yet that can eradicate this, so I'm hoping perhaps there
will be more funding made available," he said. "I'm quite confident
that it will happen."
[The farmer] said many of his neighbours have also found clubroot in
their canola crops, but were reluctant to talk about it at first. "I
think that in our county, the survey that they did shows almost half
the lands have it," he said. "People are finally admitting ... it.
They're past the denial stage." He plans to grow wheat in the field
where the canola crop was infected and said he's hoping that higher
grain prices will temper his losses. But he's also planning to go
back to canola once the 5-year ban has expired.
A key factor in curbing clubroot's spread is educating farmers to
clean their equipment before they move to another field, said
Groeneveld. There may also be a need to encourage producers to
disinfect their equipment after each use, a move Groeneveld concedes
would not be popular among farmers "who are always in a hurry. I'm
sure there's not a farmer out there who wants to hear me say that,
but we may have to take this to the extremes if it gets that bad."
Alberta's agriculture researchers are working on a solution to help
eradicate the root disease and the minister is hoping they come up
with one quickly. Groeneveld isn't considering any compensation for
farmers who are being forced to stop growing canola. They may face
some financial losses, but will still be able to grow other crops, he
said. "Yes, it's a concern, but they can look after themselves to
some degree, so at this stage of the game I'm counting on the farmers
to do that."
Scarlett said there's no question that steps must be taken quickly to
prevent clubroot's spread. "Perhaps we haven't been as well prepared
as what we need to be and perhaps we haven't spent as much money on
research to ensure that we can get a handle on this very quickly."
Farmers who are forced to stop growing canola may be able to offset
any financial losses because of recent increases in grain prices, he suggested

[Clubroot is caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora brassicae_ and is a
destructive soil-borne disease which affects nearly all cultivated,
as well as many wild and weed members of the cabbage family. It is
found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and
tropical highlands. The fungus enters root hairs and wounded roots,
and multiplies rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement of the
underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots. These roots often
decay before the crop has matured, releasing many resting spores,
which can survive for a decade in the absence of a susceptible host
plant. Affected plants are stunted and may have discoloured purple
leaves. Due to the distortion of the root, plants may wilt in dry
weather and then recover at night.
Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores
and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides.
Raising soil pH by addition of lime has been shown to be effective
but is hardly practicable on large fields. Use of clean planting
material is essential.
The pathogen is composed of numerous pathotypes which have hampered
efforts to breed cultivars with durable resistance. At least 2
prevalent clubroot pathotypes have been reported in Alberta. This
appears to be a new outbreak of a very virulent strain of the pathogen.
