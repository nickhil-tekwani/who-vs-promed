The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has reported 2 new presumptive cases of variant H3N2 (H3N2v) influenza. [virus infections]. The new cases occurred in a school-aged girl from the Twin Cities area [Minneapolis and St. Paul] and a pre-school-aged boy from greater Minnesota [outside of the Twin Cities area]. Neither child was hospitalized, and both have fully recovered.

Both children visited the swine barn at the Minnesota State Fair with their families on 2 Sep [2012], and became ill on 5 Sep [2012]. The boy lives with his family on a farm where swine are raised, and could also have been exposed to H3N2v in that setting. Neither family was exhibiting swine at the fair.

Lab specimens for both cases have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for confirmation.

This is the 1st time human infection with the H3N2v virus has been linked with possible exposure at the Minnesota State Fair; 4 confirmed or presumptive human cases involving a different flu strain, H1N2v, had previously been reported in people who spent time in the State Fair swine barn. 3 confirmed or probable cases of the H3N2v strain had previously been reported in people who visited live animal markets in Dakota County [Minnesota].

Both strains can be spread from swine to humans, but are not easily spread through human-to-human exposure. Health officials continue to emphasize that you can't get either illness from eating pork.

The H3N2v strain has been a major focus of attention nationwide this fall, with CDC recording 297 human cases and one death since the beginning of the year. Most of the cases have occurred in young people who were exhibiting swine at state or county fairs.

Both H1N2v and H3N2v typically result in illness comparable to regular, "seasonal" flu.

MDH officials said the state could still see additional cases of influenza associated with swine exposure at the State Fair, but the time window for new cases should be closing soon. The State Fair ended on 3 Sep [2012]

[The US CDC has reported that there have been 305 cases of H3N2v virus infections, most of which involved people exposed to pigs at county and state fairs. These cases have been scattered across 10 states (see proMED-mail archive no. 20120917.1297468). There is no evidence of person-to-person infection. Disease in people infected with H3N2v virus have symptoms similar to usual seasonal influenza virus infections. The 1st, and so far only human death from an H3N2v virus infection, was reported on 31 Aug 2012 in the state of Ohio (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120901.1276404]. That individual was an older person with underlying medical problems. - Mod.TY
