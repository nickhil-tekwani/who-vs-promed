A local woman was on the receiving end of a rabies scare last week [week of 19 Feb 2018] when she was bitten by a horse. LM, who lives on a farm near Doringkop, inland from Stanger [KwaZulu-Natal], told the Courier she approached the horse on [Mon 19 Feb 2018] thinking it was sick. "It was lying down, which made me think maybe it had colic and then the best thing to do is try get them back up on their feet," she said.

While trying to help the horse, she got too close and was bitten. "Afterwards I was chatting with a family friend, a vet, about colic and she phoned back to say I should just check for rabies, though it was unlikely." However, the horse did in fact test positive for rabies and had to be euthanized that same day. LM as well as all her workers who had contact with the horse have since undergone prophylactic treatments so as to prevent the rabies virus from infecting them.

Rabies is a dread disease in humans and warm-blooded vertebrates, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of an infected person or animal.

In September last year [2017], a 2 year old died after contracting rabies from a dog bite. NM was bitten while playing near the community standpipe near his home in the Thafeni area of Upper Tongaat [KwaZulu-Natal]. According to his sister, F, their mother was out asking for food when the incident occurred. "After he was bitten by the dog, neighbours cleaned his wound with spirits and killed the dog," said F. She said no one thought he had been infected as he showed no signs of pain or illness and just continued playing [see comment]. Within 14 days he started showing symptoms and one day after that he passed away.

Director of veterinary services from the Department of Agriculture, Dr Themba Skhakhane has warned residents that every dog bite should be treated as a matter of urgency and the patient must get to the nearest clinic as soon as possible. "If you have ever seen someone infected with rabies, you would agree that it is a horrible way to die."

Quintin Doidge from the state vet clinic in Stanger urged residents not to touch any stray dogs but contact the SPCA or the state vet clinic, especially if they appear to be rabid. The state vet can be reached at 032 437 7500/4/9.

["No one thought he had been infected as he showed no signs of pain or illness" (following the dog bite) is a fatal (and, unfortunately, still prevailing) mistake. Clinical signs which may lead to suspicion of rabies will appear only after an incubation period which may take days (generally, at least a week), weeks, or even months. During this period the victim appears normal.

WHO's "first aid treatment":
"Since elimination of rabies virus at the site of infection by chemical or physical means is the most effective mechanism of protection, immediate washing and flushing with soap and water, detergent, or water alone are imperative (this procedure is recommended for all bite wounds, including those unrelated to possible exposure to rabies). Then apply either ethanol (700 ml/l) or tincture or aqueous solution of iodine.

"Treatment by, or under direction of a physician:
treat as described above and then:
- apply anti-rabies immunoglobulin by careful instillation in the depth of the wound and by infiltration around the wound;
- postpone suturing of the wound;
- if suturing is necessary, ensure that immunoglobulin has been applied locally as described above;
- where indicated, begin anti-tetanus treatment and administer antimicrobials and drugs to control infections other than rabies."
(http://www.who.int/rabies/human/firstaid/en/)

Local treatment of wounds involving possible exposure to rabies is recommended in all exposures. Treatment should be started as early as possible after exposure, but in no case should it be denied to exposed persons whatever time interval has elapsed. - Mod.AS

[2] Thailand: canine, spread increased, human

Rabies has spread rapidly, albeit silently, in many provinces of Thailand, with 271 confirmed cases of infection in animals nationwide as of yesterday [24 Feb 2018] just 55 days into the New Year.

This number already exceeds the total number of rabies cases in the entire year of 2014. According to real-time rabies infection statistics reported at Thairabies.net, the rabies outbreak is most serious in the lower north eastern region, while dogs were the commonest animals to be infected. It was reported that Roi Et has the highest rabies infection rate in the country, with 65 cases so far this year [2018], almost 3 times the number of cases in Surin, which had the 2nd highest number of rabies infections, 24.

The eastern provinces of Chon Buri and Prachinburi and southern province of Songkhla also had relatively high numbers of rabies cases. The Livestock Development Department's Disease Control and Veterinary Services Bureau director, Wiriya Kaewthong, said the major rabies outbreak was caused by the breakdown of herd immunity due to the lower rate of rabies vaccinations in 2014 and 2015. This reduced the overall rabies immunization rate in the dog and cat populations to below 80 per cent. "The collapse of herd immunity significantly increased the infection rate among the unimmunised animals and we started to notice an increase of rabies cases since 2016. But it is during these recent months that the rabies infection rate has sharply risen," Wiriya said. He said the major reason for the lower rabies vaccination rate 4 years ago was a vaccine shortage due to a procurement problem.

However, he insisted that this problem had been solved and the authorities currently had enough rabies vaccine. "Although we no longer have a problem with vaccine availability, there are still many factors that contribute to the spreading of rabies, such as the lack of awareness among dog owners who often neglect to immunize their pets," Wiriya said. "Stray dogs are also a big problem, as many of these dogs have no one to take care of them, vaccinate them, and control their population." Therefore, he said, the Livestock Development Department has asked local authorities to survey and register stray dogs and cats in their locality, and dispatch local volunteers and veterinary teams to vaccinate and sterilize the stray dogs.

As a short-term measure to deter outbreaks of rabies, the department has asked the Local Administration Department to implement a 5-km [3-mi] radius quarantine zone in areas found to be infected. Dogs are not allowed to leave or enter the quarantine zone unless officers give their permission. Animals suspected of being infected will be quarantined for at least 6 months, and all cats and dogs within the zone will have to be vaccinated.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), rabies is a vaccine-preventable viral disease and it can infect many species of mammals, including humans. Domesticated dogs contribute up to 99 per cent of all rabies transmissions to humans. WHO said rabies is almost always fatal following the onset of clinical symptoms, so the best prevention methods are to vaccinate dogs and avoid dog bites.

Dr Sopon Iamsirithawon, the Disease Control Department's Vector Borne Diseases Bureau director, said a total of 14 people had died from rabies last year [2017], with one death already this year [2018]. He said people should be concerned about rabies and learn how to protect themselves. "There is still the misunderstanding among the public that rabies can be cured, but actually once the patient shows symptoms, it is already too late and death is guaranteed," Sophon said.

He said the rabies virus normally has an incubation period within humans of between 1 and 3 months. Anybody who is bitten by an infected animal should clean the wound and find a doctor to get the vaccine as soon as possible.

[Rabies is on the rise in Thailand. There were 330 reported cases of rabies-affected animals in 2015, 614 in 2016, and 843 in 2017. Dogs were the most infected (89 per cent), followed by cattle (6.6 per cent), cats (3.6 per cent), and others (0.7 per cent). Rabies caused 5 human deaths in 2015, 14 in 2016, and 8 in 2017. Last month [January 2018] a schoolteacher in Mueang Surin (Surin province) who had 5 dogs at home and often fed stray dogs died as a result of a rabies infection.
