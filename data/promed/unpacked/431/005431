Health authorities are testing hundreds of staff and patients exposed to tuberculosis after St. Vincent's Hospital [in inner Sydney] detected a cluster of highly infectious cases among a group of patients.

Genomic testing revealed 5 people were infected with an identical strain of [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, causing] active tuberculosis (TB). "The cases are linked genetically. All 4 patients have exactly the same bug," said Dr Anthony Byrne, a thoracic physician and TB expert at St. Vincent's. Three cases were patients, and a 4th was a staff member. All 4 people spent at least 8 hours together in an area of the hospital. "It is likely that one person, diagnosed at St. Vincent's Hospital, has transmitted the infection to 2 other patients and one staff member while in hospital," a hospital spokesperson said in a statement.

The 1st case was a man who presented at emergency on 30 Oct [2019] while highly infectious. He was treated for asthma and pneumonia, but his tuberculosis was not diagnosed. The man unknowingly infected 2 immuno-compromised patients and one healthcare worker. He was diagnosed with TB one month after his initial presentation and was immediately isolated and treated by staff wearing personal protective equipment.

The patients were treated as individual cases. They were only able to be linked when genomic testing results came back within the last 2 weeks.

"Since becoming aware of the genomic link amongst the patients, the hospital has been working with NSW [New South Wales] Health and St. Vincent's TB clinical experts to identify this very targeted group of staff, patients, and members of the public who may have been exposed and has commenced the process of informing them and organising for appropriate testing as a precaution," the St. Vincent's spokesperson said.

Genomic testing also found a 5th person in Sydney linked to the cluster. This person was diagnosed before the 4 St. Vincent's cases, but it is not yet known how this patient is connected. "They must have somehow crossed paths," Dr Byrne said.

The hospital's TB taskforce has identified hundreds of staff and patients who came into casual contact with the cases over a 20-hour window. "We are being very cautious and casting a wide net over a greater number of staff and patients." Dr Byrne said the risk of infection is low among the group. People with underlying illnesses and who may be immuno-suppressed are being prioritised. "Depending on their circumstances and the results, they may also be recommended to have a chest x-ray and medical review," he said.

Dr Byrne said the 4 cases at St Vincent's were very sick when they were diagnosed and resistant to the TB drug isoniazid. One patient had an advanced case with infection in their brain. All are undergoing treatment and have been discharged, Dr Byrne said.

The disease is spread by droplets and is not as infectious as the flu or coronavirus. People need to be exposed to an active TB case for several hours, even days, to become infected. Roughly 600 active TB cases are diagnosed in NSW every year. An estimated one in 20 Australians have inactive TB. Roughly 90 per cent will never get sick and cannot infect others. Certain conditions can "wake-up" a latent case. The highest risk are people with HIV, on haemodialysis, or organ transplant patients, Dr Byrne said. It can take up to 2 years for a person exposed to an active case to develop TB.

The Hospital's TB Hotline is 1 800 943 123 for those who have been in contact and would like further support.

[The news report above describes a nosocomial tuberculosis (TB) outbreak due to exposure to a patient with unsuspected TB. The transmission was confirmed by genotyping the isolates from 4 hospital contacts (3 patients and 1 hospital staff). A 5th patient with the same genotype was identified in the community, who was diagnosed before the 4 nosocomial cases, but whose epidemiologic linkage with the nosocomial cases is under investigation at this time.

Transmission of TB usually occurs indoors, in closed, poorly ventilated environments, such as homes and congregate settings, such as hospitals, clinics, refugee camps, factories, homeless shelters, prisons, etc. via airborne droplet nuclei, containing one or a few tubercle bacilli. Droplet nuclei result from evaporation of water from larger respiratory droplets generated by patients with pulmonary or laryngeal TB who are coughing, sneezing, laughing or singing. Airborne droplet nuclei are small in size (1 to 5 um) and lightweight. They remain suspended in air for a prolonged time and follow air currents. When inhaled by susceptible people nearby, these particles are small enough to traverse the bronchi and reach the alveolar macrophages to initiate primary infection.

Without treatment, about 5 to 10% of people who become infected after unprotected exposure will develop TB disease at some time later in life; about half of those people who develop active TB disease will do so within the 1st 2 years of infection. However, in people with immunosuppression, especially HIV/AIDS, untreated primary TB infection will more likely advance quickly to TB disease. In fact, 2 of the people who developed active TB disease within months after unprotected exposure to the index case in the nosocomial outbreak described above were said to be immunosuppressed, although the nature of their immunosuppression is not specified.

We are also not told specifically whether there were unprotected exposures to any of the secondary cases in this outbreak, except that contact tracing has "identified hundreds of staff and patients who came into casual contact with the cases over a 20-hour window," who are likely being evaluated for active and latent TB infection, prioritizing those "with underlying illnesses and who may be immunosuppressed."

More information as it becomes available would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
