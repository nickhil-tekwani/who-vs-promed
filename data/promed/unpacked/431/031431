The spread of fireblight must be stopped
----------------------------------------
At Lake Konstanz, the largest continuous pome fruit growing area in
Baden-Wuerttemberg [BW], the apple trees are flowering. "Depending on
the weather, there will again be a high risk of fireblight due to
last year's [2008] severe outbreak. We therefore need to respond
early and try to fight the disease," said the BW Minister for Food
and Rural Areas, Peter Hauk, at a briefing on fireblight control.

The problem of fireblight has been known for years in the pome fruit
industry and is being taken very seriously. Control measures are
being discussed with all stakeholders, environmental protection
agencies, and the public, and solutions are being sought. "At present
orchards can only be protected by agrochemicals. Mixtures containing
streptomycin are being used again this year [2009] which may only be
applied under strict guidelines and a permit system for farmers,"
said the minister.

When using streptomycin, special attention is being paid to honey
bees in collaboration with apiarists. "Despite extended research,
only sprays containing streptomycin have been shown to be
sufficiently effective," said minister Hauk. "We are continuing our
search for alternatives, for example in a collaborative project with
Switzerland and Austria." This year [2009], streptomycin may only be
applied twice and only after a warning has been issued.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected and the
host range covers more than 180 species from 39 genera.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insects, wind, water, mechanical means,
and on plant material (including budwood). They enter the host plant
through wounds. Since they overwinter almost exclusively in cankers
on limbs infected the previous season, the amount of inoculum and
thus the risk of outbreaks is increased following years with high
fireblight levels.

Disease management includes monitoring, cultural measures (such as
removal of pathogen reservoirs), and copper sprays, but currently the
most effective measure is the application of streptomycin during
flowering. However, streptomycin resistant pathogen strains are
emerging. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some
protection. _E. amylovora_ has been placed on the quarantine alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

In 2009, a high fireblight risk has also been reported from the UK,
and the use of streptomycin in pome fruit tree nurseries has been
allowed in Switzerland for the 1st time because nurseries are
considered to be pathogen reservoirs (see links below).

The use of antibiotics in agriculture is of concern because impure
preparations may still contain some bacterial DNA. Such
contaminations are feared to increase the sources of genetic
antibiotic resistance available to bacterial pathogens affecting
humans and animals.
