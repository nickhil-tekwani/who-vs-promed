Emergency report
Translation of a fax received on 8 Sep 2000 from Dr Isabelle Chmitelin,
Head, International Health Coordinating Mission, Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries, Paris:
Report date: 8 Sep 2000.
On 24 and 28 Aug 2000, 2 horses belonging to 2 different owners, both in
the same district in the department of Herault (Languedoc-Roussillon
region, in the South of France) exhibited clinical signs, namely a
disturbed sense of balance leading to paralysis of the hindquarters. They
were euthanized on 1 Sep and 30 Aug 2000, respectively.
Diagnosis:
Serological tests were positive for West Nile disease. For one of the
horses these serological results were confirmed by PCR on 8 Sep 2000.
Epidemiology:
2 other horses from the same geographical area (a few square kilometres)
presented the same clinical signs and were euthanized on 8 Sep 2000. Blood
tests will be carried out to disprove or confirm the diagnosis.
According to the preliminary results of the epidemiological survey
currently under way, the affected horses were born in this region. While
several cases of West Nile encephalitis were reported in this area during
the period 1960-1970, no further cases had been diagnosed until now.
To date, no case of human contamination [infection? has been identified.
Actions taken: health regulation measures have been implemented in the
outbreak areas in accordance with French law. In particular, the
disinsectization of the properties involved is planned.
In addition to these statutory measures, it has been decided to:
- carry out a serological survey on horses in the suspected area and
adjoining areas;
- undertake research and analysis on the vectors and potential reservoirs
of the virus;
- carry out disinsectization of an extended area around the premises where
the outbreaks took place;
- issue warnings and information messages to veterinarians, doctors,
administrative bodies and the general public.
