Health officials have drawn up caution following media reports on deaths of 10 people supposedly by an unidentified disease in the Mid-West district of Jajarkot.

Three separate medical teams, one each from Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD), World Health Organisation (WHO) and Mid-West Regional Health Directorate, are all set to visit Jajarkot to collect samples and investigate on whether or not a flu-like disease has actually caused deaths.

The teams from WHO and the regional directorate will leave for Jajarkot on Saturday [11 Apr 2015], while the EDCD team is scheduled to leave Kathmandu on Sunday [12 Apr 2015], said health officials.

Following reports of the disease, the EDCD had deployed health teams to each of the deceased's houses.

"We found that all but 3 deceased had a long history of other diseases like asthma, high blood pressure and tuberculosis. So, we cannot say whether all the deaths were actually caused by the rumored disease," said Krishna Khatri, EDCD focal person for the district.

According to Jajarkot's Chief District Officer Jagat Bahadur Basnet, 10 people have died so far with 2 deaths reported on Friday [10 Apr 2015] only.

"The patients showed symptoms like nausea, numbness and high fever," said Basnet. "More than 400 patients suffering from common cold and cough have been treated so far."

Five VDCs of Jajarkot of Paink, Archhani, Sakala, Dandagaun and Paraju have been affected by the flu-like disease. [VDCs are Village Development Committees; in Nepal, each district has several VDCs, similar to municipalities (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_development_committee).] The 1st casualty reported was 20-year-old of Archhani. A 10th grader, she showed symptoms upon returning home after taking her SLC examinations. She later died of complications.

[Jajarkot, with a population of 171 304 in 2011 and 30 village development committee (VDCs), is one of the 75 districts of Nepal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jajarkot_District). For a map of Nepal showing the location of this region, see https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jajarkot,+Nepal/@28.8482568,82.1803952,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x39a2bf63278a0755:0x8db73ce440db555e.

A flu-like illness is said to have involved more than 400 people and resulted in 10 deaths in 5 of Jajarkot's VDCs (Paink, Archhani, Sakala, Dandagaun and Paraju). A differential diagnosis of the illness is not possible without more detailed clinical information. More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
