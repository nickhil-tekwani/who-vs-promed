A hunter in western Zimbabwe has found the carcasses of 4 more elephants believed to have been poisoned by cyanide, according to a newspaper report on Mon [26 Sep 2016].

The elephants were found on Fri [23 Sep 2016] along the Manzamnyama River in Bulilima district. News of these deaths came as the decline of Africa's elephants was in the spotlight following the release on Sun [25 Sep 2016] of a report by the IUCN that showed that around 111 000 elephants had been lost mostly to ivory poachers across the continent in the last decade.

The 4 elephants were believed to have been poisoned early last week, likely by poachers who put poison in the river and then waited for the elephants to come down to drink, according to the state-owned Chronicle. The animals had already had their tusks removed.

Tests were being carried out on both of the dead elephants' intestines and on soil and water samples from the river.

These deaths came just 2 weeks after the suspected killing with cyanide of 4 elephants along the Lukosi River, outside Hwange National Park, near Sinamatella. In that incident, a policeman was accidentally shot and fatally wounded by a colleague's gun as they pursued the suspected poachers.

More than 200 elephants were killed with cyanide in and around Hwange National Park in 2013. Another 60 were killed using the same method late last year [2015]. Worryingly cyanide is fairly easily available in Zimbabwe.

The Chronicle quoted Bulilima Rural District Council officer John Ncube as saying: "It appears these [poisoning] incidents have resurfaced which is a cause for concern."

[Other articles indicate these 4 in Bulilima and 9 others in Amandundumela Gwai Forest, Matabeleand North are cases of cyanide poisoning for ivory tusks where the poachers escaped.

This article indicates there may have been mercury as well. Hopefully testing will either confirm or refute this. However, if mercury is involved, this is also a worrying development.

Further it is likely these were African savanna elephant _Loxodonta Africana_. African savanna elephant _Loxodonta Africana_ and African Forest Elephant _Loxodonta cyclotis_ are separate species taxa. Genetic studies have shown that the level of genetic divergence between _L. africana _and _L cyclotis_ is comparable to that between the modern Asian elephant _Elephas_ and the extinct mammoths (Mammuthus).

While the genetic make up may be interesting it pales compared to the crime that has been committed here. It is unlikely that they poisoned the water, especially if the water is running, as may be in a river where the dilution factor would be tremendous. However, poisoning a puddle may be a different issue, if the puddle is sufficient to water the elephants. It may be that a salt area was poisoned as elephants require a reasonable amount of salt. Depending upon how much cyanide was salted into an area where elephants may obtain their salt, may depend upon how far the elephants could travel before succumbing to the toxic substance.

Hopefully results of the testing will be made known, but as this might allow poachers to know the authorities are aware of what they are using, it is unlikely. Besides, the easy availability of cyanide is quite concerning. The entire region has been plagued by poachers using cyanide to kill the elephants for their ivory. It is unlikely that any cyanide would have remained in the carcass after the animal had been dead for 3 or more days. Therefore the statement in the article is probably based on the fact that poachers in this area have previously used cyanide.

At one point, at least a year ago [2015], it was suggested that park rangers use cameras and drones with cameras to watch the elephants and to document who in the area is poisoning them and/or their 'mineral holes' or their watering area. It is lamentable that these poachers have not been apprehended and the horrible act stopped.

Cyanide can come as either a gas, as in hydrogen cyanide, or as a solid, in the form of potassium cyanide and/or sodium cyanide. As a solid crystalline form, it may well have been put out as some kind of bait for the elephants. Once cyanide is in the system, the cells are unable to use oxygen, because cellular respiration is blocked through the inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase system and inhibition of the enzyme.

If cyanide was put out as a crystalline bait, then the perpetrators might have expected crystalline cyanide salts to work faster because of the acid in the stomach. These animals would likely have had difficulty breathing, perhaps causing panic, and then cardiac arrest. This would have been a painful death for these elephants.

Elephants are exceptionally intelligent, family oriented animals. They are very human-like in their emotions and thought processes. This is truly a heinous crime. The poachers are likely to have been shrewd observers of animal behavior.

Elephants need a relatively large amount of sodium in their diet. The Journal of Mammalogy indicates that they tend to be somewhat deficient in sodium. As a consequence, they tend to seek out salty soil and consume it.

Many elephant and mammal salt licks are areas within the ground that are high in sodium. An early salt lick may be seen at http://www.lastrefuge.co.uk/php/show-images-all-big.php?id=AW03538. However, these salt licks do not remain flat. After a time, they resemble a hole which can hold water, as seen at http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169555X1100314X-gr2.jpg.

According to Holdo RM, Dudley JP and McDowell LR: Geophagy in the African elephant in relation to availability of dietary sodium. Journal of Mammalogy 2002; 83(3): 652-64, http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1644/1545-1542(2002)083%3C0652%3AGITAEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2:

"We studied the use of mineral licks by African elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) during the dry season in a Kalahari-sand habitat in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, to investigate the role of geophagy as a mechanism for supplementing low Na+ [sodium] levels in browse and natural water supplies. Plant, water, and soil macrominerals were measured to evaluate mineral availability for elephants during the dry season. Elephant behavior was monitored at licks to investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-[sodium] loss. Female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. We found the following consistent with the [sodium]-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, [sodium] in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high [sodium] content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal [sodium]; and 4) elephants in non-Kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their [sodium] requirements from ubiquitous [sodium]-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in Kalahari-sand habitats."

But according to Young CA and Jordan TS: Cyanide remediation: current and past technologies. Proc. 10th Annual Conf. on Hazardous Waste Research, Kansas State University 1995, https://www.engg.ksu.edu/HSRC/95Proceed/young.pdf:

"Soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (FeTiO3), hematite (Fe2O3), bauxite [AlO.OH/Al(OH)3], and pyrite (FeS2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites, and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides. Depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulomb interaction. Cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations."

With bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. It is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. However, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. The rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.

While some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. However, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. This would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done.

Additional information is available from Young and Jordan's document.

Perhaps if lucky, at least some of the cyanide in the salt licks will be bound and neutralized by the calcrete clays, which are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix of the natural salt licks. - Mod.TG
