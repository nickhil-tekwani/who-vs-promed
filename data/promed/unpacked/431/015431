Malaria threat in Delhi, 53 positive cases
------------------------------------------
The threat of Malaria is looming large over the national capital,
with the city registering 53 positive cases of the mosquito-borne
disease, outnumbering Dengue cases, which is only 5, in the current
monsoon season.

As per the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on vector borne diseases,
53 cases of Malaria have been reported so far in the current season as
against 13 cases registered in the same period last year [2010].

"Malaria cases are more than Dengue this year. Last year we had 13
cases of malaria till now as against 53 this year. The Municipal
Corporation of Delhi has already adopted all anti-mosquito measures,"
MCD Health Committee Chairman V K Monga said. "We have strengthened
malaria detection Clinics, and these figures clearly reflect that
breeding of Anopheles mosquito is on the rise," he said.

According to MCD's Mosquito Breeding Checkers, as many as 18 844
houses are detected as breeding ground for mosquitoes. MCD's health
workers have already sent legal notices to 23 750 people and
prosecuted 969 of them.

If the surveillance is identifying the majority of cases the numbers
reported could represent cases infected in other areas of India and

If the surveillance especially in the slum areas are not identifying
most cases, there could be transmission ongoing in slum areas without
