42 gastro-enterities deaths in Manthani Kataram (Karimnagar)
Six mandals in the Manthani revenue division, predominantly populated by
tribals, are in the grip of gastroenteritis with 42 deaths reported in the
last 25 days from the areas. A large number of gastroenteritis cases have
been reported from Kataram, Mahamuttaram, Mahadevpur, Malhar, Manthani
Muttaram, Kamanpur and Manthani mandals even as the recent heavy rains have
further led to the deterioration of the quality of drinking water in these
areas. While the disease has spread fear among the people, its outbreak at
a time when farmers begin planting paddy has delayed agricultural
operations as people from nearly all the habitations in the mandals have
been affected and farmers have been hard put to find labour.
