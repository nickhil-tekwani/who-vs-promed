New Zealand racehorse exports to Australia have been stopped by MPI [Ministry for Primary Industries], after a suspected positive test for the rare blood disease piroplasmosis.

Piroplasmosis, also known as _Theileria equi_, is a blood disease causing anaemia in animals, spread by ticks or other parasites.

MPI today [21 May 2020] advised of a suspected positive test was returned as a result of standard export certification testing carried out prior to a broodmare being shipped from New Zealand.

The horse in question is now undergoing further testing, with MPI expecting confirmation by the end of the week. The particular horse was imported to New Zealand from Europe early last year [2019] for breeding.

"At this stage it is really a trade issue more than a health issue the MPI is trying to get to the bottom of," Dr Ivan Bridge, Chairman of the New Zealand Equine Health Association said.

"Australia requires us to have no piroplasmosis in the country for at least 3 years. MPI can't sign off on that at present.

"We have not had any clinical piroplasmosis in New Zealand and we don't believe the tick we have in New Zealand is capable of transmitting it."

A shipment of horses to Australia was scheduled for next Tuesday [26 May 2020], however, it is now on hold due to the suspected case.

[Some years ago, Australia seems to have imported a horse with the disease from Hong Kong (see below in the ProMED-mail archives). Clearly, Australia is being very cautious. Hopefully the retest will prove this animal does not have this disease.

"1. What is equine piroplasmosis?
Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a tick-borne disease that affects horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras. The disease is transmitted via ticks or through mechanical transmission by improperly sanitized surgical, dental or tattoo instruments, or through the reuse of needles and syringes. EP is considered to be a foreign animal disease in the US, but it occurs in many other areas of the world.

"2. How is equine piroplasmosis spread?
EP agents are spread by certain species of ticks, which transfer the parasites (_Babesia caballi_ and/or _Babesia (Theileria) equi_ from one horse to another. Ticks ingest blood from the infected equine and transfer the parasite to an uninfected equine by feeding on the host, spreading the disease through blood contact. Because the disease is spread through blood, EP can also be transmitted through blood transfusion when the source of blood is an infected horse, previously used needles or syringes and other skin penetrating instruments that are contaminated with blood and have not been adequately sanitized between horses (i.e. dental, tattoo and surgical equipment). _B. equi_ can be transmitted from an infected dam to her foal.

"3. What are some of the signs of EP?
An infected horse can take 5 to 30 days to show signs of the disease. Mild forms of EP can appear as weakness and lack of appetite. More severe signs include fever, anemia, weight loss, jaundiced mucous membranes, a swollen abdomen (edema fluid accumulation), swelling of the limbs, and labored breathing. Other signs of EP can include central nervous system disturbances, roughened hair coats, constipation, colic and hemoglobinuria -- a condition which gives urine a reddish or dark brown color to the urine. Chronic infection often results in nonspecific clinical signs such as mild inappetence, poor performance and weight loss. The spleen may be enlarged on rectal examination. Some cases may progress to death. Some infected horses, may however, show few or no signs of disease after infection and may not experience any decreased performance.

"Horses that survive the acute phase of infection continue to carry the parasites for long periods of time. These horses, often called chronic carriers, are potential sources of infection for other horses through tick-borne transmission or mechanical transfer by reuse of needles/syringes or surgical, dental or tattoo instruments that have not been adequately sanitized between horses.

"4. How is EP diagnosed?
Clinical signs for EP are non-specific and similar to many other diseases and conditions therefore, laboratory tests are needed to make a diagnosis of EP. If EP is suspected, state or federal animal health officials must be notified so they can further investigate the case.

"In horses with clinical signs of EP, the parasite may be detected on microscopic examination of a blood smear, but detection of the parasite is not always possible by this method of testing. The most commonly used tests are serologic tests that detect antibodies to the organism in blood. The cELISA (competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is regarded as the standard test for screening for EP infection (in the USA); there is a separate test for _B. caballi_ and _B. equi_. In an outbreak situation, different types of tests are often needed to determine the infection status of a horse."
