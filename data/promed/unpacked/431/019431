Russia (Bashkiriya): Epidemic of Hemorrhagic Fever Threatens City of Ufa
---------------------------------------------
A hemorrhagic fever outbreak is thought to be imminent in the capital
of Bashkiriya. Medical specialists in Ufa made this prediction, since
there are already 44 cases of infection with this dangerous virus
[not identified], a number 4 times greater than in 2003.
The inhabitants of Bashkiriya have a greater risk of contracting
hemorrhagic fever than those in other regions of Russia. Field voles
are particularly abundant in the lime tree forests of Bashkiriya. The
climate this year is also favorable for these rodents: warm winter,
dry spring and autumn with little flooding are ideal conditions for
multiplication of these rodents.
Health professionals are warning people be especially careful in the
countryside: store food products in places inaccessible for rodents,
do not lie in grass, and wash your hands often.

[The text of the report does not identify the etiologic agent of this
outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. A likely candidate is tick-borne
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic virus. Further information is requested. -
