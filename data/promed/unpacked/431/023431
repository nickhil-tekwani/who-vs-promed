Fever Ticks Lay Claim to a Million Acres in Texas
-------------------------------------------------
The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) marked
an ominous anniversary 3 Jul 2008 by expanding
the preventive cattle fever tick quarantine area
in south Texas by 307 000 acres, after the
dangerous livestock pests were detected on cattle
outside quarantine areas in Starr and Zapata
counties. Fever ticks, capable of carrying and
transmitting deadly "tick fever" to cattle, have
been detected on livestock or wildlife on 139
Texas pastures during the past 12 months.

"In July 2007, the 1st preventive quarantine was
established -- 39 325 acres in Starr County -- to
enable the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA)
Tick Force and the TAHC to inspect and treat
livestock moved from the area, get ahead of the
fever tick and push it back across the quarantine
line," said Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas' state
veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health
Commission, the state's livestock and poultry
health regulatory agency. "Now, a year later, we
have more than a million acres under preventive
quarantines in Starr, Zapata, Jim Hogg, Maverick,
Dimmit and Webb counties, in addition to the
half-million acres in the permanent fever tick
quarantine zone that runs alongside the Rio
Grande, from Del Rio to Brownsville."

The enlarged preventive quarantine includes
portions of Starr, Zapata counties and a small
area in Jim Hogg County. It is bounded on the
north by Texas Highway 16, from its intersection
on the west with US Highway 83 to its eastern
junction with Ranch Road 649. Ranch Road 649 is
the eastern boundary to its southern intersection
with US Highway 83, which is the western boundary
stretching northward to the intersection with
Texas Highway 16. Maps of this and all preventive
fever tick quarantines are available on the TAHC website at
<http://www.tahc.state.tx.us> or by calling the TAHC at 800-550-8242>.

"This is no longer a 'border war' against the fever tick," said Dr.
Hillman. "The fever tick has gained a substantial foothold on Texas
soil, and without adequate resources to fight this pest, it will
spread." The fever tick, which can survive winters from coast to coast
and as far north as Washington, DC, was successfully pushed back into
Mexico in 1943. Periodic tick incursions since then have occurred in
Texas, but only one, in the 1970s, eclipsed the current outbreak for
the number of premises infested and took 6 years to eradicate.

"In smaller states, a quarantine area the size of
Delaware would raise red flags," said Dr.
Hillman. "Texas' vastness and the previous
success at keeping the fever tick controlled may
be working against us. Now we need help, with a
million more acres to cover and finding about a
dozen infested premises a month."

"Early this year [2008], the fever tick program
received USD 5.2 million of the USD 13 million of
federal funds requested to fight the tick, and
while appreciated and used, it is not enough to
win this battle," said Dr. Hillman. "Furthermore,
there has been no funding for the National Fever
Tick Eradication Strategic Plan, developed and
approved by USDA in 2006. It called for
preventing entry of cattle fever ticks into the
USA, enhancing surveillance, and eradicating
infestations resulting from fever tick
incursions. The plan also was to identify and
procure the tools necessary to keep the USA free
of fever ticks, and to work with Mexico, where
cattle fever ticks are not controlled. The
strategic plan has not been implemented."

"It's really a 'pay now or pay later' scenario,
because this tick won't be stopped with less than
an all-out assault that requires adequate
personnel, sufficient treatment products, and
enough equipment, such as portable dipping vats
or portable spray boxes for cattle, and treatment
equipment for deer and other wildlife hosts,"
said Dr. Hillman. "Texas has a ticking time bomb
in south Texas. So far, we have had only 2 of the
3 elements for a 'tick fever' outbreak: fever
ticks and fever tick hosts including cattle,
horses and several species of wildlife. If,
however, some of these fever ticks carry babesia,
a blood parasite deadly to cattle, the equation
would be complete and we could see livestock deaths."

On the front lines are the ranchers in the
preventive quarantine areas who must gather their
cattle for inspection, 足which in the south Texas
brush country usually requires helicopters and
cowboys on horseback. The TAHC and USDA work
cooperatively to provide the inspections to
determine the scope of infestation in the
area. Cattle, horses and ruminants, including
llamas and camels, also must be inspected,
treated and given permits prior to leaving the area.

Dr. Hillman encouraged ranchers to comply with the preventive
quarantines and asked producers in adjacent counties to have their
livestock checked prior to movement out of the area. "In discussions
with ranchers, it has been suggested that cattle moving through south
Texas livestock markets be inspected and dipped prior to sale," said
Dr. Hillman. "This is being considered, but it, too, requires
additional personnel, chemicals and the construction of dipping vats,
resources we do not have at this time."

"We have traced more than 1000 cattle moved from
ranches later found to be tick-infested," said
Dr. Hillman. "Requesting an inspection prior to
movement costs nothing for the rancher, but it
could save us countless hours of tracking cattle,
time that could be better used in the field to
fight the ticks. I also encourage ranchers
anywhere in Texas to call us if they see tick
infestations on their cattle. We can check the
animals, and collect and send tick samples to the
state-federal laboratory for identification. We
do not want to take any chances with these ticks
and spread them further. "Ranchers can call their
area TAHC office, or the agency headquarters at 800-550-8242.

Ranches where ticks have been detected are
quarantined, and cattle are rounded up, inspected
and treated as often as every 2 weeks, or as
seldom as every 28 days, depending on the
treatment method足: dipping, spraying or injection
with Dectomax, an injectable treatment. The
cattle are repeatedly treated and returned to the
pasture to 'pick up' ticks on the vegetation,
until the animals are tick-free, indicating that
the premises is free of the pests.

Another method of clearing a pasture of ticks
involves removing clean, treated cattle and
'vacating' the pasture for as long as 9 months to
starve out the ticks. Recently, this method has
met with less than positive results, as ticks
have demonstrated their adaptability to live on
wildlife when cattle hosts are not available.

"Historically, fever ticks preferred cattle, and
sometimes, hitched a ride on horses. Now fever
ticks are being detected not only on white-tailed
deer and nilgai, but also on aoudad sheep,
fallow, axis and red deer, and elk. Fighting
fever ticks on a variety of species 足- especially
free-ranging animals that don't respect fences 足-
makes this battle much more difficult," said Dr. Hillman.

Currently, treatment of wildlife or exotic
livestock is limited to providing corn treated
with an insecticide, or setting up feeding
stations equipped with treated posts that
transfer pyrethrin, an insecticide, to the
animal's head and neck. Later, as the animal
grooms itself, the pyrethrin is distributed
across its body, killing the fever ticks. The
problem: some products require a 60-day
withdrawal period, so they can't be used just
prior to or during the hunting season. In the
quarantined areas, the hides of harvested animals
are either left behind, or inspected and treated
prior to being removed from the premises.

"Concerns about fever ticks run deep in Texas,
where the TAHC was established in 1893 to fight
this pest. A Fever Tick Working Group, with
industry and related agency membership, is
working on recommendations for getting ahead of
the fever tick, so it can be pushed back to the
border. Likewise, a Wildlife Subcommittee also is
working on suggestions for addressing fever ticks
on free-ranging and exotic livestock," said Dr.
Hillman. "Fighting fever ticks may seem simple,
but it's not easy ... and it's never cheap."
