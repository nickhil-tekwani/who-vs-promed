Fatal laboratory-acquired infection with an attenuated _Yersinia
pestis_ strain -- Chicago, Illinois, 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 18 Sep 2009, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was
notified by a local hospital of a suspected case of fatal
laboratory-acquired infection with _Yersinia pestis_, the causative
agent of plague. The patient, a researcher in a university laboratory,
had been working along with other members of the laboratory group with
a pigmentation-negative (pgm-) attenuated _Y. pestis_ strain (KIM
D27). The strain had not been known to have caused laboratory-acquired
infections or human fatalities. Other researchers in a separate
university laboratory facility in the same building had contact with a
virulent _Y. pestis_ strain (CO92) that is considered a select
biologic agent; however, the pgm- attenuated KIM D27 is excluded from
the National Select Agent Registry (1). The university, CDPH, the
Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and CDC conducted an
investigation to ascertain the cause of death.

This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which
determined that the cause of death likely was an unrecognized
occupational exposure (route unknown) to _Y. pestis_, leading to
septic shock. _Y. pestis_ was isolated from premortem blood cultures.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified the clinical isolate as a
pgm- strain of _Y. pestis_. Postmortem examination revealed no
evidence of pneumonic plague. A postmortem diagnosis of hereditary
hemochromatosis was made on the basis of histopathologic, laboratory,
and genetic testing. One possible explanation for the unexpected fatal
outcome in this patient is that hemochromatosis-induced iron overload
might have provided the infecting KIM D27 strain, which is attenuated
as a result of defects in its ability to acquire iron, with sufficient
iron to overcome its iron-acquisition defects and become virulent (2).
Researchers should adhere to recommended biosafety practices when
handling any live bacterial cultures, even attenuated strains, and
institutional biosafety committees should implement and maintain
effective surveillance systems to detect and monitor unexpected acute
illness in laboratory workers.

Case report
-----------
On 10 Sep 2009, the researcher, a man aged 60 years with
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, was evaluated at an outpatient
clinic for fever, body aches, and cough of approximately 3 days
duration. A clinic physician suspected influenza or other acute
respiratory infection and referred the patient to an emergency
department (ED) for further evaluation; however, the patient did not
seek further care at that time. On 13 Sep 2011, the patient was
brought by ambulance to a Chicago hospital ED because of fever, cough,
and worsening shortness of breath. Paramedics recorded an oxygen
saturation level of 92 percent, and oxygen was administered via mask.

Upon arrival at the ED, the patient was noted to be alert and able to
converse, with a temperature of 100.9 deg F (38.3 deg C), pulse of 106
beats per minute, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and blood
pressure of 106/75 mm/Hg. Examination revealed distant breath sounds,
abdominal distention, peripheral cyanosis, and trace pedal edema; no
lymphadenopathy, rash, or jaundice was noted. A chest radiograph
revealed normal lung fields; however, the patient continued to have
labored breathing and required supplemental oxygen. Blood chemistries
showed renal failure (creatinine: 6.5 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen: 73
mg/dL), incipient acidosis (bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L; PaCO2: 31mmHg; pH:
7.36), and elevated liver function enzymes (aspartate
aminotransaminase: 794 IU/L; alanine aminotransaminase: 160 IU/L).
Complete blood count showed severe leukocytosis (white blood cells: 79
200/mL) with a left shift (22 percent band forms) and hemoglobin level
and platelet count within normal limits. Extracellular bacteria were
noted on a peripheral blood smear.

The patient initially was treated with diuretics for suspected
congestive heart failure and later with intravenous antibiotics
(vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) once infection was suspected.
At approximately 12 hours after presentation, the patient had
worsening respiratory distress and was intubated. He died 1 hour later
of cardiac arrest, despite resuscitation attempts.

The patient had last worked in the laboratory on 4 Sep 2009. On 10
Sep 2009, he notified his supervisor about his illness to explain his
absence from work. Whether the patient himself suspected his symptoms
were consistent with plague is not known; however, existing laboratory
policy called for laboratory workers with illness consistent with
plague to report to the university's occupational health clinic (or to
the ED). The patient's occupation was not documented in the records of
either the outpatient clinic he visited or the hospital ED.

On 14 Sep 2009, blood cultures drawn the previous day yielded
gram-negative bacilli (4 of 4 bottles), gram-positive cocci (3 of 4
bottles), and yeast (1 of 4 bottles and presumed to be a contaminant).
On 15 Sep 2009, the clinical laboratory identified the gram-positive
cocci as nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS). An autopsy
performed the same day identified no signs of pneumonia, bowel
perforation, or endocarditis, which is often associated with NVS
infection. Efforts to identify the slow-growing, gram-negative
organism were under way when, on 16 Sep 2009, an ED physician learned
that the patient had worked in a laboratory that conducted research on
select biologic agents and notified the hospital clinical laboratory.
On the morning of 18 Sep 2009, 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing performed
by the hospital clinical laboratory narrowed the identity of the
gram-negative bacilli to either _Y. pestis_ or _Y.
pseudotuberculosis_. That same day, hospital infection control staff
members notified CDPH of the suspected _Y. pestis_ case.

Epidemiologic and environmental investigation
---------------------------------------------
On 18 Sep 2009, CDPH, IDPH, CDC, and the university initiated a joint
investigation to determine the source of _Y. pestis_ infection,
identify any potential additional infections, and implement prevention
and control measures. Because inhalation exposure could not be
excluded, antimicrobial prophylaxis was offered to all staff members
at the research laboratory in which the patient worked and to his
close contacts. A close contact was defined as a person who had been
within 6 feet [2 m] of the patient or who had handled his blood or
tissue samples during 7-18 Sep 2009. Unless contraindications existed,
a 7-day course of doxycycline was prescribed for prophylaxis. All 30
coworkers were prescribed prophylaxis during 19-20 Sep 2009. 1
household contact and 64 other close contacts, including medical,
laboratory, and pathology personnel, were identified, and 61 (94
percent) accepted prophylaxis during 18-20 Sep 2009. No additional _Y.
pestis_ infections have been identified.

An assessment of the laboratory environment identified no major
deficiencies in laboratory engineering controls. A review of
Occupational Safety and Health Administration Form 300 logs identified
no recent work-related injuries or illnesses among workers in this
laboratory. A review of attendance records for university biosafety
training identified deficiencies in staff attendance (including the
patient) at a number of required biosafety courses. The patient's
family members and coworkers were asked about knowledge of any
possible exposure events, such as a needle puncture or splash of
liquid to the face, and none were reported. Interviews with laboratory
coworkers revealed that the patient inconsistently complied with the
laboratory policy to wear gloves while handling _Y. pestis_ KIM D27
bacterial cultures.

Laboratory and pathologic testing
----------------------------------
Preliminary PCR and microbiologic analyses conducted by the
university research laboratory identified the organism isolated from
the patient as a pgm- attenuated strain of _Y. pestis_ (3), consistent
with the KIM D27 strain with which the patient worked, and not the
virulent _Y. pestis_ strain CO92, which was used in a separate
laboratory facility on another floor. The IDPH Division of
Laboratories confirmed the infecting organism as _Y. pestis_. CDC
independently isolated _Y. pestis_ from an aliquot of 1 of the
original blood culture bottles and confirmed the absence of the pgm
locus. CDC also identified a chloramphenicol resistance gene (a
common, laboratory-based resistance marker) that was not in the
original laboratory stock strain, suggesting that the infecting strain
had been modified as part of routine laboratory research.

To determine whether new virulence mechanisms had been acquired or
genetically inserted into the infecting strain, CDC compared the
virulence of the infecting strain with that of CO92 from CDC culture
archives and the original, attenuated KIM D27 stock strain from the
patient's laboratory. Male Swiss Webster mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with varying doses of bacteria ranging from 3 to 8 logs
of colony-forming units (CFUs) for the infecting strain and the
parental KIM D27 strain, and from 2 to 3 logs for CO92. Virulence was
measured by determining the median lethal dose (LD). The LD of CO92
was equal to or less than 100 CFUs. In contrast, an LD was not
achieved for either the infecting strain or KIM D27; less than 3% of
the mice died after injection with doses as high as 8 logs of CFUs.
Such findings suggest that the strain with which the patient was
infected was attenuated and that no new virulence mechanisms were
acquired by or engineered into the infecting strain.

Histopathologic examination of the patient's lung tissue at CDC
revealed preserved alveolar structure without inflammatory infiltrates
that would have indicated pneumonic processes consistent with plague
[for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Immunohistochemical tests
using an anti-_Y. pestis_ mouse monoclonal antibody revealed abundant
staining of _Y. pestis_ in blood vessels of multiple organs,
consistent with septicemic plague. Histologic staining revealed
abnormal iron deposits in the liver, but not in pancreatic or cardiac
tissues. Postmortem testing of blood samples revealed a total serum
iron of 541 microg/dL (reference range: 40-160 microg/dL), iron
saturation of 83.5 percent (reference range: 14-50 percent), and total
iron binding capacity of 648 microg/dL (reference range: 230-430
microg/dL). Genetic testing revealed that the patient was homozygous
for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, confirming a postmortem
diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (4). Investigators found no
evidence that the researcher knew he had hemochromatosis or that he
exhibited any symptoms of this condition.

Editorial note
--------------
This report describes the 1st known fatality from a
laboratory-acquired infection with attenuated _Y. pestis_. The last
known laboratory-acquired infection with _Y. pestis_ in the USA
occurred in 1959 and was caused by inhalation of a virulent strain
(5). Pathology findings for the case described in this report are
consistent with septicemic plague and inconsistent with pneumonic
plague, suggesting a transdermal or mucosal route of infection.
However, a recent study (6) demonstrated that intranasal infection of
mice with KIM D27 can result in persistent colonization of the lung
vasculature, subsequent dissemination of infection, and eventual death
without classic pathologic signs of pneumonic plague. Consequently, a
respiratory route of infection cannot be ruled out definitively.
Although the route of transmission for the infection remains unclear,
deficiencies in biosafety practices, including inconsistent use of
gloves, could have resulted in inadvertent transdermal exposure. The
severe outcome experienced by the patient was unexpected, given that
he had worked with an attenuated _Y. pestis_ strain that 1) is widely
used by laboratory researchers, 2) has not been associated with
previous laboratory-acquired infections or fatalities, and 3) is
excluded from select biologic agent requirements (1). Although NVS
bacteremia cannot be excluded as a contributing factor in the
patient's death, the clinical course, lack of endocarditis, and the
visualization of _Y. pestis_ in blood vessels throughout the body
strongly support gram-negative sepsis as the cause of death.

Hemochromatosis, an iron-overload disease (7), is characterized by
increased iron absorption and progressive iron storage in multiple
organs. Persons with hemochromatosis are especially susceptible to
infection with _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_,
_Yersinia enterocolitica_, and _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ (7).
Animal studies have shown that the virulence of pgm- _Y. pestis_
strains can be enhanced by the simultaneous injection of iron into
experimental animals (2). Conceivably, hemochromatosis-induced iron
overload might have a similar effect, enhancing the virulence of the
infecting KIM D27 strain by compensating for its iron-acquisition
defects (2). Although iron deposition in pancreatic tissue is known to
cause bronze diabetes, pathologic examination ruled out iron
deposition as the cause of this patient's diabetes. Nonetheless,
diabetes is a known risk factor for increased severity and
complications from bacterial infections (8).

Research using animal models of hemochromatosis (9) is under way to
better understand susceptibility to infection with bacteria attenuated
as a result of defects in iron acquisition. Researchers working with
attenuated _Y. pestis_ and other potentially infectious material
should always use at least biosafety level 2 practices (10), and
laboratory managers should ensure that staff adheres to recommended
biosafety practices. Institutional safety committees should implement
and maintain effective surveillance programs to identify and monitor
acute illness among laboratory workers, and health-care providers
should routinely inquire about occupational exposures when evaluating
patients.

[As seen in the "see alsos" below, ProMED-mail had posted regarding
this case when it occurred. In the 2nd posting Ken Alexander, head of
pediatric infectious disease was quoted that the autopsy did not imply
that the strain of the plague was a public health threat. He told the
Chicago Tribune that "the more likely possibility, I'd say 999 to 1,
is that there was something unusual about him." It appears that Dr
Alexander was correct. - Mod.LL]
