The National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality (Senasica), confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] H7N3 in 2 commercial poultry production buildings in the municipality of General Cepeda, Coahuila, where the immediate slaughter of 70 000 birds was ordered.

The Senasica received the report of clinical suspicion of avian flu on Thursday [21 Apr 2022] afternoon.

"It immediately launched the emergency and prevention operation to contain the outbreak, for which [it] sent technicians to the area to take samples in the commercial production and family poultry units located within a radius of 5 kilometers [3.1 mile] around the farm affected, with the purpose of measuring the dimension of the outbreak.

"Early Friday [22 Apr 2022] morning, the PCR tests applied in the laboratories of the agency of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER) showed the presence of avian influenza [HPAI] H7N3, and at this time, work is being done on viral isolation for definitive confirmation and [procedure] to make the corresponding reports to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE, for its acronym in French) and to commercial partners," [it] explained.

Laboratory tests carried out by technicians from the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA) confirmed that the outbreak of avian influenza [HPAI] H7N3 corresponds to the strain existing in some regions of Mexico since 2012.

Among the measures adopted by Senasica, the immediate start of a vaccination campaign for birds located on family and commercial farms in neighboring communities stands out.

In addition, the instruction was issued to reinforce the supervision tasks at the verification and inspection points (PVI) located in Coahuila to prevent the movement of live birds and their products and by-products without official control.

Given the contingency, the federal authorities, in coordination with the Secretary of Rural Development of the State Government, summoned the region's poultry farmers to an urgent meeting for this [Sun 24 April 2022], with the purpose of reviewing the results of the sampling carried out by the experts and agreeing on an action plan aimed at preventing the spread of the outbreak.

The last event of [HPAI] H7N3 in Mexico reported to the OIE began on 1 Apr 2019 and was closed on 17 Jan 2020.

In total, 33 outbreaks were identified in 8 entities: State of Mexico, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Quer√©taro, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz.

Meat and egg supply
The National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality explained that the affected sheds in Coahuila correspond to fertile egg-laying hens, that is, the egg used for the reproduction of chicks.

In Mexico, just over 298 million chickens are produced per cycle, which means that 1758 million [1.758 billion] chicks are born each year, since there are 5.9 annual production cycles, so the impact of this outbreak is so far 0.003%, and "does not represent a risk for the national supply of food."

The Senasica added that, according to data from the National Union of Poultry Farmers (UNA), the Comarca Lagunera only has a participation in the national production of chicken meat of 8%.

SADER indicated, for its part, this virus is exclusive to birds, and "there is no risk to humans," while it urged poultry farmers in the area to timely notify any suspicions and reinforce biosafety levels on their farms.

[The [HPAI] H7N3 virus is generally not a disease affecting humans, but cases of conjunctivitis have been reported. Genomic and antigenic analyses of one isolate indicated relatedness to poultry and wild bird subtype H7N3 viruses from North America in a 2012 case.

As it seems most of North America is dealing with avian influenza, this is just another variant to be on the look-out for. - Mod.TG
