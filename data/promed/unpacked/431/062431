[1] Ferret: COVID-19 susceptibility; farms
Date: Tue 25 Aug 2020
From: Sukie Crandall <sukie@mac.com> [edited]


An essential qualification about the German study (noted both in their description and in personal communications) is that the ferrets who infected each other did not do so as a casual transmission. Rather, those ferrets were housed together. Ferrets housed together normally engage in rather intimate activities such as sleeping wound together, licking each other's tongues, and grooming each other's genitalia. Contact transmission differs greatly from cats, which can infect each other while in separate cages.

My suspicion is that in households where infected humans regularly share kisses with ferrets we will at some point hear of a few cases of transmission, just as a few dogs have been infected in homes with infected people.

It is to the ferrets' detriment but useful for researchers that ferrets do not casually transmit COVID-19. That gives them better control of the timing and strain of infection in studies.

Ferrets have rather similar respiratory systems to those of humans (and rather similar brains in that they pack extra punch with folds so also used in some brain research) and are susceptible to some of the same respiratory illnesses (though not rhinoviruses), which is one reason they are used for respiratory research. Another reason is that their coughs and sneezes do not travel far. It was not even realized that they get influenza until a past researcher had his face within just a few inches of a ferret's mouth investigating an apparent sore throat. The ferret either coughed or sneezed and the researcher got the flu.

There are 2 types of farms which have ferrets. Ferret fur is sold as 'fitch'. Some pet stock comes from pet farms, with some of those farms also supplying the research industry; and I have heard of one pet farm which also used to sometimes sell to the fur industry.

[The German study, which described a COVID-19 experimental animal infection trial, to which Sukie Crandall refers, said: "All 3 non-inoculated contact ferrets became infected and viral RNA was present in nasal washing fluids starting at 12 dpi. Screening of organ samples revealed prominent viral RNA loads only in the upper respiratory tract as confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in the nasal cavity. SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies were detected from day 8 in the inoculated ferrets and in one contact ferret on day 21 dpi."

Sukie's remarks on ferret behaviour and physiology are useful and appreciated. Similarly, her indication of the 2 types of (ferret) farms in item 2 below. - Mod.AS]

[2] Ferret farms

[The post referenced above] included the following: "While minks are farmed, we are not aware of ferrets being farmed (subscribers are welcome to correct this statement if appropriate)."

Marshall Farms, in Rose, New York, USA, reputedly produces about 99% of all the ferrets sold as pets and for laboratory use in the United States.

Triple F Farms, in Bradford, Pennsylvania, USA, is also a major producer.

[ProMED is grateful to Merritt for the information above.

According to the New Zealand government's Department of Conservation website, ferrets are farmed there for export markets in Asia (https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/ferrets/).

Other ferret farms might be scattered elsewhere, but their number and dimensions seem to be significantly lower than those of operating commercial mink farms in Eurasia and America, where ferret farming seems to be of low significance. - Mod.AS]

[3] Farmed mink affected by COVID-19: scientific classification
Date: Wed 26 Aug 2020
From: Heikki Henttonen <ext.heikki.henttonen@luke.fi> [edited]


[In the post referenced above], there was a potentially misleading expression in the original text. When COVID-19 in the farmed minks in Europe was referred to, the European mink expression was used. However, all farmed minks, be they farmed in the USA, Europe, or China belong to the species American mink (_Neovison vison_). The European mink is a different species (_Mustela lutreola_), not farmed and very endangered.

[Prof Henttonen's remarks are much appreciated; the Tuft's paper addressing ferret susceptibility (ref 1) included the following: "European mink (_Mustela lutreola_) is currently the only species observed to have natural human-to-animal spillover and onward transmission." We have noted that this has already been revised; the currently available version of the paper states that "American mink (_Neovison vison_) is currently the only species observed to have natural human-to-animal spillover and onward transmission."

Also noted, ferrets (_Mustela putoris_) and farmed mink (_Neovison vison_) belong to the same taxonomic family, Mustelidae, and both have proven to be good replicators of SARS-CoV-2.

The Dutch paper addressing the event in mink (ref 2) did not address the scientific classification of the affected animals.

Notably, bioRxiv includes the following reminder in its publications: "these are preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information."

In the meantime, additional farms are getting infected in the Netherlands; yesterday (26 Aug 2020), outbreak no. 41 was reported; see https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nieuws/2020/08/26/nieuwe-besmetting-covid-19-bij-nertsenbedrijf (in Dutch). The policy applied (stamping out of affected holdings, movement restrictions) is under discussions, particularly the future of the national mink farming, which, according to an earlier government decision, is due to be terminated by 2024. Updated scientific advice is anticipated soon. The results of the ongoing research are expected as well.

COVID-19 has continued to spread in Danish farmed minks as well, although at a slower pace than in the Netherlands. The 5th outbreak was reported on Wed 26 Aug 2020; see at http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/27/c_139320267.htm. - Mod.AS]
