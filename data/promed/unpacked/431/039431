Brazil confirmed 723 [yellow fever] cases and 237 deaths for the period 1 Jul 2017 to 28 Feb this year [2018]. During the same period last year [2016-2017], there were 576 confirmed cases and 184 deaths.

The Ministry of Health updated on Thu (1 [Mar 2018]) the information passed along from the state secretariats of health about the situation of yellow fever in the country. In the monitoring period (1 Jul 2017-28 Feb 2018) there were 723 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country, with 237 leading to death. In total, 2867 suspected cases were reported, of which 1359 were discarded, and 785 remain under investigation in this period. Last year [2017] from 1 Jul 2016-28 Feb 2017, there were there were 576 confirmed cases and 184 confirmed deaths. These reports of yellow fever cases show a pattern of disease seasonality, occurring mainly in summer, with the period of analysis considered to be 1 Jul-30 Jun of each year.

Although the number of cases of the current monitoring period have been higher than during the previous season, yellow fever today circulates in metropolitan regions of the country that have the greatest contingent of the population, hitting 32.3 million, including people who live in areas that never had recommendations for [yellow fever] vaccination. In the past season, for example, the outbreak hit a population [at risk] of 8 million people, much smaller than the current population [at risk]. This explains why the incidence of the disease in this period is lower than in the past period. The incidence of the disease in the monitoring period until 28 Feb 2017/2018, is 2.2 cases for 100 000 inhabitants. In the past season, 2016/2017, the incidence was 7.1/100 000 inhabitants, in the same period.

The Ministry of Health emphasizes the importance of vaccinating the population in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and São Paulo during the campaign against yellow fever. Preliminary data from 2 of the 3 states indicate that, as of 27 Feb [2018], 5.5 million people were vaccinated. This number corresponds to 23.2 per cent of the targeted population anticipated for the campaign. The recommendation is that the states continue vaccinating until they reach a high level of coverage.

To help states and municipalities carry out the campaign, the Ministry of Health has supplied to the states in 2018 up to now 20.2 million doses of the vaccine. For the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, 15.7 million doses were provided for implementation of the Vaccination Campaign against Yellow Fever. There were 10.7 million doses for São Paulo, 4.7 million for Rio de Janeiro and 300 000 for Bahia.

[Cases of yellow fever (YF) continue to increase, albeit slowly. The YF vaccination campaign is running somewhat behind schedule.

The above report provides a good update on the yellow fever (YF) situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Should it extend for another 6 months, there is concern about infected travelers initiating ongoing transmission in countries where _Aedes aegypti_ populations are abundant and the local human population unvaccinated and not immune. Brazil is counting on use of fractionated doses of yellow fever vaccine to extend its availability for coverage of a large number of people in 3 states.

Interestingly, the presence of yellow fever virus in urine and semen samples from a patient who survived the disease was detected almost a month after the patient was infected in Brazil, according to a study conducted by researchers at the University of São Paulo's Biomedical Science Institute (ICB-USP) in Brazil in collaboration with colleagues at Butantan Institute, Emílio Ribas Infectology Institute, and Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo. The researchers followed a 65 year old patient in São Paulo who did not enter the toxic phase of the disease. They detected a significant amount of viral RNA (genetic material) in the patient's urine and semen 15 and 25 days after the initial symptoms of yellow fever appeared (https://scienmag.com/yellow-fever-virus-is-detected-in-urine-and-semen-almost-a-month-after-infection/). It would be interesting to know whether the patient shed infectious virus or just non-infectious RNA fragments of the virus.
