Potato growers of Thakurgaon and Panchagarh districts [Rangpur division] are worried due to attack of late blight disease. Arshed Ali, Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), said, "The disease appeared due to cold and foggy weather. We are suggesting farmers spray their potato fields once a week."

During a recent visit, many late blight affected potato fields [were seen]. Frequent use of [fungicides] adds to the production cost, said several farmers. They said that a portion of the plants got damaged by the disease [and that] many potato growers of the area faced the same this [2015/16] season.

23 080 hectares [57 032 acres] of land has been brought under potato cultivation in Thakurgaon while in Panchagarh, the cultivation area is 8680 hectares [21 450 acres].

Virus and late blight disease have been detected on most of the potato farmlands of the district. Severity of the disease [has] created deep alarm among the farmers.

A potato farmer lamented that he may not get 50 per cent of the production. Another farmer said about 50 per cent [of] plants have been already affected by late blight disease.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material, and fungicide sprays of crops.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. More virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Farm saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks in the past. Thus, seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Clean planting stock (potato seed tubers, tomato seeds, or explants) and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control PLB outbreaks in the future.

An undiagnosed virus is also mentioned in item 2 above, but it is not clear what has led to this assumption. Around 40 viruses and viroids have been reported to affect potato, and a number of them are present in the region. Reliable molecular diagnosis will be needed to identify whether a virus as well as PLB is present in the crops described above.
