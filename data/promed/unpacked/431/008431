Global COVID cases trend down, with surges in Japan, Korea
----------------------------------------------------
Global COVID-19 cases dropped again last week [week of 25 Jul 2022], as the BA.5-fueled disease burden shifts to some Asian nations, including Japan and South Korea, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest weekly update [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---3-august-2022].

In US developments, the Biden administration today [3 Aug 2022] released 2 new reports on long COVID, one on a research action plan and the other on services and support for people experiencing the long-term effects of the disease.

Cases still high as subvariants increase
----------------------------------------
After global cases rose through June [2022], COVID activity appears to be declining, with a 9% drop last week compared to the week before, WHO said. 2 regions, however, reported increases, the Western Pacific, where cases rose 20%, and Africa, where illnesses were up 5%. The WHO has urged caution in interpreting trends based on cases, due to declines in testing and surveillance.

In the Western Pacific region, the highest jumps were in Japan, which reported a 42% increase, and South Korea, which reported a 25% rise compared to the week before.

Japan's cases are averaging more than 200 000 per day, with healthcare systems feeling pressure in some areas, partly due to COVID-19 illnesses in staff, according to the Japan Times [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/03/national/japan-seventh-wave-medical-strain/]. South Korea is reporting more than 100 000 cases a day, the highest since the middle of April, according to the Korea Herald [https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220803000158].

In Africa, the biggest proportional increases were reported from Liberia, Seychelles, and Rwanda.

Of more than 6.5 million cases reported to WHO last week, the 5 countries with the most cases were Japan, the United States, South Korea, Germany, and Italy.

Deaths were stable last week after rising the previous week, with about 14 000 reported to WHO, with the United States reporting the most.

The proportions of more transmissible BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants continue to increase. BA.5 prevalence rose from 63.8% to 69.6%, and BA.4 levels rose slightly, from 10.9% to 11.8%.

Biden administration unveils long-COVID reports
-----------------------------------------------
In April [2022], president Joe Biden issued a memorandum calling for 2 reports in 120 days, both addressing the challenge of long COVID, in which patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms -- some serious -- for months or even years.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released 2 reports today [3 Aug 2022], one on a research action plan and the other on federal services and support for people with long COVID. HHS secretary Xavier Becerra said, "As our nation continues to make strides in the fight against COVID-19, these reports are critical to shine a light on long COVID's impact and how to match people to resources." [https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/08/03/biden-harris-administration-releases-two-new-reports-long-covid-support-patients-further-research.html]

HHS estimates that 7.7 million -- 23 million Americans are experiencing long COVID, and that about 1 million are out of the workforce at any given time, amounting to USD 50 billion in lost earnings each year.

In other COVID developments:
- President Biden, who is experiencing a rebound after Paxlovid treatment, tested positive for COVID again today for the 5th day in a row, according to a statement from his physician, Kevin O'Connor, DO. He noted that the president has a light cough but finished a light workout today. Biden will continue to isolate and work from the executive residence. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Update-8.3.pdf]
- The European Medicines Agency today recommended that pericarditis and myocarditis be listed as new side effects in the product information for the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, owing to a small number of reported cases. [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/covid-19-vaccine-safety-update/covid-19-vaccines-safety-update-14-july-2022_en.pdf]
- Cattle can occasionally be infected with SARS-CoV-2, though it's not clear if the animals can transmit the virus, German researchers reported in a research letter in Emerging Infectious Diseases. They based their findings on serology tests from samples from German cattle in late 2021. [Wernike K, Böttcher J, Amelung S, et al. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 suggestive of single events of spillover to cattle, Germany. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2809.220125]

[It is welcome news that the US federal government is addressing long COVID, both in a research plan and a plan for support of those afflicted.

One has to wonder how many recovering COVID patients relapse after testing negative, whether they have taken Paxlovid or not. Had President Biden not been tested regularly as per routine for the president, his rebound might have been missed -- he apparently had no overt symptoms that normally would trigger a test to be performed. The light cough he has experienced lingers in many COVID patients after they no longer test positive.

[2] Rebound

Around a third of people with COVID will experience a rebound of their symptoms, regardless of whether they've been treated with the antiviral Paxlovid, according to a study posted online Tuesday [2 Aug 2022]. [see ref below] The preprint study found that 27% of people with COVID saw a rebound in their symptoms after they had initially improved.

"It happens all the time. People who are untreated with COVID who then feel better can get symptoms afterward," said study co-author Dr Davey Smith, chief of infectious diseases and global public health at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Still, Smith noted that the 27% finding was higher than what he'd expected based on anecdotal evidence.

The study also found that 12% of people with COVID had a "viral rebound", meaning they tested positive again several days after testing negative. This has been documented among people who have taken Paxlovid and is referred to as Paxlovid rebound, but the study found that viral rebound occurred regardless of whether a person had taken the antiviral treatment. Anyone who has had COVID could see a return of symptoms after they've initially gone away, and those symptoms could be worse or not as bad as the first bout, Smith said. "It's just the variability in the natural course of the infection."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged the possibility of symptom recurrence in untreated COVID patients. When the agency in May [2022] issued a health alert informing physicians about Paxlovid rebounds, it also said that "a brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection in some persons, independent of treatment with Paxlovid and regardless of vaccination status."

The phenomenon of waxing and waning symptoms is not unique to COVID. "In some ways, that's the natural history of all respiratory viral infections," said Dr Paul Sax, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "There are good days and bad days, and then they eventually get better." Paxlovid rebounds, in particular, have received a lot of attention in recent weeks, with both president Joe Biden and his chief medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci testing positive several days after taking the antiviral.

In Pfizer's clinical trial on the drug, 1-2% of people taking Paxlovid tested positive for the coronavirus after testing negative. In a fact sheet [https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=16474&format=pdf for doctors prescribing Paxlovid, the drugmaker noted that this also occurred at similar rates among the placebo group.

But even if a person has taken Paxlovid, it's still hard to say whether their rebound is explicitly caused by the drug. "It could be that what would have happened without Paxlovid is that they would still have tested positive in these late days, but they wouldn't have had the intervening negative test. ... This could be just a slight disturbance in what the natural history of the illness was for them," Sax said. Smith agreed: "Symptoms fluctuate, and viral antigen in the nose fluctuates, and they fluctuate with and without Paxlovid."

Dr Albert Ko, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, said that regardless of rebound symptoms, the message is clear: Paxlovid is working. "Paxlovid is doing what it's supposed to do: prevent us from getting life-threatening COVID," Ko said. "Even though these rebounds are happening, it's preventing the severe outcomes.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
By employing a common protocol and data from electronic health registries in Denmark, Navarre (Spain), Norway, and Portugal, we estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in individuals aged ≥ 65 years old, without previous documented infection, between October 2021 and March 2022. VE was higher in 65-79 year olds compared with ≥ 80 year olds and in those who received a booster compared with those who were primary vaccinated. VE remained high (ca  80%) between  ≥ 12 and  < 24 weeks after the first booster administration, and after omicron became dominant.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
This work evaluated neutralising antibody titres against wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and 4 omicron variants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5) in healthcare workers who had breakthrough BA.1 infection. Omicron breakthrough infection in individuals vaccinated 3 or 4 times before infection resulted in increased neutralising antibodies against the WT virus. The 4th vaccine dose did not further improve the neutralising efficiency over the 3rd dose against all omicron variants, especially BA.4 and BA.5. An omicron-specific vaccine may be indicated.
