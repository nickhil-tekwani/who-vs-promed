The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of
Health urged people to be vigilant against enterovirus-71 (EV71)
infection following the confirmation of a case by laboratory test on
Tuesday [3 Jun 2008].

A spokesman for the CHP said the case involved a 2-year-old boy.
Laboratory tests on his throat samples collected earlier showed a
positive result for EV71. The boy lives in Shenzhen in Guangdong
Province. He developed a fever, hand and foot rashes and oral ulcers
on 26 May 2008. He came to Hong Kong on 29 May 2008 and was admitted
to Princess Margaret Hospital on 31 May 2008. He was discharged on 1
Jun 2008. The spokesman said CHP's investigation is on-going.

There have been 43 cases of EV71 infection reported to CHP so far in
2008. There were 35, 8, 16 and 12 cases in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007
respectively. The spokesman said EV71 is a viral infection usually
found among young children. It is also one of the causative agents of
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). He added that May to August is
the usual peak season for HFMD and EV71. The infection is transmitted
by direct contact with nose and throat discharges. Children suffering
from the infection should stay at home and avoid contacting other
children until they have recovered.
