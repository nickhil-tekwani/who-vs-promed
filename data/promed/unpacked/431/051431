In a recent note about listeriosis a question was asked by the moderator as
to why this disease is seen only in children, the elderly and pregnant
women. I propose that seen is the wrong verb; the disease is only DIAGNOSED
in the above group. I have had listeriosis reported in a relatively healthy
adult male. The situation was that he had flu-like symptoms and went to the
emergency room for treatment. Because he had a history of rheumatic fever, a
blood culture was drawn. He was discharged and recovered without event. Two
weeks later the blood culture results returned with _L. monocytogenes_. I
have felt since that it is likely that only the very young, very old and
pregnant women become sick enough to be diagnosed.

[Many years ago when I first joined MAFF and attended my first annual
meeting of the VIOs at Weybridge I remember that Ivor Field, then D/CVL,
presented one speaker, a VIO from the Midlands, with the comment that his
was the only VIC diagnosing listeriosis and would everyone pay careful
attention. The next year we had some two dozen reports from other parts of
the country. - Mod.MHJ
