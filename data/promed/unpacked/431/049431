With the oily spot bacterial blight gnawing their yield, farmers
across the State have lost at least 60 percent of their crop. As a
result, the prices of pomegranate that have been on the upswing in
the past 2 months have jumped further. With the export season peaking
from December and lasting till April, if the supply does not match,
the prices in the city are expected to shoot up further.

"At least 50-60 percent of the produce in Pune has been destroyed
because of the blight," said Ravindra Navalakha, a farmer from Theur,
about 25 km (15.5 mi) from Pune. He said the prices now stand at Rs
60 (USD 1.52) per kg. "At some places, the price for export crop is
up to Rs 100 (USD 2.53)," said Shivlingappa Sankh from Sangli. "This
week, the price rise has been steep. Varieties like Bhagwa that
should sell within the country at Rs 30-35 (USD 0.76-0.89) are
selling at Rs 50-60 (USD 1.27-1.52) in Sangola (Solapur) itself. By
the time it reaches Delhi, it will cost Rs 70 (USD 1.77). There is a
severe shortage of the fruit. Around 80 percent of the crops have
been ruined here. Earlier, 10-20 tonnes would leave from Sangola, now
not even 2 tonnes leave from here for other cities," said Baburao
Gaikwad from Sangola. He lost the entire crop on his 2-acre
(0.8-hectare) farm to the blight. He said that the current shortage
is such that companies that use the 4th quality pomegranate (with the
1st quality reserved for exports, the 2nd quality for Indian
consumption) for concentrate juice preparation are falling short of fruits.

Not many hectares are under pomegranate in Pune. The fruit comes to
the city and across the country in consignments from other districts
like Sangli, Nashik, and Solapur. The total area under pomegranate
[in India] is 120 000 hectares (296 500 acres), out of which 90 000
hectares (222 400 acres) is in Maharashtra. India contributes around
70 percent to the world pomegranate market. "This year [2007], the
output is down by 60 percent," said Prabhakar Chandane, president of
the All India Growers' Association. "Prices for exports will also
increase to at least Rs 80 (USD 2)," said Chandane.

Pomegranate is available throughout the year. It grows in drought
prone areas of Sangli, Nashik, Baramati, and Solapur within the
state. The oily spot is an airborne disease, and can infect an entire
farm in one night. "The recent rains added to the spread of the
disease," said Chandane.

[Oily spot, a bacterial blight disease of pomegranate (_Punica
granatum_, synonym _P. nana_), is caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pathovar _punicae_ and affects all plant parts. The main damage is
observed on fruits, which develop black spots and usually split
resulting in enormous yield losses. Greyish black, coalescing spots
are also found on the leaves, which eventually may drop off. Infected
stems develop cracking of nodes and girdling. They break off at the
point of infection leading to breakdown of branches. An infection
rate of up to 100 percent has been reported in some orchards.
Bacterial ooze is used for diagnostic tests.

The bacterium survives on the tree as well as on fallen plant debris.
High temperatures and low humidity favour the disease. The pathogen
is spread by infected plant material, mechanical means (including
insects, birds, and humans), wind-splashed rain, and through infected
cuttings. Disease management includes use of clean planting material,
phytosanitary cultivation techniques, and bacteriocidal sprays
containing antibiotics or copper. No commercially grown pomegranate
cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily spot.

Another strain of the same bacterial species, _X. axonopodis_ pv.
_citri_, causes citrus canker, a disease that poses a serious
economic threat to citrus industries worldwide.

The monogeneric family of _Punicaceae_ only contains 2 species, _P.
granatum_ and _P. protopunica_. _P. granatum_ probably originates
from the Iran-Afghanistan area and is thought to be the "Tree of
Knowledge" in the biblical Garden of Eden. It has been in cultivation
for over 4000 years and is now a widely grown fruit tree in many
tropical and subtropical regions. There is a continuing loss of
genetic variability of cultivated stock largely because crop
improvement in pomegranate has for centuries depended on the
selection of spontaneous seedlings and their clonal propagation. It
is grown mainly from rooted and hardwood cuttings; selection of
seedlings from open-pollinated or artificially-pollinated mother
trees is more recent.
