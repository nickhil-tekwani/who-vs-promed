The EU Reference laboratory in London has verified the dangerous H5N1 virus
in a 4th Swiss avian. The infected bird was a pochard duck (_Aythya
ferina_) that was found in Steckborn, Thurgau, on Lake Constance. [Picture:

The results from about 12 bird flu samples are awaiting processing in
London, as stated by Marcel Falk, the spokesperson for the Swiss Federal
Veterinary Office (SFVO), in response to questions. It is expected that
H5N1 will also be found in these samples. None of the samples sent was
negative [for H5].
The number of H5 bird flu infected birds [in Switzerland] has increased to
32. The reference laboratory in Zurich has revealed the infection in
another pochard duck found in Steckborn [Map at

[The Swiss observations, similar to those in other central and northern
European countries, reflect the widespread (but apparently hidden) presence
of H5N1 in the wild bird population in significant parts of Europe. This
phenomenon is reflected also in the notifications to the OIE: during March
2006 alone, official notifications on H5N1 in wild birds have been received
from Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Sweden, and Switzerland. Several other countries have sent such
notifications in Feb 2006 and earlier.
A European map on avian influenza in wild birds is available at the EU
website and updated daily:
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/index_en.htm#>.
Preventing the introduction of the virus into commercial flocks -- such as
the recent one in a turkey farm in France -- is a challenging
responsibility for the animal health authorities. - Mod.AS]
