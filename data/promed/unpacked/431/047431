A Laurieton doctor says he has "absolute proof" that 2 of his
patients have a tick-borne disease that health authorities say does
not exist in Australia. GP Dr Peter Mayne said 2 of his patients had
the bacterial illness Lyme disease. He urged medical colleagues to
keep an eye out for the infection. "I've taken tissue samples at the
bite sites, and sent them off for DNA analysis, and they were
positive," Dr Mayne said.

Debate continues about whether Australian ticks can carry Lyme
disease. "There are perceptions that Lyme disease doesn't exist here
in Australia, and the medical profession have been lulled into
thinking that they don't have to worry about Lyme disease," Dr Mayne
said.

In its later stages, the infection can spread through the bloodstream
and affect the brain, heart and joints. Earlier symptoms can include
a rash, fever, headaches, tiredness and joint pain.

Lyme disease made headlines this month after an autopsy showed a
Sydney man had the disease when he died. The dead man's wife planned
to launch a class action against NSW Health, The Sydney Morning
Herald reported [see
<http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/court-grants-lyme-disease-autopsy-20100719-10hyx.html>].
Dr Mayne said he had a list of about 30 patients -- from Newcastle to
Coffs Harbour -- with the disease. It was "incredibly difficult" to
diagnose, he added.

The illness is spread by ticks carrying the Borrelia bacterium. It
cannot be passed between people. A NSW Health fact sheet about the
disease says only some ticks can be infected and they are not found
in Australia. Lyme disease is "rare or absent" here, the fact sheet
claims. There may be other similar infections here, it says. The fact
sheet adds that past cases where the disease did occur here involved
patients who contracted it overseas. Lyme disease is common in Europe
and North America.

[Initially identified as a single species, _B. burgdorferi_ sensu
lato has been separated into 3 pathogenic species that cause Lyme
disease: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto, _B. garinii_, and _B.
afzelii_ (<http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/3/378>). These
species differ somewhat in geographic location, vectors, and clinical
manifestations: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is present both in the
North America and Europe, but it seems to be absent from Asia. _B.
garinii_ and _B. afielii_ are present in Europe and Asia
(http://ijsb.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/44/4/743).

These microorganisms are transmitted to humans by ticks of the genus
_Ixodes_, the only genus of ticks shown to be competent vectors of
Lyme disease to humans. _I. scapularis_ (the deer tick) and _I.
pacificus_ transmits Lyme disease in the United States, _I. ricinus_
(the sheep tick) in western Europe, and _I. persulcatus_ (the taiga
tick) in eastern Europe and Asia. Larval and nymphal stages of these
ticks acquire the organism when feeding on infected reservoir hosts.
In North America, small placental mammals are reservoir hosts.

Lyme disease is frequently diagnosed in humans on the basis of the
characteristic early skin lesion erythema migrans (EM). Serologic
testing is commonly by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
immunoblot (Western blot) for detection of antibodies to antigens
from a sonicate of a particular strain of _B. burgdorferi_. However,
serologic testing may be negative in early EM. Culture is possible,
but the yield is low for blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and synovial
fluid; isolation of the causative organism from a punch biopsy taken
at the edge of the EM lesion is successful in over 80 percent of
cases, although it may take 8 weeks of incubation before spirochetes
can be detected in the culture
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/pmc/articles/PMC265060/pdf/jcm00026-0115.pdf>).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect _B. burgdorferi_ in skin
biopsy specimens in patients with EM
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC270592/pdf/jcm00036-0064.pdf>).
However, PCR tests are susceptible to false-positive results from
poor laboratory technique. Also borrelial DNA heterogeneity and
significant sequence differences in the target gene can cause
false-negative results. Specificity of PCR is determined mainly by
the choice of specific primers and probes. Some primers can amplify
the DNA of all spirochete species known to cause Lyme disease and
others can differentiate the three species known cause Lyme disease
(<http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/30/11/2830>).

The existence of Lyme disease in Australia has been controversial (see
<http://medent.usyd.edu.au/fact/lyme%20disease.htm>, and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2626827/>). Cases of a
disease clinically similar to Lyme disease have been reported in New
South Wales, Australia; nevertheless, serological, vector and
reservoir host studies failed to confirm acquisition of Lyme disease
in this region
(<http://medent.usyd.edu.au/fact/lyme%20disease.htm>). None of the
mammal species identified as reservoir hosts in the northern
hemisphere are said to be present in Australia and none of the
_Ixodes_ species that are known to transmit the disease are said to
exist in Australia
(<http://medent.usyd.edu.au/fact/lyme%20disease.htm>).

A species of tick called _Ixodes holocyclus_ can be found along
Australia's east coast that can cause tick paralysis, tick typhus and
allergic reactions. This tick is a logical candidate vector of the
Lyme disease spirochete in Australia; however, after 12,000 ticks
were collected from areas associated with putative Lyme disease and
examined for spirochetes by dark field microscopy, culture of gut
contents, and direct testing of ticks with PCR for the
Borrelia-specific flagellin gene, no evidence of _Borrelia_ infection
could be found in any of the ticks collected
(<http://medent.usyd.edu.au/fact/lyme%20disease.htm>). In addition,
larval _I. holocyclus_ have been found experimentally to ingest a
North American isolate of _B. burgdorferi_, but none of the derived
nymphs were infected
(<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T7F-476HMKY-2B1&_user=10&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F1991&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c66cafe6c531cddfafe21403974a1e7d&searchtype=a>).

While there has been little evidence that Lyme disease is caused by
Australian ticks, there may be other pathogens carried by Australian
ticks, which may cause an infection that is clinically similar to
Lyme disease
(<http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/infectious/lyme_disease.html>).
For example, in the USA, the lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_),
which is found throughout the Southeastern United States, does not
transmit _Borrelia burgdorferi_
(<http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0269-283X.2005.00546.x/abstract;jsessionid=B096F73FE297D879027364E14BB2546F.d01t02>),
although it may be implicated in an illness called southern
tick-associated rash illness (STARI), which resembles a mild form of
Lyme disease.

More details are needed on the two patients reported in the above
news release: for example, was the infection acquired locally or in
an endemic region outside of Australia? Also, what were the PCR
primers used on skin biopsies taken at the tick bite sites from the
two patients and, because of possible false positivity, were the PCR
tests repeated in another laboratory?

Laurieton is one of the seaside villages of Camden Haven district
along the mouth of the Camden Haven River at the base of North
Brother Mountain. It is located along the Mid-North coast of New
South Wales 42 km [26 miles] south of Port Macquarie and 365 km [227
miles] north of Sydney
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurieton,_New_South_Wales>).
