Emergency report
---------------------
Text of a fax received on 7 September 1998 from Dr. P. P. Bosman, Chief
Director of Veterinary Services and Livestock Improvement, Pretoria:
Seven FMD carrier buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) were moved illegally to a
game farm in the Northern Province. This farm is situated in the FMD free
zone of South Africa. It has not yet been possible to determine the origin
of these buffaloes but this is being actively investigated.
The owner of the above-mentioned game farm bought seven disease-free
buffaloes from a game farmer in the Free State Province (also within the
FMD free zone). These buffaloes arrived on the farm on 19 August 1998 and
the arrival was reported to the local state veterinarian. The owner refused
to off-load the buffalo as the movement permit was a fax copy and not the
original permit as required in our legislation. The state veterinarian
immediately investigated the matter on the same day and decided to have the
animals tested for FMD. The animals were then off-loaded under official
supervision in the neighbouring farms' quarantine camp. The farm was
immediately put under quarantine. Blood was collected on 24 August 1998 and
taken for testing to the Onderstepoort Institute for Epizootic Diseases.
All seven buffalo were serologically positive for FMD virus: five were
positive for SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3, one was positive for SAT1 and SAT3, and
one was positive for SAT3 only.
On 3 September 1998 we took a second batch of samples from these buffaloes
for virus isolation. All seven buffaloes were then destroyed and the
carcasses burned and buried under official supervision.
We are still investigating to determine the origin of these animals as they
could not have originated from the farm in the Free State Province as this
farmer does not have a buffalo breeding herd on his farm.
Follow-up report No. 1
-----------------------------
Text of a fax received on 8 September 1998 from Dr P.P. Bosman, Chief
Director of Veterinary Services and Livestock Improvement, Pretoria:
End of this report period: 8 September 1998.
1. The serological profiles of the seven buffaloes correspond to what we
find in our wildlife endemic FMD zone, that is the Kruger National Park and
adjoining private reserves. Their exact origin still has to be determined,
but it is most likely from one of these privately-owned reserves.
2. It must be stressed that the buffalo were not in contact with any
susceptible animals at their destination -- either the original or the final
destination. The quarantine camp (officially approved) where they were kept
from 19 August until 3 September is isolated with a buffer zone from both
domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals.
3. We received the results of the serological tests from the Onderstepoort
Institute for Epizootic Diseases on 2 September. The seven buffalo were
euthanised on 3 September and oesophageal scrapings and other diagnostic
specimens were taken. The carcasses were incinerated.
4. The supposed farm of origin and the farm of destination and adjoining
properties have been served with animal movement restriction orders and are
under official surveillance.
5. The genetic profile of viruses isolated from the buffaloes will be
matched with the latest Kruger Park isolates in order to confirm, or
disprove, the probable origin of the buffaloes.
6. It should be stressed that FMD carrier buffaloes with positive
serological titres normally shed relatively low amounts of virus. The
situation is therefore not comparable with a clinical outbreak in cattle
or, even worse, in pigs.
7. It has already been confirmed that serological titres were stable from
24 August to 3 September. The results of virus isolation efforts should be
known in a day or two, with DNA sequencing taking another couple of days.
Results of phylogenetic analyses should be available by 18 September.
