The number of new reports of measles is halved last week compared to the previous week. Last week, there were 64 new cases. The week before, the number was still 127. These figures were published on Thursday [29 Aug 2013] by the RIVM [The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]. Since May 2013, the Netherlands has seen a growing number of measles patients. In total, since May 2013, 1226 people were infected with the disease, mostly children between 4 and 12 years. The vast majority of people who become infected live in the Bible Belt, the strip from Zeeland to Overijsel, where many strict Calvinists live and who don't allow vaccination because of their faith.

The number of new cases has been falling for several weeks, but according to a spokesman for the RIVM, that does not necessarily mean that the measles epidemic has passed its peak. The RIVM believes that the epidemic expands once all the schools have started again. "We still expect a peak in the autumn [2013], though it is conjecture," said the spokesman.

Some 82 measles patients are hospitalized due to complications.

As of 29 Aug 2013, measles reportedly claimed the lives of 2 people in Abu Karinka locality in West Darfur on Wednesday [28 Aug 2013], where 25 000 displaced people are living in harsh circumstances. Speaking from Abu Karinka, one of the displaced persons told Radio Dabanga that a secondary school student and a woman, whose names were not immediately available, have died. "They were both positively diagnosed with measles."

The source pointed out that "the number of displaced persons in the locality following the recent clashes between the Ma'alia and Rizeigat tribes has now risen to 25 000. They are living in very challenging humanitarian conditions." He appealed via Radio Dabanga to humanitarian organisations to provide food and medical care for the displaced.

According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur), Darfur is a region in western Sudan, an independent sultanate for several hundred years; it was incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916. The region is divided into 5 federal states: Central Darfur, East Darfur, North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur. Because of the war in Darfur between Sudanese government forces and the non-Arab indigenous population, the region has been in a state of humanitarian emergency since 2003.

The Radio Dabanga report is ambiguous about the location of Abu Karinka, alternately in East and West Darfur. It is remarkable in view of the chaotic conditions in the region that there have not been more cases of measles.

State health officials have confirmed a case of measles in an individual in Monroe County. The individual, who was not vaccinated, became infected with measles while overseas. The Indiana State Department of Health and local health departments are working to prevent further transmission of the disease by identifying individuals who may have been exposed as well as potential additional cases.

The individual visited the Indianapolis International Airport on 22 Aug 2013 while infectious. Those who visited the airport that day and develop symptoms of measles, such as rash, fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, should stay home and call their health care provider. Secondary cases would begin experiencing symptoms from 24 Aug through 12 Sep 2013. Health care providers should consider measles in patients with rash and fever, particularly if the patient is unvaccinated and visited the Indianapolis International Airport on 22 Aug 2013 or has a history of travel to Texas (where a measles outbreak is currently occurring), international travel, or contact with international visitors or symptomatic cases. Health care providers are encouraged to ask these patients whether they have been vaccinated against measles.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. It is rare in the United States due to the widespread availability of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; however, visitors from other countries or U.S. citizens traveling abroad can become infected before or during travel. More than 95 percent of people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to measles, and more than 99 percent will be protected after receiving a 2nd dose. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to be fully protected. Individuals are encouraged to check with their health care providers to ensure vaccinations are up-to-date.

Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at one year of age and again at 4-6 years of age before going to kindergarten, but children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at risk. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles. Individuals who are unsure about vaccination history should contact their health care providers. Measles is highly contagious. When infected persons sneeze or cough, droplets spray into the air. Those droplets remain active and contagious on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours.

[This report is another instance of the introduction of measles virus infection by an unvaccinated person who had returned from travel abroad. To eliminate such events, it may be necessary to require all US residents to be vaccinated or revaccinated prior to travel.

King County health officials say members of the public may have been exposed to a child with a confirmed case of the measles in mid-August 2013 in both Washington and Oregon. The child is a King County resident who was unvaccinated and exposed to measles while traveling in Europe. This measles case is unrelated to previous cases in King County in July 2013. People who have not been vaccinated and attended a tennis tournament in Portland, Oregon on 14-17 Aug 2013, or were at the Aladdin grocery store on 18 Aug 2013, should call their health care provider if they develop a fever or unexplained rash between Sun 25 Aug and 8 Sep 2013.

Health officials warn that travelers to Europe should check their vaccination records because they are more likely to be exposed there.

A dangerous measles outbreak has been traced to a mega-church in Texas whose leader told followers to stay away from vaccines. Terri Pearsons, the daughter of prominent televangelist Kenneth Copeland, and the leader of Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark, Texas, has long warned followers to stay away from vaccines, promoting the idea that they cause autism. The un-vaccinated congregation was recently put in danger when a member left the country and came in contact with measles. They then returned to Texas, where they interacted with the congregation, as well as handled children in the church's on-site day-care centre.

Nine children and 6 adults have been infected with the disease, 12 of whom were not fully vaccinated. All of the school-aged children infected were home-schooled and didn't have to get the immunization shots needed to enter public schools. Infected people will spread the disease to 90 percent of the people they come in contact with.

"This is a classic example of how measles is being reintroduced," William Schaffner, a professor and infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville told USA Today, citing examples where fears of vaccines causing autism have led to measles outbreaks. "This is a sadly misinformed religious leader."

Following the outbreak, Pearsons has called on all congregants to become vaccinated. "Our children and even adults of all ages need to be immunized now to stop the spread of measles and prevent those potential complications," She said. "The disease is only shut down when all are immunised."

Health is asking Queensland residents to look out for measles symptoms after it received notification of a 3rd case in just over 2 weeks. The case is unrelated to 2 other cases and is an overseas traveller who became unwell while visiting Cairns on 16 Aug 2013. The visitor also spent time on Fitzroy Island on 16 Aug 2013 and then travelled by car down the coast. They stayed at Townsville on 17 Aug 2013, Airlie Beach on 18 Aug 2013, Rockhampton on 19 Aug 2013, Hervey Bay and Fraser Island on 20-21 Aug 2013, and Brisbane, before flying to Sydney at the end of their infectious period on 24 Aug 2013.

While the risk to the general public is considered low, anyone who is not immune through past disease or vaccination may be vulnerable if they are in the vicinity of an infected person. Close contacts of the case are being followed up by relevant authorities. Queensland Health says most Australians born before 1966 are naturally protected against measles. Adults born since 1966 may not be fully vaccinated and are unlikely to have natural protection. Anyone born since 1966 who is unsure whether they have been vaccinated against measles is advised to see their GP and have a dose of MMR vaccine.

Health authorities are fearing a measles outbreak in Victoria after 10 cases of the potentially fatal virus [infection] were diagnosed in Melbourne over the past 3 weeks. Victoria's Chief Health Officer Rosemary Lester said 2 separate clusters of the highly contagious disease had now been identified and that people in the northern and eastern suburbs of Melbourne may be at risk.

Dr Lester said the 1st cluster involved a 26-year-old East Brunswick man who passed the disease on to 4 people. This man flew on a domestic flight between Brisbane and Melbourne on 31 Jul 2013 and spent time whilst infectious at Northland shopping centre, including the cinemas http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/measles-detected-sparking-outbreak-fears-20130808-2ri3a.html?rand=3D1377480147345, on 1 Aug 2013. The man also attended an East Brunswick medical practice on 3 Aug 2013.

The 2nd cluster is linked to a 21-year-old man who recently flew home to Australia from Europe. He has passed the illness on to 3 family members and was infectious from 1-10 Aug 2013. During this time, he or his family were in contact with people in suburbs including Ivanhoe, Collingwood, Upper Heidelberg and Donvale. People susceptible to the virus may have also been exposed to infected people in Reservoir, Coburg, Preston, Parkville, Brunswick and Box Hill.

Dr Lester said she was also concerned about patients who attended Box Hill Hospital emergency department on 15 Aug 2013 because a Chinese woman who presented to the hospital that day has since been diagnosed with measles. "We are not aware of any other cases at this stage from the woman at Box Hill Hospital, but people are asked to be alert for symptoms. She also attended 2 medical centres, which are alerting medical staff and patients," Dr Lester said.

Because the virus has an average incubation period of 10 days before symptoms present, Dr Lester said further cases may emerge. She said the illness usually begins with common cold symptoms such as fever, sore throat, red eyes and a cough. The characteristic measles rash usually begins 3-7 days after the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and then spreading to the rest of the body. "Anyone developing these symptoms is advised to ring ahead to their GP or hospital and alert them that they have fever and a rash," Dr Lester said.

Measles, which is also known as rubeola, is a very contagious virus. Estimates suggest one person will infect about 9 in every 10 people who have not had the illness or are unvaccinated. Serious and sometimes fatal complications include pneumonia and encephalitis. The Victorian clusters come after an alarming surge of measles in the UK this year [2013] prompted an urgent vaccination campaign. British health authorities believe the outbreak was caused by a lack of herd immunity among young people who were not vaccinated in the early 2000s.
