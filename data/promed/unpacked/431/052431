A six-year-old boy has died of dengue fever in Tonga.
Ninety-eight of 300 blood specimens sent to laboratories in Australia, New
Zealand and Fiji have tested positive [Whatever that means. - Mod.CHC
Although the number of people seeking help for dengue symptoms has
declined, the report quoted a Health Ministry official as saying the
cooperation of the public in destroying breeding places for mosquitoes was
still needed.

[We have received the following update on the dengue epidemic in Tonga.
Once again, many thanks to the Ministry of Health of Tonga and Dr Ian Welch

UPDATE STARTS
**********************
[...
The epidemic which commenced in Tonga in February 1998 now appears to have
ceased with only a very few patients being seen in outpatient clinics with
symptoms that might be dengue related. The last antibody tests performed
amounted to only 13 suspect cases, with specimens collected between 1-15
June 1998. Of these 13 cases, there were two positive IgM results.
Almost without exception, the confirmed cases have all been from the main
island of Tongatapu. There have been two confirmed cases only from the
neighbouring small island of 'Eua.
As reported previously, there was one death attributed to DHF [dengue
hemorrhagic fever. This was a six year old who died while being admitted
to Vaiola Hospital on 23 March 1998. Blood specimen was taken at the time
and was later confirmed by PCR in Brisbane as dengue 2 virus. There have
been no other deaths.
Further antibody test results are expected shortly from a few suspect cases
seen since mid-June and following receipt of those results we will
summarise the situation and advise you accordingly.
