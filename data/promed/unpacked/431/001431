From: Martin Haditsch, MD, PhD <martin.haditsch@travel-clinic.at>

Two short comments:
1) The sex distribution of the Malaria cases DOES NOT reflect the
population of travelers and immigrants since (also shown in several
studies) males are more likely to become infected than females.
2) In an oral presentation on APTH3 (Bali, July 2000) it was pointed out
that Europe seems to have the highest [rate of underreporting (estimated
50%), although reporting is mostly mandatory (e.g. as in Austria, where we
also miss a lot of cases).

[I do not agree that there is a sex preference in malaria infection. In
fact all studies that I am aware of show that this is not the case. Malaria
is a notifiable disease and if underreporting occurs in Europe, which I
agree it does, it is the obligation of the health authorities to optimize
reporting and the duty of those responsible for the surveillance to do what
they can to ensure that as many cases as possible are reported. -Mod.EP
