143 carabao deaths reported in 2 East Samar towns
-------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Arteche and Oras towns in Samar province are now alarmed
about the occurrence of the disease resembling hemorrhagic septicemia
which apparently caused the deaths of some 143 carabaos [water
buffalo. - Mod.JW].

Prompted by the alarming condition, Provincial
Veterinarian, Nilo Mondonedo, reported that his
office conducted immediately a series of Animal
Health Missions in the rural barangays of the 2
towns on 1 Jun to 4 Jul 2008 where they gathered
the aforesaid data. Also, their study revealed
that some 231 farm animals were infected by the
bacteria. But he also disclosed that 116 had been
vaccinated and 213 of the animals had been treated.

In a separate interview, Dr. Norma Ylanan, Vet.
IV of the Office of the Provincial Veterinarian
confirmed that the bacteria is slowly being
contained today, which is attributed to the
activation of the Municipal Quick Response Team
headed by the municipal mayors. She said that the
team conducted close monitoring and immediate
reporting of any case; also they tracked the
occurrence of the disease and most importantly
they conducted treatment and prophylaxis; they
also instituted quarantine measures especially on
the movement of animals and the emergency
procurement of antibiotics and other veterinary medicines.

Asked if the bacterium is imported just like the
Brontispa in coconut trees, Ylanan said, the
bacterium is endemic in the carabaos; meaning, it
already exists in them and when their resistance
lowers, the bacteria feast in the system of the
farm animal until the animal is defeated and dies
unless treatment is done at once.

"The bacteria are highly contagious," Ylanan added. "They are easily
transferred to the next carabao through the liquid discharges (mucus,
urine, etc). That is why we monitor and approve before a carabao is
butchered because even the blood can carry the bacteria and infect
other animals. We even banned temporarily the slaughter of carabaos
for the health and safety of the people," the Vetmed concluded. [The
HS serotypes of _P multocida_ have not been recovered from human
infections. However, because many serotypes of _P multocida_ have the
potential to infect humans, appropriate precautions should be taken. -

Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is an acute
pasteurellosis, caused by particular serotypes of
_Pasteurella multocida_ and manifested by an
acute and highly fatal septicemia principally in
cattle and water buffaloes; the latter are
thought to be more susceptible. HS is seen
infrequently in swine and even less commonly in
sheep and goats. It has been reported in bison,
camels, elephants, horses, and donkeys, and there
is evidence of its occurrence in yak. An acute
pasteurellosis indistinguishable from HS is seen
infrequently in deer, elk, and probably other
feral ruminants. Laboratory rabbits and mice are
highly susceptible to experimental infection.

HS is a major disease of cattle and water buffalo
in Asia, Africa, and some countries of southern
Europe and the Middle East. Although it may be
seen at any time of year, the worst epidemics
occur during the rainy season. It is most common
in the river valleys and deltas of southeast Asia
among buffaloes used in rice cultivation. The
only true outbreaks in North America have
occurred in bison in Yellowstone National Park.
Occurrence in Central and South America has not been confirmed.

Animals are infected by direct or indirect
contact. The source of infective bacteria is
thought to be the nasopharynx of bovine or
buffalo carriers. As many as 5 percent of cattle
and water buffaloes may be carriers in endemic regions.

It is hypothesized that animals become susceptible as a result of
various stresses, e.g., the inanition [severe weakness and wasting as
occurs from lack of food] seen in cattle and water buffalo at the
beginning of the rainy season. Natural infection is acquired by
ingestion or inhalation. The initial site of proliferation is thought
to be the tonsillar region. In susceptible animals, a septicemia
develops rapidly, and death due to endotoxemia [toxins in the cell
walls of bacteria in the blood stream] ensues within 8-24 hr after the
first signs develop. Exotoxins [toxins released from bacteria] have
not been demonstrated.

The mortality rate is high when the agent is introduced to virgin or
nonendemic regions. Losses vary widely in endemic areas. The heaviest
losses occur during the monsoon rains in southeast Asia, and it is
thought that the organisms, which can survive for hours and probably
days in the moist soil and water, are transmitted widely at this time.

Most cases are acute or peracute, resulting in death within 8-24 hr
after onset. Because the course is so short, clinical signs may easily
be overlooked. Animals first show dullness, then reluctance to move,
fever, salivation, and serous nasal discharge [thin, watery, like
serum]. Edematous swelling is frequently seen, beginning in the throat
region and spreading to the parotid [salivary gland] region, neck, and
brisket [breast or lower chest]. Mucous membranes are congested. There
is respiratory distress, and usually the animal goes down and dies
within hours. Occasional cases linger for several days. Recovery is
rare. There appears to be no chronic form.

The principal means of prevention is by vaccination. 3 kinds of
vaccine are widely used: plain bacterin, alum-type precipitated
bacterin, and oil-adjuvant bacterin [bacterin is weakened or dead
bacteria]. The most effective bacterin is the oil-adjuvant. One dose
provides protection for 9-12 months; it should be administered
annually. The alum-precipitated-type bacterin is given at 6-month
intervals. Maternal antibody interferes with vaccine efficacy in
calves. The oil-adjuvant vaccine has not been popular because of
difficulty in syringing and occasional adverse tissue reactions. A
live intranasal vaccine prepared from a B:3,4 serotype of deer origin
is being used with reported success in southeast Asia.
