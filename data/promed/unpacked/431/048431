Your previous postings on this disease commented on it spreading with the
rats. It is worth mentioning that it is also spread with the intermediate
hosts. I believe that the introduction of _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ to
American Samoa followed the (accidental?) introduction of the giant African
snail _Achitina [Achatina fulica_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Julian for his comment. _Achatina fulica_ has, in
some locations, been bred for consumption (as escargot) and has been
documented to have escaped from the artificial breeding sites in which it
has been raised. - Man. Ed. DS
