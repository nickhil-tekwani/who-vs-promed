Foot and mouth disease in Greece: virus type Asia 1
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: September 1996).
Emergency report: Text of an e-mail received on 12 Jul 2000 from Dr
Vasilios Stylas, Head, Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture,
Athens [edited]:
Report date: 12 Jul 2000.
Date of clinical suspicion: 10 Jul 2000.
Date of laboratory confirmation: 11 Jul 2000.
Outbreaks:
Location: Evros Delta, Prefecture of Evros, North-Eastern Greece, on the
border with Turkey
No. of outbreaks: 2 herds
1. Background
* On 6 July 2000, veterinary officers from the Local Veterinary Station of
Ferres, Prefecture of Evros, visited several bovine herds in what later
became the FMD affected area, including one of the herds actually infected,
for the purpose of administering Rev-1 vaccine within the framework of the
brucellosis control programme. On this occasion, they neither observed any
signs of FMD nor heard any complaints or alarming reports from the farmers.
* In addition, within the framework of the ongoing "EVROS" programme, the
results of clinical inspections and serological monitoring for FMD in the
entire Prefecture of Evros had been consistently negative until the last
round of inspections (late June).
Detailed, relevant and recent results of the active surveillance for FMD in
the context of the "EVROS" programme are being processed. The two
considerations mentioned above, taken in conjunction with clinical and
serological evidence in the FMD outbreaks, allow an estimation of the
probable date of incursion.
2. Suspicion
On 10 Jul 2000, a farmer from the delta of the Evros river, Prefecture of
Evros, applied to the Local Veterinary Station for an animal movement
permit. Within the framework of the "EVROS" programme, all movements of
animals within and from the Prefecture of Evros are subject to a permit
issued by the local official veterinary service after the animals have been
clinically examined and serologically tested with negative results. Upon
inspection, suspicion of FMD was raised on the basis of mild clinical
signs, i.e., salivation, fever, inflammation of the gums and vesicles in
the buccal cavity, in 4 or 5 of the 50 bovines present in the herd.
Samples (blood/epithelium) were collected on the spot, the alarm was raised
and standard measures on suspicion were initiated.
On 10 Jul 2000 at 2:10 p.m., the National Crisis Centre (NCC) in Athens was
notified. By 6 p.m. a team from the NCC was on the spot. The suspicion was
confirmed on clinical grounds, and the herd was provisionally designated as
FMD outbreak No. 00/01 pending the results of laboratory tests.
At 8 p.m. samples were collected by the FMD Institute in Athens, and the
first set of ELISA plates was laid for FMD antibody (liquid-phase blocking
ELISA) and antigen detection of types A22, O1, C and Asia 1.
3. Confirmation
On 11 Jul 2000, throughout the morning, an epidemiological survey was
carried out in the vicinity of the suspect herd, leading to identification
of a second bovine herd with clinical signs compatible with FMD situated
approximately 1,000 m to the north of outbreak No. 00/01.
The second herd was provisionally designated as outbreak No. 00/02. Samples
were collected and dispatched to the FMD Institute in Athens and standing
arrangements for killing and destruction of infected animals were activated.
Note: In the light of retrospective investigations and taking into account
the rate of propagation within the infected herds, the clinical picture and
age of lesions, it is considered that, chronologically, the first herd
infected was actually outbreak No. 00/02, while the subsequently identified
herd was in fact outbreak No. 00/01.
On 11 Jul 2000 at 4:45 p.m., the FMD Institute reported:
a) negative serology for all types of FMD virus (FMDV);
b) negative antigen detection for FMDV types A and O;
c) inconclusive antigen detection for FMDV type C (it should be noted that
FMDV type Asia 1 has been known to give partial cross-reactions with type C
d) positive antigen detection for FMDV type Asia 1 (after repeating the
tests, at 10 p.m. the FMD Institute reported definite positive antigen
detection for FMDV type Asia 1).
4. Description of the situation in the field
4.1. The infected area
A total of 17 sick animals were detected in two free-grazing beef herds
comprising a total of 177 animals.
Both herds were kept on common pasture with another 22 bovine herds,
comprising a total of 1,388 animals, 1 flock of 250 sheep and 1 herd of 30
pigs. All bovines and sheep were individually identified by ear tags. All
these animals were considered to have been in contact with the two infected
herds and were duly destroyed on 12 Jul 2000.
4.2. The protection and surveillance zones
The "protection zone", including the infected area, is designated by the
following coordinates:
- from 40º 42' 30'' N to 40º 48' N, and
- from 26º 18' 30'' E to 26º 26' E.
The susceptible livestock population inside the protection zone, minus the
infected zone, is as follows: 17 bovine herds comprising 1,900 animals, and
9 goat flocks comprising 1,265 animals.
The "surveillance zone" is designated by the following coordinates:
- from 40º 42' 30'' N to 40º 50' N, and
- from 26º 18' E to 26º 30' E.
The susceptible livestock population inside the surveillance zone is as
follows: 31 bovine herds comprising 2,611 animals, 1 sheep flock comprising
150 animals, and 2 goat flocks comprising 650 animals. In all cases natural
barriers were used (Evros river to the east, the sea to the south, the
railway to the north and west) and, considering that the actual locations
of outbreaks are on the border, the size of the zones exceeds the minimum
requirements, namely a 3- and 10-km radius, respectively.
4.3. Epidemiological considerations
The means of transmission are still under investigation but the most likely
scenarios, in order of likelihood, are:
a) indirect cross-boundary contact via mechanical carriers or fomites,
b) direct cross-boundary contact via wild animals (boars),
c) cross-boundary air-borne spreading of FMD virus,
d) direct cross-boundary contact via accidental crossing of the Evros river
by an infected animal,
e) criminal act, or act of negligence.
These scenarios are currently being investigated, in cooperation with the
competent authorities.
5. Control and safeguard measures
Greece is applying a stamping-out/non-vaccination policy aimed at
eradicating the disease. Standard control and safeguard measures are laid
down in Council of Europe Directive No. 85/511/EEC, as amended by Directive
93/423/EC, and they have been promptly implemented. In addition to these
minimum measures, the Greek Authorities have taken additional steps to
prevent the spread of the disease, such as the following:
* On 10 Jul 2000, a general ban was imposed on the dispatching of live
susceptible animals, products of animal origin and feed from the entire
Prefecture of Evros. The ban will remain in place until the situation has
been clarified.
* A retrospective investigation of consignments of products of animal
origin dispatched from Evros during the previous 15 days has produced
negative results. This excludes consignments of heat-treated meat products
exported to the Balkans. However, the latter consignments present no risk
of transmitting FMD virus.
* A general standstill on animal movements and slaughter in the entire
Prefecture of Evros has been imposed until the situation has been clarified.
* Lay persons and vehicle movements inside the Evros Delta have been
drastically reduced and stringently controlled with the active involvement
of the police, the army and border guards.
