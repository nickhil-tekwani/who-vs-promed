Sixteen quarter horses have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) at one Kaufman County premise, according to the Texas Animal Health Commission, which has placed the premise on quarantine. The latest bulletin was issued yesterday [Mon 8 Jul 2019] by the Equine Disease Communication Center and comes nearly a month after a previous alert out of Kaufman County for a quarter horse previously testing positive for EIA.

"The confirmed EIA cases are contained on one Kaufman County premises located southwest of Kemp, Texas," the Texas Animal Health Commission told inForney.com in an email Tuesday [9 Jul 2019] in response to a request for additional information.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease, with no cure or vaccine, attacking horses' immune systems. Horses diagnosed with EIA are infected for life and typically die, are euthanized, or must be placed under very strict quarantine conditions for the remainder of their lives.

Although not all horses display signs of EIA infections, those that do can exhibit muscle weakness and progressive condition loss, poor stamina, fever, depression, and anemia.

The virus is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids through blood-contaminated medical instruments and needles as well as blood-feeding insects such as horseflies.

"There is no human health risk associated with EIA, as this disease does not affect humans," stated the TAHC.

According to the alert, "TAHC staff is working closely with owners and veterinarians to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures."

In an 8 Apr 2019 notice, a quarter horse in Van Zandt County tested positive for EIA, and its home facility was placed on quarantine.

In June 2018, 2 quarter horses at a Kaufman County facility tested positive for EIA. A 3rd horse at the quarantined facility later tested positive for EIA. In that case, all positive horses were euthanized.

[The US Department of Agriculture in 2006 published data recommendations/regulations regarding EIA in 2006. The figures in this particular document use data from 2005, or 14 years ago. In the 2006 document, the USDA stated that approximately 0.01% of the horses had EIA (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/eia/eia_info_sheet.pdf).

In 2006, it was determined there were approximately 9.5 million horses in the USA (http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/us-has-95-million-horses-most-world-report-says). If we assume both figures are correct, it means that approximately 950 horses were euthanized from EIA in 2006.

While 14 years ago 950 horses may not warrant a vaccine, the value of those horses (or more, considering the increasing price of horses) as well as the measure of heartache from losing a horse may now warrant a vaccine. Those numbers may be higher today, as I could not find a document with more recent horse-population figures or percentage of EIA-positive horses. Also, I do not know if the 95 million included the feral horses, most on federal lands, or how many feral horses are documented EIA positive.

The clinical findings and course of EIA are variable, depending on the virulence of the virus strain, viral dose, and susceptibility of the horse. After an incubation period of 15-45 days or longer in naturally acquired cases of infection, classic cases of the disease progress through 3 clinical phases. An initial or acute episode lasting 1-3 days is characterized by fever, depression, and thrombocytopenia. Because these signs can be mild and transitory, they are often overlooked. Typically, this initial phase is followed by a prolonged period associated with recurring episodes of fever, thrombocytopenia, anemia, petechiation on mucous membranes, dependent edema, muscle weakness, and loss of condition. The interval between episodes can range from days to weeks or months. In most cases, the episodes of clinical disease subside within a year, and infected horses enter the asymptomatic stage to become inapparent carriers and reservoirs of EIA virus. Many of these horses remain clinically normal.

Although the foregoing represents the most commonly described clinical course of the disease, some outbreaks of EIA can be associated with peracute infection in which the primary viral infection is uncontrolled; this can result in a very high fever, severely reduced platelet counts, and acute depression, leading to death. In view of the wide variation in response seen in natural cases of infection, it is not possible to confirm a diagnosis of EIA based solely on clinical grounds (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/equine-infectious-anemia/overview-of-equine-infectious-anemia).

While there are documents regarding the clinical signs and some horses are euthanized based on their possible inability to recover, their perceived impending or soon-to-be-impending death, or an owner's inability to care for the animal, published documents regarding natural deaths from EIA seemed unavailable or are lacking in the literature.

Consequently, I am wondering how many horses die naturally, or if we are trying to decrease the reservoir of virus so tabanid flies cannot carry the disease to another animal. Therefore, we euthanize positive horses, but what do we really know about the genetics of the tabanids and other biting flies capable of transmitting the virus? Can they genetically transmit the virus to the next generation of flies? I did not find documentation addressing such a question.

It is always advisable to use horse-approved sprays for prevention of mosquitoes and flies, and especially to prevent tabanid flies, although I have seen those be pretty aggressive. - Mod.TG
