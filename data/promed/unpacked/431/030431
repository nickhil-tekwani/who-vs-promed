Disease threatens Brazilian orange crop
---------------------------------------
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Officials and agricultural experts reported on Tuesday
that a new citrus disease ominously called "Sudden Death" could destroy
almost all of Brazil's orange groves if left unchecked. A warning was
issued at the start of a campaign aimed at combating a disease that has
killed some 3 million trees since it was first detected 3 years ago in the
southern state of Minas Gerais. The disease has since spread into the state
of Sao Paulo, which accounts for 85 per cent of Brazil's 280 million trees.
Brazil is the world's largest orange producer and exporter of frozen
concentrate orange juice -- ahead of the US state of Florida. The Brazilian
industry generates annual revenues of about USD 5 billion.

[According to a report published by Newsday.com on 19 March 2003, there is
no cure for citrus sudden death (CSD) at present. Affected trees die within
2 weeks after the first symptoms appear. Scientists at the Brazilian
Association of Citrus Exporters (ABECitrus) suggest that a mutant form of
Citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV) virus may be involved. It killed 9
million of Brazil's 11 million citrus trees in the 1940s. CTV is
transmitted by several aphid species and this is a major concern for
growers in protecting their trees. Unfortunately, the CTV-resistant
cultivar "Rangpur Lime", which is susceptible to CSD, constitutes 85 per
cent of the rootstock underlying Brazilian orange groves. Producers are
being advised to replace Rangpur Lime with other cultivars as soon as
possible. Another strategy is to graft disease-resistant roots onto
endangered trees, thus allowing such trees to initiate new roots. About 10
million trees have received the root grafting procedure. - Mod.DH]
