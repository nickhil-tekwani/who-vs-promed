RE: ProMED-mail Tuberculosis, elephants - Nepal 20070616.1962
--------------------------------------------------
The TB response effort in Nepal needs to include screening and
treatment of the elephant handlers as well as the elephants, because
both human-to-elephant and elephant-to-human transmission of
tuberculosis are known to occur (Michlak et al 1998; Davis 2001).
It is possible that the index case in elephants was caused by
human-to-elephant transmission from an infected human keeper or
'mahout', given the prevalence of human TB in Nepal. Statistics
provided in a recent paper by Newell and colleagues (2006; see
reference 3 below), indicate that
- 60 percent of Nepal's adult human population is infected with
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_;
- more than 80 000 have active TB infections;
- 44 000 people develop active disease every year, of whom 20 000
have active infectious TB;
- 6000-8000 people die from TB annually
- male-to-female ratio of registered TB patients is 2:1.
Given the high prevalence of TB in humans in Nepal, it is evident
that any long-term solution to this problem must be an integrated
veterinary/public health approach that includes testing and treatment
of both elephants and their human counterparts.

[Tuberculosis has been recently reported in 10 domesticated elephants
in a national park in southern Nepal (see ProMED-mail posting
Tuberculosis, elephants - Nepal 20070616.1962). Tuberculosis in
elephants is clinically similar to the disease in humans. These
elephants in Nepal are apparently used in safaris by private hotels
and state-run national parks. Elephants are a protected species in
Nepal and killing them carries a jail term of up to 15 years. A
program for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in elephants
is being initiated by the Nepalese and supported by "Elephant Care
International" (see ProMED-mail posting Tuberculosis, elephants -
Nepal (02) 20070620.1990).
Tuberculosis is spread via infectious aerosols of respiratory
secretions that contain a high _M. tuberculosis_ load and are
generated by coughing or sneezing by patients with cavitary pulmonary
tuberculosis and presumptively by trumpeting infected elephants.
These aerosols remain suspended in air for prolonged periods of time
in closed, poorly ventilated settings, such as barns. It is in such a
barn setting that zoonotic transmission of tuberculosis between
handlers and infected elephants, confirmed by DNA fingerprinting,
apparently occurred, as reported by Michalak et al 1998 (see
reference 1 above). Presumably, the risk of transmission would be
small for persons with brief contacts with elephants in the outdoors,
as would occur with tourists. Elephants in the wild are said to be
free of tuberculosis.
In Nepal the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in humans is likely
made only on the basis of a positive sputum smear for acid-fast
bacilli (see reference 3 above, Newell et al Lancet 2006), without
the benefit of speciation or antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
The report from Nepal does not state whether the isolates were _M.
tuberculosis_ or _M. bovis_. _M. bovis_ has been isolated from an
elephant in the USA (Summary. Elephant Tuberculosis Research
Workshop. Orlando, FL 21-22 May 2005. This is a detailed description
of the history, diagnosis, and treatment of tuberculosis in
elephants, available at
<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).
Although the prevalence of _M. bovis_ infection in people or other
animals is unknown because of the complexity and cost of
differentiating _M. bovis_ from other members of the _M. tuberculosis_
complex, _M. bovis_ infection is nevertheless likely to be widespread
in developing countries such as Nepal. Treatment of tuberculosis in
elephants is reported to be similar to that in
humans, and involves use of a combined regimen of INH (isoniazid), RIF
(rifampicin), PZA (pyrazinamide), and ethambutol. However, _M. bovis_
is inherently resistant to PZA and susceptibility testing to PZA is
not routinely performed. A 6-month, short-course anti-mycobacterial
therapy in humans depends on having PZA as part of the drug regimen;
without this drug, therapy must be prolonged beyond 6 months. Also,
MDR TB (multidrug-resistant TB) is likely to be prevalent in Nepal and
further complicate treatment in elephants and their human contacts in
this country. - Mod.ML
