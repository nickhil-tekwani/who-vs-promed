Dalian in Northwest China's Liaoning Province reported one local COVID-19 case on Wednesday [22 Jul 2020] -- a 58-year-old man working at a seafood processing company tested positive, according to a China Central Television report. The company the man works for is engaged in processing and cold storage of imported and domestic aquatic products said the report. The man lives alone and said he had not left Dalian for 14 days before the onset and had not knowingly been in contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases or people coming from key areas of concern. The man is in stable condition and has been transferred to a designated hospital for isolation and treatment.

On [10 Jul 2020], customs in Dalian found the novel coronavirus in the packaging of frozen white shrimp imported from Ecuador. China has strengthened the testing of food imports after the virus was found on a chopping board used to cut salmon at Xinfadi, a large wholesale food market in Beijing.

The confirmation that COVID-19 was spread among employees working at a seafood processing company in the coastal city of Dalian in Northeast China's Liaoning Province has had a domino effect on the city, with more than 190 000 residents preparing to receive coronavirus tests, although the source of the infection is unknown. Local seafood markets remain closed and some subway services are suspended.

On Thursday [23 Jul 2020], 2 confirmed cases and 12 asymptomatic cases were reported among close contacts of a confirmed case. The confirmation of those patients broke Dalian's record of zero COVID-19 cases for 111 days. All the new cases were working in the same area at a local seafood processing company, according to an official report. Vendors and residents reached by the Global Times said infected workers may be employees from the Dalian Kaiyang seafood company, located in the Dalian Bay area.

To curb the spread of infections, the city will provide COVID-19 tests to more than 190 000 people around the city, including 130 000 in the Dalian Bay area, and another 30 000 from 2 local communities, as well as people in regions that might have been exposed to the coronavirus, said Luo Weixing, a government official. The results of some nucleic acid tests were positive out of 1318 samples collected from the environment and food at the warehouses and 18 branch stores of the seafood company, including areas such as toilets, the cafeteria, and office buildings.

As a large comprehensive enterprise, Dalian Kaiyang's business scope includes seafood processing, research and development, sales, bonded storage, and imports and exports. The company has a storage capacity of more than 50 000 tons, including a public bonded warehouse of 30 000 tons designated by the customs authority. The company has suspended its operations and all employees are under medical observation, a government official revealed at the press conference. Dalian authorities said they had acquired detailed information related to their imported products and trading channels, and they will begin to track the source of the infection as soon as possible.

The city will send positive nucleic acid test samples to the national and provincial centers for disease control and prevention for gene sequencing, and they will make a comparison with known pathogenic genes to determine the source of the virus in Dalian. The confirmation of a COVID-19 patient could deal a blow to the seafood industry in Dalian, a coastal city that relies heavily on the seafood business, even though authorities did not reveal whether the man contracted the virus through seafood or cold-chain products.

Operations at one of the biggest local seafood markets -- Liaoyu international seafood market -- about 3.3 kilometers [about 2 mi] away from Dalian Kaiyang, were suspended on Wednesday afternoon [22 Jul 2020], an office employee told the Global Times on Thursday [23 Jul 2020].

A vendor confirmed with the Global Times that shops in the market were closed on Wednesday [22 Jul 2020] and all vendors were given COVID-19 tests. Taking up an area of about 12 000 square meters [about 129 000 sq ft], Liaoyu seafood market has around 1000 seafood stalls.

Also on Thursday [23 Jul 2020], China's State Council issued a guideline, demanding all imported meat products must be provided with a nucleic acid test certificate before coming into industrial plants for processing. The guideline is intended to strengthen the regulations on imported food products due to the spread of COVID-19 in some countries. The novel coronavirus was detected in imported seafood samples. On [3 Jul 2020] Dalian customs detected the coronavirus on the inner wall of a white shrimp container and 3 outer packaging samples of frozen white shrimps imported from Ecuador. Customs authorities have carried out COVID-19 surveillance on cold chain food from overseas nations to prevent the spread of coronavirus through imported cold chain food.

Cold chain products and seafood once again came under the public spotlight after the coronavirus was found on a chopping board that was used to cut salmon at Xinfadi market, a large wholesale food market in Beijing, in early June [2020]. "First Wuhan's Huanan seafood market; then the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing and now the patient working at seafood company, it reminds us of the risks associated with cold chain products and how easily they can spread COVID-19," Wang Guangfa, a leading respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing and member of the national medical expert team dispatched to Wuhan in early January [2020], told the Global Times on Thursday [23 Jul 2020].

The original source of the COVID-19 infection may have involved multiple channels, Wang said, noting that finding infections in many meat processing companies in foreign countries, such as the US and Romania, further backups the theory. Dalian shut down the Dalian Bay subway station on subway Line 3 on Wednesday [22 Jul 2020], where the 1st confirmed patient travels every day between his home and his company. The local government said residents should not leave the city if not necessary.

The infections caused Dalian to press the pause button again when the city was on the track of business resumption and cinema expected to open for business. Citywide recruitment activities, indoor gyms, swimming pools and cultural centers as well as cinemas are suspended from Thursday [23 Jul 2020], officials said.

[Definitely food for thought... 3 outbreaks in China (Wuhan, Beijing, and Dalian), and all 3 involve seafood markets (or a processing plant). The positive findings on imported frozen shrimp (1 inner wall of packaging the other 3 outer packaging) could have been introduced at the port of entry or prior to shipping). Genomic sequencing may help clarify the origin of the virus involved in this outbreak. In the Beijing outbreak, the contaminated cutting boards were used for cutting Danish salmon, but information on the genomic sequencing of the virus involved in the outbreak hasn't been released as yet (or perhaps I missed it...). - Mod.MPP]

[2] ACE inhibitors and ARBs and SARS-CoV-2

ref: Mackey K, Kansagara D, Vela K. Update Alert 2: Risks and impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers on SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jul 23]. Ann Intern Med. 2020; 10.7326/L20-0969. doi:10.7326/L20-0969
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this 2nd monthly update of our living review (1), we searched MEDLINE (Ovid) weekly from [9 Jun 2020] to [6 Jul 2020] using the same search strategy as described in the original review. We did not limit by language. This search update yielded 91 results (de-duplicated). After an independent dual-review process, we identified 3 new meta-analyses, 5 new observational studies, and one in-progress trial for inclusion.

New evidence
------------
Results of 3 new meta-analyses (2-4) evaluating the association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) use with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness severity are consistent with the findings that we reported in the original manuscript. 5 new observational studies also examine this association. 4 of these studies found that the use of ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (5-8). In a retrospective study of 113 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Turkey, the use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (9). However, a major limitation of the study is that the group of patients taking ACEI/ARBs were older and more likely to have coronary artery disease than the non-ACEI/ARB group.

Overall, the inclusion of these 3 new meta-analyses and 5 new observational studies does not change the certainty of evidence rating we reported in the original manuscript for key question 2 -- high-certainty evidence that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease.

In-progress trials
------------------
We identified one randomized controlled trial that is currently in progress in the Netherlands comparing ARB therapy (valsartan) with placebo on intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 (10). The estimated study completion date is December 2021.

[A pity that the one randomized controlled trial ongoing in the Netherlands will not be completed before December 2021. The meta-analyses are of interest, and the observational studies while highly suggestive, do not definitively prove that there is no impact on disease presentation of those individuals taking either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is virtually unchanged from the preceding period, but the average number of daily reported deaths increased by 17.4%, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country. While seemingly plateauing on the national level, the mortality continues.

I suspect there may be a change in reporting criteria as the testing positivity rate is now 10%, and increase from 9% over the past few weeks, consistent with an as yet uncontrolled pandemic in the USA.

According to CDC data, as of 23 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remained at 10% out of 52 942 145 tests performed as of 23 Jul 2020, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 23 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- In a joint effort to enhance research and development related to the use of traditional medicines for COVID-19 in Africa, the WHO Regional Office for Africa and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) have launched an expert advisory committee to provide independent scientific advice and support to countries on the safety, efficacy, and quality of traditional medicine therapies.

- WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr Hans Henri P Kluge has signed an agreement for a new centre of excellence and visited Gaziantep, marking 60 years of cooperation with Turkey. Dr Kluge and Dr Fahrettin Koca, Turkey's Minister of Health, also discussed Turkey's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as improving the pandemic situation in Turkey with the country's Scientific Advisory Board for COVID-19.

- The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is one of the few countries where there have not been any COVID-19 cases reported. Since early January, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific has been working with the government and partners to support FSM to prepare for COVID-19 with a special focus on empowering local communities.

- WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, and the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, have jointly launched an initiative called COVID-19 Law Lab. The COVID-19 Law Lab gathers and shares legal documents related to COVID-19 from over 190 countries across the world to help countries establish and implement strong legal frameworks to manage the pandemic.

- Today [23 Jul 2020], we include 2 reports in the 'Subject in Focus'. The 1st provides information on the 'Working group on SARS-COV-2 genetic sequence evolution'. The 2nd provides an update on the 'COVID-19 Supply chain system'.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 55.6% of the global newly reported cases and 58.5% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 7.9 million cases. The USA reported 45.8% (62 929) cases, Brazil 29.8% (41 008), Colombia 5.1% (7033), Mexico 5.0% (6859), Argentina 3.9% (5344), Peru 3.2% (4406), and Chile 1.3% (1819).

- The European region reported 9.2% of the global newly reported cases and 7.1% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 25.5% (5848) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Israel 8.7% (1988), Kazakhstan 7.2% (1646), Spain 5.9% (1357), Romania 4.5% (1030), Kyrgyzstan 4.2% (967), France 4.1% (945), Turkey 4.0% (902), and Ukraine 3.8% (856). Spain's 14 day population based incidence rate has gone from a low of 7.74 per 100 000 population on 25 Jun 2020 to 34.90 today (23 Jul 2020), continuing to increase on a daily basis (daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_169_COVID-19.pdf) and Italy has increased its 7 day average by 16.8% (see section [3][C] above).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.9% of the global newly reported cases and 6.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 18.5% (2706) of the regional newly reported cases, Iran reported 17.7% (2586), followed by Saudi Arabia 15.9% (2331), Pakistan 12.1% (1763), Oman 11.4% (1660), Kuwait 5.1% (751), Egypt 4.6% (667), Qatar 3.0% (441), Palestinian Authority 2.4% (356), and Bahrain 2.2% (321). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020, while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq and Oman. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 7.5% of the global newly reported cases and 8.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 70.9% (13 150) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 3.7% (683), Kenya 3.4% (637), Madagascar 3.3% (614), Algeria 3.2% (594), Nigeria 2.9% (543), and Ethiopia 2.4% (452). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000 14 of the 22 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.13% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 46.6% (1505) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 22.4% (726), Australia 14.5% (468), Singapore 9.6% (310), China 4.2% (135), and South Korea 1.8% (59). Japan has been steadily increasing daily case counts over the past week.

- The South East Asia region reported 20.4% of the global newly reported cases and 18.5% of global deaths. India reported 90.5% (45 720) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.4% (2744) and Indonesia 3.7% (1882). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. The progression has been the initial "surge" in the Western Pacific region, followed by the surge in the European region and its decline; the entry and surging of the Americas region without any decrease, and the gradual and persistent increase in the South East Asia region; the increase then plateauing of the Eastern Mediterranean region, the slow but steady increase in the Africa region, and a slight increase in the Western Pacific region.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 15 650 482, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (69 116) followed by Brazil (58 080) and India (48 446). The total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa) represent over half of the total cases reported globally (57.2%). A global total of 636 385 deaths have been reported, an increase of 6247 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Russia, Peru, and Bangladesh. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2856 to 69 116.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 9.3% and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 23.9%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
