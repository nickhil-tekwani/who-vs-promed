[1] New Zealand apples banned while committee investigates fireblight

A Senate Committee has sided with fruit growers in Victoria's Goulburn
Valley who are concerned about the spread of disease if New Zealand apples
are allowed into Australia.
The Rural Affairs Committee has tabled its report into the decision by the
Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) to lift the import ban. In
the report, the committee says it was not convinced by AQIS's argument that
diseases like fireblight would come into Australia but not spread.
The committee also states concerns that AQIS ignored scientific evidence
during an appeal against the decision by the fruit industry.
The committee has asked that no New Zealand apple imports go ahead until it
makes a final determination.

[2] Fear fireblight will kill orchard business

Michael Nicol fears his family's 5-generation apple growing business in the
Adelaide Hills will be wiped out by the entry of New Zealand apples into
the country. He believes the arrival of NZ apples on to Australian fruit
shop shelves within 2 years will bring with it the dreaded fireblight, a
[bacterial disease] described as the foot and mouth disease of the apple
and pear industry. "I think the odds are very high that we will get
fireblight and that it will infect our industry. I would think a minimum of
30 and up to 50 per cent of growers would be forced out by the disease."
Quarantine authorities Biosecurity Australia and AQIS have told the Senate
rural committee there is a very low risk fireblight will come into
Australia if the importation goes ahead as they recommended in March
[2007]. But last week [7-13 May 2007], the Senate's rural committee told
federal quarantine officers their assessment failed the commonsense test.
Apple and Pear Growers Association of South Australia (SA) general manager,
Trevor Ranford, said the industry would utilise whatever mechanisms to stop
or slow the process, including a legal challenge.
Mr Nicol, president of the Apple and Pears Growers Association of South
Australia, said his apple orchard was at grave risk from fireblight because
it is close to Adelaide and attracts a lot of tourists. He predicted a lot
of orchards would disappear. The SA industry is worth between AUD 40
million and AUD 50 million (USD 30.9-42.4 million) at the farmgate.

[3] New Zealand apple import decision defies 'commonsense test'

The head of the Senate's rural affairs committee says a decision to allow
apple imports from New Zealand defies the "commonsense test". Senator Bill
Heffernan made the comments as quarantine officers and unhappy apple
growers gave evidence to the committee last night [9 May 2007].
Quarantine officials admitted there is still a very low risk that the
disease fireblight will enter Australia if imports go ahead. Labor
spokesman for primary industries, senator Kerry O'Brien, says the decision
needs a rethink because officials also admitted there will be no foolproof
test for making sure quarantine protocols have been met.
"What we're told is that it's assumed that fireblight will be in the
orchards, that the time it might get on to the apples to come into this
country later in the growing period would be dealt with by chlorine
dipping," he said. "If we can't be absolutely certain that the dipping has
occurred, then it's possible that one of the aspects of the proposed
protocol would not be met."

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_. _Erwinia_ is a
plant-pathogenic genus that includes a number of species affecting
vegetable and fruit crops. Fireblight was 1st reported from the state of
New York (USA) and is now widely distributed in northern America, Europe,
small areas of western Asia, and is also endemic to New Zealand. The
disease derived its name from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as
if they were scorched by fire.
Affected shoots bend forming black hooks, cankers appear on branches and
trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria are highly infectious and
are spread by insects (aphids, flies, bees etc), wind, water, and
mechanical means entering the host plant through wounds, often on flowers.
Many varieties of pear and apple trees are susceptible although some less
than others. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are
susceptible, including quince, ornamental roses, hawthorn, and firethorn.
_E. amylovora_ was found in _Cotoneaster_ shrubs in both Adelaide and
Melbourne botanical gardens in 1997. The origin of these bacteria is not
known and the infections were successfully eradicated. Local and national
surveys of both orchards and ornamental garden plants did not identify any
further cases.
The importation of plant material, including fruit, from any country with
endemic fireblight would, over time, almost certainly lead to the
establishment of the pathogen in Australia. This would cause enormous costs
to the industry and the national economy for eradication attempts and due
to the loss of Australia's fireblight-free status, which would prohibit
valuable exports to Asian countries including Japan. It would be sheer
madness to prioritise short term political considerations over the long
term future of an important agricultural industry.
