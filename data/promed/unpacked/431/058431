[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 47. The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on Tuesday (19 Jul 2022) to 294 cases on 30 Jul 2022. Interestingly, these 294 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome. AES is not mentioned above, so all the cases are attributed to JE. There is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state. The current JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
