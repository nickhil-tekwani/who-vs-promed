An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 has

[The first case of H5N1 in Denmark was detected in a common buzzard in the
southern part of the country at Svino on 14 Mar 2006. Until now, all the
avian influenza cases have been in wild birds, but here a backyard flock of
51 chickens, 41 ducks, 5 geese, 3 guinea fowls and 2 peacocks became
infected -- 47 of the birds died and the remaining 55 animals were killed
in a stamping-out program. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration
website cited above provides a very detailed description of avian influenza
in Denmark to date. It is of note that several "protection and
surveillance" zones have been lifted since the 21 Apr 2006. For the general
location of the backyard flock, see map at
