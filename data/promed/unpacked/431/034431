Tests for the equine herpes virus (EHV-1) performed on 35 horses stabled in
a Churchill Downs barn placed under a Kentucky Department of Agriculture
quarantine have returned results that show no trace of the illness in any
of those horses.

A total of 2 tests were performed on each of the horses in Barn 47 -- a
nasal swab test and a blood test -- and negative results were returned on
all of those horses. The barn, which houses 19 horses trained by David
Carroll and 16 under the care of trainer Al Stall Jr., remains under
quarantine. Biosecurity measures are in place at the barn and no horses
were allowed in or out of that structure on Saturday [27 Oct 2007] for a
2nd consecutive day.

The quarantine order was issued after a 3 year old thoroughbred trained by
Carroll was found late on Thursday [25 Oct 2007] to be infected with EHV-1.
That horse had been moved from the barn to an equine hospital after he
started to display suspicious symptoms at the barn early in the day on
Thursday [25 Oct 2007].

Rusty Ford, the equine programs manager for the office of Kentucky state
veterinarian Dr Robert Stout, said the quarantine of Barn 47 would remain
under quarantine, but he said the negative results were encouraging and the
status of the horses in that barn would be closely evaluated in the coming
days. "All of the horses were eating and everything looks good," Ford said.
"The test results reaffirmed our suspicion that the infected horse carried
a low level of the infection in his body and that made him a lesser risk to
transmit the virus to other horses. We remain optimistic that the presence
of the virus in that barn was caught very early, which would be good news
for our efforts to contain the virus to infected horse and this barn."

Policies and procedures designed to limit the introduction and spread of
equine herpes remain in place at Churchill Downs as the track prepared to
open its 21-day Fall Meet on Sunday [4 Nov 2007]. All horses who enter and
depart from the track's stable area are required to present a veterinary
certificate of health that certifies that the horse has been healthy for
the previous 72 hours. Horses who ship in to compete in Churchill Downs
races are required to stable in either the receiving or stakes barns, and
those barns -- along with the starting gate, paddock, and equipment used by
outriders and the track's horse identifier -- will be regularly disinfected.

"The policies and precautions implemented by Churchill Downs -- including
the requirement for the certification of health for horses that enter the
track's stable area -- remain significant factors in preventing the
introduction and transmission of the equine herpes virus and other
illnesses," Ford said. "Horsemen at the track and their veterinarians have
been vigilant in monitoring the condition of their horses and in working to
notify our department immediately when suspicious symptoms and other
concerns arise. That was the case again in this instance and it led to a
very early discovery of what is, so far, a single case of equine herpes in
the quarantined barn."

Symptoms of equine herpes virus most commonly include fever and an upper
respiratory infection. The symptoms can also include lethargy, loss of
appetite, a nasal discharge, and a cough. In severe cases, horses can
suffer a loss of coordination and an inability to stand and the illness can
be fatal.

[It is good that these early tests show the horse that was initially
contaminated has not spread the disease yet. Continuing vigilance in
biosecurity and quarantine appear to be the key factors in limiting the
spread of disease at Churchill Downs. - Mod.PC
