[Guizhou Province is approximately 500 kilometers north of Guangxi,
which is geographically close to the Mekong region, approximately 250
kilometers northeast of the Viet Nam border. Since foot and mouth
disease (FMD) is one of the most difficult animal disease to control.
Early warning of disease outbreaks would help to minimize chances of
FMD spreading in the region.

To minimize the chances of FMD spreading, risk communication, animal
containment and import control, including quarantine, are the 1st line
of defense. An appropriate level of resources should be reserved to
ensure that effective border and import quarantine policies and
programs to prevent introduction of FMD in the region can be
implemented effectively.

Regarding the FMD outbreak in Guizhou, FMD serotype O affected 87 of
252 cattle and 4 of 421 pigs. As a result of control measures 240
cattle, 7 sheep and goats, and 419 pigs were destroyed. The source of
the outbreak or origin of infection are unknown or inconclusive.

A map showing the location of the outbreaks is included in the OIE
report and can be seen at the source URL above. For a map of China
with provinces, see

[In the OIE WAHID database, 14 outbreaks in widely disparate areas of
the country were reported between 22 Feb 2010 and June 2010. Since
June 2010 there have been 7 other outbreaks of FMD serotype O
including this one and they have ranged from Xinjiang to Tibet and now
Guizhou. Clearly, this is not the kind of epidemiologic situation we
like to see as new outbreaks tick over on a periodic basis and cover a
long time period. Changes or additions in the control tactics may be
indicated. - Mod.PC]
