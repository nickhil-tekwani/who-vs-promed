More than 250 dengue fever cases had been diagnosed in the city's [Da
Nang] hospitals during the past 2 weeks, raising the total cases to
about 3000 since early this year [2010], a 6-fold increase over the
same period last year [2009]. A report from Da Nang General Hospital
shows that the facility receives between 20 and 30 patients per day,
which has forced people to share the limited number of beds available
at the facility. About 80 percent of the patients have been young
adults and children, and 150 patients are in serious condition, the
Municipal Preventive Health Centre said.

According to the 154th Epidemiological Alert issued by the Network of
Venezuelan Scientific Medical Societies, the cases of dengue have
continued to occur throughout the country. Based on unofficial
reports, "until the 39th week, which ended on 2 Oct [2010], the
cumulative number of dengue cases amounted to 97 000, while more than
72 patients have died."

Until 25 Sep [2010], there were 94 289 cases, according to official
data. This amount represents 3 times the number of cases reported in
the same period of 2009 and "the highest in the country ever since
health records started to be kept by the government."

An important number of cases (59 967), which represents 64 percent of
the total, were reported in 7 Venezuelan states, namely Miranda,
Zulia, Merida, Tachira, Lara, Aragua, and the Capital District.
Miranda ranks 1st with 12 628 cases (13 percent of the total). 9
Venezuelan states are still affected by the epidemics and the number
of cases has increased in 10 states. For every 13 cases of dengue,
there is a case of DHF.

[This is reported as the worst dengue epidemic recorded in Venezuela.
A previous report indicated that all 4 dengue viruses (1,2,3, and 4)
are circulating, but there is no indication which one(s) is (are) most
prevalent currently. It would be of interest to know what preventive
measures are being taken.
