In late September 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) notified the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) that a case of bovine TB had been detected in a cow from Alberta when it was slaughtered in the United States. The CFIA has initiated an investigation into the case and is working with provincial agriculture and health authorities.

Based on the current epidemiological information, CFIA veterinarians and inspectors will be making contact with cattle producers in the following areas:
- Newell County
- Special Area No. 2
- Special Area No. 3
- Acadia No. 34
- Cypress County (North of Medicine Hat)

Tracing work is currently underway to identify animals that may have been exposed to bovine TB at individual premises and/or the Buffalo-Atlee and Suffield Block community pastures.

As additional information about the movement of potentially exposed animals is gathered, the CFIA investigation may involve additional locations and individual farms. [Go to the CFIA website to read the following. - Mod.MHJ]
- Notification to industry
- Farm visits in southeast Alberta during the current investigation

Movement of cattle and other animals
-------------------------
Only premises that have been placed under quarantine by the CFIA are prevented from moving animals without permission. Producers in the general investigation area that have not been contacted by the CFIA are allowed to move animals (including sending cattle to auction markets and feed lots) but must comply with livestock identification requirements. [Go to CFIA website to read the following. - Mod.MHJ]
- Livestock identification and traceability

Premises that are under quarantine must not move any animals without permission from the CFIA.

Quarantine and testing
----------------
As the disease investigation proceeds, additional premises may need to be quarantined while cattle are tested for bovine TB. The CFIA has prepared information for producers who are contacted in the course of a disease investigation. [Go to CFIA website to read the following. - Mod.MHJ]
- What to expect if your farm is under investigation

Additional information and guidance from CFIA staff will be provided to individual producers if their animals are required to be quarantined. Testing is completed as quickly as possible. Quarantines remain in effect until all susceptible animals have tested negative for the disease.

If an animal under quarantine tests positive for bovine TB, the CFIA will follow established procedures for destruction and compensation. [Go to CFIA website to read the following. - Mod.MHJ]
- What to expect if your animals are infected
- Animal Health Compensation
- What to expect when an animal is ordered destroyed

The CFIA investigation does not include testing of wildlife for bovine TB. Disease management in wildlife is under provincial jurisdiction.

Additional information
--------------------
Producers whose animals are under quarantine and subject to movement controls will be contacted by local CFIA staff who will respond to specific questions about individual situations. General questions about bovine TB or the current investigation will be managed by email.

"The investigation is ongoing, and it is not yet known how many animals will require testing," said agency spokesman Denis Schryburt in an email. The number of animals requiring testing will depend on a number of factors such as whether additional animals test positive and the movements of exposed animals to other locations." The quarantine means that animals must remain on the ranch unless they are moved directly to an inspected slaughter facility, said Schryburt.

Bob Lowe, chair of the Alberta Beef Producers, said ranches under quarantine could face additional costs of housing and feeding their livestock as winter sets in, instead of selling the animals. "As far as the Canadian cattle industry is concerned, it's not a problem at all. It's not a border issue, it's not affecting markets," he said. "But if you're one of the producers that's quarantined, it's devastating."

If any infected cattle are found, the entire herd would have to be destroyed, he added. [CFIA rules state that infected and "exposed susceptible" stock must be destroyed. See [1] above. - Mod.MHJ]

I was at an Alberta Beef Producer regional meeting in Fort Macleod last week, and their biggest issue at the moment is they feel CFIA is moving too slowly. A comment was made that you can't test calves for TB until they're 13 months of age. The ranchers' main concern is that the calves cannot be sold but the feed supply is not sufficient to continue to feed them, but without selling the calves the ranchers don't have the cash to purchase hay. There will be welfare issues soon if CFIA does not move fast, as there are 30 ranches under quarantine and all with fall calves at foot.

[A fraught situation in southern Alberta and the ranchers concerns with perceived un-extracted bureaucratic digits. And this year's [2016] calves cannot be sold until the testing is complete; exactly when this would be is affected by the minimum age when calves may be tested. The CFIA site does not mention a minimum age for animal testing of 13 months. This year's calves are presently half that age. - Mod.MHJ
