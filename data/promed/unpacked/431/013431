Cluster of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections at a recreational park in
Georgia
This message is being sent to inform you about a recent cluster of
Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in children associated with attendance
at a water recreational park in Marietta, Georgia. This large park attracts
many out-of-state visitors.
On June 24, the Georgia Division of Public Health issued a press release
reporting that seven cases of E. coli O157:H7 infection in children were
reported between June 17 and June 23; five children developed hemolytic
uremic syndrome. Six of the seven patients attended White Water
Recreational Park in Marietta, Georgia on June 11 or June 12.
Specifically, all six played in pools reserved for small children,
including the "Captain Kids Cove." No other common link among the ill
children was identified. Currently, nine additional cases of diarrhea in
Georgia residents who visited the park on June 11 or 12 are under
investigation.
Confirmed E. coli O157:H7 cases have been reported in two children from
Tennessee who visited the park on June 11. Seven other possible cases in
residents from states other than Georgia who visited the park through June
15 are under investigation.
The Georgia Division of Public Health is interested in receiving reports of
patients in your state with E. coli O157:H7 infection who may have visited
White Water Recreational Park in Marietta, Georgia during the month of
June. We suggest that all persons with E. coli O157:H7 infection in your
state who became ill during June be interviewed about this possible
exposure. Please contact the epidemiologist on call at the Georgia Division
of Public Health [Telephone: (404) 657 2588; e-mail
<lxb0600@dhr.state.ga.us>] to report such cases.
We also request that state health departments who learn of patients with E.
coli O157:H7 infection who report having visited this park in June arrange
for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping of isolates from
these patients. To facilitate rapid analysis, we wish to compare these
patterns electronically through the PulseNet network. Please arrange for
PFGE subtyping of these isolates at your state laboratory (if a PulseNet
participant) or at your PulseNet regional laboratory. Alternatively,
isolates can be forwarded to the Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch
Laboratory (please contact Dr. Timothy Barrett, at 404-639-3334 to arrange
for shipment of isolates).
