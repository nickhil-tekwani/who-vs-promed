The Department of Health office in Bukidnon reported the emergence of
heterophyiasis, an emerging disease in the province seen to be worse
than schistosomiasis. [Bukidnon is a landlocked province on the
island of Mindanao.

Heterophyiasis, according to Dr. Vincent C. Raguro in a statement
given to MindaNews, is an infection of the small intestines caused by
intestinal flukes [acquired] by eating raw or "insufficiently" cooked
fish. He said the disease is endemic in 59 barangays from 10
municipalities and 2 cities in the province.
As of August 2006, the DOH identified 592 individuals who turned out
to be positive of the disease out of the 2739 examined in the endemic
areas. "But the real situation is yet to be determined," Raguro said
in a statement, adding that what they are seeing is just the "tip of
the iceberg."
Treatment officer Nestor Sotelo said they are constrained by lack of
funds for fuel and other operating expenses to conduct tests all over
the province. He said they have so far monitored only 2 cases out of
the 3 fatalities this year, in San Jose in Malaybalay City and in New
Kidapawan in Kibawe.
Ingestion of insufficiently cooked or raw fish is the only [way to
acquire] heterophyiasis, according to the DOH. Adult worms and eggs
of the intestinal flukes thrive in the intestines and will also
spread to other organs like the brain, spinal cord, and the heart.
The DOH statement said those infected suffer from upper abdominal
discomfort or pain, gurgling abdomen, colicky abdominal pain, and
diarrhea. Tissue reactions may lead to cardiac arrest for those with
heart problems and also cause intra-cerebral hemorrhage in the brain.
The statement said if it reaches the spinal cord, the disease may
result in loss of motor and sensory functions where lesions are
located. The DOH said diagnosis may be clinical due to similarity
with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and acid peptic disease (ACD),
history of bowel disturbance and consumption of raw or improperly cooked fish.
Sotelo said definitive tests could only be done in the laboratory to
check parasite eggs using fecal or stool analysis. Sotelo said the
disease is even more dangerous because, unlike schistosomiasis, which
[may be contracted] through skin contact with unsanitary areas, the
general public is at risk with the disease. "Because infection is
through eating raw fish, it could infect anyone. If somebody eats
uncooked fish that became host to the fluke, he could also be
infected," he said.
Sotelo identified fish from both pond and brackish water or estuarine
waters as susceptible to become hosts to the fluke. He said among the
long list is bangus, tilapia, "mol-mol", kitong, lapu-lapu and hito.
He also warned [that] those who eat farmed frogs [are also] at risk.
Sotelo said those who tested positive could [be given medication to
cure] schistosomiasis. He warned those who have the lifestyle of
eating raw fish to take the test in health centers. The DOH advised
proper or thorough cooking of fish as preventive measure.
They have also called for control measures, calling local health
authorities to educate the population regarding proper eating habits.
They also called for the banning of fish pond seeding using human and
animal waste. The DOH also warned of feeding fish [scraps] and [of
giving] water used to clean fish to animals like dogs, cats, poultry and hogs.
On 29 Sep 2006, medical technologists around Bukidnon will meet to
study the disease. But Sotelo said the disease is not limited to
Bukidnon. He said they have learned from experiences shared by health
authorities in Davao City.

[Heterophyiasis is an infection of the small bowel by minute
intestinal flukes of the genus Heterophyes or related members of the
family Heterophyidae. A stool survey conducted in Monkayo, Compostela
Valley, the Philippines found that 36 percent of patients with
history of bowel disturbance (abdominal discomfort/pain and/or
diarrhea) in the past 4 weeks were found to have heterophyidiasis.
All age groups were infected, with the youngest patient being 1 year
7 months of age, while the oldest patient was 73 years of age.
Prevalence was highest in the age group 15-30 years at 55.3 percent
(Belizario et al. Intestinal heterophyidiasis: an emerging food-borne
parasitic zoonosis in southern Philippines. Southeast Asian J Trop
Med Public Health. 2001;32 Suppl 2:36-42). The main symptoms are
intestinal, but occasionally the eggs may migrate to the heart,
resulting in potentially fatal myocardial and valvular damage, and to
other organs (e.g., brain).
A description of the lifecycle is found at
<http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/heterophyiasis.htm>.
Fish that live in fresh or brackish water are the 2nd intermediary
host, and the information in the posting that frogs may serve as
intermediate host is most probably wrong. There is no risk of
infection from saltwater fish, and infection can be prevented by
cooking fish adequately. - Mod.EP]
