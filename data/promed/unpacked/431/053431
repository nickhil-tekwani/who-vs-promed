Re: Merritt Clifton's Comment On Equine Rabies Immune Globulins
---------------------------------------------------------------
Though I have no first-hand knowledge of animal rights activists' protests
against the use of horses for plasma donations, I have personally heard
self-proclaimed animal rights activists protesting equine sources of
conjugated estrogens. A quick search of the web for "Animal People" found
evidence of organized protest against Premarin (equine-derived estrogen) by
animal rights groups. I do not doubt that there have been protests against
the collection of horse plasma for immune globulins.
