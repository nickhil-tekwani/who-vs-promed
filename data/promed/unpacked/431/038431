The College of Veterinarians urges [members] to ensure vaccination of animals, and to be alert to the possible emergence of bats that may be infected with the virus.

In a report by the Functional Zoonoses Group of the Surveillance and Control in Public Health Branch presented to the National Institute of Health professionals in Colombia, they confirmed 3 cases of fatal rabies virus variant 4 corresponding to the cycle of bats-cats-humans. The Province of Buenos Aires College of Veterinary Surgeons emphasized the consequences of human and animal rabies and urged its members to take preventive measures.

Rabies is a viral zoonosis that can affect mammals, both domestic and wild animals, including humans. There are currently 8 variants of rabies virus known, from which the most common in our country [Colombia] and worldwide is canine rabies: the dog passes the virus to humans.

Disease transmission occurs mainly by the spread of the virus through contact with a rabies-infected animal's saliva, mainly by bites and more rarely through scratching or licking of scratches.

Fatal cases in Colombia confirmed the possibility of human infection with variant 4 virus, called "bat variant," which raised the possibility of transmission from bats to cats and then to humans, a possibility in which there may be data from reports but no prior confirmation of this variant cycle.

[The college is obviously observing some early trends with rabies circulation, and this should serve as a warning to veterinarians and animal owners to be alert for the signs of rabies.

"Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses in the Rhabdovirus family. Lyssaviruses are usually confined to one major reservoir species in a given geographical area, although spillover to other species is common. Identification of different virus variants by laboratory procedures such as monoclonal antibody analysis or genetic sequencing has greatly enhanced understanding of rabies epidemiology. Generally, each virus variant is responsible for rabies virus transmission between members of the same species in a given geographic area.

"From an epidemiologic perspective, it is common to use the name of the species acting as the reservoir and vector as an adjective. For example, rabies maintained by dog-to-dog transmission is termed canine rabies, whereas rabies in a dog as a result of infection with a variant from a different reservoir animal, e.g. skunk (or fox), would be referred to as skunk (or fox, etc.) rabies in a dog.

"In North America, distinct virus variants are responsible for rabies in red and Arctic foxes in Canada and Alaska, raccoons along the eastern seaboard, gray foxes in Texas, and a closely related variant in gray foxes in the southwestern USA. Two different variants are responsible for rabies in striped skunks, one in the south central states and the other in the north central states. Another skunk rabies virus variant is found in California. The epidemiology of rabies in bats is complex. In general, each variant found in bats may be characterized with a predominant bat species. Spillover from bats to terrestrial animals is seen infrequently. Most human cases of rabies in the USA in the past decade have been caused by bat rabies virus variants (especially viruses associated with _Lasionycteris noctivagans_, the silver-haired bat, and _Perimyotis subflavus_, the tricolored bat).

"Reservoirs of rabies vary throughout the world. Canine rabies predominates in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. In North America and Europe, where canine rabies has been eliminated, rabies is maintained in wildlife.

"For many years, skunks were the most commonly reported rabid animal in the USA, but since 1990, rabid raccoons have been the most numerous. Canine rabies became established in dogs and coyotes (_Canis latrans_) in southern Texas but was eliminated. Canine rabies persists in Mexico, with the potential to spread throughout the USA if reintroduced. Skunk, raccoon, and fox rabies are each found in fairly distinct geographical regions of North America, although some overlap occurs. Bat rabies is distributed throughout the Americas. The vampire bat is an important reservoir in Latin America and is the source of multiple outbreaks in cattle, as well as in humans, particularly in parts of Amazonia.

"In Europe, red fox rabies predominated before its elimination by oral vaccination. In parts of eastern Europe, rabies in raccoon dogs is of increasing concern. Rabies in insectivorous bats may be widely distributed in Europe.

"Other wild species play an important role in the transmission of rabies in certain areas, including mongooses in the Caribbean, southern Africa, and parts of Asia; jackals in parts of Africa; and wolves in parts of northern Europe.

"All rabies reservoirs are also vectors of the virus, but not all vectors are reservoirs. For example, cats can effectively transmit the virus, but no cat-to-cat transmission of rabies persists, and no unique feline rabies virus variant has been documented. However, cats are the most commonly reported rabid domestic animal in the USA. Virus is present in the saliva of rabid cats, and people have developed rabies after being bitten by rabid cats. Reported cases in domestic cats have outnumbered those in dogs in the USA every year since 1990." (see http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/nervous_system/rabies/overview_of_rabies.html.) - Mod.TG
