A food handler at a Gloucester Township Starbucks has tested positive for hepatitis A and worked during the infectious period, officials say. The affected store is at 1490 Blackwood Clementon Road. The worker was on duty 4-6 and 11-13 Nov 2021. Any customer who was there on those days is being urged to get vaccinated.

"The county health department has been working closely with the patient and the staff at the Starbucks to address the situation," Camden County Health Officer Paschal Nwako said. "Our highest priority is ensuring everyone involved remains safe and healthy. The patient is not currently working, and close contacts have been identified. We encourage anyone who may believe they were exposed to get vaccinated against hepatitis A by calling the county health department or your primary care physician."

The Camden County Department of Health is setting up a vaccine clinic for those affected, which will take place Friday and Saturday [19-20 Nov 2021].

[A 2020 CDC report (citation, text, and references follow) provided information to support not routinely immunizing food handlers against hepatitis A virus (HAV). While focusing on high-risk groups for HAV is certainly more cost effective, those groups are difficult to access for HAV immunization. Essentially any day, one can search the internet for hepatitis A and find reports of HAV infection in a food handler.

Hofmeister MG, Foster MA, Montgomery MP, et al. Notes from the field: assessing the role of food handlers in hepatitis A virus transmission, multiple states, 2016-2019. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020; 69(20): 636-7; http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6920a4

"The United States is experiencing person-to-person outbreaks of hepatitis A in unprecedented numbers during the vaccine era (1). As of May 2020, 33 states had reported hepatitis A outbreaks involving approximately 32 500 cases, 19 800 (61%) hospitalizations, and 320 deaths since 2016 (1). These infections are spreading primarily through close contact among persons who use drugs and persons experiencing homelessness, as well as among men who have sex with men (MSM) (2).

"During these outbreaks, hepatitis A infections occurring among food handlers have raised public alarm and resulted in calls for vaccinating all food handlers, often prompting health departments to divert limited resources away from populations at risk. However, the risk for secondary transmission from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons is not well understood. To characterize this risk, a novel, structured survey was developed and conducted using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (version 9.5.13; Vanderbilt University); among 30 state health departments reporting person-to-person hepatitis A outbreaks during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 29 states responded (3,4).

"[A total of] 26 states (89.7%) submitted complete information regarding secondary transmission events associated with food handlers (Table [see citation URL for table - Mod.LL]). Among 22 825 hepatitis A outbreak cases reported from these 26 states during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 871 (3.8%) were among food handlers; 587 (67.4%) hepatitis A-infected food handlers reported one or more risk factors (i.e., drug use, unstable housing, or homelessness, MSM, or incarceration) during the 15-50 days before symptom onset. Associated with these 871 hepatitis A-infected food handlers were 8 (0.9%) secondary transmission events (Table), which resulted in 57 secondary cases.

"Of 29 states, 18 (62.1%) submitted complete information for public health response activities related to hepatitis A-infected food handlers. Among 275 cases in food handlers from these 18 states, 271 (98.5%) investigations and 63 (22.9%) public notifications took place.

"Ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks have been prolonged and costly to control (5). These study findings indicate that the risk for secondary infection from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons in these outbreaks is low (less than 1.0%). Therefore, public health efforts to preemptively vaccinate all food handlers would be ineffective at mitigating the current risk for person-to-person outbreaks. To optimize resources, health departments should assess the risk for secondary transmission of hepatitis A from infected food handlers on a case-by-case basis and prioritize vaccination efforts in situations where secondary transmission risk is deemed high (6).

"Approximately two-thirds of the hepatitis A-infected food handlers in this survey reported risk factors commonly associated with the current person-to-person outbreaks. This underscores the importance of vaccination strategies targeting the populations at highest risk (i.e., persons who use drugs, persons experiencing unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, and persons who are or were recently incarcerated) as the cornerstone of an effective public health response."

It is likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case here was un-immunized, and any cluster of secondary cases could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019 and this year's (2021) outbreak in Virginia of more than 50 cases with 3 deaths related to a food handler bear witness to the fact that while the risk of HAV in food handlers may not be high, if infected the food handler represents a real risk to those eating in the restaurant. If such cases occur, the public relations and financial damage to the restaurant could be very significant. Although vaccine mandates in today's world are problematic, restaurant-associated food handler-related outbreaks of HAV are preventable.

Spillover of HAV from the current large multistate epidemic involving the homeless and/or substance-abusing populations into food handlers certainly likely occurs.

As of 12 Nov 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm), since the hepatitis A outbreaks were first identified in 2016, 36 states have publicly reported the following:

Cases: 42 920
Hospitalizations: 26 141 (61%)
Deaths: 402
