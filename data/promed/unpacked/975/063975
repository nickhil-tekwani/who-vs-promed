Epidemiological comments Between 27 Dec 2007 and 4 Jan 2008 3 swans
were found in Abbotsbury Swannery and the vicinity in the Chesil
Beach area in Dorset. Preliminary reports suggest that 2 of the swans
were still alive when found but were euthanised due to injuries.

According to EU and national legislations wild bird control and
monitoring areas are now set up. The boundaries of these areas are
set with reference to the places where the birds were found, while
also taking into account the location of local bird reserves and the
presence of wild bird populations along the Dorset coastline towards
Portland Bill. The boundary of the control area is set at 3 km [1.86
miles] from the relevant points where the birds were found; the
monitoring area at 10 km [6.2 miles].

No evidence of disease has been found in domestic birds.
Epidemiological inquiry is underway.

[The comments of Moderators MHJ/AS in "Avian influenza (171): Saudi
Arabia, UK (England) 20071114.3701" point us to an interesting
"epi-curve" of wild bird H5N1 cases. The summary of cases reported
through the ADNS system indicates 308 wild bird cases in 2007 as of
26 Dec 2007. The vast majority of the wild bird cases reported were
from Germany and clustered around a peak week in July 2007 where 171
cases were reported. There were none reported last year in from
January to May 2007, so these new cases may be noteable -- especially
if there is any sustained rise in the number of cases during this
winter season.

The location, midway between Exeter and Bournemouth, can be seen in
the original reported referenced above or at
