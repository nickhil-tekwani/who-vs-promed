It's important to remember that this vaccine is still under "investigation",
meaning it is not an approved product, and therefore is not considered to be
safe and efficacious for widespread use.
The IND (Investigational New Drug) process allows the manufacturer to
complete the required clinical efficacy and safety studies in order to
achieve registration of the product. Therefore, the product must be
administered under the direction of the study director, following an agreed
upon (by the FDA) protocol.
The people receiving the vaccine are volunteers and must be made aware if
it's experimental nature before agreeing to be vaccinated. The paperwork,
protocol and oversight of the study director are to ensure the safety of the
test subjects (people!) during the experimental use of an unlicensed product
and that they gave an informed consent to be a volunteer.
If an unapproved product were to be used widely, and some people became ill
(or died!), all you-know-what would break loose! Instead we have people
complaining about having to jump through hoops because they just can't go to
the local physician and receive a shot! Can't have it both ways!!
