Avian influenza in the Netherlands
----------------------------------
Outbreaks of a of highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus A
(H7N7) have been reported in various poultry farms in the Netherlands since
February 2003. Recent cases of the disease in poultry have also been
reported in Belgium.
While avian influenza strains normally infect exclusively poultry, Dutch
authorities have reported that the H7N7 strain has now jumped the species
barrier, causing one death and more than 80 cases of mild disease in
humans. A 57 year old veterinarian who visited a poultry farm affected by
the (H7N7) strain died on 17 Apr 2003 of acute respiratory distress
syndrome in the Netherlands. H7N7 influenza virus was isolated from the
patient. No other respiratory pathogen was detected in a series of
laboratory tests.
The detection of the H7N7 avian influenza strain in humans is the most
recent case in which an avian influenza virus has crossed species to affect
humans. In Hong Kong in 1997, the H5N1 strain of avian influenza caused its
first outbreak in humans, with 18 cases and 6 deaths. In mid-February 2003,
again in Hong Kong, the H5N1 strain infected 2 people, causing one death.
Since the H7N7 outbreak began in the Netherlands in late February, there
have been 83 confirmed cases of human H7N7. Most of these cases (79)
exhibited conjunctivitis, and 13 of them displayed mild influenza-like
illness. 3 family members of 2 poultry workers have also fallen ill with a
minor respiratory disease, suggesting a possible chain of human-to-human
transmission. Affected poultry in the Netherlands are being slaughtered as
a control measures. Mass culling of poultry proved effective, in both Hong
Kong outbreaks, in preventing further cases in humans.
Close investigation, including tracing of the veterinarian's contacts, has
not revealed any transmission of the disease (in its severe form, as
opposed to the much milder conjunctivitis) to other people. Based on
available evidence, WHO concludes that the death is an isolated case, as no
efficient human-to-human transmission of the avian H7N7 influenza virus
strain has been detected.
In accordance with WHO's pandemic preparedness plan for influenza, WHO
recommends that in countries where initial cases of H7N7 were detected,
surveillance and diagnosis of the avian H7N7 virus should be enhanced in
humans and susceptible animals (including chickens, turkeys, and pigs). In
addition, countries should initiate specific investigations to increase
understanding of possible transmission patterns. Specific personal
protection, such as prophylactic use of the antiviral drug oseltamivir for
agricultural workers in contact with H7N7-affected poultry, has also been
recommended by national authorities in the Netherlands and in Belgium.
WHO advises that persons in contact with H7N7-affected poultry flocks
should be on guard for any signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. If
symptoms arise, the person should consult a doctor, who will then initiate
laboratory testing and reporting to health officials. WHO emphasizes that
these heightened surveillance measures will help in the timely detection of
any further transmission of H7N7 to humans and to prevent its possible spread.
The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network is currently assembling a
test kit for H7N7 that will be ready for use in 3 weeks. As a precautionary
measure, the network is also working on the development of a vaccine for H7N7.

"No mutation" in Dutch bird virus
---------------------------------
A Dutch vet believed to have died of bird flu was not suffering from a
mutated form of the virus, the Dutch health ministry has been quoted as saying.
The 57 year old vet died of pneumonia last week, sparking fears that the
bird flu virus might have mutated into a potentially deadly new human form
of flu. But health officials now believe he had contracted only the
"normal" form of the bird virus. Officials had stressed that there was
little danger to human health. But as well as the death of the vet, dozens
of people have now contracted conjunctivitis.
Dutch ministers have announced an independent inquiry into the vet's death.
"We now know there's no mutation of the virus, we know for sure that the
vet died of the original bird flu. It's very good to know that," a health
ministry spokesman told Reuters new agency.
The vet had not taken anti-viral medicine, as recommended by the
government, the spokesman added. "If he had taken his anti-virals he
probably wouldn't have died," he said. A government statement issued at the
weekend said the direct cause of death was chronic pneumonia, but said bird
flu virus was also found in his lungs. "No other cause of death could be
detected, a clear indication that the man died as a result of infection
from this virus," the statement added. It added that there were no signs
that anyone else has caught the virus from the vet.
Health officials fear that if the bird flu became mixed with human flu
viruses, the result could be a deadly new form of the disease. "The contact
between the 2 viruses could produce a new strain," Dutch virologist Albert
Osterhaus told Dutch television.
Bird flu is highly contagious among chickens, turkeys, and ducks but
infects humans only rarely. A 1997 bird flu outbreak in Hong Kong also
spread to the human population, killing 6 people. Dutch workers involved in
the cull have been vaccinated against the disease, and have been given
other medication to help ward off infection. In Belgium, antiviral drugs
are being offered to vets and others in contact with infected birds.

[The Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad (24 Apr 2003], citing a spokesman of the
Dutch Ministry of Health, says that the total number of conjuctivitis cases
has risen to 83; 5 of them are veterinarians. It would be helpful to know
whether the Dutch workers have fully sequenced the complete genome of the
virus from the deceased vet, or merely the H7 and N7 genes. - Mods.CP/AS]
