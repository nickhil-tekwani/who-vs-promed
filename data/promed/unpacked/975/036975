In this letter I inform [the House of Representatives], also on behalf of the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS), about the latest state of affairs in the current study in 3 COVID-19-infected mink farms. RIVM [National Institute for Public Health and the Environment], the veterinary experts, and the investigators concluded that:

1. It is plausible that an employee of one of the infected mink companies was infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the minks (this employee has since recovered);
2. Minks can undergo COVID-19 also subclinically (without symptoms); and
3. it is important to further investigate the role of cats in potential virus transmission between companies.

As a result, there is reason to take additional measures, including for the sake of public health. In this letter I indicate how my policy is to be adapted.

In view of the above conclusions, I have decided to identify an "infection with SARS-CoV-2 in mink on mink farms" as an infectious animal disease, according to Article 15 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act. This designation makes it possible to take further measures on mink farms.

Infected employee and subclinical infections
--------------------------------------------
The genetic coding of SARS-CoV-2 in many human COVID-19 patients and in infected animals have been mapped. This is comparable to DNA testing in people. The virus that causes COVID-19 mutates relatively quickly. These changes in the genetic code can be monitored. Comparisons between the genetic codes of virus isolates from various animals and from humans can contribute to the establishment of a family tree demonstrating the points in time and locations, along the road, where man and animal got infected.

This type of research has also been applied in the current event, addressing infected minks and human patients. The virus recorded in one of the employees has shown similarity with the mink virus found on the same farm. Based on mutual comparison and the position of the virus isolates in the family tree, it became plausible that one employee of an infected mink farm has been infected by mink. To be able to further demonstrate the said conclusion, the researchers presently add family trees of other human patients from the region to the map in order to get as complete a picture as possible.

Until now, it was believed that animals got infected with SARS-CoV-2 from humans. The perception that it is plausible that a mink has infected a human is new, but not unexpected. RIVM advised previously that employees of infected mink farms should use personal protective equipment. This infected employee has worked with the minks during the period when it was not yet known that the minks on the farm were infected; at that point in time, the advice of using personal protective equipment on mink farms was not yet issued.

Additional research has also shown that COVID-19 in minks can have a subclinical course. This means that the animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 but do not show any symptoms. The current reporting obligation only applies to farms where symptoms are seen (increased mortality and / or challenged respiration). Subclinically infected farms would therefore remain under the radar, which is undesirable given the potential risks to the public and animal health.

In view of the above-mentioned RIVM conclusions, I will take the following measures. As with all measures, public health comes 1st.

- Screening of mink farms (for antibodies); this will be extended to all mink farms in the Netherlands and is mandatory. This means that voluntary screening becomes legally required. The NVWA coordinates this screening.
- The continuing infections on mink farms are to be intensively followed by various research groups to determine whether these foci of infection die out or that the infection slumbers. The latter, meaning the virus continues its presence on the farm, is to be prevented as far as possible.
- I will include more details about the specific symptoms of COVID-19 in minks in the relevant ministerial regulations, which should be reported to the NVWA. The purpose of this is to help farms with symptomatic minks to report the earliest.
- The existing rules for the infected farms are to be extended by a visitor's ban in the stable and rules about which hygiene measures visitors should observe. This will allow visits to the house in the yard continued.
- At infected farms, the earlier advice of RIVM and GGD [Municipal Public Health Service] to employees, addressing their personal protection means when in the animal facilities, remains unchanged.
- In relation to the advice to infected mink farms, ensuring that cats do not enter or leave the farm premises, consultations with mink farmers, examining operational ways to apply the advice effectively and practically, are being undertaken.

Farm cats and COVID-19
----------------------
Current research showed that the virus strains on 2 of the infected mink farms are very similar. There can be several reasons for this.

Because on one of the infected farms, antibodies against the virus have been demonstrated in 3 of the 11 farm cats, it is important to investigate the possible potential role of farm cats to transfer the virus between farms. Farm cats are cats that live in the yard but are not socialized (are not used to people). In the course of this ongoing investigation, farmers of infected mink farms have been advised to ensure that cats cannot enter or leave the farm's premises. In consultation with the mink farmers, we are currently examining how this advice is to be applied effectively and practically.

Pets
----
According to the current RIVM assessment, the probability that a cat with COVID-19 can infect humans is very small. Infection mainly occurs between humans. The full RIVM's existing advice on COVID-19 and animals is available at https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/huisdieren (in Dutch).

In addition, it is important to consider, and further investigate, the role of cats in potential virus transmission. In this context, research is being carried out by a partnership composed of research groups united in the Netherlands Center for One Health (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in the Utrecht University, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Erasmus University Rotterdam, and research centers in human healthcare).

Decision-making structure
-------------------------
In view of the developments described above, it has been decided to enter the zoonosis structure effect. VWS coordinates, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, RIVM, local administrators, and GGDs, the policy and the decision management. The zoonosis structure advises the ministers of VWS and LNV. Both ministers decide by mutual agreement, keeping their own policy responsibility, in which in all cases public health comes 1st.

Technical briefing
------------------
In view of the complexity of these issues, I suggest to the House to organize soon a technical briefing, in which both human health and veterinary experts will be present.

[The above update letter to the House of Representatives refers to 3 COVID-19-infected mink farms in North Brabant; initially, 4 farms were referred to.

A concise version of the issue is available on the English pages of the Dutch Ministry's website at https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/05/19/new-results-from-research-into-covid-19-on-mink-farms.

Further results of the Dutch COVID-19 research projects, addressing minks, cats, and other animals, incorporating 3 universities and 2 ministries within an exemplary One Health effort, are anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS
