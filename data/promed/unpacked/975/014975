Cholera has killed 6 people in Angola since May 2018, with 12 cases confirmed among the 86 suspected cases registered to date, only in the province of Luanda, the health authorities said on Tue 7 Aug 2018.

The data were forwarded to the Lusa agency by the provincial director of Luanda, Rosa Bessa, after a meeting of the Provincial Committee to Combat Endemics, which analyzed the disease situation in the capital of Angola.

According to Rosa Bessa, the Inter-ministerial Commission and the Province of Luanda have joined efforts to combat the disease that, in the last 4 months caused, according to data from the Ministry of Health, 6 deaths of the 12 cases, which were laboratory confirmed. "It is also necessary to take appropriate measures at home and consume water after boiling or disinfecting with bleach as preventive measures," said Rosa Bessa.

Other outbreaks of cholera also affected the provinces of Uíge and Cabinda in 2018, both in northern Angola, the 1st of which sickened more than 600 people and caused more than a dozen deaths, and 2nd over 10 cases with at least one death registered last February 2018.

Poor basic sanitation and the use of contaminated water are causes indicated by the health authorities for the appearance of these outbreaks.

The government of Niger says 4 people have died while 123 cases are being monitored following the outbreak of cholera in the Maradi region on [13 Jul 2018]. The outbreak is concentrated in the Madarounfa district, which sits on the border with Nigeria. The deceased were members of the same family, who recently returned from a long stay in Katsina state, Nigeria. They presented symptoms that included diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration.

"Laboratory results released by the Centre for Medical and Health Research (CERMES) in Niamey on 12 Jul 2018 confirmed _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Inaba in samples from the 3 case patients. A retrospective investigation found that the patients developed symptoms in the village of Makada in Jibiya local government area in Nigeria prior to admission at the health centre in Niger," the Ministry of Public Health said.

Between 6 and 7 Jul 2018], 6 new cases from 3 villages close to the border with Nigeria were confirmed. They all presented similar signs and symptoms to those of the deceased cases. At least 19 out of the 123 cases under treatment are villagers from the Nigerian side of the border.

[3] Cholera - Nigeria

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/says-nigerian-cholera-outbreak-control-4-states-51765/


WHO says the cholera outbreak that has affected Nigeria since the beginning of the year [2018] is now under control in at least 4 of the 17 affected local government areas. In its latest epidemiological situation analysis, WHO said 367 new suspected cases and 4 deaths were reported in the Adamawa, Bauchi, Katsina, Niger, Plateau and Zamfara states in the week ending 15 Jul 2018.

"Samples collected from 12 of the cases tested positive by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). None of these have been cultured. As of 18 Jul 2018, a total of 16 892 suspected cases with 201 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.2 per cent) have been reported from Adamawa, Anambra, Bauchi, Borno, FCT, Gombe, Jigawa, Ebonyi, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau, Yobe, and Zamfara since the beginning of 2018," WHO said.

To date, samples from 268 cases have tested positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ by culture. WHO noted that there has been an overall declining trend since the peak of the outbreak in the week ending 27 May 2018, when 1345 cases were reported. "With no new cases reported in the last 4 weeks in Anambra, Nasarawa, Borno, and Yobe States, the outbreak is considered to be under control in these states. The decrease in the number of cases has also been reported from Adamawa State, which has been one of the epi-centres of this outbreak. This is contributing to the overall declining trend across the country except in Zamfara and Katsina States, where the number of cases reported is still high," the epi-update said.

An estimated 72 per cent of the affected are aged 5 years and above. WHO also found males and females to be proportionally affected. The infected are being treated at specially designated health facilities that have cholera treatment center (CTC) support from Médicins Sans Frontières (MSF).

[5] Cholera - India (Punjab)

Four people have died of cholera in Punjab's Hoshiarpur district in the past few days, the district epidemiologist said today [Wed 25 Jul 2018].

According to district epidemiologist Shailesh, over 327 patients suffering from diarrhea and dehydration have been admitted to the civil hospital here for treatment. A [12 year old] resident of Fatehgarh died of the waterborne disease today [Wed 25 Jul 2018], raising the death toll to 4. Earlier, 2 women and a man lost their lives due to the disease.

After the health department took 20 water samples from several parts of the city, it was found that the mixing of sewage in the water supply caused contamination of drinking water that led to spread of the disease, Shailesh said. The municipal authorities have been asked to supply chlorinated water through water tankers in the affected areas.

[6] Cholera - India (Mumbai)
Date: Wed 1 Aug 2018

With the advent of monsoon, the city [Mumbai] recorded 6 cholera cases this month [July 2018], with most patients diagnosed sporadically from different regions except for E-ward (Byculla-Nagpada-Madanpura), which reported 3 cases.

The cases this year [2018] are significantly high. In July 2017, only one cholera patient was diagnosed in Mumbai. According to WHO, while the disease is no longer mandatory to notify under international health regulations, the government has to monitor each case to prevent it from spreading. According to civic officials, the fresh cholera cases came up in Nagpada area (E Ward), Mulund (T ward), and Kurla (E ward). Three cases were earlier reported in Dhana Bunder (B ward), Byculla prison, and Hathibaug (E ward).

In the latest case, a 24 year old migrant worker shifted to Mumbai in the 1st week of July [2018] and developed loose motions within a day in Mulund, where he was residing with his brother. "It is suspected that he contracted the infection in Bihar, his native state," a health officer said. The migrant labourer was admitted to Sion hospital immediately for treatment. Over 2000 residents in his neighbourhood in Mulund have been screened for similar symptoms. "He has been discharged and has started working," the civic official said.

A 32 year old Nagpada woman, who lives behind JJ [Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy] Hospital, was diagnosed with cholera last week. "The entire family ate outside and suffered loose motions. But only her stool culture was positive for the infection. Everyone else in the family is stable," a BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, or the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] official said.

In the 3rd case, a man from Kurla has been diagnosed with cholera. "But the patient has been discharged and is stable," a civic official said.

In the past cases, a 26 year old male prisoner was diagnosed with cholera from Byculla prison; a 42 year old Hathibaug resident was admitted in Kasturba for cholera, and a 50 year old from Dhana Bunder was admitted to Nair Hospital. "Usually, these cases come in clusters. Even in Byculla prison, we expected more cholera patients, but tests showed no one else had the bacteria. For precautionary measures, we had distributed doxycycline tablets to inmates and staffers," a civic official from E ward said.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
