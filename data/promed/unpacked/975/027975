In a recently released report (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014; 63(25); 552-3 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6325a5.htm?s_cid=mm6325a5_w), during 19 Sep 2013-15 Dec 2013, a total of 175 cases of cholera were confirmed in La Huasteca (159 in Hidalgo, 14 in Veracruz, and 2 in San Luis Potosi). These cases and those of 2013 occurred in La Huasteca area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Huasteca), a geographical and cultural region located in Mexico along the Gulf of Mexico that includes parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, Queretaro, and Guanajuato. It is roughly defined as the area in which the Huastec people had influence when their civilization was at its height in the Mesoamerican period. Today, the Huastecs occupy only a fraction of this region, with the Nahua people now the most numerous indigenous group. - Mod.LL]

[4] Cholera - Cameroon (Extreme North Province)
Date: Tue 29 Jul 2014

A cholera epidemic has hit northern Cameroon, killing more than 200 people in less than a month. The government of the central African nation and aid agencies say some of the affected persons are refugees fleeing the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram. Cameroon's Far North regional delegate for public health, Dr Rebecca Djao, says the death toll from cholera in hospitals has surged to more than 100 and deaths out of hospital are also estimated at more than 100. The epidemic follows heavy rains that triggered flooding.

Cameroon's Minister of Public Health Andre Mama Fouda told VOA a majority of people infected with the disease are children under the age of 5 and women.

He advised people to drink only potable water and not get their water from rivers, which can carry the disease downstream if infected fecal matter or bacteria is in the water. "I have asked them to boil water from suspicious sources before drinking," he said, "and to stop their children from defecating in bushes and streams, adding that people should not dig pit toilets near water wells." The hardest hit areas are Logone, Chari and Mayo Sava where safe drinking water is usually in short supply.

Fru Angwafor, a senior health official, said some of the patients were refugees fleeing violence in neighboring Nigeria. "It is not possible to stop people from moving so it is entirely possible that somebody that is contaminated is moving from one region to the other and this essentially has been the case. Because of this high mobility of patients we now have the disease in this areas," said Angwafor.

The country's Red Cross movement and the National Order of Medical Doctors have warned that if resources are not deployed to fight the disease, Cameroon may be in for a repeat of the 2010 epidemic, when the country had to deal with 10 000 cases of cholera, more than 80 percent of them in the north. That epidemic killed about 4000 people.
