South Korea reported 3 new suspected [outbreaks] of African swine fever (ASF) on [Wed 25 Sep 2019], adding to concerns over the potential spread of the deadly animal disease despite massive disinfection efforts, Yonhap news agency reported.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, 2 suspected cases were reported at farms on Ganghwa Island in Incheon, around 60 km [about 37 mi] west of Seoul,

The ministry confirmed the 5th ASF [outbreak] in the same location a day earlier.

The other suspected case came from Yeoncheon, near the border with North Korea, where another ASF [outbreak] was confirmed last week [week of 16 Sep 2019].

Should the suspected cases all test positive for the highly contagious disease, the country will have a total of 8 confirmed ASF [outbreaks] in less than 10 days.

South Korea reported its 1st-ever confirmed ASF [outbreak] on 17 Sep 2019, also near the heavily fortified border with North Korea. So far, all 5 [outbreaks] came from northern areas of Gyeonggi Province and Incheon.

Although ASF does not affect people [but lapses in biosecurity measures favor the spread of the disease], it is fatal for pigs, with no cure currently available.

[The terms "case" and "outbreak" are often confused/misinterpreted by media sources.

According to OIE's glossary, "case" means "an individual animal infected by a pathogenic agent, with or without clinical signs"; "outbreak" means "the occurrence of one or more cases in an epidemiological unit." For OIE's other definitions, including "epidemiological unit", please refer to https://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=glossaire.htm.

Following the immediate notification of 16 Sep 2019 addressing its 1st ASF outbreak, South Korea has reported to the OIE 5 additional outbreaks in domestic pigs. A summary report, updated 25 Sep 2019, with links to all reports submitted so far, and an interactive map presenting the 6 outbreaks in a cluster situated in northwest Korea, close to the border with North Korea, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=31778. If confirmed, the 2 additional suspected outbreaks mentioned in the media report above are to be reported to the OIE.

The Republic of Korea is the 9th eastern Asia country infected by ASF since its introduction into China, reportedly 1 Aug 2018. The others are (in chronological order of introductions) Mongolia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, North Korea, Laos, Myanmar, and Philippines. The virus is also circulating in Russia's far east, along China's north-eastern border. For all ASF outbreaks reported to the OIE since August 2018 see the OIE interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/yy3k29gz (click on the cluster of interest and zoom in to the required resolution).

Eastern Asia is the most recently infected region of the ASF pandemic, which started in Georgia in 2007, spreading into vast parts of EurAsia. The odds of eradication of such outbreaks are rather poor; so far, only one of the countries, infected since 2007, has managed to eradicate the disease, namely the Czech Republic. So far, no vaccine against this viral, non-zoonotic disease is available.

North Korea submitted its immediate notification on ASF on 30 May 2019, indicating "start of outbreak" as 23 May 2019 and date of confirmation as 25 May 2019; see with map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=30664. - Mod.AS
