The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine's New Bolton Center, in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, continues to work with state authorities to respond to the equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) situation identified last week [week of 15 Jan 2018].

On 16 Jan 2018, a horse hospitalized for an unrelated medical issue developed signs compatible with equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and tested positive for EHV-1. Since then, an additional febrile horse housed in an adjacent barn has tested positive for EHV-1 and has been moved into the on-site state-of-the-art isolation facility with dedicated staff that are entirely separate from any personnel handling the other horses.

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has traced and quarantined horses suspected of having been exposed to the virus that had already left New Bolton Center prior to the EHM diagnosis. In Pennsylvania, Orders of Special Quarantine have been posted at premises that received these potentially exposed animals to control the spread of this disease.

Along with increased biosecurity, these locations are required to conduct twice-daily temperature checks and monitor and report any horses showing signs of EHV-1 infection. At the time of this publication, there have been no febrile or neurologic horses detected on the quarantined farms.

Another Pennsylvania premise that had contact with one of the EHV-1 positive horses prior to its hospitalization has also been quarantined. In addition, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has provided information concerning horses from other states that might have been exposed to the virus to their respective State Animal Health Officials for follow up.

The New Bolton Center will continue to receive equine and camelid emergency admissions only during this time; these patients can be discharged when clinically indicated. On [Mon 22 Jan 2018], in consultation with the regional state veterinarian, New Bolton Center will decide if elective equine patients can be admitted.

All cows, goats, sheep, or pig patients can continue to be admitted and discharged without restriction. Field Service operations are unaffected, as are reproductive services at the Hofmann Center.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[A horse in Virginia was exposed to likely the index case at New Bolton Center (see ProMED-mail posting 20180121.5572164). It is possible other horses could also have been exposed.

The fact that the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture is tracing other animals is an indicator we may be seeing more animals possibly exposed but having returned to their home barn. - Mod.TG
