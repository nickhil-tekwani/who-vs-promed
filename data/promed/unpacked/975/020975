Recently, we reported on a mumps outbreak in Austria (1). By Mon 3
Jul 2006, the outbreak was estimated to include at least 150 cases.
As mumps is not a notifiable disease in Austria, data protection
issues are hindering appropriate investigation. The 3 provinces
affected by the unusually high number of mumps cases since May 2006
have documented a total of 107 serologically confirmed cases,
including 56 cases in Kaernten [Carinthia] (involving 7 health
districts), 22 from Niederoesterreich, 19 from Wien [Vienna], and 10 cases for
which the province of origin is unknown.
The 107 serologically confirmed cases include 2 cases of mumps
meningitis, 9 cases of orchitis, and 2 cases of pancreatitis. One
case involved a pregnant woman. The initial analysis of case data had
suggested that attendance at an Easter celebration on 16 Apr 2006
could be a common link between the initial cases in Kaernten [see the
epidemic curve illustrated by a histogram in the original text].
Anonymised questionnaires have been completed for 46 cases. The
primary case among these 46 had symptom onset on 10 Apr 2006,
and the most recent case had symptom onset on 2 Jul 2006. The
epidemic curve [not shown here] illustrated a propagated spread.
According to the questionnaires that have so far been completed, men
were 1.3 times more often affected than women. Of the 46 cases, 12
(26 percent) were admitted to hospital. All but one of these 46 cases
were in patients aged between 16 and 32 years (median age 23,
interquartile range 21-28) and one female patient (the mother of an
infected teenager) was 59 years old.
The 45 cases aged 16 to 32 years were born into birth-cohorts that
should have been vaccinated with at least one dose of mumps vaccine
in the years from 1974 to 1990. In our initial report, we
hypothesised that teenagers and young adults born before 1994 had
either not been vaccinated or had been vaccinated with one dose only.
Only 4 of the 46 cases (9 percent) had received 2 vaccine doses.
Fourteen cases (30 percent) received only one dose, and 25 cases (54
percent) were unvaccinated; in 3 cases, vaccination status was
unknown. A bivalent mumps-measles (MM) vaccine provided by Merck
Sharp & Dohme was introduced in Austria in 1974, and was replaced in
1994 by the trivalent mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Reliable data on vaccination coverage for MMR in Austria are not
available. Since 31 May, MMR vaccine has been offered to the
population of Kaernten (population approximately 550 000) by local
health authorities, physicians and hospitals. Approximately 1200
people have so far been vaccinated.
A final analysis of the outbreak will be published soon.

[The resurgence of mumps in young adults in several parts of the
world can be related most often to inadequate vaccination (either a
history of a single dose of vaccine, or a history of no vaccine).
The epidemiologic data described above reflect this situation, with
the added feature that attendance at an Easter celebration could be a
common link between the initial cases in the outbreak in Kaernten
(Carinthia).

American outbreak? See ref. below. - Mod.JW]
