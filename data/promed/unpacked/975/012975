[Canadian] federal officials invoked the Quarantine Act to block a
group of 39 Japanese students and 2 of their chaperones from boarding
a flight to Tokyo on Thursday [31 May 2007], when departure screening
in Vancouver (British Columbia) revealed one girl was ill with
symptoms that could be measles.
"The decision to hold them back was made under . . . the federal
Quarantine Act, which essentially is designed to protect against the
import and export of infectious diseases," said Dr. Howard Njoo,
director of the Public Health Agency of Canada's centre for emergency
preparedness and response.
They are part of a larger group of 130 Japanese tourists -- 123
students and 7 chaperones -- who had previously been quarantined by
local public health authorities in Banff, Alberta, after one student
developed measles shortly after arriving in the country on [24 May
2007]. While in Banff, the entire group was tested to see if they had
antibodies to measles and the 39 students and 2 chaperones were
identified as having no immunity to the highly contagious disease.
Public health agency officials said with a new potential case, it was
felt that these people -- who could be incubating the disease --
posed a health risk to other passengers on the 12-hour flight to
Tokyo. "Because these could be early signs of possible measles, it
was felt prudent that the group should not board the plane,"
explained Dr. Theresa Tam, the agency's director of immunization and
respiratory diseases.
The remaining students and chaperones were allowed to board the
flight. The antibody testing showed they were immune to measles and
as such, pose no risk to fellow passengers.
In total, 42 people are being held back. A tour organizer -- who is
immune to measles -- decided to stay with the group until they can
return to Japan.
The girl who is sick had a low grade fever and upper respiratory
symptoms -- which could be measles, influenza, or a number of other
illnesses; but given that she was exposed to a confirmed case of
measles, public health authorities felt the disease could not be ruled out.
The unexpected extension of the group's trip could potentially be a
lengthy one. If the girl doesn't have measles, that may become clear
within 3 or 4 days, Tam said. But if she does, the group would not be
allowed to travel until after a full incubation period. "Potentially
the longest time period would be post last contact and past the
incubation period, which could be up to 18 days," Tam admitted. "But
we'll have to just wait and see what happens with this person."
Initially the group was being held at Vancouver International
Airport's quarantine station while authorities made arrangements to
put them up while they remain in Canada. Njoo said the students, who
are believed to be 16 and 17 years old, would be allowed some freedom
of movement while in Vancouver, but they would face some
restrictions. "It's not strict isolation in the sense that we would
do for a serious disease such as SARS," he said. "We don't want to
have them go out to mass gatherings and unduly expose large groups of
people in a prolonged setting. But in terms of strict isolation, I
think we're going to try to find balance there."
"It's not similar to some other situations we're aware of," he said,
referring to the case of the American man infected with extensively
drug resistant tuberculosis [XDR TB], who is being held under a U.S.
federal quarantine order.
[The case of XDR TB mentioned above], sparked an international
disease scare after he travelled to and through Europe to get married
and go on his honeymoon against the advice of public health officials
in Atlanta (USA), where he lives. He and his wife travelled back
through Canada to evade a U.S. no-fly order.
Tam said the Japanese Embassy and officials of Japan's Ministry of
Health were involved in the discussions about detaining the students,
adding the group was being "extremely cooperative." Japan is
currently experiencing a measles outbreak.

Federal, provincial, and local public health authorities have been
managing the response to a single case of measles among a tour group
of students and their chaperones visiting Canada from Japan.
As part of this response, the Public Health Agency of Canada
recommended that the 41 members of the tour group who tested as
non-immune -- indicating they were never vaccinated or exposed to the
virus -- be screened at the airport prior to departure on [31 May 2007].
During the screening, one individual showed early signs of possible
measles. The student will undergo further medical examination before
returning home. As well, because there is a risk the other non-immune
students may develop symptoms during the flight, and because the
immune status of the other passengers is not known, this group of
individuals will remain in Canada for further examination.
The Public Health Agency understands this situation may cause
inconvenience and stress, and every effort is being made to
accommodate the needs of those being kept in Canada.
The decision to keep the 41 individuals in Canada was taken under the
provisions of the Quarantine Act. The new Quarantine Act, which came
into force on [12 Dec 2006], is designed to prevent travellers
suffering from serious communicable diseases from entering or leaving
the country.
Background
----------
A case of measles in a traveller visiting Canada from Japan was
reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada on [28 May 2007]. The
student, after visiting several tourist destinations in Victoria,
Vancouver, and Burnaby, was admitted to hospital and later confirmed
to have measles. Measles is a highly contagious disease that has been
virtually eliminated in Canada, but still exists in other parts of the world.
As a precaution, local public health authorities in BC [British
Columbia] contacted those who may have come in contact with the ill
youth to assess their susceptibility to infection and offer
preventative medication.
The students and their chaperones were isolated upon arrival in Banff
[Alberta]. The students were tested and 41 non-immune individuals
were given medication (immune globulin) that can help prevent or
delay onset of illness, and minimize symptoms.
The risk of transmission to the general population remains low
because most children in Canada routinely receive 2 doses of the MMR
(measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine between their 1st and 5th birthdays
and most jurisdictions conducted catch-up campaigns with measles
containing vaccine in the 1990s.
Keeping up to date with routine immunization is key to measles
prevention for Canadians, including those traveling abroad. Two doses
of measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine are recommended and are 99
percent effective in providing protection from measles.
No cases have been identified in Canada to date, in relation to this
case. It is possible that there will be sporadic cases and only
limited transmission to those who are un-immunized or have received
only one dose of MMR vaccine.
There are several outbreaks of measles occurring around the world,
including a large outbreak in Tokyo, Japan. Routine immunization of
Canadians is key to preventing transmission of disease within Canada.
Canadians are advised to contact a travel medicine specialist before
travelling internationally.

[ProMED-mail has reported on the ongoing outbreak of measles in Japan
(see references below), which has primarily involved school children,
especially university students. Prior to April 2006, the routine
immunization program in Japan had included a single dose of
measles-containing vaccine, administered at or after 12 months of
age. Beginning in April 2006, a 2nd dose of measles-containing
vaccine was added, to be administered at school entry (primary
school). With the ongoing measles epidemic in Japan, the Japanese
Ministry of Health has recommended that: "Amid the current outbreak,
those who have never been vaccinated or who do not have any history
of the disease should receive measles vaccine immediately. As infants
and young children are most susceptible to measles virus, it is
highly recommended that they receive the measles vaccination, of
which the 1st dose is given at the age of one year old and the 2nd
dose by the entrance to elementary school." (from ProMED-mail posting
Measles - Japan (03): Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa 0070523.1655).
From the report above, it appears as though in this group of
tourists (123 teenaged students and 7 chaperones), 32 percent (41 out
of 130) were found to be susceptible to measles (there were no
protective measles antibodies found on serologic testing).
In checking the medical literature, while there is much discussion of
measles as one of the diseases associated with transmission during
air travel, the actual number of reports documenting such
transmission is scarce. In de Barros et al (ref. 2), there was a
description of 2 secondary cases associated with commercial air
travel: "In June 2005, an unvaccinated 36-year-old surfer was
identified as the initial case of a measles outbreak in Brazil. This
outbreak resulted in a total of 6 confirmed cases identified through
passive and active surveillance (Pan American Health
Organization-PAHO, 2005). As part of the outbreak control measures,
73 282 persons were vaccinated. This initial case was exposed to a
confirmed measles outbreak in the Maldives during a surfing
tournament. During the periods of incubation and communicability,
this person traveled by air on international flights before arriving
in Brazil, and on 5 domestic flights within Brazil. Two secondary
infections among fellow passengers traveling between Sao Paulo and
Florianopolis on 17 Jun [2005] (one day before the rash onset of the
index passenger) were confirmed by viral isolation and serology. One
of these secondary cases was an unvaccinated 38-year-old man with
rash onset on 1 Jul [2005], and the other was an unvaccinated
5-year-old child with rash onset on 3 Jul [2005]. The child had not
been vaccinated due to alternative medical practices. According to
their boarding passes, the index passenger was in seat 8-A and the
secondary cases in seats 5-K and 16-A. Of the 334 passengers
traveling with this index passenger during his period of
communicability, 118 were contacted and investigated. No other
secondary cases were identified. The epidemiologic investigation
suggests that transmission may have occurred towards the end of the
period of communicability of the index passenger."
de Barros et al concluded: "Reports of measles transmission aboard
aircrafts are infrequent and transmission may well be affected by the
type of aircraft and the ventilation and filtration systems used. A
higher proportion of large commercial aircraft than smaller planes
use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters (Mangili and
Gendreau, 2005). Nevertheless, our experience may suggest that
airplane-associated transmission is underreported in the scientific
literature."
In Mangili and Gendreau (ref. 5), there is mention of several case
studies describing measles transmission during commercial air travel:
"A case report in 1982 identified 7 secondary cases of measles
epidemiologically linked to the index case as a result of in-transit
exposure; one was a passenger flying on the same aircraft as the
index case and 5 others were people who had visited at least one
common departure gate with the index case. [ref. 11] In the same year
[1982], another study reported an index passenger who infected 2
fellow passengers on a flight from Venezuela to Miami. [ref. 12] A
3rd report recorded 8 cases of in-flight transmitted measles during a
10-hour flight from New York to Tel Aviv in 1994. [ref. 13] The
source case was not identified but was speculated to be a crew
member. In 2004, a passenger with measles travelled from Japan to
Hawaii, but this did not result in any transmission to other air
travellers. [ref. 1] International adoptions have a significant role
in the number of imported measles cases. In April 2004, an outbreak
in children adopted from an orphanage in China resulted in temporary
suspension of adoptions from that particular orphanage. [ref. 14] Of
the 10 confirmed cases, 9 were thought to be infectious while
travelling. One secondary case was a female student in close contact
with an infected child.
While there had been documentation of transmission of tuberculosis
following exposure on airline flights, the outbreak of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) followed by the heightened concerns about
pandemic influenza have lead to an increased awareness and concern
about airborne transmission of diseases on commercial airlines (see
references below). The action on the part of the Canadian Public
Health Authorities is one of the 1st significant implementations of
quarantine laws with respect to airline travel. This moderator is
unaware of other instances where a group of airline travellers has
been screened for protective antibodies against measles, and
quarantined from travel to prevent the risk of measles transmission.
It is curious that according to the newswire, these students "will be
allowed some freedom of movement while in Vancouver, but they will
face some restrictions". One wonders what the definition of "freedom
of movement is", and what "some restrictions" are... and whether
there may be possible exposure of the general population to measles virus.
