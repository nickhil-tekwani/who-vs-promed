City officials planned Thursday to spray insecticide in a southeast Dallas
neighborhood early Friday morning to prevent a potentially fatal
mosquito-related illness. City officials ordered the spray in a
one-half-mile radius of the 1100 block of Dowdy Ferry Road after blood
taken from a chicken in one of Dallas' sentinel flocks tested positive for
[antibody to? St. Louis encephalitis [virus. The test indicates that
mosquitoes are carrying encephalitis [sic in the area.
Rodger Jayroe, a manager with the Dallas Department of Environmental and
Health Services, said such sprays are common during the summer and that
several were done last year. He said he was not aware of any reports of
people contracting St. Louis encephalitis in Dallas last year or this
summer. "I wouldn't panic," Mr. Jayroe said. "I would take precautions and
try to avoid the mosquitoes." The spray is simply a preventive measure, he
said. "We're trying to lessen the adult population of mosquitoes in the
area," Mr. Jayroe said. "The potential is there for a greater problem. That
is what we are trying to prevent." Calm winds and dry weather permitting,
the spraying was set to begin at 1 AM Friday and continue for about three
hours, Mr. Jayroe said.
The city's Department of Health and Environmental Services routinely
collects mosquitoes and blood samples from various flocks of chickens
located throughout Dallas. The flocks provide an early warning system to
alert officials to the [possibility that St. Louis encephalitis virus may
be present. The sample that produced the positive test was taken June 29.
City officials also advise residents to be aware of stagnant water around
their homes, because that's where mosquitoes breed. Officials recommend
frequently changing water in bird baths and pet water bowls.
