Suspected acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in the Republic of the
Congo - Update 2
-------------------------------------------------
As of 12 Feb 2003, 61 suspected cases of acute haemorrhagic fever
syndrome have been reported in the districts of Mbomo (7 cases, 4
deaths) and Kelle (54 cases, 44 deaths) in Cuvette Ouest Region (see
previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_10/en/>)
A team is in the field and clinical samples have been collected.
These will be tested by the Centre International de Recherches
Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon. Volunteers from the national
Red Cross Society are informing and mobilizing communities in the
region. A National Coordination Committee to contain the outbreak has
been established in Brazzaville under the Direction Generale de la
Sante, assisted by WHO and other international partners.

At least 48 people are now known to have died in a suspected outbreak
of Ebola in the north of Congo-Brazzaville, near the border with
Gabon. The authorities in Brazzaville have not yet been unable to
confirm that the virus is the cause of the deaths.
At first, inhabitants of the villages of Kelle and Mbomo, where
people have been dying daily in recent weeks, refused to cooperate
with emergency teams from the ministry of health and the World Health
Organisation (WHO) sent to investigate a possible Ebola outbreak.
Instead they accused the health teams of bringing the virus to the
area themselves, and refused to give blood samples from their dead.
But the ministry of health says it has now obtained blood samples
from 5 of the deceased. The samples have been sent from Kelle and
Mbomo, 800 kilometres north of the capital, Brazzaville, to a
laboratory in Libreville, Gabon, and results of the Ebola tests are
expected within the next 5 days.
In the meantime, the ministry of health and the WHO are treating the
deaths as a confirmed Ebola outbreak and taking measures to contain
the spread of the virus, which is easily passed by contact with body
fluids and between humans and animals. The ministry says its
emergency teams have now succeeded in convincing inhabitants of the
area to stay away from church and not to travel. The teams are also
trying to stop people in the region from eating wild game such as
gorilla, gazelle, and antelope. These are among the animals that have
been dying off in the surrounding forest and have already tested
positive for Ebola.
Ebola killed 43 people in Congo and 53 others in neighbouring Gabon
between October 2001 and February 2002. The WHO says more than 1000
people have died of Ebola since the virus was first identified in
1976 in western Sudan and in a nearby region of Congo.

[This is an increase of 10 suspected Ebola virus deaths in the 2 days
since the last report -- see ref. below. The reference to gazelle is
probably to a small, dog-sized antelope also known as duiker, nowhere
near as fast a runner as the East and South African gazelles. As
noted in the 2001 ref. below, these are caught and eaten by
chimpanzees, but gorillas do not eat meat, so their source of
infection must be something else -- termites or insect larvae have
been postulated. - Mod.JW]
