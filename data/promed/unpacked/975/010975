Rifampicin [rifampin] resistant tuberculosis, GeneXpert MTB/RIF, Kathmandu, Nepal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patients who are clinically suspected of having tuberculosis [TB] are referred to Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital to determine _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ infection and rifampicin resistance by using GeneXpert MTB/RIF testing. Among 39 GeneXpert MTB/RIF-positive cases tested, 3 (about 8%) were found to be rifampicin-resistance positive from November 2017 through January 2018.

According to the National Tuberculosis Center, Kathmandu, 45% of the population is infected with TB (probably latent tuberculosis infection, LTBI) with 20 000 new sputum-positive TB cases every year. There is, however, a scarcity of data on rifampicin-resistant TB in Nepal, which can lead to multidrug resistance in the long run; a significant threat to national and global control of TB infection.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Pun for his continued contributions.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of tuberculosis (TB) that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the 2 most potent 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a subset of MDR-TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, as well as resistant to fluoroquinolones and at least one of the 3 2nd-line injectable anti-TB drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

MDR-TB may be primary or secondary. Secondary MDR-TB is acquired as a consequence of the emergence of drug-resistant mutants during inadequate or improper use of anti-TB medications for active TB. Primary MDR-TB is a new infection (in the absence of a history of prior treatment with anti-TB drugs) that has been acquired from someone with MDR-TB.

Primary drug resistance indicates need for better TB control to interrupt transmission, whereas secondary drug resistance indicates need for better patient management to prevent the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.

The following tuberculosis profile for Nepal is provided by WHO: Of the about 31 000 cases of tuberculosis that Nepal reported in 2016, 73% were pulmonary (22 630 cases), of which 75% were bacteriologically confirmed (about 17 000 cases) (https://extranet.who.int/sree/Reports?op=Replet&name=/WHO_HQ_Reports/G2/PROD/EXT/TBCountryProfile&ISO2=NP&outtype=pdf).

33% of the previously treated cases and 2% of the new cases were tested for rifampin resistance. Of the 1697 cases that were tested for rifampin resistance, 537 cases (31.6%) were found to be rifampin-resistant (RR) (MDR/RR-TB: 134, XDR-TB: 403); the high percentage of rifampin resistance was likely because rifampin resistance testing was done preferentially on previously treated cases (https://extranet.who.int/sree/Reports?op=Replet&name=/WHO_HQ_Reports/G2/PROD/EXT/TBCountryProfile&ISO2=NP&outtype=pdf). - Mod.ML
