What's new?
-----------
- 9 more ill people have been reported from 8 states. The most recent illness started on 13 Mar 2016.
- 5 states have been added to the list of states with ill people: Alabama, California, Hawaii, Michigan, and West Virginia.
- Consumers should not eat and retailers should not sell the recalled RAW Meal products. These products have a long shelf life and may still be in people's homes.

Highlights
----------
* CDC, multiple states, and the Food and Drug Administration are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Virchow infections.
* 27 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Virchow have been reported from 20 states.
- 5 ill people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.
* Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that RAW Meal Organic Shake & Meal products made by Garden of Life, LLC are the likely source of this outbreak.
* As a result of this investigation, Garden of Life, LLC voluntarily recalled several lots of RAW Meal Organic Shake & Meal products, available in chocolate, original, vanilla, and vanilla chai, on 29 Jan 2016 (initial recall) and 12 Feb 2016 (expanded recall).
* Consumers should not eat and retailers should not sell the recalled RAW Meal products.
- These products have a long shelf life and may still be in people's homes.
- Even if some of the RAW Meal product has been eaten without anyone getting sick, throw away or return the rest of the product.
- The recalled products were available for purchase nationwide in many retail stores and online.

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 5 Dec 2015 to 13 Mar 2016. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 84, with a median age of 35. Fifty-six per cent of ill people are female. Among 19 ill people with available information, 5 (26 per cent) reported being hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

[As compared with recalled contaminated produce that tends to have a short shelf-life, products with prolonged shelf-lives can been associated with prolonged outbreaks. Recall systems in which the consumer buying the product can be identified by electronic retail store records can facilitate recall and minimize numbers of a outbreak. - Mod.LL
