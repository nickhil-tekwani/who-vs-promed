According to data from regional department of Rospotrebnadzor, 14 patients have been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Stavropol, in southwestern Russia.

"According to the results of laboratory tests, the diagnosis of Crimean hemorrhagic fever was established in 14 patients from among the provisionally hospitalized, living in the Petrovsky and Blagodarnensky urban districts; in Apanasenkovsky, Arzgirsky, Krasnogvardeisky, Ipatovsky, and Shpakovsky districts; and in Stavropol," the report says.

Stavropol residents are urged to observe safety measures when outdoors. It is recommended to spray clothes with repellent, and after walking, check your body for ticks. If you find a tick on yourself, contact the emergency room.

CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic and occurs frequently in the Stavropol region. Southern Russia -- Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, and Kalmykia in Southern Federal District and Stavropol, Ingushetia, Dagestan, and Karachay-Cherkessia in North Caucasus Federal District -- and disputed Crimea are endemic for CCHF. Between 2005 and 2015, 1397 total cases, including 42 fatalities and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.2%, were recorded. The highest numbers were registered between 2006 and 2008, which coincides with official Russian MOH statistics. In 2016, 162 cases were reported in total for Russia with 6 fatalities (based on reported cases, CFR 3.7%), and in 2017, 72 cases were reported by ProMED-RUS for Russia with 4 fatalities (5% CFR; https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(18)33924-9/fulltext).

Healthcare personnel are at risk from nosocomial infections, and the 1st such cases were described in Pakistan and later reported from many countries. Severe CCHF with associated hemorrhage presents the highest risk, and failure to recognize the initial nonspecific clinical features of CCHF remains a challenge both in endemic settings and in exported cases in travelers (http://archive.lstmed.ac.uk/7577/1/PLoS_0182315_8_9_17.pdf). - Mod.UBA
