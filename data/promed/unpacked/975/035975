[According to media reports: "Due to the worsening epizootic situation around African swine fever in Ukraine, the import of pork meat and finished pork products (salo, kielbasa, canned meats, etc.) from Ukraine into the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic, including in hand luggage for personal use, has been prohibited.

On 1 Sep 2017, Ukraine's State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection announced that 20 settlements from 9 regions across the country had been quarantined due to the virus. 104 cases of ASF have been reported so far in 2017, already exceeding the 91 cases reported last year [2016]. An estimated 10 000 pigs infected with the virus have been destroyed, and ASF has cost farmers over 125 million hryvnia [about USD 4.8 million] in losses" https://sputniknews.com/europe/201709171057462463-donetsk-ban-ukrainian-pork/.
