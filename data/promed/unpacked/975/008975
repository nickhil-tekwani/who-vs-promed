Another comment on the vagaries of underreporting. My medical practice is
located in Mansfield (Storrs), CT about 15 miles from Dr Cummings [see:
Lyme disease - USA (Massachusetts) (02) 20020516.4231]. During the summer
months my practice sees close to one case of acute Lyme disease daily. Many
of these are not reported because patients here are attuned to the early
signs and symptoms of Lyme/ECM [erythema chronicum migrans]. Under current
guidelines (State of CT and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC]) only ECM larger than 5cm is "reportable". Since many cases of ECM
with myalgias/fever are smaller than 5cm, we do consider them as probable
Lyme and treat accordingly but do not report them. Of course, some of these
may not be Lyme, but probably most are. This is another source of
underreporting. In addition, I'm sure we fail to report many other definite
cases just due to being busy, forgetful, and all the other myriad reasons
for failing to report cases.

[Dr Dardick correctly points out that erythema migrans is only reportable
according to the CDC case definition (reproduced below) if it is 5 cm in
diameter or greater. It is likely that the size was set to decrease the
number of "clinically false-positive" skin lesions. It is important to
point out that CDC makes it clear that this is a surveillance definition
and not a clinical one. Although this can account for some underreporting,
it is still likely that much of the issue is related to the nonreporting of
cases that would fit the definition.
Lyme disease surveillance case definition (revised September 1996)
-----------------------------------------
Clinical description: A systemic, tick-borne disease with protean
manifestations, including dermatologic, rheumatologic, neurologic, and
cardiac abnormalities. The best clinical marker for the disease is the
initial skin lesion, erythema migrans, that occurs in between 60 and 80 per
cent of patients.
Clinical case definition: Erythema migrans, or at least one late
manifestation, as defined below, and laboratory confirmation of infection.
Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: isolation of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ from
clinical specimen, or demonstration of diagnostic levels of IgM and IgG
antibodies to the spirochete in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or a
two-test approach using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay or
immunofluorescence antibody followed by western blot is recommended (1).
Case classification
Confirmed: a case that meets one of the clinical case definitions above
Comment: this surveillance case definition was developed for national
reporting of Lyme disease; it is NOT appropriate for clinical diagnosis.
Definition of terms used in the clinical description and case definition:
A. Erythema migrans (EM)
For purposes of surveillance, EM is defined as a skin lesion that typically
begins as a red macule or papule and expands over a period of days to weeks
to form a large round lesion, often with partial central clearing. A
solitary lesion must reach at least 5 cm in size. Secondary lesions may
also occur. Annular erythematous lesions occurring within several hours of
a tick bite represent hypersensitivity reactions and do not qualify as EM.
For most patients, the expanding EM lesion is accompanied by other acute
symptoms, particularly fatigue, fever, headache, mild stiff neck,
arthralgia, or myalgia. These symptoms are typically intermittent. The
diagnosis of EM must be made by a physician. Laboratory confirmation is
recommended for persons with no known exposure.
B. Late manifestations
Late manifestations include any of the following when an alternate
explanation is not found:
Musculoskeletal system: recurrent, brief attacks (weeks or months) of
objective joint swelling in one or a few joints, sometimes followed by
chronic arthritis in one or a few joints. Manifestations not considered as
criteria for diagnosis include chronic progressive arthritis not preceded
by brief attacks and chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. Additionally,
arthralgia, myalgia, or fibromyalgia syndromes alone are not criteria for
musculoskeletal involvement.
Nervous system: any of the following, alone or in combination: Lymphocytic
meningitis; cranial neuritis, particularly facial palsy (may be bilateral);
radiculoneuropathy; or, rarely, encephalomyelitis. Encephalomyelitis must
be confirmed by showing antibody production against _B. burgdorferi_ in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), demonstrated by a higher titer of antibody in
CSF than in serum. Headache, fatigue, paresthesia, or mild stiff neck alone
are not criteria for neurologic involvement.
Cardiovascular system: acute onset, high-grade (2nd or 3rd degree)
atrioventricular conduction defects that resolve in days to weeks and are
sometimes associated with myocarditis. Palpitations, bradycardia, bundle
branch block, or myocarditis alone are not criteria for cardiovascular
involvement.
C. Exposure
Exposure is defined as having been in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas
(potential tick habitats) in a county in which Lyme disease is endemic no
more than 30 days before onset of EM. A history of tick bite is NOT required.
D. Disease endemic to county
A county in which Lyme disease is endemic is one in which at least 2
definite cases have been previously acquired or in which a known tick
vector has been shown to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_
E. Laboratory confirmation
As noted above, laboratory confirmation of infection with _B. burgdorferi_
is established when a laboratory isolates the spirochete from tissue or
body fluid, detects diagnostic levels of IgM or IgG antibodies to the
spirochete in serum or CSF, or detects a significant change in antibody
levels in paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples. States may
determine the criteria for laboratory confirmation and diagnostic levels of
antibody. Syphilis and other known causes of biologic false-positive
serologic test results should be excluded when laboratory confirmation has
been based on serologic testing alone.
