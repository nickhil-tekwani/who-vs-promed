People vaccinated against meningitis are supposed to have protection
for 3 years but health officials have announced that meningitis
epidemics have occurred in several areas where populations had
recently been immunized.

"[Health researchers] are currently collecting information so as to
identify the factors explaining the recurrence of the epidemic in
districts where populations have been vaccinated", Ousmane Badolo,
head of the epidemiologic surveillance department at the ministry of
health, told IRIN. Vaccination campaigns target people between 2 to
30 years old; according to the ministry of health, 80 to 90 percent
of the victims of meningitis belong to that age group.

A total of 714 people have died since 1 January out of 7184 cases.

Several different bacteria can cause meningitis which is an
inflammation of the protective membranes covering the central nervous
system. The Neisseria sero-group is one of the most important to
watch because it often leads to epidemics, experts say. Badolo, the
epidemiologist, said that health research teams from the UN World
Health Organization and US-based Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have come to Burkina Faso to investigate.

"This is the first time that such research is being conducted,"
Badolo said, adding that at this stage he could only guess why the
vaccination programmes have not worked. "Perhaps it is because of
population displacement," he said, "for instance in gold mining areas
people are often coming and going."

The health researchers will focus their work on the districts of Reo
in the central west of the country, Boulsa in the central north,
Titao in the north and in Sig-nonghin a district in the north of the
capital Ouagadougou. The populations in each of those 4 districts
were vaccinated last year [2007]; yet each has reached epidemic
thresholds. A total of 5 out of the country's 55 districts have
reached the epidemic threshold and 14 others are on alert.

Meanwhile, 3.5 million people have been vaccinated this year [2008]
out of a population of 14 million. The government said it is in the
process of procuring a million more vaccines with the help of UN
Children's Agency UNICEF.

[The number of total cases of meningitis in Burkina Faso has more
than doubled and the number of deaths has about doubled since the
last report (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Burkina
Faso 20080314.1017).

There are at least 13 _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on
the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease
due serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common. According to a
prior ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa: meningitis
belt 20080225.0756, _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was identified as
the presumptive causative agent of this outbreak in 2 of the Burkina
Faso districts. Serogroup A has been the predominant cause of
meningitis outbreaks in the African meningitis belt (in which Burkina
Faso is located) that recur at intervals of 7-14 years and result in
excessive morbidity and mortality among children and young adults. In
recent years, group W135 meningococci have also caused outbreaks in
this region.

All serogroup polysaccharides but B, are immunogenic in humans. There
are several different types of meningococcal vaccines. Polysaccharide
vaccines, which have been available for more than 30 years, exist
against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in various combinations (such
as, a bivalent AC, trivalent ACW-135, and a tetravalent ACYW-135
polysaccharide vaccine). There is a monovalent conjugate vaccine
against serogroup C and a tetravalent against serogroups A, C, Y, and
W-135. The type of meningococcal vaccine used in the current outbreak
in Burkina Faso is not specified.

Immunity following meningococcal vaccination is serogroup-specific.
One possible explanation of vaccine failure is a mismatch in the
predominant meningococcal serogroup causing the Burkina Faso outbreak
and the serogroup specificity of the vaccine. Another possibility is
the outbreak is due to an organism other than _N. meningitidis_.

Vaccine stability could be an additional problem. There had been a
recall in 2002 of Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135 (Meningococcal Polysaccharide
Vaccine, groups A, C, Y and W-135 Combined) because of loss of
serogroup A potency in this multivalent vaccine. Inability to
vaccinate enough of the susceptible population to induce herd
immunity may be another explanation. We await the results of the WHO
and U.S. CDC investigation.
