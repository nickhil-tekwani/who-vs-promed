Cholera outbreak claims 3 in Burundi
-----------------------------------------
A cholera outbreak in the Burundi capital of Bujumbura is thought to have
claimed 3 lives, with more cases being reported daily, said Medinfo in
Johannesburg.
Dr. Andrew Jamieson said the epidemic, which started on 12 Jan 2005, was
spreading rapidly. "We think 3 people have already died, but this has not
yet been substantiated," he said.
He said 88 cases had been reported by the Ministry of Public Health since
the outbreak. He attributed the "flare up" of the disease to the heavy
rainfall that caused fecal contamination of ground water and wells, and the
cutting off of public water sources in informal settlements due to
non-payment for water by the city council to the water utility company.
Jamieson advised travelers to the region to practice good food and water
hygiene and to consider immunization against cholera if at high risk.

At least 5 people have died and 105 been taken ill, as a cholera outbreak
in the northern part of Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, has spread since the
middle of the month, a UN official said on Thu 20 Jan 2005.
A spokeswoman for the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) said 16
new cholera cases were reported on Wed 20 Jan 2005, bringing the number
infected by the potentially fatal waterborne disease to 105.
About 75 percent of the cases are in Bujumbura's northern Kamenge district
where the outbreak began, the spokeswoman, Isabelle Abric, told reporters,
citing statistics from Burundi's public health ministry and the WHO.
In a bid to stop the spread of cholera, authorities have closed down many
businesses in the area, including roadside fruit and vegetable stands and
beer bars.

Diarrhea victims flood hospitals
-------------------------------
The number of people suffering from diarrhea is on the rise in Surabaya,
with Dr. Mohammad Soewandi Hospital treating over 65 children in the 1st
week of January 2005 and 49 more in the 2nd week.
The hospital's secretary, Sukadji, said the January 2005 figure was higher
than in December 2004, but less compared to the October-November 2004
period when the hospital treated 1540 patients with diarrhea. Out of the
1540 patients, 1121 of them were children.
Most diarrhea patients were treated and released after 2 or 3 days, he said.
In Dr. Soetomo Hospital, an average of 13 diarrhea patients have been
admitted each day in January 2005
