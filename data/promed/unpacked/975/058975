A total of 4 persons from Bhavani Peth and Yerawada areas have tested positive for leptospirosis at a state government referral laboratory this month [July 2017].

"Up to 5 people have tested positive for leptospirosis in July [2017]. Among them, 4 were residents of Pune city, 2 each from Yerawada and Bhavani Peth, while the 5th one was from Baramati," a state health official said. Incidentally, civic health officials were clueless about the 4 cases when TOI [Times of India] contacted them. "As per our information, there is only one confirmed case of leptospirosis. A Warje man who died of the disease is the sole case so far," infectious diseases expert Sudhir Patsute, in-charge of the PMC's [Pune Municipal Corporation's] disease surveillance cell, said.

Incidentally, when TOI reported about the death of the leptospirosis on [Mon 10 Jul 2017], even then the civic health officials were clueless about it. It was only after the TOI reported that the officials initiated surveillance and preventive measures. "Leptospirosis is grossly under reported due to lack of awareness about it among medical professionals and difficulties in diagnosis," another state health department official said.

In cities, rodents that infest the sewage system with free living animals act as carriers. Even light showers choke the poorly maintained drainage systems leading to flooding. This causes a spurt in leptospirosis cases in the monsoon.

[Pune, considered to be the cultural capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra, with a population of about 3.1 million residents, is the 2nd largest city in Maharashtra and the 9th most populous city in the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune#Museums.2C_parks_and_zoos).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, e.g., rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal.

Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Pune is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (July-October) and July is the wettest month of the year.
