Dengue fever hits UPDF in Somalia
---------------------------------
A total of 122 UPDF [Uganda Peoples Defence Force] soldiers in Somalia
have been attacked by dengue fever, Parliament has heard. Health
minister Dr Christine Ondoa told MPs yesterday [16 Sep 2011] that the
ministry was working together with the UPDF health department to
control the fever in Somalia. They are also working to prevent
importation of the disease into Uganda by returning soldiers.

According to the permanent secretary of the health ministry, Dr Asuman
Lukwago, dengue fever is a viral infection and is spread by
mosquitoes. Its symptoms are nose bleeding, general body weakness, and
red eyes. The disease eventually leads to total organ failure if not
treated, he added. Lukwago said the cases have been managed in
Nairobi.

According to the World Health Organisation, the disease causes a
severe flu-like illness and sometimes a lethal complication called
dengue haemorrhagic fever. WHO disclosed that global incidence of
dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, with about 2/5 of the
world's population at risk.

Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide,
mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. There is no specific treatment
for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves lives, WHO
added. The only way to prevent transmission of dengue virus is to get
rid of the disease-carrying mosquitoes, WHO said.

[Uganda and Burundi are 2 of the African Union member states that have
sent troops to Mogadishu-Somalia to help restore peace and order. This
report indicates that the troops have now been infected by dengue
fever, an arboviral disease for which there is neither a cure nor a
vaccine. Although the report does not clearly indicate where the
outbreaks have occurred, it is assumed that this is in or around
Mogadishu where the African Union troops are deployed. Previous
reports of suspect dengue fever transmission in Mogadishu are traced
back to April 2005 (see ProMED posting achieve no 20050423.1139).

Dengue fever cases were reported in 1992 amongst United States marines
following "Operation Restore Hope" (Sharp et al, 1995). As highlighted
in the report, there is a risk of disease importation to Uganda and
Burundi. As peace and order has now almost returned to most of
Mogadishu after the withdrawal of Al Shabab, vector control measures
need to be initiated by the authorities to contain local transmission
of the disease. Definitive vector control measures in Mogadishu will
rely on the findings of an entomological assessment to determine the
vectors (usually_Aedes aegypti_ or_Aedes albopictus_) and hence
initiate a tailored response. To guard against importation, the troops
that are returning to their home countries, the troops may need to be
kept in a central holding place for 7-10 days on returning home as
evaluations are undertaken to determine their dengue infection and
exposure status before being allowed back into the communities.

Fever spreads through children living in Karenni refugee camp
-------------------------------------------------------------
More than 400 refugees -- mostly children -- in Karenni refugee camp
in Mae Hong Song in northern Thailand have been infected by a fever
with symptoms similar to dengue fever.

Camp health officials said that about two-thirds of the patients are
children between the ages of 8 and 18, who have high temperatures,
coughs, and a sore throat. Officials are doing tests now to determine
the exact cause of the illness.

If the disease is diagnosed as dengue fever, an infected patient must
be separated from other people, the medical official said.

During August [2011], more than 300 refugees received medical
treatment at the clinic in Quarter No. 9, and more than 100 received
treatment at a clinic in Quarter No. 1.

"Many children who attended school are infected with a virus. When
they sneeze, the virus spreads in the air," a medical worker told
Mizzima. Medical officials said that a similar fever outbreak spread
through Karenni camp No. 1 in 2009.

Also, starting 2 weeks ago, an eye disease has infected 102 patients
in the camp, said Nga Meh, a clinic health worker.

Meanwhile, health workers distributing information about preventive
measures to combat the diseases.

About 15 000 Karenni refugees who fled from the fighting in Burma
between government troops and the Karenni National Progressive Party
have taken refuge at Karenni camp No. 1.

There are 9 refugee camps along the Thai border, including 2 Karenni
camps. Out of more than 145 000 refugees in the camps, about 65 000
were sent to resettlement countries from 2006 to 2010.

[The newswire reports an outbreak of febrile illness with dengue
fever-like symptoms, which affected more than 400 children in Karenni
refugee camp in Mae Hong Song in northern Thailand in August and
September 2011. However, the etiological agent of the outbreak has not
been identified yet. PRO/MBDS would highly appreciate any information
from a reliable source regarding the etiological agent of the fever
outbreak in the Karenni camp.

The Ministry of Public Health has urged people in flooded areas to
beware of dengue fever infection during the 7-10 days after the water
recedes, as the mosquito population is expected to soar.

With concerns over a possible outbreak of dengue fever, the Minister
has assigned provincial public health and disease control offices
across the country to be on high alert and seek cooperation from local
residents in cleaning their homes after the floods and eliminating all
stagnant waters within the 1st week.

According to MD Paijit, there have been 48 760 people infected with
dengue fever in Thailand since the beginning of this year [2011]; 35
of them have passed away. The majority of patients are in the central
region, followed by the Northeast, the North and the South.

[It is not clear why there is a discrepancy in the number of dengue
cases in Lahore between the 3 reports above. Perhaps the number of
cases coming in to hospitals and health centers has been so great over
the past few days that the statistics have not kept up with the
outbreak. Also, it is not clear which figures are official ones and
which unofficial. - Mod. TY]
