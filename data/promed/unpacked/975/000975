Mestcheriakova I.S. Actual problems of tularemia prophylaxis in modern
conditions --p.17.
In the Russian Federation 2019 cases of tularemia were registered from 1987
till 1997. From 60 to 75% of the cases were reported in three regions: the
Northern, the Central and the West-Siberian. The average number of
tularemia cases fluctuated from 100 to 400 per year.
Last time the widest tularemia outbreaks were reported for:
1993 -- Rostov oblast (226 cases, transmissible);
1995 -- Smolensk oblast (91 cases, water-borne);
1995 -- Moscow City (20 cases, milk-borne);
1998 -- Bashkortostan (>70 cases, transmissible).
Clinical forms of the tularemia cases were ulcer-bubonic, anginal-bubonic
and bubonic.
Characteristics of the last tularemia outbreak is an increase of cases
(60-73%) in urban areas and a decrease of cases in rural areas. Also to be
noted is a morbidity increase in children under 14 years (20-30% of total
number of cases).
To reduce the spread of tularemia, essentially it is necessary to provide
the following measures:
1) immunization of the population in enzootic territories and risk groups;
2) serological and allergic control for immune status of immunized persons;
3) epizootological monitoring of natural foci.
Special attention should be paid to these measures at [times of] epizootic
activity in natural foci.

[The natural reservoir of tularemia is in "numerous wild animals,
especially rabbits, hares, muskrats, beavers & some domestic animals; also
various hard ticks. In addition, a rodent-mosquito cycle has been
described for [tularemia] in Russia & Sweden" (Benenson, A. ed. (1995)
