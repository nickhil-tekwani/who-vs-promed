City officials confirmed on Sat 5 Feb 2011, the 1st known cases of
cholera in New York since the outbreak of the disease in Haiti in
2010. A commercial laboratory notified health officials on Fri 4 Feb
2011, that 3 New Yorkers had [cholera after] developing diarrhea and
dehydration, classic symptoms of the disease, after returning from a
wedding on 22 and 23 Jan 2011 in the Dominican Republic, where the
government has been trying to prevent the disease from spreading from
neighboring Haiti.

The 3 who contracted cholera were adults who returned to the city
within days of the wedding. None were hospitalized. Dr Sharon Balter,
a medical epidemiologist for the city Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene, said on that the victims had all recovered.

Officials declined to release the names of the patients or where they
lived.

Officials at the CDC have noted a few cases of cholera in the past 3
or 4 months from travelers who arrived in the USA from Haiti or the
Dominican Republic.

While cholera can spread swiftly where sanitation is poor and clean
drinking water is unavailable, the possibility of transmitting the
disease in New York is considered low. The likelihood of
person-to-person transmission is also low, as one would have to drink
large amounts of water contaminated with _Vibrio cholerae_, the
cholera-causing bacterium, to get sick.

"People get cholera by drinking water or eating food that is
contaminated with cholera," said Erin Hughes, a spokeswoman for the
city's health department.

In New York, the occasional cholera case is not unusual. Officials
see an average of one case per year, particularly among those
traveling to regions where the disease is common, Dr Balter said. But,
until now, no cases have emerged since the outbreak in Haiti, she
said.

[In previous reports, no mention was found of wedding guests from
NYC, but it appears, as in Boston, that cases of cholera have been
imported into New York from this ill-fated wedding (as least for many
of the guests). Again, in the developed world with adequate sanitation
and clean water, the risk of spread of cholera is quite low. - Mod.LL]
