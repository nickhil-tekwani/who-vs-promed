The United States Department of Agriculture
reports that Asian soybean rust has been
confirmed on soybeans in Natchitoches Parish,
Louisiana. This is the 1st case of rust in that
county in 2006, the northernmost case on [soy-]
beans in the state and farthest west Asian
soybean rust has been found in [the crop planted for] 2006.

The rust was found in a sentinel plot on Group V
beans at the R5 growth stage. According to the
Agriculture Department, area producers are
advised to use fungicide if the beans are between
the R1 and R5 stage and have good yield
potential. The USDA states that "harvest has
begun in many of the soybean growing areas
especially with early maturing varieties or those planted early."

For the year to date, 10 counties in 5 Southeast
and Gulf Coast states have reported Asian soybean
rust on soybeans, with several recent cases
attributed to storm activity during July.

[2] ASR on soybean � Georgia: 1st report for Tift County in 2006

Asian soybean rust was confirmed on 7 Aug 2006 on
leaves taken from Group IV soybeans growing in an
industry research field near Chula in Tift County.

A small leaf sample (<10 leaflets) was submitted
to the University of Georgia diagnostic clinic,
and rust was confirmed. The Tift County find
makes 6 counties in south central Georgia reporting infections.

Tift becomes the 29th county in the U.S. with
soybean rust and the northernmost in Georgia in
2006. The positive counties are Brooks, Decatur,
Miller and Tift, with Grady and Thomas no longer
red on the USDA map after infected plants were
destroyed and no more rust found. It is the 9th
U.S. county in 5 states with rust on this season's soybeans.

Tift County is the site of the University of
Georgia's Tifton campus and a center for row crop
research, including soybeans. By comparison, rust
was first confirmed at the Tifton campus on 15 Jul 2005.

University of Georgia pathologists say although
Asian soybean rust has been confirmed on kudzu in
Miller and Brooks counties and on soybean
research plots in Brooks and Decatur counties, it
has really not spread much at all this year, likely due to hot and dry weather.

University of Georgia Plant Pathologist Bob
Kemerait says, "Many growers may choose to wait
to apply the fungicide application until we are
able to document rust spreading in our sentinel
plots and research plots. For example, though
rust was found on soybean plants in Attapulgus,
Decatur County (1 leaf of 100) on 3 Jul 2006, we
have not found the rust again. We have also not
found rust in sentinel plots in Moultrie (SunBelt Expo) or elsewhere."

To the west, in Alabama, rust was detected
over-wintering in kudzu as far north as
Montgomery county in the central part of the
state, but has not been reported in soybeans in the state.

To the south, in Florida, rust has been found in
both sentinel plots and commercial counties in
northwest Florida. Movement has been sporadic at
best and researchers have not recommended
spraying for soybean rust, unless yield potential of beans warrants.

To the north in South Carolina, spores were found
in June, but no rust has been detected in the
state and soybean specialist John Mueller says no
recommendations have been made for growers to spray beans for rust.

A recent find in southwest Mississippi has not
spread from the site in Jackson County. Hot, dry
weather throughout most of Mississippi has not
been conducive to spread of rust and Extension
specialists say soybeans in the Delta and
northern Mississippi are not threatened by rust at this time.

Though some scattered rainfall in late July in
south and central Georgia brought some relief
from the drought, intense heat in August has
offset most of the gains. Throughout the southern
tier of states, where rust begins its move
northward, extended hot, dry weather has severely limited its movement.

Details of the technical program planned for the
2006 National SoybeanRust Symposium 29 Nov - 1
Dec 2006, in St. Louis are now available online
<http://www.apsnet.org/online/SBR/>.

The technical committee, co-chaired by Anne
Dorrance of Ohio State University and John Rupe
of the University of Arkansas, has lined up a
packed program. Don Hershman, University of
Kentucky, is the overall coordinator for the
symposium, which is presented by the American
Phytopathological Society [APS] in cooperation
with related organizations and sponsors.

The first morning's general session (30 Nov 2006)
will be overviews of soybean rust in 2006 from 4
areas: North America, South America, Mexico and
the Caribbean. This is followed by results from
this year's soybean rust control studies.

The afternoon offers 2 sets of breakout sessions
with multiple presenters. The 1st session choices
are biology of soybean rust; economics and
policy; epidemiology and host response. The
second sessions are application technology;
disease management; forecasting; and monitoring.

The 2nd morning is filled with varying takes on
the present soybean rust situation, followed by
discussion of the long-term perspectives on
soybean rust. The symposium ends at noon 1 Dec 2006.

Participants who register by 20 Oct 2006, event
at the Adam's Mark Hotel in St. Louis receive an
early registration discount. To register,
download and complete the registration form [from
the URL above]. The symposium Web site will carry
the latest event information and has a place to sign up for symposium updates.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease
caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and
was introduced into the USA in 2004. In addition
to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_),
cowpeas, green beans, and other edible legumes
could be affected by the ASR pathogen which
causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu
(_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) is
an important alternate host for the pathogen in southern states of the USA.

New detections reported in this posting of ASR in
specific counties in Louisiana and Georgia bring
to 10 the number of counties in the USA where ASR
has been reported on soybean, mostly in sentinel
and other test plots. There is still no major
outbreak to report in commercial fields. Dry
weather seems to be holding the disease in check
in 2006 and preventative fungicide applications
are probably less than in 2005 so far.

The USDA national commentary recaps on 15 Aug
2006 that: "Currently rust has been found on this
year's soybeans in 10 different counties in 5
states (AL,FL,GA,LA,MS), the rest of the finds
have been on kudzu. A total of 30 counties have
reported rust this year and include 5 in Alabama,
13 in Florida, 6 in Georgia, 4 in Louisiana, one
in Texas, and one in Mississippi."

The American Phytopathological Society is
organizing a Symposium on ASR in November, as it
did in 2005. Information on the program and
registration are at <http://www.apsnet.org/online/SBR/>
