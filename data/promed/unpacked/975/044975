A fresh brucellosis outbreak has been reported in south Armagh
--------------------------------------------------------------
Criminal practises may have been the cause of a brucellosis outbreak
in a south Armagh cattle herd, it has been claimed. The Department of
Agriculture confirmed the re-emergence of the disease on Friday [11
Jun 2010] and in a statement Agriculture Minister Michelle Gildernew
said decent farmers in the area are suffering because of the illegal
activities of a few individuals.

The Minister said: "We know that we have the widespread backing of the
farming community in our efforts to eradicate this disease. I am
determined that the illegal activities of a few self-serving
individuals do not undermine our efforts to eradicate brucellosis.
"There are indications that irresponsible and even criminal practices
are at the heart of this cluster of infection, with decent farmers
having to suffer the consequences."

This recent brucellosis outbreak has exposed the depth of the problem
in South Armagh, particularly in the outlying area of the town of
Keady. Since the start of 2010 8 cases of the disease have been
discovered, 6 of which have been confirmed with 2 awaiting
confirmation. 5 herds were found to have brucellosis reactors between
the months of January and March, however in the last 3 weeks another 3
herds have been highlighted with each showing multiple reactors. The
breakdowns in this area have so far resulted in the depopulation of
more than 300 cattle.

[According to information provided by the Department of Agriculture
and Rural Development in the Northern Ireland Executive (devolved
government), since January 2001 annual testing for bovine brucellosis
(BB, caused by _Brucella abortus_) was reintroduced in the Armagh,
Enniskillen, and Newry divisional areas. Also in 2001, the Brucellosis
Bulk Milk ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay)(BrBME) was
introduced for sampling dairy herds, and cull cow sampling was
introduced at meat plants. In late 2004 pre-movement testing was
introduced. Annual Herd Incidence, as of March 2010, was 0.36 percent.
Northern Ireland suffers from a higher BB infection rate than the rest
of the UK.

Background information on BB and additional data on its situation in
Northern Ireland, including its history there since the 1930's to
present, is available at
