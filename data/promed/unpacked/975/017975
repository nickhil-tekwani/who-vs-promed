NSW [New South Wales state] Health has warned people to protect themselves against mosquitoborne diseases as the weather warms up and people move outdoors. Medical entomologist at NSW Health Pathology, Dr Cameron Webb, said the warmer weather was a time for increasing mosquito activity and it was important to prepare against diseases carried by them such as Ross River and Barmah Forest virus.

There were 9 official notifications of Ross River virus in NSW Between 28 Oct-3 Nov [2018] and 11 in the previous week. 512 cases have been reported so far this year across NSW compared with a total of 1592 during 2017, and 595 in 2016.

NSW has a robust system around the notification of mosquitoborne disease that includes the trapping of mosquitoes to monitor their abundance and the activity of viruses that cause diseases. Mosquito numbers have previously been monitored by NSW Health and other organisations across Sydney, including Bankstown, Blacktown, Georges River, Hawkesbury, Hills Shire, Penrith Ryde, and Sydney Olympic Park.

During 2015 there were 7 confirmed cases of Ross River virus on the Central Coast -- the highest annual figure in the region for the last 5 years. Monitoring of local mosquito numbers was conducted in 2015 and 2016 at Empire Bay, Killcare Heights, Ourimbah, Halekulani, and Charmhaven.

"The incidence of Ross River and Barmah Forest virus infections increases over hotter months, especially with people spending more time outside," Dr Webb said. Dr Webb said these diseases were commoner "in rural and bushy areas around Sydney" but urged people to avoid mosquito and insect bites.

Symptoms usually develop in around 7 to 10 days and can resemble flu, with aches and pains in muscles and joints. There can also be a rash associated with them, and a general feeling of feeling weak or unwell. Most people recover in a few weeks, some will continue to experience symptoms like joint pain and fatigue for many months. There is currently no vaccine for either disease so preventing them means avoiding the bites of mosquitoes that spread them.

Ross River virus infection is the most commonly reported mosquitoborne disease in Australia, with more than 4000 cases of illness are reported every year. Activity has been recorded from every state and territory in the country. And while Ross River virus generally considered a disease of rural regions, it is increasingly active at urban fringes where there are suitable wetlands and other conditions.

[How to avoid mosquito bites]
- Avoid being outside unprotected, particularly during dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.
- When outside cover up as much as possible with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing, and covered footwear.
- Apply mosquito repellent regularly to exposed areas (as directed on the container). Repellents containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) or picaridin are best.
- Do not use repellents on the skin of children under the age of 3 months. Instead, use physical barriers such as netting on prams, cots, and play areas for babies.
- Screen all windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. When camping, use flyscreens, or sleep under mosquito nets.
- Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by getting rid of items that hold water or by emptying the containers.

[This has been a very active season for Ross River virus transmission. As noted in previous comments, Ross River virus [RRV] infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY
