Emergence of fox rabies in north eastern Italy
-----------------------------------------------
On 17 Oct 2008, the national reference centre for rabies at the Istituto
Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie of Legnaro in Padova, Italy,
identified a rabid red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) in the municipality of Resia
(Province of Udine, Northeast of Italy). The fox had bitten a 69 year old
man on the ankle on 10 Oct 2008. The victim received 1st aid assistance and
complete post-exposure treatment at the local health unit. The exposed
person is currently under active health surveillance.

Laboratory analysis
-------------------
A brain sample from the fox initially tested negative in the fluorescent
antibody test (FAT) for rabies virus (RABV). However, the virus was
successfully isolated on murine neuroblastoma cell culture, and was
confirmed as RABV by RT-PCR using specific primers. When the FAT was
repeated on other brain specimens, the test was weakly positive.

The complete open reading frame (1,350 nt) of the gene encoding the
nucleoprotein (N) was sequenced (GenBank Acc. Number FJ424484) and compared
to the sequences available in public databases. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed using the neighbour-joining method with 1000 times bootstrapping,
as implemented by the Mega 4 programme. Phylogenetic analysis identified
the isolate as Lyssavirus genotype 1, "classical" rabies virus, according
to the classification made by Kissi et al, clustered in the Western
European group. As expected, it was closely related to RABV isolated from
eastern neighbouring countries (Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) and shared 99 per cent homology with
the complete N gene sequence of the strain 86111YOU and 100 per cent
homology with a 400 nt fragment of the N gene sequence of the strain
9494SLN, red fox isolates from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia, respectively.

According to the characteristics of the isolate it seems reasonable to
believe that the emergence of sylvatic rabies in north-eastern Italy could
be linked to infection in the bordering territories of Slovenia, although
no cases are currently reported in the area.

Rabies situation in Italy
-------------------------
The north eastern territories of the Italian region of Friuli Venezia
Giulia have been affected by rabies in the 1970s and 1980s, and more
recently in the period from 1991 to 1995. The municipality of Resia was
affected until 1992. At that time, the epidemic of sylvatic rabies was
linked to the epidemiological situation of infection in Austria and the
nearby territories of former Yugoslavia, now Slovenia. For this reason, the
risk of rabies in the northern and eastern border regions of Italy has long
been recognised. The rabies surveillance carried out in that region
accounted for an annual number of 310, 210, 123, 94, and 85 foxes analysed
from 2004 to October 2008, respectively. Vaccination campaigns using oral
rabies vaccine baits have been conducted targeting the wild fox population
in these areas in 1989 and between 1992 and 2004. The last case of rabies
in Italy was diagnosed in a fox in the province of Trieste on the border
with Slovenia in December 1995.

Italy has been classified as rabies-free since 1997. At present, Austria is
rabies free, while in Slovenia, rabies cases in foxes are still being
reported from the south eastern regions bordering Croatia. In this area
oral vaccination campaigns are systematically conducted in the fox
population since the mid-1990s in the framework of a national rabies
eradication programme.

On 27 Oct 2008, a 2nd fox was found dead and diagnosed with rabies in the
municipality of Venzone (Province of Udine), 12 km west to the one infected
earlier the same month. No human exposure has been reported related to this
2nd infected fox.

Measures taken
--------------
Following these outbreaks, the preventative measures implemented in the
affected areas of Italy include compulsory rabies vaccination of dogs and
domestic herbivores at risk of infection (that is, cows, horses, sheep, and
goats kept outdoors), prohibition of hunting with dogs, enhanced
surveillance in the wild animal population and implementation of oral
vaccination of foxes. Furthermore, an informative campaign on the risk for
the local population, as well as visitors and tourists, has been
implemented and a protocol for post-exposure prophylaxis and
recommendations for pre-exposure immunisation for individuals at high risk
(such as hunters, forest workers, game wardens, veterinarians) have been
sent to all health care facilities and medical associations in the affected
area.

[The occurrence of rabies in wildlife within an area declared rabies free
more than a decade ago illuminates the importance of the regional
application of fox oral vaccination. In other words: what your neighbors do
is a crucial issue.

is being applied now, with the indicated locations of the 2 cases, is
