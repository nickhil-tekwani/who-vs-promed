Correction
----------
Part [2] of ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (15): Egypt, drug
resistance 20070118.0238" contains a serious error. The drug resistant
virus isolated from the Egyptian patient exhibited resistance to the
neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir only. This isolate remains sensitive to
the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamir and amantadine, which targets the M2
protein.
The Moderator's comment, based on a misreading of the text, should be
disregarded. [My apologies. - Mod.CP]
