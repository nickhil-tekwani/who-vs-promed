New poppy blight
----------------
A fresh blight is poised to hit Afghanistan's poppy fields this year [2012]. Plant diseases destroyed nearly half the 2010 opium harvest in Afghanistan, the world's biggest producer, but output there rebounded 61 percent in 2011.

"We may anticipate that this year [2012] there will be another plant disease -- maybe not to the same scale as 2010 -- but (it) still may affect, especially in the southern part of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation," the UN said. The report cited indications that [poppy] shortages had encouraged use of other [narcotic] substances.

[Several species of poppy (_Papaver_) are grown for ornamental purposes, but only one (_P. somniferum_) is cultivated as a broadacre [large-scale] crop. Different varieties of _P. somniferum_ with varying flower colours and opiate contents are used to produce poppy seed (a significant food item as ground seed or oil in parts of Eurasia) or narcotics.

In 2010, an undiagnosed blight of opium poppy crops was reported from Afghanistan and the problem appears to have re-emerged. A number of (mainly fungal) pathogens have been reported to affect poppies, but a diagnosis of a causal organism in Afghanistan still does not seem to be available. The situation is considered by some as fortuitous because it has been suggested that such a disease would encourage farmers to plant alternative crops.

However, since highly host species specific pathogens are relatively rare, this disease must rather be considered a serious threat to any other crops planted to replace the poppies and is more likely to cause additional problems in the country, including a potential threat to food security.
