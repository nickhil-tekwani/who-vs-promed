Egypt: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 10
------------------------------------------------
As of 20 Mar 2007, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has
announced a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
infection. The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public
Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3).

The 2-year-old boy from Aswan Governorate developed symptoms on 15
Mar [2007]. He was admitted to hospital the following day where he
remains in a stable condition. Investigations indicate a history of
contact with backyard poultry. No epidemiological link has been found
between this case and that of the 10-year-old girl from the same area
that was announced on 19 Mar 2007.

Of the 26 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 13 have been fatal.

Indonesia: 66th suspected human case of avian influenza
-------------------------------------------------------
A 21-year-old Indonesian woman has died of bird flu, raising the
human death toll in the country from the virus to 66, a Health
Ministry official has said. Indonesia, which has millions of backyard
fowl, has the world's highest human death toll from bird flu.

The woman died on Monday [19 Mar 2007] in a hospital in East Java's
Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, Nyoman Kandun, Director
General of Communicable Disease Control at the Health Ministry, told
Reuters. "We had hoped that she would survive as her condition was
getting better a few days ago, but later it got worse and she died,"
Kandun said. The woman had been confirmed last week as having the
H5N1 bird flu virus, he said, adding Indonesia has now had 66 deaths
from 86 cases of the disease.

Bird flu is endemic in fowl in many of the 33 provinces in Indonesia,
the world's fourth most populous country with 220 million people, and
there was a sudden increase in the number of human deaths from the
virus early this year after a brief lull. The country has tried to
control bird flu by banning backyard fowl in Jakarta and surrounding
provinces, and increasing culling. Although H5N1 avian flu mostly
affects birds, the big concern is that it could mutate into a disease
that easily passes between people, triggering a global pandemic.
