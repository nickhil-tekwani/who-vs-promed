An outbreak of malaria and dengue fever has killed at least 14 people and
has infected more than 14 000 others in Ecuador, health officials said
Wednesday. The Health Ministry called for a medical state of emergency in
17 of Ecuador's 23 provinces, along the Pacific coast and in interior
jungle regions bordering Peru and Colombia.
So far 14 192 cases of malaria have been confirmed, and six people have
died. Health officials also detected 220 cases [eight deaths of dengue,
known to many as break-bone fever because of the excruciating muscle and
joint pains it causes, said Jorge Zambrano, Director of the National Health
Center director.
The last outbreak in Ecuador occurred in 1997 and 1998 during the El Nino
weather phenomenon, which ravaged this small Andean nation of 12 million
people with heavy flooding -- creating a perfect environment for mosquitoes.
