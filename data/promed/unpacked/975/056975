[Dr Flahault has kindly provided ProMED-mail with this summary of
chikungunya mortality on La Reunion Island. - Mod.TY]

From March 2005 to the end of September 2006, 266 000 cases of chikungunya
were estimated by InVS (Institut de Veille Sanitaire, French-CDC) to have
occurred in La Reunion (France), with 760 000 inhabitants. 273 serious
cases (immediately life threatening condition) have been reported among the
cases, in patients aged over 10 days (59 per cent were 65+ years old).
Chikungunya was proven in 246 serious cases; 101 patients had
co-morbidities, and 27 per cent of confirmed cases eventually died. In
addition, 44 cases of mother-to-child infections were reported, and 40 were
confirmed (one died).
To date, in 248 death certificates, chikungunya was reported as the direct
or indirect cause of death, with a median age of 79, range 0-102, and a
sex-ratio (M/F) of 0.95. InVS, in collaboration with Inserm (French NIH),
also reported (by 6 Jun 2006) a significant excess of mortality (from all
causes) during the major outbreak, which occurred from December 2005 (+10
per cent) to April 2006 (10.1 percent), with a peak of excess mortality
reached in February 2006 (+34.4 per cent) concomitant to the peak of incidence.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Flahault for sending this information. Dr
Flahault is head of the French task force on research on dengue, DHF, and
chikungunya, head of the Department of Public Health, AP-HP, Hopital Tenon;
and director of the WHO collaborating centre for electronic disease
surveillance in Paris, France. The information that he provided clearly
indicates that chikungunya in a massive epidemic can be a cause of death
(COD) in a significant number of cases. This report also underscores the
need for laboratory confirmation of chikungunya virus infection as the COD
where concomitant infections occur and where other infectious diseases that
produce similar symptoms, such as dengue fever/DHF, may be co-circulating
in the same population. - Mod.TY]
