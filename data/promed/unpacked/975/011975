Date: 10 May 2001
From: Martin Hugh-Jones <mehj@mail.vetmed.lsu.edu>

I have been informed by Fred Brown <burrage@cshore.com> that Tetracore has
developed a handheld real-time PCR kit capable of identifying FMDv (Foot
and Mouth Disease virus) at the level of 100 target molecules in infected
animals; the kit weighs about 27 pounds so it is readily portable. Their
current trials at PIADC (Plum Island Animal Disease Center) involving
experimentally infected animals of various species stabled with susceptible
animals are going very successfully; virus has been demonstrated, as one
would expect, in the sentinel animals before they showed signs of disease.
Earlier this year the equipment was demonstrated by a company officer, Bill
Nelson, on UK TV "Tomorrow's World" with Bill bleeding a sheep.
