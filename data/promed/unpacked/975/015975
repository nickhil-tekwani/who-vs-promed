Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments:
- Outbreak 1 (Aomori): on 28 Nov 2016, the local veterinary service in Aomori Prefecture received a notification from a domestic duck farm on an increase in the number of dead birds (10 birds on the same day). The samples were sent to the laboratory of local veterinary service (Aomori Livestock Hygiene Service Centre) and the samples from dead birds were confirmed to be influenza A virus positive by antigen-capture kits. On the same day, the Centre started RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5.
- Outbreak 2 (Niigata): on 28 Nov 2016, the local veterinary service in Niigata Prefecture received a notification from a domestic hen farm on an increase in the number of dead birds (60 birds on the same day). The samples were sent to the laboratory of local veterinary service (Niigata Livestock Hygiene Service Centre) and the samples from dead birds were confirmed to be influenza A virus positive by antigen-capture kits. On the same day, the Centre started RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5.
For both outbreaks: stamping-out policy was applied to the affected farms. Destruction of all the susceptible birds in the affected farms is being implemented. Movement restrictions are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3 km [2 mi] of the affected farms. Shipment restrictions are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3-10 km [6 mi] of the affected farms. The N-type has not yet been identified.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestations; quarantine; stamping out; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Although the neuraminidase has not been typed, these 2 new outbreaks could be related to the HPAI H5N6 detections recently reported by Japan. HPAI H5N6 was reported to occur in wild birds in the prefecture of Akita on 22 Nov 2016. See posting 20161122.4647818. - Mod.CRD
