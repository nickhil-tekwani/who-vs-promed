At the beginning of November [2022], Animal's Health reported the detection of an anthrax outbreak in Asturias, in the municipality of Cangas de Onís, in a cattle farm with 136 susceptible animals. Now [21 Nov 2022], the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) has confirmed a secondary focus of anthrax on a farm in the same municipality, with 152 susceptible cattle and 3 affected.

This is the fourth outbreak of anthrax detected in Spain this year [2022]. Both the outbreaks in Asturias have been detected in cattle, whereas the other two outbreaks detected this year, in the province of Badajoz in Extremadura, were in sheep. Also, this year a veterinarian contracted the disease, possibly after performing a necropsy on a cow.

In 2021, Extremadura suffered several cases of anthrax that also affected some people. This situation led the Cáceres Veterinary College to issue an urgent statement asking veterinarians in the region to take extreme precautions when carrying out necropsies on these animals.

Anthrax is a notifiable disease, included in the EDO list of the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), control measures basically consist of the implementation of biosecurity measures and the vaccination of susceptible animals.

The previous outbreak in Onís was detected in the pastures of Cabañayu and Canos [and led to] vaccinating the animals housed there and establishing a 3-week quarantine from the date of vaccination for those that had not yet come to the area. The Ministry of Rural Affairs also warned that any sudden death of animals would have to be immediately notified to the official veterinary services. It was also recalled that vaccinated animals could not be slaughtered (for consumption) until 2 weeks had passed since the date of vaccination.

[This reappearance of livestock anthrax in Spain is definitely puzzling, and I hope that their veterinary specialists are investigating it thoroughly. If they can find a probable cause and source, they can then design their control and surveillance programme to better prevent any more outbreaks. In the meanwhile, livestock in these affected areas, both on the affected farms and in neighbouring farms, must be vaccinated. This will have to be repeated for some 5 years to prevent recurrences and cases from latent infections.

They should not ignore the need to genetically identify the strains involved, as this can be very helpful, especially if the source involves either contaminated hay or feed. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
