The 4 year old boy who travelled to Africa to support his father in a
charity bike race died after contracting a rare disorder that shut
down all his organs. The boy went with his mother to watch his father
take part in a 330 mile [531 km] ride to raise money for the Kisiizi
Hospital, in Kabale, Uganda. But the energetic infant contracted
haemolytic uraemic syndrome [HUS] and, after initial treatment at the
hospital his father was fundraising for, he was taken to the Kenyan
capital Nairobi -- where he died.

[The boy was transferred by] air ambulance to Gertrude's Children's
Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. But his condition deteriorated and he died
on Mon 25 Jul 2011.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a triad of microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. It is
the commonest cause of acute renal failure in children and its
incidence appears to be growing worldwide.

Typical (or infection-induced) HUS is most commonly associated with
_Escherichia coli_ with somatic (O) antigen 157 and flagellar (H)
antigen 7 -- hence the designation O157:H7. It produces a toxin called
Shiga toxin or verotoxin -- hence, alternative names are Shiga
toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) or verotoxin-producing _E. coli_
(VTEC). HUS is a systemic disease caused by damage arising from the
circulating toxin which binds to endothelial receptors, particularly
in the renal, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems. Thrombin
and fibrin are deposited in the microvasculature. This occurs early in
the disease, prior even to the development of HUS and may be why
antibiotics confer no benefit. Erythrocytes are damaged as they pass
through partially occluded small vessels and subsequent haemolysis
occurs. Platelets are sequestered but without the cascade of clotting
factors as in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Other pathogens may induce HUS, including bacteria such as
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Shigella dysenteriae_ type 13 as well
as some viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and
coxsackieviruses. Atypical HUS can be caused by exposure to certain
medications (such as ciclosporin, tacrolimus), genetic mutations in
the complement pathway 4 and systemic conditions including lupus,
cancer, and pregnancy.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a rare disorder with an annual
incidence of 6.1 cases per 100 000 children aged under 5 years
(compared with an overall incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 100 000). Over
90 per cent of cases in children are secondary to infection. O157:H7
causes haemorrhagic colitis but only about 3-15 per cent of cases
progress to HUS. Cases may be sporadic or occur as part of larger
outbreaks. The largest documented outbreak in England occurred in
Cumbria in 1999, and was associated with pasteurised milk. It affected
114 people.

About 10 per cent of HUS cases are atypical and are not caused by
Shiga toxin-producing bacteria or streptococci. Patients without
evidence of underlying infection should be fully investigated, in
particular looking for complement gene mutations. HUS occurs worldwide
but is less widely reported in countries with less developed medical
services. (Extracted from Patient.co.uk

This diagnosis leaves open the questions of the causation of the boy's
HUS. - Mod.CP

We have learned from a reliable source that there is no evidence of
Ebola in the region of Uganda where this took place. No other cases of
HUS have been reported from the hospital. - Mod.LM]
