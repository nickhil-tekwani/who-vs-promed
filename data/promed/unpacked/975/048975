In addition a national oral vaccination program has dropped the number of
rabies cases in Austria to 0 (1 case 1998). It has only to be kept in mind
that the countries surrounding Austria (mainly bordering in the North, East
and South) still do have a substantial problem with rabies, so that attacks
by animals near these borders should lead to PEP anyway.
