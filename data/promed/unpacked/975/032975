Foot-and-mouth disease kills over 1600 cattle in Champassak province
--------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 1600 head of cattle have been killed in the past one month
in the 10 districts of Champassak province. According to a source from
this southernmost province, today the outbreak of the disease has
declined.

The Livestock and Fishery Division, Agriculture and Forestry Service
of Champassak province, disclosed on 2 Feb 2011 that the province
dispatched its technical officers to work with local farmers at
villages in the districts to help them combat the outbreak of the
disease.

The limit in funding and necessary equipment was attributed to the
main cause of the outbreak, said the Livestock and Fishery Division.

Over 200 cattle in Champassak die of foot-and-mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease killed more than 200 cattle including 89
buffaloes and 131 cows in Champassak district, province of the same
name, between last December [2010] and early January [2011], according
to Head of the Agriculture and Forestry Office of Champassak district
Savath Keobandith.

The disease also infected more than 8800 cattle in the district
during the period, which has caused an estimated loss of about 400
million kip [about 50 000 USD] to local people.

Most of the dead cattle were young buffaloes and cows, according to
Mr. Savath. "The most severe scenes of infection were reported in the
villages of Donthalad, Nongvien, Houai Ngeun, Nongpham and Nongtae."

The Agriculture and Forestry Office in cooperation with relevant
officials have encouraged people to prevent the disease outbreak and
cure infected cattle and imposed ban on the consumption of the meat of
dead or infected cattle, or cattle dying of unidentified causes by
relevant officials.

"If cattle die, they should be burned or buried. Do not move the
carcasses to other places," advised Mr Savath.

Champassak province now has over 15 600 buffaloes, 14 300 cows, 9500
pigs and 2000 sheep.

[The 2 newswires of the KPL Lao News Agency included in this post
report that FMD was the cause of massive cattle mortality in the
Champassak province, which is situated at the very south of Laos,
bordering Cambodia and Thailand. Within 3 days, different data were
provided by the same source: on 11 Feb 2011 (item 1), the given number
of dead cattle was 1600; 3 days earlier (item 2) the report stated
that "FMD killed over 200 cattle including 89 buffaloes and 131 cows
in Champassak between last December (2010) and early January (2011)".
In case the figures are right, a significant increase of the mortality
has been observed.

According to the website of the "SEAFMD Campagne", coordinating the
control of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in South East Asia, not a
single case of FMD has been reported from Laos between Jan 2010 and
(inclusive) Jan 2011. The countries cooperating in SEAFMD, under
auspices of the OIE, include Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam (see
<http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd>).

On 4 Feb 2011, the Vientiane Times reported that about 200 cow and
buffalo calves, aged between 1 and 6 months, died in 9 villages in Aed
district, Houaphan province, following infection of a disease which
caused mouth lesions. According to a laboratory investigation into the
cause of death, "the animals did not die from foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] or as a result of the recent cold weather but from a mouth
infection" (see 20110206.0417). Houaphan province is situated in
north-east Laos, bordering Vietnam, about 600 km distant from
Champassak.

A clearer and authoritative information on the FMD situation in Laos,
and an explanation to the pending request for information on the
"non-FMD mouth lesions" which caused mortality in Houaphan, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
