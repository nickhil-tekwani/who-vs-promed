ENTEROVIRUS EPIDEMIC DEATH TOLL HITS 55
Taipei, July 2 (CNA) The death toll of an enterovirus epidemic striking
Taiwan rose to 55 Thursday when China Medical College Hospital in central
Taichung reported another death believed to have been caused by the virus.
H. M. Hsu, vice director of the Department of Health's Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control, said that 39 children with the virus remained
hospitalized as of Thursday while 182 had been allowed to go home.
The latest deaths resulted from infections contracted before June 18, an
indication that the spread of the child-killing virus has slowed, Hsu said.
The DOH announced on Wednesday that it will set up a national virus
research center at National Cheng Kung University Hospital in southern
Tainan City.
The DOH said it chose Tainan as the center's location because virus
epidemics usually break out in central or southern Taiwan. So far Changhua
and Taichung counties in central Taiwan have been hardest hit by the
enterovirus epidemic, which started in February. (By Flor Wang)
