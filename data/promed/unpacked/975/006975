The 1st victim was a premature boy in the intensive care unit whose mother noticed a mysterious irritation in his groin; it grew into an open wound burrowing into the baby's abdomen. The last patient to die was a 10-year-old girl, whose face was ravaged; 3 other patients at Children's Hospital [in New Orleans] were also stricken, including a 13-year-old boy who his parents said endured over 20 surgical procedures in 54 days in a futile effort to save him. Like the others, the 13-year-old, arrived at Children's Hospital battling a serious illness before being overwhelmed by an infection. "What haunts me more than anything is thinking about what he suffered," said [the 13 year-old's father].

The children died of various causes between August 2008 and July 2009 during an outbreak of a flesh-eating fungal infection, mucormycosis, most likely spread by bed linens, towels, or gowns, according to a medical journal. The disclosure this month [April 2014] caused new pain for the families of the children and raised troubling questions about how the infections came about, why doctors did not connect the cases until more than 10 months after the 1st death, and what obligation the hospital had to inform parents -- and the community -- of the outbreak.

That may be because of changes in the environment and a larger pool of vulnerable people with suppressed immune systems because patients are living longer with serious illnesses. An estimated 75 000 patients with infections picked up in healthcare facilities die in hospitals each year, according to figures released last month [March 2014] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The outbreak may have spread unchecked, at least in part, because of lapses in the hospital's infection controls and sloppy handling of contaminated linens, according to a review of emails, patient records, legal testimony from hospital and laundry staff, and interviews with doctors, lawyers, federal health officials, hospital administrators, and patients' families.

Workers unloaded clean linens on the same dock where medical waste was removed, moved clean and soiled linens on the same carts, and stored linens in hospital hallways covered in dust from a nearby construction site, court records indicated. CDC investigators did not fault the hospital for failing to move more quickly to detect the outbreak, noting that the infections occurred weeks or months apart in different areas of the hospital. Still, there were problems, records and interviews showed. With one of the 5 children, a doctor allegedly agreed to biopsy an infected spot only after a nurse and the parents insisted. And the hospital's infection investigators did not become involved for months because their threshold for reviewing cases excluded some of the 5 deaths.

In a city where so many institutions had failed its citizens -- a former mayor convicted of bribery, a police department tainted by charges of brutality, schools where student performance was historically abysmal -- Children's Hospital was well respected. It cared for New Orleans's sickest young patients, from those living in the poorest precincts like the Lower Ninth Ward to those from the hospital's genteel neighborhood uptown. But now, Children's Hospital is accused of breaking faith with the community. Much of the anger has focused on what a local newspaper, The Times-Picayune, charged in an editorial was an "appalling" failure to alert the public and a "lack of urgency" that slowed the discovery of the outbreak.

Hospital officials first suspected they had a problem in late June 2009, and in the weeks after alerted state and federal health officials, but few others. They contacted the children's families only after the journal article "Mucormycosis Outbreak Associated With Hospital Linens" appeared in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal [1]. (The article did not identify the hospital, but a local television station, WVUE, disclosed it based on a tip from a local doctor, Brobson Lutz.)

"We failed to do what we should have done, pure and simple," Dr John F Heaton, the hospital's associate medical director, said during a news conference this month [April 2014], in which he acknowledged that the infections most likely contributed to the children's deaths.

In response to several unrelated outbreaks in recent years, the CDC started an initiative to help hospitals and health departments communicate with the public about medical errors and infections acquired in healthcare facilities. Abbigail Tumpey, who leads the effort, said that while it is important to avoid scaring away patients, hospitals that are open about problems and the steps taken to remedy them have built public trust. Children's Hospital is trying to be more transparent, but for some, it is too late.

A baby born prematurely at 26 weeks would eventually be identified by investigators as Case No 1. But because the infant had been critically ill before contracting mucormycosis -- in its severe form the fatality rate tops 90 percent, and it primarily afflicts patients with compromised immune systems -- it was not considered a primary cause in his August 2008 death. Even though Children's Hospital had not had a single incident of hospital-acquired mucormycosis for at least 15 years, [the baby]'s case did not raise alarms or become labeled a sentinel event, which would have set off an inquiry.

Dr Rodolfo Esteban Begue, who headed the hospital's infection control committee, said later in a deposition that he was not aware of the case. Even though mucormycosis had caused rare hospital outbreaks elsewhere, his committee had not included it in its quarterly reviews of hospital infections, and it was not among the diseases hospitals must report to the government.

When [the 13-year-old] came to the emergency room 6 months later, with a recurrence of a cancer-like condition that causes widespread tissue damage, his parents still expected he would return home to his siblings, his book collection, and his chess sets. By March 2009, though, his immune system was suppressed by chemotherapy, his health precarious. That month, [the 13 year-old]'s mother noticed a small black spot in his armpit. In operations, sometimes just a day apart, doctors chased the infection -- cutting underneath [his] arm and into a 2nd site in his lower back. To repair the defects, they moved skin and muscle from his chest and thigh and operated on his belly, performing a colostomy. "After his skin graft, his pain was quite intensified," doctors noted. He died of multiple causes on 17 May 2009. Dr Begue helped treat [the boy] and asked for a review of infection control procedures regarding his treatment, but did not consider opening a wider inquiry, he said later.

While [the 13-year-old] had been struggling, another premature baby received a diagnosis of mucormycosis and died in a different part of the hospital, but Dr Begue did not learn of the case. In late June [2009], [a 10-year-old] admitted for heart surgery also fell victim to the infection. Hospital personnel began swabbing various surfaces to determine the source, which struck one more patient, an 11-year-old girl, who died the day after her diagnosis. One of the doctors decided to test the linens.

Fungi thrive in moist environments, and the 40 000-square-foot [3 716 sq m] washing warehouse owned by the hospital's off-site launderer, TLC Linen Services, was just that. The laundry sits several blocks from Lake Pontchartrain on a dirt road in the city's Ninth Ward. The owners, who declined interview requests, replaced drywall and flooring after the levee failures caused by Hurricane Katrina brought in water. But [they] never tested to verify that the plant was free of mold, records showed. The company, which was not accredited by the main voluntary group that inspects healthcare laundries, also lacked proper filters on ventilation fans to block spores and dust from the street, records showed. There was also reason to suspect that the outbreak was due to myriad problems with the way hospital workers handled linens, court documents showed. (3 patients' families have filed lawsuits; one was settled.)

In the rare instances when linens have been associated with transmitting illnesses, the problem is usually caused by improper transportation or storage, said Lisa Waldowski, an infection control specialist with the Joint Commission, the organization that accredits most American hospitals. Hospitals typically do not sterilize linens, except those used in operating rooms. Hospital bed sheets and towels typically are washed and bleached to reach the same standard of cleanliness as hotel laundry. One key difference is that medical linens are supposed to be wrapped in bags or cellophane for transport.

Starting in 2007, TLC managers complained in meetings and emails about how Children's Hospital housekeepers were handling the linens. Washcloths were being used as "cleaning rags" to wipe down bathrooms, TLC said. Laundry workers had to fish bags of dirty towels and sheets out of hospital trash bins. Trash was being put in linen carts and linens in trash carts. Especially frustrating, TLC managers said in a deposition, was that, in violation of industry and federal guidelines, the head of housekeeping, Glenn Cobb, told them in 2007 to stop delivering the clean linens in sealed bags.

"I didn't agree with it," Charles LeBourgeois, a co-owner of TLC, said in the deposition. The plastic bags were cumbersome for the housekeeping staff and getting caught in cart wheels, he recalled being told by Mr Cobb, who did not respond to interview requests. It was only after dust from nearby construction sullied linens that the hospital agreed to allow TLC to cover the carts. Mr LeBourgeois testified that he had discovered workers at the hospital washing bed linens in a machine there after the outbreak -- using a method intended for cleaning floor mops. He said he had explained that the chemicals were too weak and the water temperatures too low to be hygienic. "Oh, my god," he recalled Mr Cobb saying. "So, we are not getting them clean?"

In recent weeks, hospital officials have emphasized the protective measures that they have taken, like re-sterilizing key areas of the hospital, including where linens were stored, and changing the site where they were delivered. The hospital now uses sterile linens for sick infants, cancer patients, and other highly vulnerable patients. It also now wraps linens for transport.

Dr Heaton also pledged that the hospital would fully disclose any adverse event or hospital-acquired condition that affects any of its patients. [The 13-year-old's] father said such measures might have saved his son and other patients. "Perhaps it will inspire other institutions to be more vigilant."

[The news report above concerns an outbreak of hospital-associated mucormycosis at Children's Hospital of New Orleans that involved 5 patients over 11 months, all of whom died. The 5 patients had significant co-morbidities. The cases occurred on different hospital wards, and hospital linens were the only exposure shared among all 5 patients. The patients were infected with _Rhizopus delemar_, which was also identified in 26 (42 per cent) of 62 environmental samples collected from clean linen and related areas, and in 1 (4 per cent) of 25 samples taken from non-linen related items. ProMED-mail previously posted a report of this outbreak (Mucormycosis - USA: (LA) 2009, hospital linen, fatal 20140411.2397880), but the news report above describes the lapses in hospital infection control in greater detail.

Children's Hospital of New Orleans is a 201-bed, non-profit children's hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana. The main hospital is located in the University District of Uptown New Orleans, on the city's old high ground, which escaped the flooding of most of the city in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005; the hospital suffered no flood damage and negligible wind damage during the storm and was fully reopened over a month later in October 2005 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital_of_New_Orleans).

Mucormycosis is the name given to infections caused by _Mucorales_, which includes species of the following genera: _Rhizopus_, _Rhizomucor_, _Mucor_, _Apophysomyces_ and _Cunninghamella_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, such as soil and decaying vegetable matter. Although most individuals are exposed to these fungi daily, usually mucormycosis occurs in individuals with predisposing medical conditions such as immunosuppression and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, necrotizing soft tissue mucormycoses have been described in immunocompetent individuals as a result of traumatic injuries following tornados, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions (see ProMED-mail post Mucormycosis, fatal - USA: (MO) tornado-related 20110612.1789).

Nosocomial mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of healthcare-associated procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surfaces, ingestion of contaminated material, or inhalation of aerosolized fungal spores.

An outbreak is defined as the occurrence of more cases of disease than expected in a given area or among a specific group of people over a particular period of time (http://www.cdc.gov/osels/scientific_edu/ss1978/Lesson6/Section2.html). However, even a single case of an unusual hospital-associated infection, such as mucormycosis, would require an investigation to identify a source or route of transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/osels/scientific_edu/ss1978/Lesson6/Section1.html#_ref6). Many hospital infection control practitioners review microbiologic isolates to identify such occurrences. To accomplish this, there must be close, on-going collaboration with the hospital microbiology laboratory.

The epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak was published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal and is referenced above. The abstract is available at http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Citation/2014/05000/Mucormycosis_Outbreak_Associated_With_Hospital.9.aspx. The authors emphasized that "when mucormycosis occurs in hospitalized patients, particularly when several cases occur in a temporally clustered manner or share an unusual presentation, attempts should be made to identify a mold source or route of transmission for which control measures can be implemented." Their findings underscore the importance of proper handling and storage of clean hospital linens. They concluded, "hospital linens should be laundered, packaged, shipped, and stored in a manner that minimizes exposure to environmental contaminants." - Mod.ML
