Victoria's chief health officer Dr Graham Rouch was cited as saying today
that laboratory testing had shown the cluster of Legionnaires' cases in the
Moonee Ponds area, in Melbourne's north-west, was "most likely linked" to
the cooling tower of Caseready Meats.
The story noted that a 73-year-old woman died and four other people were
identified as carrying the illness late last month and earlier this month,
leading to the closure and disinfection of the Caseready Meats tower and
the Moonee Ponds Australian Tax Office (ATO) tower.
Dr Rouch was further cited as saying in a statement that tests from two of
the five people infected had shown the _Legionella_ type they were carrying
was the same as that identified in the meat manufacturer's tower.
