Packages of franks and cheeseburgers are voluntarily being recalled by
separate companies because of potential _Listeria_ contamination.
Florida-based Dixie Packers Inc., is recalling more than 100 000 pounds
of
franks and Hormel Food Corporation is pulling its 4.8-ounce packages of
Quick Meal frozen cheeseburgers. Both products may be contaminated by
_Listeria monocytogenes_. The bacteria were discovered during routine
testing.
The recalled cheeseburger sandwiches were distributed in retail stores
in
Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The
product
comes in a 4.8-ounce package with lot number 09248E.
The recalled franks were distributed to Winn-Dixie grocery stores in
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
Some of the franks were also distributed to the Bahamas.
All of the recalled products have a sell-by date of 13 Nov 1998 and a
label inside the USDA inspection seal that reads either "Est. 1415M" for
beef products or "P-6655" for poultry products [= chicken hot dogs.
[These involve beef, turkey, pork, & chicken products - Mod.MHJ
