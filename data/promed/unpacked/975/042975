Joint FAO/WHO/OIE Statement on influenza A(H1N1) and the safety of pork
-----------------------------------------------
To avoid any misunderstanding FAO, WHO and OIE would like to reissue
their joint statement originally issued on 30 Apr 2009.

In the ongoing spread of influenza A(H1N1), concerns about the
possibility of this virus being found in pigs and the safety of pork
and pork products have been raised.

Influenza viruses are not known to be transmissible to people through
eating processed pork or other food products derived from pigs.

Heat treatments commonly used in cooking meat (e.g. 70 C/160 F core
temperature) will readily inactivate any viruses potentially present
in raw meat products.

Pork and pork products, handled in accordance with good hygienic
practices recommended by the WHO, Codex Alimentarius Commission, and
the OIE, will not be a source of infection.

Authorities and consumers should ensure that meat from sick pigs or
pigs found dead are not processed or used for human consumption under
any circumstances.

[The "joint statement originally issued on 30 Apr 2009" is probably
the following one, found on the website of the OIE at
<http://oie.int/eng/press/en_090503.htm>:

"Joint WTO/OIE/WHO/FAO statement on A/H1N1 influenza
-----------------------------------------------
The following statement was issued jointly on 2 May 2009 by the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the World Trade Organization.

In light of the spread of influenza A/H1N1, and the rising concerns
about the possibility of this virus being found in pigs and the
safety of pork and pork products, we stress that pork and pork
products, handled in accordance with good hygienic practices
recommended by the WHO, FAO, Codex Alimentarius Commission and the
OIE, will not be a source of infection.

To date, there is no evidence that the virus is transmitted by food.
There is currently, therefore, no justification in the OIE
Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Code for the imposition of trade
measures on the importation of pigs or their products.

However, it is important that Veterinary Authorities should
collaborate with human health counterparts to monitor pig herds for
any signs of unusual illness with suspected linkages to human cases
of A/H1N1 influenza."

The issuance of an updated joint statement is timely and welcomed in
view of some confusion caused by the recent publication of
contradictory statements by individual organizations and is related
to the discovery of an H1N1-infected pig farm in Alberta, Canada.
Reportedly, the virus was introduced into the said herd on 12 Apr
2009 by a person who returned from Mexico. Tests in humans and
animals from the said herd are not yet convincingly final; see ProMED
posts 20090502.1653, 20090505.1683, 20090505.1680, and 20090506.1691,
as well as "People on Alta. pig farm where swine flu found test
negative for virus," 6 May 2009, by Helen Branswell, The Canadian Press, at
<http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/SwineFlu/2009/05/06/9373066.html>.

One should keep in mind that the current outbreak of the novel,
swine-related (A)H1N1 influenza virus -- already officially reported
from 24 countries in 4 continents (Africa remaining the only
continent where no such information has yet become available) -- is
unprecedented. Since there are still serious gaps in the knowledge
about the virus, its epidemiology and pathogenicity, communicating
clear, unanimously accepted and scientifically-based information and
advice to the public is complex. Experimental infection trials in
animals and other research activities have already been initiated,
and their anticipated results will, hopefully, ease the task of the
public health, animal health and food safety authorities in their
Risk Communication efforts.
