Analysis of samples taken from 218 Brazilian equids showing clinical signs of nervous or behavioural changes revealed that 37 of them, or 17 percent, had rabies.

The researchers from the Biological Institute and the Pasteur Institute, both in Sao Paulo, set out to learn more about the causes of brain inflammation and related brain disorders in equines.

Elenice Maria Sequetin Cunha and her colleagues obtained samples from equines with disorders of the central nervous system for investigation.

Viral, prothozoal and bacterial infections were diagnosed by direct methods. Microscopic tissue examinations were performed for studying inflammatory and degenerative disorders in the central nervous system.

Aside from the 37 samples that were positive for rabies, the researchers found that another 13 (6 percent) were positive for the presence of protozoal infections - _Sarcocystis neurona_ (1) and _Toxoplasma gondii_ (12).

3 samples (1.4 percent) were positive for equine herpesvirus type 1 myeloencephalopathy, and 24 (11 percent) for bacterial encephalitis.

20 cases of leukoencephalomalacia, triggered by the ingestion of a toxin from corn infected by a fungus, were detected, representing 9.2 percent of the animals; while 1 was found to have cryptococcal myelomeningoencephalitis, i.e., fungal meningitis.

The researchers, writing in the Journal of Equine Veterinary Science, said diagnosis was conclusive in 45 percent of samples, indicating that other infectious and even non-infectious origins of brain inflammation and other disorders should be considered for investigation.

Sequetin Cunha was joined in the research by Maria do Carmo Custodio de Souza Hunold Lara, Eliana Monteforte Cassaro Villalobos, Alessandra Figueiredo de Castro Nassar, Claudia Del Fava, Eloisa Scannapieco and Mariana Sequetin Cunha, all from the Biological Institute; and Enio Mori from the Pasteur Institute.

[Just because an animal has neurological signs, one should not automatically conclude that rabies is the cause. Rather, an examination by a veterinarian and a thorough history should be taken. The differential list for diseases producing neurological diseases in horses can be long, as this article listed several. Rabies should always be on the differential list when dealing with any animal with neurological signs. - Mod.TG
