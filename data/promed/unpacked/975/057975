A case of [a] hantavirus [infection], the 1st this year in Herrera province, was confirmed by the health authorities in this region of the country. The individual involved is a 28 year old patient, resident in the Monagrillo neighborhood of Chitre, who is suspected to have acquired infection outside this region, specifically in the area of Tres Quebradas in Los Santos province.

The patient is currently receiving intensive care in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitré, and investigations suggest that he could have contracted the disease 2 weeks ago in a visit to [Los Santos].

The minister of health himself, Miguel Mayo, confirmed this situation during a visit to this region in Herrera, and stated that one expects this disease to occur, mainly in this season of the year. "We are having more cases of hantavirus [infection], as was suspected by the Gorgas Commerative Institute [national reference laboratory]. The people have to take care of their health since the mouse [virus reservoir] is here and the virus has arrived to stay," Mayo indicated.

According to what he indicated, surveillance was done in the surroundings of the house of the patient and thus determined that this could be a case exported from an endemic area and not locally. The minister of MINSA [Ministry of Health] said that they are continuing analysis of mice found in the Azuero region, as part of the strategy to fight the disease.

During 2018, in the Azuero [peninsula] area there have been 12 cases of hantavirus [infections], 11 in Los Santos [province] and one in Herrera [province].

[Apparently, this individual probably became infected in the Los Santos province, but was hospitalized in Herrera province. That suspicion is well founded, since his visit to Los Santos fits the usual incubation period of the disease and Los Santos has been the locality of several cases so far this year [2018]. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. There have been 11 cases so far this year [2018] and last year [2017] ended with 23 cases, 16 with [hantavirus] fever and 7 with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The specific situations in which the patients acquired their infections are not mentioned. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva.
