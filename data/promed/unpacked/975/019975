Nine locations around Riverton [Wyoming] have been quarantined due to a virus that can cause painful sores in infected animals.

The Ranger of Riverton reports (<http://bit.ly/1jcPPG8) that all Wyoming ranchers may have a limited ability to move and sell their animals because of the vesicular stomatitis outbreak.

The virus primarily affects horses and cattle but can also affect sheep, goats, swine, llamas, bison and other animals. State veterinarian Jim Logan says it is not a human safety risk.

About 20 locations in the state are currently under quarantine due to vesicular stomatitis. Over the year, 80 in 9 Wyoming counties have been quarantined.

The disease, which is thought to be spread by insects that migrate along river valleys, can cause blisters, sores, sloughing of skin and lameness in animals.

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) has confirmed additional cases of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in Panhandle horses.

State Veterinarian Dr. Dennis Hughes said NDA has confirmed a total of 5 cases, including the case from last week. Four of those cases are in Scotts Bluff County and 1 is in Sioux County. Five additional cases, 4 in Scotts Bluff County and 1 in Lincoln County, are being investigated with test results pending.

Hughes said the additional cases are not unexpected, based on transmission patterns in other states where the disease is present, and he is encouraging horse and cattle owners to take precautions, particularly with animals that may be comingling with other animals at events over the next several months.

"We just want owners to be aware of the cases and consider taking precautions, especially now that we know the disease is spreading in Nebraska," Hughes said. "The primary way the virus is transmitted is from biting insects or midges, so consider treatments to reduce flies and mosquitoes in quarters where animals are housed. We also want owners to be cognizant of the fact that VS also can be spread by nose-to-nose contact between animals."

VS is a viral disease which primarily affects horses and cattle, but can also affect sheep, goats and swine. It causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves and teats. As a result of the lesions, infected animals may refuse to eat and drink, which leads to severe weight loss. NDA has quarantined the livestock on all affected farms.

"The virus itself usually runs its course in 5 to 7 days, and it can take up to an additional 7 days for that infected animal to recover from the signs." said Hughes.

Hughes said Colorado, Wyoming and South Dakota all have VS cases at this time, and several of the Wyoming cases are near the Nebraska Panhandle border. "The case we are investigating in Lincoln County involved a horse that recently had been in a competition in Wyoming," Hughes said.

Hughes said that because of the confirmed VS finding, he and officials for the Aksarben Horse Show, scheduled for this weekend at the Lancaster Event Center in Lincoln, and the Aksarben Stock Show and Rodeo, scheduled for Sept. 24-27, in Omaha, have agreed to put in place new requirements for horse and cattle exhibitors. Horses arriving at the shows from anywhere within Nebraska will need to have seen a veterinarian within 48 hours. The 48-hour rule also will apply to any cattle coming to the show from the Nebraska Panhandle counties. Hughes is encouraging the managers of other livestock exhibitions and events to consider similar requirements.

"Unfortunately, until cold weather moves in, VS will be a threat," Hughes said. Freezing temperatures kill the insects that spread the virus.

[How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.

In people, the disease causes an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise. To avoid exposure to this disease, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.
