Tainted cakes Make 1200 sick in Spain; 68 still in hospital
-----------------------------------------------------------
A total of 1200 people became ill after eating salmonella-contaminated
cream at a festival in north eastern Spain, and 68 are still in hospital,
according to a new count made on Fri 28 Jun 2002, by the regional
government of Catalonia.
The largest outbreak of food poisoning in Catalonia in recent years
occurred after a caterer in the town of Torroella de Montgri baked 800
cakes for the San Juan celebrations on Sun 23 Jun 2002.
Many of the participants, including tourists, had to be treated for
gastroenteritis after eating pastries, and regional health officials said
the cream in the cakes was infected with salmonella bacteria. By Fri 28 Jun
2002, 68 people, half of whom were children or elderly people, remained in
hospitals across the Gerona region.
Catalonia's health minister Eduard Rius said on Friday that the epidemic
was "under control". The catering establishment which made the pastries was
closed temporarily for failing to meet hygiene standards, and officials
said the owner could face a fine of 15 000 euros (14 700 US dollars),
Reuters reported.

Hundreds fall ill on Spain's holiday
------------------------------------
44 people were admitted to hospital and another 832 fell ill after eating a
local delicacy at a festival on Spain's north eastern holiday coast, the
region's healthy ministry said on Wed 26 Jun 2002. The ministry stated that
13 of the infected are under 14 years of age and 9 are elderly people.
The outbreaks of vomiting, diarrhea, and fever were traced to "cocas," a
cream-filled pastry sold over the previous weekend at an outdoor summer
event in Torroella de Montgri, 70 miles north east of Barcelona.
The ministry said that a first analysis showed the presence of salmonella,
which can contaminate various foods including eggs. Most people recover
within a week without treatment, but the infection can be fatal.
The regional health minister, Joaquim Casanovas, warned that the number of
victims could rise significantly since the bakery making the cocas had
produced 6800 portions [from the 800 cakes mentioned in [1] above.]
Casanovas said violations of hygiene codes had been discovered at the
bakery in Torroella, according to the news agency. The bakery that made the
pastries has been shut down pending an investigation. Casanovas said the
establishment passed an inspection in March [2002], but had been required
to make certain improvements that he did not specify.

Cocas de San Juan is a pastry made with: 600 g flour (about 1 1/3 lb), 1
egg yolk, 1 dL (100 mL) olive oil, 2 dL (200 mL) water, and salt.
The feast of San Juan was on the 21 Jun 2002. It is one of the most popular
and old festivals in Spain, and coincides with the summer solstice in the
northern hemisphere. During the celebration we burn anything that can be
set on fire (no, we do not settle any personal accounts in this way!) piled
up in street junctions and squares all over the country. In some places,
there is music and entire families join in. In Catalonia, it is traditional
to eat "cocas de San Juan" made for that festival in particular.

[The pastry itself, although containing egg yolk, is unlikely to be the
vehicle of transmission as long as it is cooked. The cream filling, on the
other hand, would be an excellent vehicle. It is not cooked, could be made
with eggs, or might be contaminated with salmonella in the preparation
process. Salmonella and other foodborne bacteria are readily transmitted in
foods than are uncooked, such as cake icing or the raw egg-containing
dressing of a Caesar salad. - Mod.LL]
