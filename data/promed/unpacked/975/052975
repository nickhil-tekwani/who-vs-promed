Following the confirmation by the Institute of Public Health, the
Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; Regional
Ministerial Secretariat] issued information of the 1st case of [a]
hantavirus [infection] in Maule. The case is a 37-year-old
agricultural worker from the Casa Blanca de Molina area. The man is in
stable condition in the Curico Assistance Center and is progressing
satisfactorily. This case of this young man was mild, as he did not
present with a cardiopulmonary syndrome, so his recuperation has been
rapid, explained the head of the Public Health Department of the
Health SEREMI, Alex Silva.

Silva stated that during the spring-summer period prevalence of
positive hantavirus [infection] cases increases. However, to date only
this case has been reported from the region.

Following [laboratory] confirmation, the epidemiological team carried
out an investigation to determine the focus of origin and verify [the
health status] of the contacts who were exposed to this same risk [of
infection]. People in the Casa Blanca area who have been in contact
with [this case] and have symptoms of the disease should go to a
health center, stated Silva.

The head of the Public Health Department mentioned that the
epidemiological situation for hantavirus [infections] is, to date, 12
reported confirmed cases in the country [Chile], figures within the
expected range for the spring-summer period.

A campaign for hantavirus [infection] prevention is being carried out
since December 2010.

[The specific hantavirus involved with this confirmed case of
hantavirus infection in Chile is not indicated, nor the environment
described in which the virus might have been acquired. The virus most
likely to be responsible for this case is Andes virus, if confirmed,
with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
