Mystery childhood hepatitis cases jump to 228 in 20 countries: WHO
------------------------------------------------------------------
Suspected childhood hepatitis cases have surged to at least 228 worldwide, resulting in 1 confirmed death and 4 additional fatalities possibly caused by the mystery illness, the WHO said Tuesday [3 May 2022]. WHO's Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva press briefing that the international health agency is currently monitoring the cases of severe liver inflammation in young children in at least 20 countries.

"As of [1 May 2022], at least 228 probable cases were reported to WHO from 20 countries with over 50 additional cases under investigation," Jasarevic said. More than 20 US children in 10 states, among them New York, have been stricken by the illness, which can cause fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain and jaundice. Some of the patients have required liver transplants, and 1 child in Wisconsin had died.

Patients ranged from 1 month to 16 years old, and more common forms of liver disease -- hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C -- were ruled out, the health organization said. The illness is being called hepatitis of unknown origin. The cases have no known connection, although a link with adenovirus that can cause colds is being investigated as a possible culprit.

The UK is currently leading the world with 145 cases of the rare hepatitis, followed by the USA, Spain and Israel. Nearly a dozen other European countries have reported probable hepatitis cases in the single digits. Indonesia reported that 3 children, ages 2, 8 and 11, died in Jakarta in April [2022] after possibly contracting pediatric hepatitis, reported Bloomberg. Additional cases are being investigated in Japan as well as in Singapore, where a 10-month-old baby has been hospitalized with hepatitis symptoms.

In the USA, the CDC sent out an alert to physicians nationwide last month [April 2022], encouraging them to test children with severe liver illness for the adenovirus. Minnesota, Georgia and New York have reported they were looking at multiple cases of acute liver inflammation in children. Another 9 cases also emerged in Alabama, 2 in North Carolina, 1 each in Delaware and Louisiana, 3 in Illinois, 4 in Wisconsin and 6 in Tennessee.

CA children infected with severe hepatitis: what to know
--------------------------------------------------------
California has confirmed a cluster of severe hepatitis cases -- or inflammation of the liver -- among previously healthy young children. Cases have been reported across 10 other states. The Golden State's health department issued an advisory late last month [April 2022] directing clinicians to report infections in children to the state.

A total of 7 cases of the unusual illness have been reported since October 2021, the California Department of Public Health confirmed in a statement to Patch on Wednesday [4 May 2022]. California health officials have not confirmed if adenovirus played a role in the illness or if cases are connected.

Few cases have been reported in California, but local health officials are urging parents and guardians to take general measures to prevent infection and illness, such as good hand hygiene, covering coughs and sneezes and keeping children home from school or childcare while they are sick, officials said.

The presence of an adenovirus infection among patients with hepatitis is a common link in outbreaks that have so far flummoxed both USA and European health officials. There appears to be no epidemiological link among cases, researchers have said. Cold-like symptoms typically accompany adenovirus infections, but the virus has never been known to cause hepatitis, according to the CDC. These types of infections typically run their course, with no specific treatment recommended.

In November 2021, 5 children undergoing treatment for hepatitis at a large children's hospital -- 3 of them with acute liver failure -- tested positive for adenovirus infections, which can cause cold-like symptoms among people of any age. Another 4 cases of children with both hepatitis and adenovirus infections were subsequently discovered. None of the patients died, but 2 required liver transplants.

South Dakota Health Department confirms mysterious case of hepatitis in a child
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The South Dakota Department of Health is investigating the origins of hepatitis discovered in a child with no obvious cause. South Dakota joins a growing list of states and countries that have seen outbreaks of hepatitis in young people where the origin of the infection can't be explained.

"We are asking medical providers to be on the lookout for hepatitis in children without a known cause," said Dr. Josh Clayton, state epidemiologist. "DOH is working with the CDC to identify the cause and to prevent additional illnesses from occurring."

The child is a Brown County resident under the age of 10. The department is urging people to talk with their medical provider if children display symptoms of hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, including fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, and jaundice (yellow skin or eyes).

Argentina detects 1st case of new acute hepatitis in children
-------------------------------------------------------------
Argentina on Wednesday [4 May 2022], detected its 1st case of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children, the health ministry said in a statement.

An 8-year-old boy was admitted to the children's hospital of the city of Rosario, in Santa Fe province. With its 1st confirmed case, Argentina joins a list of at least 20 affected countries.

Some 228 such cases have been recorded in less than a month while another 50 are under investigation, the WHO announced on Tuesday [3 May 2022].

While most of the cases have been detected in Europe, the disease has also been detected in the Americas, the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia. The WHO has asked countries in which cases have been detected to continue investigations and report any possible cases with the aim of gathering information and being able to trace the source of the disease.

The WHO is currently investigating if the disease is caused by adenovirus subtype 41, detected in dozens of these cases. This virus usually causes common colds and gastroenteritis.

Four suspected cases of hepatitis
---------------------------------
Portugal has 4 suspected cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children, aged between 7 months and 8 years, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) announced.

The 4 suspected cases were identified in the health regions of the North, Centre and Lisbon and Tagus Valley and all tested negative for hepatitis A, B and C and for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with results for hepatitis E still awaiting in 2 situations, reveals the DGS in a statement.

According to the health authority, 1 of the cases has already tested positive for adenovirus, and the sample has been sent for sequencing to the National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge.

"The children had symptoms in April [2022] and were hospitalized, but none had serious complications, having recovered from the clinical picture", says the health authority, stressing that epidemiological factors such as travel or connections between cases are under investigation, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

[More clinically compatible cases continue to be reported -- it is not entirely clear how many of these are newly presenting or being found looking back at past cases over the past few months. A timeline of all the cases based on the day of initial symptoms would be very informative.

One possible cause, adenovirus serotype 41, one of the so-called enteric adenoviruses, has not been known previously to cause hepatitis in the immunologically normal host. Whether the finding of adenovirus serotype 41 is an epiphenomenon or the virus is etiologic here is not yet known. In this CDC report related to the Alabama cases (Hepatitis, undefined, global (03): USA (AL) children, CDC, poss adenovirus, 2021-22 20220430.8702942), which were seemingly recognized prior to European cases, no clear evidence of adenovirus in the affected liver tissue was found, and although type 41 was identified by hexon gene sequencing, it is not clear if a whole genomic analysis of the virus has been compared to older adenovirus serotype 41. Hexon is the major surface coat protein of adenovirus. If the virus is the cause, has the agent acquired additional virulence factors, or is a cofactor involved (virus or toxin)? Are certain children genetically more susceptible to the more severe disease? It has been suggested that using deep sequencing metagenetics of the affected liver tissue and blood may well be the best methodology.

At this point, no evidence for household clusters has been reported, which one might expect if a foodborne toxin or transmissible agent was involved. Additionally, it would be interesting to know if any asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were looked for in household contacts. The cases recognized as severe could be the "tip of the iceberg," as we saw with paralytic poliomyelitis when only a small percentage of infections resulted in the classical asymmetrical flaccid paralysis of polio. - Mod.LL]
