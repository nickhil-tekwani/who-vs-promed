Genetic diversity of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza viruses at a single overwintering site of migratory birds in Japan, 2014/15
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
We isolated 8 highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza viruses (H5N8 HPAIVs) in the 2014/15 winter season at an overwintering site of migratory birds in Japan. Genetic analyses revealed that these isolates were divided into 3 groups, indicating the co-circulation of 3 genetic groups of H5N8 HPAIV among these migratory birds. These results also imply the possibility of global redistribution of the H5N8 HPAIVs via the migration of these birds next winter.

Background
----------
In January 2014, newly discovered highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza viruses (H5N8 HPAIVs) caused outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in South Korea, although their ancestor had been isolated in China in 2013. Thereafter, these viruses have been circulating in both avian populations in South Korea and sporadically in neighbouring countries, including China and Japan. Since November 2014, H5N8 HPAIVs have also appeared in poultry and wild birds in Europe. Genetic analyses revealed that these isolates were closely related to the H5N8 viruses circulating in Korean birds. More recently, genetically similar HPAIVs also caused outbreaks in various avian species in North America. These findings suggest that the H5N8 viruses have circulated and evolved in migratory birds.

Characteristics of the study area
---------------------------------
The Izumi plain, which is located at the southern tip of Japan's mainland, is a major overwintering site of the white-naped crane (_Grus vipio_) and hooded crane (_Grus monacha_), both of which are categorised as vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. Over 10 000 cranes visit this plain in the winter season (arriving around November to December and leaving around February to March). For the purpose of protecting these endangered bird species, the local government creates artificial wet paddy areas for roosting cranes every winter. In addition to the cranes, many other migratory birds including wild ducks, a natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, also overwinter at this plain and share the wet paddies. Avian influenza viruses are therefore likely to be transmitted among the migratory birds, including the endangered cranes, at the Izumi plain. In fact, H5N1 HPAIVs were isolated from 7 dead cranes in the 2010/11 winter season. We have also isolated low pathogenic avian influenza viruses from duck faeces and the cranes' roost water collected at this area over the last 2 winter seasons.

Influenza isolates from birds in the study area
-----------------------------------------------
On 23 Nov 2014, a debilitated white-naped crane was captured at the Izumi plain. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected and subjected to RNA extraction for the detection of influenza A viral genes and inoculation into embryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation. Influenza A viral M gene was detected in the RNA from the tracheal swab by conventional reverse transcription PCR. The allantoic fluids of the inoculated eggs showed haemagglutination activity. Further genetic analyses of the allantoic fluid revealed that the isolate was the H5N8 subtype influenza A virus. The infected white-naped crane died on 29 Nov 2014; investigations are under way into the cause of death. The partial sequence of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed that the isolate encoded RERRRKRG at the HA cleavage sites, suggesting their potential to cause systemic infection, subsequently leading to high pathogenicity.

Since 23 Nov 2014 when the infected crane was found, wild birds within a 10 km [about 6 mile] radius of the point where the infected crane was found have been placed under active surveillance for HPAIVs. Local government staff searched for sick and dead wild birds in the area, and sent us the swab specimens and/or dead bodies to test for avian influenza viruses. As of 21 Mar 2015, 8 H5N8 HPAIVs have been isolated from 6 debilitated or dead cranes, 2 dead mallard ducks (_Anas platyrhynchos_) and a water sample collected from the cranes' roost at the Izumi plain. These virus isolations were reported in a timely manner to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] via the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan.

Genetic characterisation
------------------------
To genetically characterise these H5N8 HPAIV isolates, we determined the complete genome sequences of the 8 H5N8 HPAIV isolates, and deposited the sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. Overall sequence data show that each gene segment of these isolates was genetically similar to the counterpart H5N8 HPAIVs recently isolated elsewhere in the world, suggesting that these isolates had not experience gene reassortment since their parental viruses caused outbreaks in South Korea in early 2014.

Phylogenetic analysis
---------------------
To understand the genetic relationship between our isolates and related viruses, the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes were phylogenetically analysed with counterparts from the representative avian influenza H5 and N8 subtypes, respectively. We found that the H5 genes from our 8 isolates belonged to clade 2.3.4.4 and were genetically divided into 3 groups.

Conclusion
----------
These findings suggest that 3 genetically distinct groups of H5N8 HPAIVs were independently circulating among the migratory birds at the Izumi plain. Intriguingly, the genetic grouping of our isolates matched broadly the dates of sampling; the 4th to 8th isolates were categorised into Group C, while earlier isolates were categorised into Group A or B. To determine whether this virus group has genetic characteristics that become predominant among the migratory birds over the remaining virus groups, further investigation would be needed.

No mutations were found that are known to confer the ability to infect mammalian hosts or to provide resistance against anti-influenza drugs to avian influenza viruses, with the exception of an asparagine at position 31 in the M2 protein, which confers resistance to the M2 ion channel blocker amantadine [11].

[The results indicate the co-circulation of at least 3 genetic groups of H5N8 HPAIVs among the migratory birds overwintering at a single site in Japan. These H5N8 HPAIVs are most likely to be derived from wild ducks, rather than from cranes whose flyways were restricted to East Asian countries. These findings also imply the possibility of global redistribution of the H5N8 HPAIVs via migration of these ducks next winter. No observations are recorded to indicate that mammalian H5N8 viruses have been derived by this route. - Mod.CP
