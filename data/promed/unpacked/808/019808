[The question was asked by Robert Jones in Botswana, "Perhaps it will be
possible to receive information on the rationale upon which the USDA
protocol is based?" - Mod.MHJ

From: Robert A. LaBudde <ral@lcfltd.com>

The USDA requires (9 CFR 310.25 and 381.94) sampling and testing of
carcasses from cattle, swine, poultry and others at specified frequencies
with specified criteria. This testing includes _E. coli_ biotype 1 and
_Salmonella_. All inspected plants are required to be under monitoring,
although different monitoring frequencies are specified for very small
slaughter operations.
Hazard-Analysis-Critical-Control-Point ("HACCP") systems were required for
all large plants (> 500 employees) on January 22, 1998. Companies supplying
product to US school lunch programs must be HACCP by July 1998. Medium-size
plants will enter mandatory HACCP on January 22, 1999. Very small plants
will have an additional year.
Thus all US slaughter operations for normal food species are currently
under _Salmonella_ monitoring and control by the USDA.
