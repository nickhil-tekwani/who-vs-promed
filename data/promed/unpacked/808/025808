[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV), is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily _Orthoretrovirinae_.

EIAV is not considered a risk to human health.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.5.6 "Equine infectious anaemia" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates in May 2013).

The clinical signs of acute EIA are often nonspecific. In some cases in horses, the only sign is a fever, which is sometimes accompanied by transient inappetence [loss or lack of appetite] . In mild cases, the fever can last less than 24 hours. More severely affected horses can become weak, depressed and inappetent, with additional signs that may include jaundice, tachypnea [excessively rapid respiration], tachycardia [abnormally fast resting heart rate], ventral pitting edema [swelling of belly due to fluid accumulation that may be demonstrated by applying pressure to the swollen area], thrombocytopenia [low blood platelet count], petechiae [pinpoint red spots] on the mucus membranes, epistaxis [nosebleed] or blood-stained feces. Anemia can occur, although it is more likely to be severe in chronically infected animals. Occasionally, horses become gravely ill and may die during the acute stage. After the initial bout, most horses become asymptomatic carriers; however, some animals develop recurring clinical signs that vary from mild illness and failure to thrive to fever, depression, petechial hemorrhages on the mucus membranes, weight loss, anemia and dependent edema. Inapparent infections may become symptomatic during concurrent illnesses, severe stress or hard work. Death is possible during these febrile episodes. Ophthalmic lesions, characterized by depigmentation with prominent choroidal vessels [in the eyeball], have been reported in chronically infected horses.

According to the above OIE notification, it seems that the infected animal remained on the premises of the affected unit where 13 other "susceptible" horses are kept. Have these horses been tested negative?

The Polish EIA policy seems to be different from the policy prevailing in Germany and France, where recent EIA cases have been destroyed (20141212.3029534, 20141014.2862468). The background to the (different) Polish policy will be helpful. Poland's equine population (last available OIE data, 2013) is 303 963 (0.97 per sq km). - Mod.AS
