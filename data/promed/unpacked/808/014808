Clinical foot and mouth disease (FMD) cases, reported from a beef cattle herd grazing in the Mas'ada forest [Golan Heights, Odem forest reserve], have been confirmed positive. Quarantine measures have been imposed on the herd's site and a 10-km [6.2-mile] (radius) zone around it. All cattle breeders should be reminded of the need to complete, at the earliest opportunity, the annual FMD vaccination of all cattle.

[Mas'ada is a Druse village, situated about 5 km [3.1 miles] from the Syrian border and 11 km [6.8 miles] from the Lebanese border (for map, see https://tinyurl.com/yd7bvpnd).

This outbreak will become the 5th FMD event, which originally started in northern Israel (Mughar) on 5 Sep 2018, affecting a herd of 200 free-ranging beef cattle and 40 goats. The herd had been vaccinated in December 2017 (see 20180911.6021871).

The 2nd outbreak was recorded on 28 Sep 2018 in a bovine fattening herd of Moshav Shaal, Golan Heights, about 12 km [7.5 miles] south of Mas'ada, affecting vaccinated fattening beef calves (see 20180929.6060436). The said outbreak was reported to the OIE in follow-up report no. 1 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=28311). The virus lineage of the first 2 outbreaks was, reportedly, O/ME/Panasia-2.

On 22 Nov 2018, Israel notified the OIE of 2 additional FMD outbreaks, nos. 3 and 4, in free-ranging beef cattle, one on the Hermon mountain (northern Golan Heights, bordering Syria) and the other in Banias (Upper East Galilee); see, with map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=28716. The lineage of these 2 outbreaks is pending.

The OIE summary of the continuing event, as of 22 Nov 2018, follows:
Total outbreaks: 4 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 404 / 45 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / 40 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
All reports, with map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000028716_20181122_191825.pdf.

For many years, no FMD cases were recorded in Israel during November, with the disease presenting a seasonal pattern, peaking in April and May. When investigating FMD events in northeast Israel, including the Golan Heights and the Jordan valley, the dense wild boar population as potential virus disseminators deserves attention; in the past, the involvement of wild boar in FMD epidemiology was subject to investigations.

FMD may be assumed to be currently circulating in adjacent territories of Lebanon and Syria.

FMD has been circulating, during 2018, also in the West Bank (Palestinian authority); on 17 Nov 2018, the Veterinary Services in Ramallah submitted follow-up report no. 2 (final report), announcing that the event that had started 17 Jun 2018 was resolved. A link to the report and to the previous reports, as well as a map presenting the locations of the 4 outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26989.

The virus lineage of outbreaks 3 and 4, as well as confirmation of the current case in the Mas'ada forest, its serotyping and genotyping, is expected. - Mod.AS
