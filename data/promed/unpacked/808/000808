Chronic Wasting Disease found in a farmed deer from Lac Qui Parle County
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health today announced that a farmed white-
tailed deer [_Odocoileus virginianus_]from a Lac Qui Parle County herd tested
positive for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD).
The brain stem and lymph nodes from a 10-year-old female white-tailed
deer were submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National
Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, after the animal
was euthanized due to illness. NVSL confirmed the animal had CWD.
The Board of Animal Health quarantined the herd on 14 Mar 2006. This
quarantine means no cervidae (members of the deer and elk family) can
move on or off the farm. Meanwhile, officials continue to
investigate the source of the infection and whether other cervidae
may have been exposed.
In 2003, Minnesota implemented mandatory registration and CWD
surveillance programs for farmed deer and elk herds. When farmed
deer or elk die or are slaughtered, herd owners must submit brain
samples for CWD testing. The herd from which the CWD-positive animal
came has been registered with the state since 1997.
CWD is a fatal brain and nervous system disease found in elk and deer
in certain parts of North America. The disease is caused by an
abnormally shaped protein called a prion, which can damage brain and
nerve tissue. Infected animals show progressive loss of body weight
with accompanying behavioral changes. In later stages of the
disease, infected animals become emaciated (thus 'wasting' disease).
Other signs include staggering, consuming large amounts of water,
excessive urination, and drooling.
According to state health officials and the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, there is no evidence that CWD can be
transmitted to humans.
In addition to Minnesota's case, CWD has been found in farmed deer or elk in
Colorado, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming,
Wisconsin, & New York, and in Alberta & Saskatchewan, Canada.
Cases have been found in wild deer or elk in Wisconsin, Wyoming, Colorado,
South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, Illinois, West Virginia, New York, &
Kansas, and in Alberta & Saskatchewan, Canada.

[This looks like the 1st occurrence of CWD in Minnesota. It would
reinforce the old addage, "seek and you shall find." The Minnesota
surveillance program is working. - Mod.TG]
[It would be interesting to know if the case had lived all its life in
Minnesota, or had been traded from elsewhere.
