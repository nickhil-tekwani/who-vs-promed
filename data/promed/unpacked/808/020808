Health authorities in Samar may yet face another round of chikungunya fever [virus] infection in Samar, as some 500 Villareal folks have been affected, which rendered the victims unproductive for a week.

Dr. Antonio Tirazona, Department of Health (DOH) Representative in Samar, reported this situation during the 1st Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Council (PDRRC) meeting this morning [28 Jan 2013].

He declared that they have received reports that chikungunya [virus infection] has threatened the municipalities of Daram, an island town, Jiabong, Gandara, and the city of Catbalogan.

Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_).

Symptoms appear in people on average 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The virus causes high fever and severe joint pain. It can also cause headache, muscle pain, and rashes. "This is not fatal, but it can make people lose work for a number of days and depletes the resources of the community affected," he explained.

"In Villareal, the LGU ran out of medicines that they asked for from the provincial government. The Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) is now examining the blood samples taken from the patients in Daram," he said.

DOH-Samar warned the public last week about chikungunya virus infection. The doctor said that infected persons should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the 1st few days of illness so they cannot contribute to the transmission cycle.

The usual practices of hygiene and cleanliness are recommended to fight chikungunya fever, which originated from Africa.

"I am here to seek your help to disseminate the information in your communities so that, together, we can prepare to avoid this disaster," the doctor said.

[This is the 2nd report of a chikungunya virus outbreak in Samar province within the past 4 days. The 25 Jan 2013 report (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130126.1516209) indicated that there might be over 200 cases. In just 4 days, that estimated number is now at 500 cases. If the current cases prove to be due to chikungunya virus infections, there are likely to be many more infected individuals in coming days. It will be of interest to learn what the results of laboratory tests are. There is always the possibility that there is a mixed chikungunya-dengue outbreak going on. Both viruses are transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. Since there is no commercially available vaccine for either of these viruses, the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
