A study [by] a team of modelers along with surveillance experts identified long-term trends and hotspots for wheat rust outbreaks in Ethiopia. Today, crop surveillance data fuel an early warning system for wheat rust outbreaks, but a comprehensive understanding of past outbreaks has been lacking. [The team] evaluated 13 years' worth of surveillance data from more than 13 000 fields across Ethiopia [by] geographical analysis, statistical tools, and data-driven modeling to identify long-term, countrywide trends for the 3 types of wheat rust: stem, stripe, and leaf.

The analysis showed that all 3 rusts have contributed to recurrent outbreaks over the past decade, causing estimated economic losses of tens of millions of US dollars per year. Each type poses increased risk in distinct geographical hotspots, and the 2 most common types (stem and stripe) display distinct directional trends in their prevalence. All 3 types vary in prevalence according to altitude.

The researchers also found evidence for a "boom-and-bust" outbreak cycle that may result from widespread adaptation of specific wheat varieties bred for genetic resistance to certain subtypes of rust, only for resistance to break down or other subtypes to infect the crops.

These findings could help improve wheat rust surveillance and control efforts, such as targeted application of fungicides and planting of certain rust-resistant wheat varieties in key geographical locations. The results could also aid development of mathematical models to accurately predict future outbreaks. Comprehensive annual field surveillance combined with data-science reveals patterns in large-scale epidemics of potentially devastating fungal diseases.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves, which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40-100% have been reported in wheat.

Wheat stem rust (also called black rust) is caused by the fungus _P. graminis_. Overall yield losses of up to 80% are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. The fungus can also produce hardy teliospores to infect members of the genus _Berberis_ (barberries), which then serve as a source of crop inoculum. The Ug99 group of strains (see ProMED-mail post 19990519.0812) have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Variants unrelated to Ug99 with virulence to 4 additional host resistance genes have also been identified (for example, ProMED-mail post 20180219.5638265). In Ethiopia, strains of Ug99 as well as other groups are present (ProMED-mail post 20140327.2360315).

Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _P. recondita_. Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause yield losses of over 40% in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" during favourable weather.

Rust spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season and are also spread by mechanical means and with infected plant material (straw, grain). The fungi need living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed or stubble or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and some wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, and control of volunteer crop plants. Field monitoring for early discovery of infections is important so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of cereal rusts with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple rusts (ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) is particularly difficult since the pathogens can be expected to mutate independently, resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains. Furthermore, climate warming allows survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes as yet another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172).
