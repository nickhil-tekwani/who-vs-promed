An additional mink farm has been found infected by SARS-CoV-2. The farm, in Ledeacker, includes 4500 mink dams. The infection was brought to light by a report of symptoms of mink disease on the farm (duty to report). The farm will be cleared as soon as possible.

In total, 24 mink companies in the Netherlands have now been declared infected. All animals were culled on the 23 farms where SARS-CoV-2 was previously diagnosed.

The cabinet will continue the monitoring investigation in the coming weeks to detect new infections quickly. In view of the recently found infections, the ministers Hugo de Jonge (health, welfare and sport) and Carola Schouten (agriculture, nature and food quality), on the advice of experts, and together with the fur farming sector, have tightened up the hygiene protocol. In addition, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was asked to conduct in-depth research into possible introduction routes. The OMT-Z [Outbreak Management Team for Zoonoses; see comment] has also been asked to provide advice on the recent developments.

The government has already taken measures for all fur farms in the Netherlands, such as a national transport ban for mink, a visitor ban in stables and a strict hygiene protocol, to prevent further spread and to prevent CoV-2 from passing from mink to human, a phenomenon which has plausibly been recorded in 2 farms.

The government is working on a quit scheme with which mink companies can voluntarily terminate their business operations in the short term. In 2024, mink farms will stop their activities in accordance with the legal prohibition.

[According to the Dutch presentation to the European Union's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed [SCoPAFF] meeting (18 Jun 2020), there were, prior to the COVID-19 event, 127 active mink farms in the Netherlands, ranging in size from 500 to 120 000 mink per farm. The total adult mink population given was 2.32 million. This means that about 20% of the Dutch mink farms have already been found infected. This event may lend the country's scientific community a unique opportunity to study the epidemiology of this virus in susceptible animal population(s), in particular, modes of spread, including aerogenic. The presentation, which dealt with the 1st 15 COVID-19 outbreaks in minks, is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20200618_covid_mink_nld.pdf.

OMT-Z, mentioned in the above press release, stands for "Outbreak Management Team for Zoonoses". It is a team of experts formed in case of an outbreak for which guidelines on outbreak control do not exist, or do not cover the specific outbreak situation. Experts assess the signal in depth and advise the AGCM-Z (Administrative Governmental Coordination Meeting - Zoonoses) about the risk and appropriate control measures.

OMT-Z is one of the components of which the Dutch "structure for the control of zoonoses", which was set up in 2011 as a separate entity based on the older structure for the control of infectious diseases, is composed.

A major outbreak of Q fever among humans, mainly in North Brabant during 2007-2010, originated in dairy goat farms and involved more than 4000 human cases, marking a turning point in how the Dutch government responds to emerging zoonotic diseases. The need to signal, assess, and control emerging zoonoses, especially new ones, requires close cooperation between medical and veterinary professionals. Accordingly, a systematic One Health approach was developed and officially instituted for the purpose of sharing, assessing, and responding to signals of new and re-emerging zoonotic infections in which veterinary and medical professionals work together.

In 2011, this integrated human-veterinary risk analysis structure was formally adopted by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality as the national Zoonoses Structure. The Zoonoses Structure consists of several steps (see reference). Crucially, both medical and veterinary experts are involved at every step. An important platform in this structure is the Signalling Forum for Zoonoses (SOZ), which conducts the initial assessment of signals. Its members are:
1. GD Animal Health, Deventer
2. Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Lelystad
3. Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht
4. Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA), Utrecht (Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality)
5. Municipal Public Health Service (GGD)
6. Dutch Wildlife Health Centre (DWHC), Utrecht
7. National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven (Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport)

The current event has become the baptism of fire for the said Dutch system.
