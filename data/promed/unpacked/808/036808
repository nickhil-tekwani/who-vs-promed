New virus strain causing conjunctivitis
------------------------------------------------
A possible new strain of the virus causing sore eyes or
conjunctivitis, which has affected many Mumbaikars, has become a
matter of concern among health specialists. A few reported
complications like 'corneal involvement,' and the clinical diagnosis
indicating it to be due to 'adinovirus' [i.e., adenovirus] has made
experts fear that it could be a new strain of conjunctivitis virus.
"We are planning to carry out a detailed virological study," said S
Natrajan, chairman and medical director, Aditya Jyot Eye Hospital.
Normally, the infection gets cured within one week with antibiotics
but a few cases of 'corneal involvement', in which cornea gets spots
(superficial punctate keratitis), require longer treatment, he said.
Doctors from municipal and private hospitals said most of the
patients take self-medication as the treatment is effective using a
few well-known antibiotics. "We get 5 to 7 patients in a day," they said.
"The best thing is precaution as the disease spreads through touch.
Therefore, do not touch your own eyes," Natrajan said. Mumbai had an
outbreak of conjunctivitis in 1981 when, in some cases, patients
suffered paralytic attack. The virus strain was identified by
Haffkine Institute as enterovirus-70.
Haffkine Institute Director Ranjana Deshmukh said she had not
received any referral cases so far for viral investigation this year.
"If we get samples we will definitely do the investigation." Deshmukh
said most of the patients get cured with a variety of antibiotics
available in the market which clears any superficial infection but in
some cases the redness of the eye remain for sometime. "The patient
should wear goggles to prevent getting glare of the light and also
give importance to personal hygiene," she advised.

Pinkeye cases on the rise, may signal serious epidemic
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The recent increase in conjunctivitis cases throughout the island [of
Taiwan] might signal a more serious epidemic, local media reported
yesterday [5 Oct 2007]. Most of the cases are accompanied by symptoms
such as hemorrhages in the eyes and swollen eyelids, which are the
same symptoms of enterovirus 70 patients, said Lu Tah-wen, director
of the Tri-Service General Hospital's ophthalmology department, to
the United Evening News.
Known also as "enteroviral conjunctivitis," "acute hemorrhagic
conjunctivitis," and "Apollo 11 disease," enterovirus 70 is
transmitted by direct or indirect contact with discharge from
infected eyes. Other symptoms include sudden onset of pain or the
sensation of a foreign body in the eye and seromucous discharge, and
it is highly infectious, explained Lu. Less commonly, patients may
also suffer from systemic and upper respiratory infection, fever and
headache. The best way to combat the infectious disease is patient
quarantine, he said. The treatment, however, is relatively simple:
just use eye drops, added Lu.
The Department of Health's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said
since the recent outbreak had not been declared an epidemic, it was
not clear on how many people in the country are affected with
conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye. But it recognized a recent
increase of cases particularly in the northern Keelung and southern
Yunlin areas and has therefore taken necessary measures, including
urging the public to wash their hands regularly to avoid being infected.
The CDC further said that it has already contacted the Ministry of
Education and epidemiologists to work out measures to cope with the
situation and informed hospitals under the direct jurisdiction of the
DOH to take measures to prevent a further spread of the disease.
Noting that the last time a pinkeye outbreak occurred in Taiwan was
in the 1970s and that it was the result of enterovirus 70, Shih
agreed with Lu and said that this time around, the outbreak seems to
have been caused by enterovirus.
Meanwhile, Chiu Hsiao-wen, deputy director of Yunlin County's Bureau
of Education, discounted a China Times report Friday [5 Oct 2007]
that over 1000 people in Yunlin have been infected, saying that as of
Friday morning, the bureau had not been notified by any school in the
county of an outbreak of the disease. Kao Kun-yu, an official with
the Yunlin County Bureau of Health, also said Friday that as of noon,
his bureau had not received any requests from any schools or the
Yunlin Bureau of Education for help regarding a pinkeye outbreak.
Kao called for students, particularly young kids, and all members of
the public to seek medical aid if they are infected with pinkeye. To
avoid being infected, Kao said, kids should be taught to wash their
hands often with water and soap. They also should not share eye
droppers, tissues, wash cloths, towels or pillowcases with other
people, Kao added.

[Acute conjunctivitis can be caused by several viruses including
enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24, and epidemic adenoviruses. These
viruses may also cause acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC),
characterized by photophobia, watering, and foreign body sensation,
eyelid edema, conjunctival hemorrhages, and superficial punctate
keratitis. The disease is self-limiting. An outbreak of acute
haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) was 1st reported from Africa
(Ghana) in 1969 and was referred to as Apollo conjunctivitis. A new
enterovirus, now designed human enterovirus 70, was identified as the
agent of this disease. Subsequently AHC and enterovirus 70-related
outbreaks of acute conjunctivitis have been recorded throughout other
regions of Africa and Asia.
The 1st serologic report of enterovirus 70 infection in India came
from Bombay in 1971-72 during the rainy season, and subsequently
recurrent epidemics have been recorded throughout India. The current
outbreak of enterovirus 70 infection in Mumbai appears to be the
milder form of the associated disease.
Enterovirus 70 is presumed to be the sole etiologic agent in the
outbreak in Taiwan, but it is not clear that this diagnosis is based
on laboratory testing or only on clinical assessment. So far only
mild disease has been associated with the outbreak in Taiwan, but
enteroviruses in general have the potential to cause neurological
damage in a minority of patients and surveillance should be
continued. - Mod.CP]
