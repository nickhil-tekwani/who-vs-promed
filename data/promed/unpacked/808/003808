Meningitis epidemic afflicts Rwanda and Burundi
--------------------------------------------------
The meningitis epidemic in Rwanda has spread rapidly into neighbouring
provinces and countries, in particular, Burundi. MSF (Physicians Without
Borders) is conducting and facilitating mass vaccination campaigns in
Rwanda and Burundi in order to curb a severe meningitis epidemic. The
Rwandan health authorities declared the epidemic in mid-July 2002, and 3
months later the situation is still worrisome, with even the inhabitants of
Kigali now being vaccinated. During the past 3 months, the alert threshold
has been exceeded in several communities and provinces in Burundi as well.
"By mid-October [2002] Rwanda has counted more than 1100 meningitis cases."
said Luc Nicolas, operational coordinator of MSF in Belgium. "125 people
died because of the disease, which means a mortality rate of more than 10
percent. Especially the southern and eastern provinces of the country are
heavily affected."
Meningitis is endemic to Rwanda and, especially during dry season, there
are outbreaks. The epidemic is extremely severe this time, since it has
spread rapidly into neighboring provinces and countries, such as Burundi.
In this outbreak, patients presented themselves for treatment only at the
late stage, which caused a very high mortality rate. To curb the epidemic
the health authorities are carrying out mass vaccination campaigns in many
provinces.
"We have donated a total 450 000 doses of vaccine to the Ministry of
Health," Nicolas added. "The first part of the donation is being used in
Butare Province, where the first meningitis cases were detected. The health
authorities have vaccinated the entire population aged over 6 months in
this province -- some 800 000 people. And we provided support for the
vaccination of 200 000 people in the district of Gahini, Umutara Province.
Access to health care is very problematic in countries like this, which
makes it more difficult for the population to receive treatment . Therefore
we sent a medical doctor in Gahini hospital who is in charge of the
treatment of meningitis patients."
Meningitis is also spreading in Burundi. It already affected more than half
of the country. All the northern and central provinces have been affected.
The management of the epidemic is further complicated by a lack of access
to health care for the population and insecurity in many parts of the country.
"By the end of September 2002, 934 infected patients were counted, of whom
69 people died," explained Nicolas. "The health authorities decided to
vaccinate the whole of northeastern Burundi. They carried out most of the
vaccinations while our teams vaccinated three communities in Karuzi Province."

[2] East Africa Alert

Meningitis: EA May Face Outbreak in 2 Months
--------------------------------------------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) last week sounded a meningitis alert,
saying that a new variant of the disease could break out across the
continent, including East Africa, in the next 2 months.
According to the organization, "thousands of people will certainly die"
unless international donors make available at least $10 million to procure
the vaccine and drugs needed to combat an outbreak.
"Unless the funds are urgently provided, the vaccine and drugs which are
needed to prevent deaths and control the epidemic will quite simply not be
available," the UN health agency said in a statement released last
Wednesday, 13 Nov 2002. Last Thursday, the organization held an emergency
strategy meeting with representatives of potential donor countries and
those in Africa's 'meningitis belt' in Geneva to discuss possible
interventions.
According to the WHO statement, the organization is particularly concerned
that a new variant of meningitis, caused by a previously rare strain known
as W135, could be responsible for the next major outbreak, posing new
challenges in treatment and control.
Between February and June 2002, the strain was found to have been
responsible for 12 000 infections in Burkina Faso, which resulted in more
than 1500 deaths. The strain had previously been responsible only for
sporadic, minor outbreaks.
Protection against W135 can be achieved through the use of a tetravalent
vaccine, which is manufactured largely for sale in developed countries at a
cost of as much as US $50 per dose. This price is far beyond the reach of
the countries at risk in Africa.
Currently, the WHO is holding talks with manufacturers, with the aim of
providing a stock of the vaccine, the goal being to have it at a price of
$1 per dose or below. Currently, the best offer is that by GlaxoSmithKline
of $3.50 per dose, which would bring the total cost of a prevention
programme across the belt to $100 million.
Outbreaks of the disease occur almost every year in the so-called African
meningitis belt, which stretches from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal in
the west. Although northern parts of Kenya and Uganda are technically
considered to be in this belt, medical experts say that East Africa as a
whole is threatened, mainly because of cross-border travel.
Such cross-border travel was responsible for isolated outbreaks in southern
Uganda 2 months ago following an outbreak in neighbouring Rwanda.
This year [2002] alone, according to the WHO, there have been at least 33
000 meningitis cases across Africa, resulting in more than 2500 deaths. In
the past 10 years, more than 700 000 cases have been reported.
