Bulgaria has discovered 2 new cases of H5 bird flu in dead swans near
its Black Sea coast and will send samples to a British laboratory to
tell if it is the strain that can be deadly to humans, officials said
on Thursday [9 Feb 2006].
The announcement comes a week after Bulgaria found its 1st case of
bird flu in a sick swan in the Danube River. "We have 2 new samples
from swans that have reacted to H5," Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil
told journalists.
Test results on whether the 1st infected swan was actually carrying
H5N1, the strain which has killed at least 88 people and millions of
birds since 2003, are due early next week.
Kabil said one of the newly discovered swans was found in Lake Shabla
near the northern border with Romania, which along with Bulgaria's
southern neighbour Turkey has been battling dozens of outbreaks of
H5N1 since October 2005.
The other bird was found near the Black Sea port town Varna.
Health Minister Radoslav Gaidarski said samples would be sent to an
EU-certified laboratory outside of London on Monday [Is the delay due
to administrative-technical issues, transport-security
considerations, or the reference laboratory not operational during
weekends? - Mod.AS]
Greece said on Thursday it found samples of the H5 bird flu virus in
3 swans in northern areas of the country which borders Turkey.
The Bulgarian Health Minister urged calm, saying authorities had
taken appropriate measures to stop the spread of the disease. "We
shouldn't panic the public," Gaidarski said.
"Even if we find new H5 cases, it's not worrying if domestic birds
are not in contact with wildfowl... We've taken additional measures
to inform district officials to restrict domestic birds from going in
the streets and lakes."

Greece discovered avian influenza in 3 swans and is testing to
determine whether it's the European Union's 1st case of the strain of
the disease that has killed birds and people across Asia.
The Greek government, having established that the virus is the H5
bird flu subtype, said it has sent samples from the 3 wild birds to
an EU laboratory in London to check for the presence of the deadly
H5N1 strain.
"The H5 strain was detected after examinations in 3 swan samples",
Greek Agriculture Minister Evangelos Basiakos said today [9 Feb 2006]
in an e-mailed statement. The swans were found in separate areas in
the northern part of the country.
Mushrooming outbreaks in Turkey, killing 4 people since the beginning
of 2006, have illustrated the difficulties of controlling the disease
once it gains a foothold. The part of Cyprus controlled by Turkey was
struck [in January 2006] and Iraq and most recently Nigeria have also
confirmed the presence of H5N1.
Results of the tests on the swans found in Greece are expected in 2
to 8 days, Basiakos said. Greece in October 2005 reported its 1st
suspected bird-flu case; it turned out to be a false alarm.
The EU has tried to avoid avian influenza outbreaks by banning
imports of poultry from infected areas and halting trade in pet
birds. Street markets selling live fowl have been shut down and
surveillance of wild birds stepped up.
Mounting public concern about the threat has hurt sales at poultry
processors. Sales of poultry in Italy dropped 13 percent in 2005 as
people opted for alternatives to avoid contracting bird flu, an
Italian farmers group said.
The last time a deadly bird flu virus struck the EU in Feb 2003, more
than 25 million Dutch chickens were slaughtered and a veterinarian
who contracted the illness died, according to the medical journal
Lancet.

[Reportedly, the European Commission is due to adopt on Friday (10
Feb 2006) a measure to ensure increased biosecurity on poultry farms
in the affected areas. Movements of poultry from those areas to other
holdings or for slaughter will be subjected to rigorous additional
controls, said the Commission in a statement.
"We have to work on the assumption that the avian influenza virus
could be spread by wild birds, so we should not be unduly surprised
or alarmed if such cases are found in the EU," said EU Health and
Consumer Protection Commissioner Markos Kyprianou. - Mod.AS]

Hong Kong authorities on Thursday [9 Feb 2006] investigated 2 new
suspected cases of bird flu, a dead chicken and a wild bird found
near a local school, and the health secretary said he won't be
surprised if more birds fall ill.
The territory, which last saw a major bird flu outbreak in 1997, has
seen a series of birds test positive for the disease in recent weeks.
The government announced late Wednesday [8 Feb 2006] that a dead
egret found earlier this week in an urban Hong Kong district has
tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu.
Spokesman Albert Hui of the Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation
Department said final test results on the dead chicken and on a
Japanese White-eye [_Zosterops japonicus_, picture at
<http://www.stanford.edu/~petelat1/whiteeye.html>], a small wild bird
found near the school, weren't available yet.
On Thursday, officials collected another dead bird, a Red-whiskered
Bulbul [_Pycnonotus jocosus_, picture at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Red-whiskered_Bulbul.jpg>], in
the same area. It will be tested for avian flu but wasn't yet
considered a suspect case, Hui said.
"It won't be surprising if more birds are infected," Health Secretary
York Chow said Thursday.
Chow said the government is searching for sites near chicken farms to
set up slaughterhouses for centralized killing of chickens, instead
of in local shops as is customary in Hong Kong.
The government has also tried to control the bird flu outbreak by
banning people from raising poultry at home. The ban, under which
offenders can be fined up to 100 000 Hong Kong dollars (USD 12 880;
Euros 10 760), starts 13 Feb 2006, reports the AP.

Romania detected new suspected cases of bird flu in domestic fowl on
Thu [9 Feb 2006] in the Danube delta where the disease was first
found in October 2005, the farm ministry said in a statement.
"Rapid tests made on 6 hens from the village of Jurilovca in Tulcea
county led to suspicion of the presence of the bird flu virus," the
statement said.
The Danube delta is Europe's largest wetlands and lies on a major
migratory route for wild birds.
"If further tests confirm the H5 type, we will cull all the birds in
the village as a precaution and we will send the samples to a British
laboratory to see whether it was the deadly H5N1," Romania's chief
vet Ion Agafitei told Reuters.
He said the animal health authority culled all the birds from the
small farm where the dead hens were found.
Authorities said they are still testing the samples from the village
of Cetatea, 500 km (311 miles) west of the Danube delta, where they
suspected the presence of H5 on Tue [7 Feb 2006].
Avian flu has been discovered in 26 villages across the Black Sea
country since the first outbreak occurred in October 2005. Romania
has not reported bird flu in humans so far.

[The last AI outbreak in Romania was recorded in the village of
Albesti, starting 27 Dec 2005, reported to the OIE on 4 Jan 2006 (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_37.HTM#Sec7>, including a map).
The renewed incidence and the spread of the disease into neighbouring
Bulgaria and Greece demonstrate the vitality of this panzootic. The
disease seems to have a remarkable incidence in wild swans, observed
during 2005 in Mongolia, Romania, Croatia and Russia (Astrakhan
region), and recently in Bulgaria and (final confirmation pending)
Iran and Greece. Evaluation of this species' role as carriers or
sentinels is needed.
Regulations prescribing indoor keeping of poultry have been announced
by Germany recently. Reportedly, the Netherlands, where similar
measures have been withdrawn since 1 Jan 2005 [see 20060203.0353], is
currently considering re-implementing them. - Mod.AS]
