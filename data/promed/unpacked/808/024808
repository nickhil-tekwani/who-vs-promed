A total of 5 people died in the city of Puerto Nuevo in Táchira state, west of Venezuela, from a suspected outbreak of acute Chagas disease, informed the regional governor Laidy Gómez. "Official information: Epidemiologic outbreak of acute Chagas was detected in Puerto Nuevo, Libertador municipality, leaving 5 dead" wrote the governor on Twitter.

The fatalities were an 11 month old baby, a 79 year-old woman and 3 men of 31, 42 and 51 years old respectively. Gómez announced there was activation of a special plan in the region in order to treat the outbreak.

The doctor Ely Toubia explained that acute Chagas disease can be transmitted in various manners: the 2 most common ones are through the bite of the barbeiro (the triatomid bug) which transmits the parasite (_Trypanosma cruzi_) or through insect feces in fresh fruit juice.

In the initial stage (acute), the symptoms of infection can be confused with that of the common cold/flu, but the parasite remains living in the body of the infected individual for a long time, up to 30 years, and can induce serious damage to the heart which can lead to death. It is also able to induce damage to the esophagus and the intestines, enlarging them, leading to severe digestive problems.

[Since the outbreak of food-borne Chagas disease in Santa Caterina, Brazil, in 2005 there has been several reports of food-borne transmission throughout South America. The largest outbreak was in Caracas (Venezuela) in 2007 with over 120 cases probably due to contaminated guava juice. If the cases reported here are indeed infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ this indicates a common source. In the previously reported foodborne outbreaks, fresh juice from different fruits and sugar cane was identified as the source. - Mod.EP
