Today [20 Dec 2017] Saudi Arabia's MEWA (Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture) announced the detection of Highly Pathogenic H5N8 among birds at a market in Riyadh.

While other Middle Eastern countries (Iran, Israel, Egypt, etc.) have reported HPAI H5N8 [virus] over the past year [2017], this is - as far as I can determine - the 1st outbreak in poultry in KSA [see comment].

MEWA published on [Wed 20 Dec 2017], the following "Statement on the emergence of avian influenza (H5N8) in the city of Riyadh" No 02/04/1439, at https://www.mewa.gov.sa/ar/MediaCenter/News/Pages/20-12-2017-1.aspx [in Arabic, machine transl, edited]:

"The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture, announced on [Wed 20 Dec 2017] the disease of a number of birds infected with bird flu (H5N8) in Azizia market, in the city of Riyadh. Initially, information on deaths of birds, accompanied by respiratory and nervous symptoms, had been received on [Tue 19 Dec 2017].

"The ministry indicated that following the receipt of the report on the birds' mortality, the Ministry's veterinary teams visited the site and collected samples from the dead birds which were subsequently tested in the diagnostic veterinary laboratory in Riyadh, where HPAI H5N8 virus strain was identified in chickens and turkeys. MEWA, cooperatively with the ministries of Health, of the Interior, and of Municipal and Rural Affairs, implement prevention measures and emergency plans for bird flu, including the closure of the market and imposing a ban on the entry and exit of birds and trading in them. The ministry confirmed that the World Health Organization (WHO) has not recorded cases of human infection with H5N8 virus type to date. Such infection is not expected.

"Field teams proceed with the follow-up and control. Poultry breeders and producers and farm owners and the public at large are requested to inform the Ministry about any suspected case of the disease by calling the emergency and information room through toll-free phone (8002470000). Periodic reports on the situation will be published and steps undertaken to eradicate the disease."

[The last time Saudi Arabia submitted an OIE notification addressing avian influenza was in 2008; the event, caused by HPAI H5N1, reportedly had started 12 Nov 2007 in the eastern part of the Kingdom. In its final follow-up report (No 3), dated 11 May 2008, Saudi Arabia indicated that the disease had resolved on 29 Jan 2008, the total number of outbreaks being 29 (see OIE summary with map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000007017_20080511_111709.pdf). In 2006, the virus was detected several times in falcons imported from central Asia.

Remarkably, according to Saudi Arabia's annually updated "Animal health situation" report to the OIE (last report covering 2016), HPAI was absent in Saudi Arabia since January 2008.

The current event is expected to be notified at the earliest to the OIE. - Mod.AS
