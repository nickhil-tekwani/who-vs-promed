[Following the discovery of Brucellosis in the dairy cattle operation of Kibbutz Revivim in late October 2015 (references in "see also"), where 135 dairy cows (out of about 1300) were initially found to be infected with _Br. Melitensis_ (field strain biotype 1) and destroyed, the State Veterinary Services launched investigations into possible spread to contact farms. The Grofit dairy farm, in the Arava region (southeast Israel; map at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html, select square 19) was found to have purchased some cattle from Revivim. When tested, several positive animals were discovered, 7 of which were reported in the above weekly circular "Hachaklait".

Leakage of _B. melitensis_ into high-yielding industrial dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The following statistics on the total annual number of human "Malta fever" cases have been published by Israel's Ministry of Health: 2005 - 141; 2006 - 138; 2007 - 152; 2008 - 149; 2009 - 136; 2010 - 139; 2011 - 127; 2012 - 183; 2013 - 336; 2014 - 596. According to the ministry's most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report, dated 21 Nov 2015, the (preliminary) accumulated number of diagnosed new human brucellosis cases since the beginning of 2015 is 384, compared with 573 during the same period in 2014. While 2014 seems to have been a record year, 2015's figures are still higher than the years before.

It will be interesting to learn whether human cases have followed animal infection in the said cattle farms, if their personnel have undergone serological tests and, in case affirmative, what the results were.

It may be assumed that the infection in Revivim originated in neighboring grazing sheep/goat flocks. The route of _B. melitensis_ introduction from infected flocks into the (zero-grazing) Kibbutz dairy farm has yet to be established.

For decades, brucellosis in livestock in Israel has been caused exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has long been eradicated (last case in 1984). _B. suis_ has never been diagnosed.

The main clinical damage caused by _B. melitensis_, when initially introduced into sheep and goat flocks, is abortion waves (mostly during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy); the abortion rate decreases in subsequent years. The financial losses to owners are significantly lower than the devastating damage to human health. This situation is an obstacle in obtaining the cooperation of owners (particularly in nomadic flocks) needed for effective control measures, including vaccination and animal identification. Such cooperation is more likely when measures are offered free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when animals are culled.

The affected dairy cattle farms have to undergo repeated tests, applying the "test-and-slaughter" policy until declared free of infection. In case of excessive infection rate, it may become necessary to cull the entire herd. - Mod.AS
