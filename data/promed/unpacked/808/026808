Egypt has slaughtered more than 17 500 poultry in a farm where bird flu cases were reported in the Dakahlia governorate (Delta), said head of Veterinary Medicine Directorate, Abdel Moneim Al Mongy, on [Sat 30 Dec 2017]. After taking samples from infected poultry, vets buried the dead and slaughtered poultry to control the spread of viruses, Mongy added in remarks to Al-Watan newspaper. Dakahlia's Mit Ghamr and Gharbyia's Santa cities were ranked as the most dangerous places, as they have the virus, he continued.

During the veterinary inspection, the vets reported new H5N2, H8N2, H9N2, and IB [infectious bronchitis] strains. The fact that these strains are appearing for the 1st time in Egypt has made the situation all the more serious.

"After the death of my poultry, I informed the Veterinary Medicine (Directorate) immediately," the owner of the farm, [MA], confirmed. The government should produce local veterinary medicine to cure the local virus strains and stop [importing] drugs for strains not existing in Egypt, he said.

The [H5N1] virus first appeared in Egypt in 2006, and caused 41 deaths during 2015. Most cases are detected in impoverished rural areas that raise poultry. The Ministry of Health repeatedly urged all residents dealing with poultry to take all protective measures against the virus.

[In another media report, in Arabic, the viruses apparently identified on this farm were "H8, H5, H9, Newcastle disease [NCDV], and IB [infectious bronchitis]"... (https://tinyurl.com/y9857skq thanks to Mary Marshall for the submission). Rather confusing and in clear need for further clarification.

The most recent avian influenza event affecting poultry in Egypt, reported to the OIE, was caused by HPAI H5N8. It reportedly started on 24 Nov 2016, eventually causing 15 outbreaks in 10 governorates throughout the country: Ash Sharqiyah, Al Buhayrah, Al Qahirah, As Suways, Dumyat, Al Minya, Kafr ash Shaikh, Al Gharbiyah, Al Qalyubiyah, and Al Wadi al Jadid (New Valley). Most of the outbreaks were located within the Delta region. All of them but one involved backyard poultry; only one, in Al Sharqiyah, affected a relatively larger farm (3200 susceptible animals). Reportedly, vaccination against the H5N8 strain was applied, though on a rather small scale.

Follow-up report no 5 ("final report") of the said event, published 7 Sep 2017, included the following comment: "The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports."

The total number of susceptible animals in all 15 notified outbreaks was 4903, of which 523 cases, 372 deaths, 4526 culled; the event summary, with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000024759_20170907_175652.pdf.

The current outbreak involves a relatively large commercial plant, in Dakahlia governorate, which was not mentioned among the ones affected during the recent H5N8 event.

In February 2017, 2 new, fatal human cases, caused by HPAI H5N1 were reported from 2 governorates in Egypt; this reflects the continued circulation of the zoonotic H5N1 strain, though outbreaks in poultry were not published; see 20170402.4939591.

Egypt has been experiencing human H5N1 cases and its circulation in poultry since 2006; mainly, backyard poultry was affected. So far, 359 human cases have been reported, including 120 fatalities.

HPAI H9N2 is known to be circulating in the Middle East; in Egypt, it was reported from humans (see 20150215.3168314, 20150522.3378923, 20160122.3956280).

The apparently mixed infection on the commercial poultry farm in Dakahlia, suspected to involve several strains of avian influenza (H5N2, H8N2, and H9N2), as well as a new strain of the poultry virus IB and NCDV, is unusual. This information is in need of firsthand clarifying data, including lab confirmation and genotyping results. - Mod.AS
