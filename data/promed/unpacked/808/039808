Namibia's Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform (MAWLR) successfully conducted its 1st field oral rabies vaccination of dogs in the northern Omusati and Oshana regions mid-October [2021], the ministry announced Thursday [11 Nov 2021].

Rabies is endemic throughout Namibia; however, dog-mediated rabies poses a significant threat to public health in the Northern Communal Areas (NCAs).

"MAWLR could only attain about 76 percent vaccination coverage of total dog population in the NCAs where the rabies control program is implemented, instead of the targeted 80 percent vaccination coverage to achieve herd immunity," said MAWLR Chief Veterinary Officer Albertina Shilongo [see comment].

According to Shilongo, one among many other reasons why [it] was challenging to achieve herd immunity was the inability to access stray dogs as well as challenges experienced by some of the dog owners in handling [them and being] unable to present them at the vaccination points or veterinary offices for vaccination.

This 1st trial was carried out with close cooperation with the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute of Germany, supported with funds from the Global Health Protection Program of the German Ministry of Health, using mobile planning and data-capturing technology.

"The innovation of oral vaccination will enable us to reach most, if not all, dogs, especially the stray dogs and dogs that are difficult to handle," Shilongo said. "This new methodology, if fully introduced, will not replace our initial national dog rabies control program, but will complement the parenteral vaccination for wider dog population reach."

[Domestic dogs are responsible for nearly all the global human rabies deaths that occur annually. Numerous control measures have been successful at eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths in upper-income countries, including dog population management, parenteral dog vaccination programs, access to human rabies vaccines, and education programs for bite prevention and wound treatment. Implementing these techniques in resource-poor settings can be challenging; perhaps the greatest challenge is maintaining adequate herd immunity in free-roaming dog populations. Oral rabies vaccines have been a cornerstone in rabies virus elimination from wildlife populations; however, oral vaccines have never been effectively used to control dog-mediated rabies.

The perspectives of the OIE's and WHO's experts regarding the role of oral vaccines for dogs, and their recommendations for overcoming hesitations to expedited field use of appropriate oral vaccines, were published in December 2020 (doi: https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2612.201266).

Over the last 6 years, Namibia has developed and implemented a national strategy to tackle rabies. Accessible dogs are vaccinated parenterally. Free-roaming dogs are often inaccessible for parenteral vaccination during mass rabies dog vaccination campaigns. Oral vaccination is considered to be a promising alternative to attain the targeted 80% vaccination coverage securing herd immunity.

The results of a pilot field trial on oral vaccination of dogs against rabies in key hot-spot areas in the Northern Communal Areas of Namibia, using a high-safety-profile oral rabies vaccine, have recently been published (Ref 1). The studies addressed the immunogenicity of the highly attenuated 3rd-generation oral rabies vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS in local free-roaming dogs, assessed by determining the immune response in terms of seroconversion for up to 56 days post-vaccination. At 2 study sites, free-roaming dogs were vaccinated by administering the vaccine either by direct oral administration or via a vaccine-loaded egg bait. Pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were tested for rabies virus neutralizing as well as binding antibodies using standard serological assays. A multiple logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine a possible influence of study area, vaccination method, and vaccine dose on the seroconversion rate obtained. About 78% of the dogs vaccinated by the oral route seroconverted (ELISA), though the seroconversion as determined by a rapid fluorescence focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was much lower. None of the factors examined had a significant effect on the seroconversion rate. The authors concluded: "This study confirms the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS and the potential utility of ORV for the control of dog-mediated rabies in African dogs."

It will be helpful to obtain information on the shape and size of the vaccine-loaded egg baits applied for the oral vaccination of the inaccessible dogs.

During the last General Session of the OIE (May 2021), Namibia's Official Control Programme for dog-mediated rabies was endorsed (see ProMED post 20210601.8412656). The ultimate objective will be to eventually eliminate the disease from the country's territory and self-declare its freedom, contributing to the "Zero by 30" global goal to eliminate human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030.
