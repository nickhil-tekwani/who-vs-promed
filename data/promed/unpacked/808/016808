Animal rabies - Federal District
--------------------------------
7 cases of animal rabies in equines and bovines were confirmed in the rural
area of the Federal District [Brasilia] in the 1st 2 months of 2005 -- this
amounts to half of the total number of cases reported in the whole year of
2004. There are at least another 10 suspected cases under
investigation. This high number has led to an alert on the part of the
Secretary of Health, the Secretary of Agriculture and Southern Credit
Association and Rural Assistance [Emater -- Associa� Sulina de Cr�to e
Assist�ia Rural]. They admit that there may have been many more deaths
of oxen and horses caused by this disease, which is transmitted by bats.
Rural producers do not usually contact the authorities when they lose an
animal with symptoms of rabies.
Because there is no obligatory vaccination of Brazilian herds against
animal rabies -- the ranchers must take the initiative -- the technicians
of the 3 organizations were concerned about the proliferation of the
disease among their animals and about possible human infection. The only
recorded case of human rabies in the Federal District occurred in
1978. Apart from bats, rabies can be transmitted to man by cats, dogs,
[flicker mice] foxes, coyotes, ocelots, skunks, raccoons, and macaques. The
virus is transmitted through the saliva of an animal.
Cases confirmed in animals in 2005: 4 bovine, 2 equine and a hematophagous
[vampire] bat (which feeds on blood), were detected in rural communities of
Catingueiras (Sabradinho II), Taguara, Tabatinga and Stanislau (Planaltina).
Small ranchers confirmed the suspicions of the technicians by mentioning
deaths among animals on their farms. These cases did not appear on
official statistics.
The technicians from the Secretariat of Agriculture were not able to
explain the focus of the disease in Planaltina and Sobradinho. But they
affirmed that deforestation and disorganized occupations [squatters?] are
pushing the bats -- and many other animals -- out to other greener areas.
The Director of the Department of Cattle Breeding and Sanitary Protection
(DPDS) of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Guilherme Campos, affirmed that
government technicians are investigating all of the cases that have come to
their attention.
Teams from the Control of Reservoirs and Zoonoses, of the Directory of
Environmental Surveillance, of the Secretariat of Health, conducted field
work aimed at identifying individuals that had contact with the oxen, cows
and infected bats.
In order to control the disease among the herds, technicians from the
Secretariat of Agriculture have advised the owners to vaccinate their
animals. The team from Environmental Surveillance has already studied the
possibility of promoting the capture of bats in those regions affected by
the disease.
Animal rabies in herbivores in the Federal District had been eradicated 8
years ago, but cases have reappeared since 1998. In 2002, there were
outbreaks in the same localities where there are foci today. 3 years ago,
35 cases were detected in Planaltina in less than 2 months. Rabies was
under control again in 2003.
