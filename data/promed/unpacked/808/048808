Officials search for cause of outbreak affecting 170 children
---------------------------------------------------------------
Staff at a Cochrane [Alberta elementary school are at a loss to explain
what caused an outbreak of a "mystery" illness that left about 170 students
and teachers sick. Officials with Elizabeth Barrett elementary school were
alerted to the problem when a large number of students called in sick
yesterday.
Several students started getting sick Wednesday night -- suffering from
vomiting and/or diarrhea -- and kids were still getting ill during the
school day and into last evening.
"Many were just sick for a short period and then they were OK," said
assistant principal Deborah McLaren.
After discovering about one-third of students were ill, staff notified
medical authorities around 9:15 a.m. and requested that a public health
nurse attend the school. Environmental Health and Rocky View School
Division maintenance workers were also called in to assess the situation.
[No students were hospitalized.
School staff and Environmental Health workers were looking for a common
thread as to what caused the sickness, but were at a loss to explain the
outbreak. "We're looking for any relationships or commonalities between the
illnesses to see if there's any pattern, but so far we don't have any
indication," said McLaren.
Tests will continue throughout the school in an effort to locate the source
of the outbreak.
"It's far too early to say what might have caused this -- we're still
investigating all possible causes," said Doug Fraser, spokesman for the
Calgary Regional Health Authority.
Health officials are encouraging anyone who suffers from symptoms of the
illness to see a doctor.
