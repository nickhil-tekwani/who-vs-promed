Richmond Equestrian Centre in North Yorkshire has cancelled all upcoming events, including its British Eventing fixture, after a case of strangles on its livery yard. Richmond Horse Trials (2) was due to take place on [30 Aug to 1 Sep 2019].

Co-owner Abigail Turner told H&H they were devastated to announce the cancellation of the BE event, but emphasised "horse welfare comes first".

"The vet came out to a livery's horse on Tuesday [13 Aug 2019] which had a slightly snotty nose and temperature. Because we had the BE event coming up and especially with the current equine flu situation, we had the horse tested for flu and strangles as an extra precaution. Never in a million years did we expect it would test positive for strangles," she said.

"The horse was moved into quarantine immediately and was treated with antibiotics. It is no longer showing signs but we will be doing more blood tests and a guttural pouch wash to make sure the antibiotics have treated the infection."

Abigail said no other horses at the centre have shown signs but all will be blood tested.

"We are very tight on biosecurity so we don't know how strangles got on to the yard -- we're at a loss. Our vet has said we'll never know, it could have been carried in by a horse that's picked it up somewhere or a person," she said.

"The bottom line is [it's] bad luck. Everybody in the equine community needs to be tight on biosecurity. We have done our very best to keep it contained and are on full lockdown."

Abigail said the centre was expecting record numbers for the BE event.

"We were very low on numbers and we lost money at our May event. We have thrown everything into the September event -- we've spent thousands on the cross-country course, the ground is in amazing condition, we have 50 sponsors.

"We were so upset because we had a low entry before the ballot date and put a plea out to say if you're going to enter to let us know and we were overwhelmed by the numbers received. Yesterday [14 Aug 2019] when we cancelled we had 818 entries, and 50 on the waiting list, but obviously horse welfare comes first," she said.

The centre is expected to be on lockdown until [3 Sep 2019].

"We're working with our vets and other local vets. We obviously won't be doing anything until we get the green light, but when we do we plan to run some one-day events and show cross. We might look at doing some intermediate and novice cross-country schooling over the jumps that never got used," said Abigail.

"We've had massive support from people -- it's been quite overwhelming. Everyone is behind us ready for the next event."

All BE entries will be refunded in full, and the BE100 regional final will be relocated to Alnwick Ford International on [28-29 Sep 2019].

[How very important and appropriate to put horse health first.

Strangles, a worldwide known highly infectious equine bacterial disease entity caused by infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_), is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases.

Strangles is a contagious infectious disease of Equidae characterized by abscessation of the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated beta-hemolytic Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3 to 14 days, and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscessation in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly the lymph nodes in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. _S. equi_ is the most common cause of brain abscess in horses, albeit rare.

Most horses continue to shed _S. equi_ for around one month after recovery. A total of 3 negative nasopharyngeal swabs at intervals of 4 to 7 days should be obtained before release from quarantine, and the minimal isolation period should be one month. Prolonged bacterial shedding (as long as 18 months) has been identified in a small number of horses. Guttural pouch empyema is the source of infection in most prolonged carrier states. Bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal swab and/or guttural pouch lavage is used to identify persistent carriers.

Post-exposure immunity is prolonged after natural disease in most horses, and protection is associated with local (nasal mucosa) production of antibody against the antiphagocytic M protein. The clinical attack rate of strangles is reduced by 50% in horses vaccinated with IM products that do not induce mucosal immunity. Local (mucosal) production of antibody requires mucosal antigen stimulation. An intranasal vaccine containing a live attenuated strain of _S. equi equi_ was designed to elicit a mucosal immunologic response. This attenuated strain is not temperature sensitive (inactivated by core body temperature) like the intranasal influenza vaccine. Reported complications include _S. equi equi_ abscesses at subsequent IM injection sites (live bacteria on hands of administrator), submandibular lymphadenopathy, serous nasal discharge, and purpura hemorrhagica.
