["Bovine babesiosis (BB) is a tick-borne disease of cattle caused by protozoan parasites of the genus _Babesia_, order Piroplasmida, phylum Apicomplexa. The principal species of _Babesia_ that cause BB are _B. bovis_, _B. bigemina_, and _B. divergens_. A recent study suggested that _Babesia_ sp. Mymensingh may be an additional species capable of causing clinical babesiosis in cattle. Other _Babesia_ that can infect cattle include _B. major_, _B. ovata_, _B. occultans_, and _B. jakimovi_."

"Morbidity and mortality vary greatly and are influenced by several factors, such as prevailing treatments employed in an area, previous exposure to a species/strain of parasite, age, cattle breed, and vaccination status. In endemic areas, cattle become infected at a young age and develop a long-term immunity. However, outbreaks can occur in these endemic areas if exposure to ticks by young animals is interrupted or immuno-na√Øve cattle are introduced. The introduction of _Babesia_ infected ticks into previously tick-free areas may also lead to outbreaks of disease."

"All _Babesia_ are transmitted by ticks with a limited host range. Bovine _Babesia_ species are principally maintained by subclinically infected cattle that have recovered from disease and by tick vectors via transovarial transmission. The principal vectors of _B. bovis_ and _B. bigemina_ are _Rhipicephalus_ spp. ticks and these are widespread in tropical and subtropical countries. The major arthropod vector of _B. divergens_ is _Ixodes ricinus_.

"BB is found in areas where its arthropod vector is distributed, especially tropical and subtropical climates. _B. bovis_ and _B. bigemina_ are more widely distributed and of major importance in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America. _B. divergens_ is economically important in some parts of Europe and possibly northern Africa."

"There is no indication that most cattle Babesia infect humans; however, _B. divergens_ can cause serious illnesses in people who have had splenectomies. Whether this organism can cause mild or asymptomatic infections in people with an intact spleen is still debated. Clinical cases thought to be caused by _B. bovis_ were reported in the past, but most or all of these organisms were probably _B. divergens_ or other misidentified species."
