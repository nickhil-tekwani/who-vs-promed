West Nile virus cases in horses rise in NSW as hot, wet summer fuels mosquito population
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A horse in the New South Wales Hunter region has died and more across the state have been infected with West Nile virus in numbers not seen since the outbreak of 2011.

Cases of the illness, including its Kunjin strain, have been diagnosed recently in northern and southern parts of NSW amid good breeding conditions for mosquitoes.

Scone vet Lucy Cudmore described the virus as "shocking" and said signs could vary, but it often presented in similar ways to the Hendra virus.

"It can be quite distressing to find your horse presenting with these neurological abnormalities," she said.

"They can look like they have a headache or look quite dull and depressed ... sometimes they'll have a fever."

Dr Cudmore encouraged horse owners who noticed signs such as weakness of limbs, loss of appetite and difficulty swallowing to act with caution, especially if the horse was not vaccinated against Hendra virus.

"Fortunately, the horse in itself is a dead-end host, so they can't pass the virus on to humans, which is different than Hendra," she said.

"But speak to your vet before approaching it or doing too much with the horse."

While horse-to-human infection does not occur, mosquitoes can infect humans and in serious cases the virus can cause hospitalisation.

What's the cure?
----------------
Dr Cudmore said horses usually began to recover within days, but each case was different and factors such as age and general immunity could have an impact.

Two of the recent cases in the Hunter had to be hospitalised and one passed away.

"There's no specific treatment ... it's really about supportive care," Dr Cudmore said.

"Some anti-inflammatories, some corticosteroids in some cases might be helpful, and then just making sure that they have good access to water, that they're able to drink and continue to eat."

She said some horses could need "a little more TLC", including intravenous fluids.

Without a cure, vets advise owners to keep mosquitoes away from their horses where possible and use animal-friendly insect repellent.

"Try to keep them out of the paddocks as much as you can in the dawn and dusk periods when the mozzies [mosquitoes] are most active," Dr Cudmore said.

"Keep your rugs on if you can."

Low fatality rates
------------------
The last time NSW and Victoria saw an outbreak was in 2011, when about 100 horses died from the virus.

Dr Cudmore said until weather conditions cooled down horse owners needed to remain vigilant.

Fortunately the Australian strain of West Nile virus is not as severe as it is in other countries.

"Compared to our US counterparts, this disease tends to be relatively milder than what they see, and certainly we have a lower mortality rate in Australia," Dr Cudmore said.

"The last outbreak was 2011 and we saw about 1000 horses between NSW and Victoria test positive to the virus and there was only about a 10% fatality rate."

"West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus. A strain of WNV, Kunjin virus (WNVKUN) is endemic in parts of Australia and has been present for many years."

"WNV is found across all continents except Antarctica. In Australia, WNVKUN has been infrequently associated with disease in humans. In 2011, there was a large outbreak of neurological disease in horses in South East Australia caused by a variant of the Australian strain WNVKUN."

"How is the virus spread?
"WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird cycle where mosquitoes act as vectors and birds act as natural hosts. The species of mosquito (_Culex annulirostris_) that most frequently spreads WNV breeds in fresh water. Wading birds are key natural reservoirs of WNV in Australia. Horses, people and a variety of other animals may become infected through a bite from an infected mosquito. There is no further spread of the virus from an infected mammal."

"Signs of West Nile virus
"In Australia, disease has been limited to horses, although several cases have been suspected (though not confirmed) in dogs and alpaca. Many animals infected with WNV do not develop any clinical signs. Unlike North American strains, Australian strains of WNV have not caused disease in birds. The early stages of disease may be mistaken for colic. Initially, horses may appear depressed and reluctant to move but these signs are soon followed by neurological signs. The most commonly encountered signs are those of ataxia (including stumbling, staggering, wobbly gait, or incoordination).

"Other nervous signs may include:
• Facial paralysis
• Muscle tremors/fasciculation
• Hyperaesthesia
• Circling
• Blindness
• Recumbency or inability to stand
• Hind limb weakness
• Multiple limb paralysis
• Altered mental state
• Hypermetria
• Depression

"When does it occur?
"WNV infections are encountered intermittently in NSW. The seasonal occurrence of WNV infection may vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the distributions of both the vector and the natural reservoirs. Virus transmission is more common after periods of very high rainfall in spring and early summer. However, infections in animals are more likely to be observed from February to April, sometimes when mosquito populations are not unusually high.

"Where does it occur?
"WNV is endemic in northern Australia. While _Culex annulirostris_ is common throughout NSW, very large populations develop in the Murray Darling River basin and Macquarie Marshes areas of NSW. Asymptomatic infection occurs intermittently in these areas and can be detected serologically in sentinel chickens or other animals, particularly dogs and horses.

"In 2011, cases of disease in horses in NSW were initially detected in south western and central western NSW but became widely distributed west of the Great Dividing Range from northern NSW to the Murray River in the south and throughout the Hunter Valley and Sydney basin.

"Diagnosis of West Nile Virus in Horses
"Diagnosis of West Nile virus in live horses is routinely based on detecting an immune response to the virus. Collection of paired clotted blood samples is recommended. The 1st (acute) sample should be taken as soon as possible after clinical signs have been observed. A 2nd convalescent sample should be collected approximately 21 days later. The acute samples should be submitted to the laboratory soon after collection as a high proportion of horses will give significant results in the WNV IgM assay at the time clinical signs are first observed. If cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been collected, it should also be submitted for testing for both the virus by qRT-PCR and for antibody detection. Although WNV can be detected in the central nervous system of acutely infected horses, it is not possible to detect viral RNA in blood samples.

"If the horse dies or is euthanased, both fresh and fixed brain, CSF and upper cervical spinal cord samples should be taken. The brain should be cut in half longitudinally to ensure that representative areas are available fresh for virus detection and fixed for histopathology. The risk of Hendra virus infection should be considered prior to tissue collection.

"Keep all samples chilled but do not freeze. The Department of Primary Industries covers the cost of laboratory testing of samples collected by a veterinarian to confirm or exclude suspected WNV infection in animals.

"For further information on submitting laboratory samples see http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/about-us/services/laboratory-services/sample-submission.

"Treatment
"There is no specific treatment available for WNV infections. Supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatory drugs may be required.

"Prevention
"Reducing exposure of horses to mosquitoes is the most effective measure to minimise the risk of infection with WNV. Mosquitoes are usually most active at dusk and dawn, so reducing time outside at these times may help. Insecticides and physical barriers, such as rugs for horses, may also be useful.

The strain of virus may be slightly different from the virus strains in North America. Nevertheless, we have vaccines to prevent this virus in the USA. The companies producing these vaccines are worldwide companies, so I am not understanding why there is not a vaccination in Australia to prevent this virus? - Mod.TG
