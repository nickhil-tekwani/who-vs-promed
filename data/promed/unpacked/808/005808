A Davidson County man who was bitten by a wild fox on Sunday [23 Jan 2022] marks the 1st reported case of rabies in the county, according to the Davidson County Health Department.

The health department was notified of the wild animal bite incident, and the animal has tested positive for rabies. On [23 Jan 2022] the county resident was bitten on the leg by a fox that had been underneath the individual's home in Thomasville. The man was able to kill the animal prior to contacting animal control.

The fox was removed from the property and lab results received on [25 Jan 2022] confirmed the fox was positive for rabies. Reports to the Davidson County Health Department limit exposure to only the individual who has been bitten. The man is seeking appropriate postexposure medical treatment, a press release from the health department indicated.

"This unfortunate event serves as a reminder to protect yourself, family, friends and pets, beware of wild animals, especially those out during the daytime," the press release continued. "Stay away from animals you do not know."

Rabies is 99.9% fatal in humans.

Here are some tips to avoid contact with rabies and what to do if you are exposed:
* Never touch a dead wild animal with your bare hands.
* Humans who have been exposed to rabies through direct contact should immediately begin treatment with the rabies vaccine postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent contracting the virus.
* If you are a pet owner, N.C. law requires that all domestic dogs, cats and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies by 4 months of age and kept current.
* If your vaccinated pet comes in contact with a wild animal, seek care from a veterinarian as a rabies booster vaccine for your pet may be needed.
* If you see stray dogs, cats or wildlife in your neighborhood, call Animal Control..
* If you have questions regarding your own exposure to any animal, please contact your healthcare provider to discuss your situation.

[4] Ontario: dog, human exposure

https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/confirmed-rabies-exposure-in-toronto-spurs-search-for-unidentified-owner-and-dog-1.5754094Q


Toronto Public Health (TPH) is looking to identify an owner and their dog which were licked and jumped on by a dog with a confirmed rabies case in early January [2022].

The interaction occurred on [12 Jan 2022], the agency says, when a brown, mixed labrador retriever, who has since tested positive for rabies, came in contact with an unidentified owner and their "bulldog-type dog" on Bison Drive and Regatta Crescent, near the intersection of Bathurst Street and Steeles Avenue West, in Toronto.

A statement issued on Tuesday [25 Jan 2022] by TPH says the Labrador, who at the time did not appear sick, jumped up on and licked the unidentified owner of the bulldog-type dog.

On [19 Jan 2022], TPH received a confirmation the Labrador has tested positive for rabies.

The agency is looking to speak with the owner of the bulldog "to assess their risk of exposure to rabies and, if needed, support preventative treatment."

TPH says all other human and canine contacts have been identified and contacted, with the exception of the bulldog-type dog and its owner, adding the agency has "engaged in door-knocking and postering in the community, as well as contacted nearby veterinarians and Toronto Animal Services." Because of this, the agency said the risk of rabies exposure to the general public remains very low.

According to TPH, the bulldog-type dog may have been named "Bulldozer" but says it's unsure of the dog's current name.

["Tuktoyaktuk/Tuk-tu-yaaq-tuuq or short version 'Tuk' (Inuvialuktun: resembling a caribou) is an Inuvialuit hamlet of about 965 people which is located on the shores of the Arctic Ocean at the tip of the Northwest Territories. Formerly known as Port Brabant, the community was renamed in 1950 and was the 1st place in Canada to revert to the traditional native name" (https://www.tuktoyaktuk.ca/). - Mod.TG]

Two dogs showing signs of rabies have been sighted in Tuktoyaktuk.

A [3 Feb 2022] notice from the Chief Environmental Health Officer advised the animals were spotted the day previous.

It notes animals with rabies can have varying signs. Some can be fearful while others can be aggressive. Many have excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, often stagger or walk backwards. They may make abnormal sounds, fall victim to paralysis or have seizures.

"If you have been bitten, licked, scratched or in contact with one of these dogs, a fox, or yours or someone else's dog after it was attacked, you should contact the Rosie Ovayuak Health Centre and report the incident immediately," said the notice. "Rabies in humans can be fatal without treatment. If you see a puppy or dog showing signs of rabies or if your dog has been attacked by a fox, please contact your ENR wildlife officer to report the contact immediately.

"Getting your dogs vaccinated for rabies is an important way to reduce the risk for you and your community. Vaccines can be provided by Lay Vaccinators in your community -- please contact your DHSS Environmental Health Officer or the Territorial Veterinarian to find out if a Lay Vaccinator is operating in your community. If you are a hunter, dog musher or otherwise regularly handle wildlife and animals, please ensure your own rabies vaccination is up to date."

The DHSS Environmental Health officer can be reached by email at <environmental_health@gov.nt.ca> and the Territorial Veterinarian can be reached at <WildlifeVeterinarian@gov.nt.ca>

[This posting indicates a wide variety of animals, enforcing the issue that rabies can affect any mammal, which includes human beings. You may recall in a previous rabies posting there was a rabid fox in the Northwest Territory and now there are dogs with rabies. It really cannot be over emphasized to vaccinate your pets and to ensure those vaccines are kept up-to-date. It is the first line of protection between you and wildlife. It can be a lifesaving measure for your pet, regardless of the size of your pet. Yes, vaccinate your cats and dogs but also your horses, cattle and any other animal you work with, show, ride, or exhibit, or co-exist with in any fashion.

Rabies is deadly to animals, and without proper treatment it can be deadly to human beings as well.

Rabies is where mammals are. It is not constrained by heat or cold or elevation. So be on the lookout for animals who may not have the normal expected behavior. Rabies can be present in the furious form or the dumb form. The dumb form may make animals appear unusually docile or friendly for a wild animal. So while they may seem friendly, be sure to consider the possibility of rabies. - Mod.TG
