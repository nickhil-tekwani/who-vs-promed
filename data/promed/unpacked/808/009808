The Taxonomy of Avian Coronaviruses
-----------------------------------
The purpose of this message is to correct a comment added by the Moderator
following the communication from Brazil describing a novel avian
coronavirus [see: Coronavirus, chicken, new - Brazil 20030403.0816].
Turkey coronavirus was stated to be within Group 2 coronavirus (of which
bovine coronavirus is also a member). Turkey coronavirus has recently been
moved from Group 2 to Group 3 (See: Virus Taxonomy", Seventh Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), edited by M.H.V. van
Regenmortel et al., Academic Press, 2000). Thus Group 3 contains 2
species, _Infectious bronchitis virus_ (IBV) of chickens and _Turkey
coronavirus_. Also, genetically very similar viruses have been isolated
from pheasants (see references below).
Turkey coronavirus had been assigned to Group 2 in the late 1980s or early
1990s on the basis of some antigenic and sequence analysis. Later
independent work at several laboratories in the USA and in our lab in UK
have shown that the virus isolated from turkeys in the USA and UK was
genetically and antigenically very similar to IBV. The gene sequences of
several turkey isolates were different from each other, from all IBV
strains being worked on in the laboratories, and from all IBV gene
sequences previously deposited in the nucleotide data banks.
Notwithstanding, experiments in the US have shown that turkeys can be
successfully infected with a bovine coronavirus; enteric disease resulted
(see: Ismail et al. (2001), Experimental bovine coronavirus in turkey
poults and young chickens. Avian Diseases, 45, 157-163).
As yet I believe that there is no hard evidence for the infection of
turkeys in the field with Group 2 coronaviruses. However, in view of the
data of Ismail et al., an open mind must be kept as to the potential of
non-Group 3 coronaviruses to infect turkeys and other avian species in the
field.

[Unfortunately my remarks as Moderator of the preceding post in this thread
were based on the text in the Seventh Report of the ICTV accompanying a
figure illustrating phylogenetic relationships in the genus _Coronavirus_.
This text is in conflict with the updated taxonomy appearing on page 842 of
the Seventh ICTV Report. ProMED-mail welcomes this clarification from Dr.
Cavanagh of the taxonomic status of the avian coronaviruses. - Mod.CP]
