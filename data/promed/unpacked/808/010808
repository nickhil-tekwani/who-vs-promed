A 44-year-old man died early this morning, 31 Oct 2005, in Vic
General Hospital (Barcelona) as part of the _Legionella_ outbreak
detected in this city, and now the death toll is 2, confirmed by
sources from the Generalitat's Health Advisory Board.

The victim was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Vic
General Hospital on 25 Oct 20095 and had some underlying disease. The
_Legionella_ outbreak had its 1st fatality 20 Oct 2005, an
81-year-old man who died 3 days after he was hospitalized because of
chronic bronchitis.

So far, the Health Advisory Board has detected 3 new cases, so that
the number of affected people is now 19. The 3 new cases are men, all
of them admitted on 30 Oct 2005 to Vic General Hospital. The 1st is a
73-year-old man whose symptoms appeared on 27 Oct 2005; the 2nd a
50-year-old man whose symptoms appeared on 29 Oct 2005; the 3rd a
50-year-old man whose symptoms appeared on 23 Oct 2005.

With respect to the 14 remaining cases, 1 died 20 Oct 2005, one is in
the ICU, 4 have been discharged, and the remaining 8 are still
hospitalized and doing well, according to the Health Advisory Board.

The Health Department, led by Dr. Marina Geli, in cooperation with
Vic city council, delimited a 2-kilometer area in order to clarify
the origin of the outbreak. 12 companies have been inspected, and 27
samples were taken from 6 of them, since the other companies either
did not have refrigeration towers or were in operation sporadically
and were closed when the outbreak occurred.

The samples are currently under study in the laboratory.
Additionally, shock disinfection measures have been taken in 11
refrigeration towers operated by 4 companies located within the
2-kilometer area in order to assure that this outbreak is under control.
