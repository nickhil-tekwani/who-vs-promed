While the nation and the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex have been gripped in fear over the 2nd US case of the deadly Ebola virus in Dallas, an even bigger threat has hit Texas -- enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), the respiratory killer that strikes children. Of the 691 cases of EV-D68 confirmed from by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now in 46 states and the District of Columbia, 14 of these cases are in Texas. On [9 Oct 2014], the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) confirmed that the children with EV-D68 were residents of Anderson, Bexar, Dallas (7), Denton, and Lubbock (4) counties. One additional confirmed case was in a resident of another state.

EV-D68 is one of the more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses, first identified in California in 1962, according to the CDC; yet, 28 patients in 7 states are experiencing non-characteristic paralysis symptoms, including an 11 year boy from Allen [Collin County, Texas]. He was taken to Children's Health System of Texas in Dallas for a respiratory infection last July, the Dallas Morning News reported. The youngster was treated and sent home, only his symptoms got worse and he lost the use of his right arm. He returned to the hospital where he's remained since the summer.

NBC-5 reported that doctors suspect the Reed Elementary 6th grader has EV-D68. He spent much of the past 2 months on a ventilator and continues to have a tracheostomy tube in his throat. He still needs the ventilator at night to breathe. He also remains partially paralyzed. He is improving and is not infectious and will be transferred to a rehabilitation facility where he faces "month, not years, of physical therapy" and he may never fully recover. Part of his therapy is relearning how to talk. Children's Health neurologist Dr Ben Greenberg said that although the boy tested positive for enterovirus, the hospital is waiting on a final determination from samples sent to the CDC to see if, indeed, it is the D68 strain, according to the Dallas Morning News article. Jeff Allard, Director of Pediatric Nursing at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, also told NBC-5 in their report that EV-D68 has a telltale sign -- wheezing in kids. He said that the wheezing is of concern and when that symptom is present, families are being asked to contact their children's doctors.

In Lubbock, the Avalanche-Journal reported an additional case on [10 Oct 2014], although it was not recorded with the DSHS. If confirmed, this would bring the Texas EV-D68 tally up to 15.

EV-D68 is not new. What is new is the dramatic jump in numbers of children showing up at hospitals around the country in 2014. "In about 2 dozen cases reported in the United States and Canada, the patients developed polio-like symptoms. A smaller cluster of polio-like cases were identified in California from August 2012 to July 2013," the Dallas Morning News included in their article.

Additionally, Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the DSHS told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal that concerns were raised about EV-D68 earlier this summer [2014] in yet another part of the country. He said, "There were 2 clusters of illness that were unusual -- one in Chicago and one in Kansas City. It was a really sort of intense cluster of cases. A lot of children were showing up in the hospital with respiratory symptoms around the same time. That caused concern because that was unusual. That sort of sounded the alarm and started people looking for the virus. We haven't seen that sort of thing in Texas, but we have seen cases." Several years ago, another strand of enterovirus, human enterovirus EV 71, produced cases of illness and paralysis in South America and Australia [and hand-foot-mouth disease in South-East Asia - Mod.CP], according to the Dallas Morning News article on the Allen youth. Still, medical professionals caution against panic over EV-D68. Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) Medical Director/Health Authority Dr Christopher Perkins said on [26 Sep 2014] that not all respiratory illnesses occurring are EV-D68. This also is cold and flu season.

The enterovirus season runs from July through October. Almost all of the confirmed cases of the virus this year [2014] have been among children the CDC reported. Infants, children, and teenagers are at higher risk than adults for getting infected and sick with enteroviruses like EV-D68. The CDC stated that is "because they have not been exposed to these types of viruses before, and they do not yet have immunity (protection) built up to fight the disease." They emphasized that children with asthma or a history of wheezing are at greater risk for severe respiratory illness from EV-D68. The CDC site states that EV-D68 "has been detected in specimens from samples submitted for testing from 5 patients who died. None of these children were in Texas. FOX News reported a 6th case on [12 Oct 2014]. EV-D68 is now being blamed for the death of a Michigan toddler. These cases are all under investigation.

EV-D68 has flu-like symptoms. On the mild side of the spectrum that may include a fever, runny nose, cough, and body or muscle aches, while more severe symptoms include wheezing and difficulty breathing. The CDC recommends a few tips to prevent catching or even spreading EV-D68 [or any other enterovirus - Mod.CP]. Washing hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds tops the list followed by avoiding physical contact such as kissing, hugging, and sharing cups or utensils with people who are sick. Covering one's mouth when coughing and sneezing into a tissue or shirtsleeve instead of a hand is also suggested. Parents are advised to clean and disinfect toys and doorknobs if someone is sick and to keep children out of school when sick.

[2] CDC: statement on faster testing
Date: Tue 14 Oct 2014

CDC develops a new, faster lab test for enterovirus D68
-------------------------------------------------------
Confirmed cases will appear to rise as agency accelerates specimen testing. Changes in case counts due to faster testing will not represent a real-time influx of new cases.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed and started using a new, faster lab test for detecting enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in specimens from people in the United States with respiratory illness. This test will allow CDC to more rapidly test remaining specimens received from states since mid-September [2014].

Every year, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses cause millions of respiratory illnesses in children. This year [2014], EV-D68 has been the most common type of enterovirus identified, leading to increases in illnesses among children and affecting those with asthma most severely. Other rhinoviruses and enteroviruses continue to be detected as well. CDC expects, as with other enteroviruses, that EV-D68 infections will likely begin to decline by late fall. The real-time lab results combined with data on hospital admissions will help us understand when and where the EV-D68 outbreak is ending. CDC has received informal reports from some hospitals and states that are seeing signs of decreasing EV-D68 infections. CDC is gathering more information from states and assessing whether this represents a national trend.

"CDC has received substantially more specimens for enterovirus lab testing than usual this year [2014], due to the large outbreak of EV-D68 and related hospitalizations," said Anne Schuchat, MD, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "When rare or uncommon viruses suddenly begin causing severe illness, CDC works quickly to develop diagnostic tests to enhance our response and investigations. This new lab test will reduce what would normally take several weeks to get results to a few days."

Since the outbreak of EV-D68 began in August [2014], CDC has tested 1163 specimens submitted by hospitals and from 45 states. Of the specimens tested by the CDC lab from [1 Aug to 10 Oct 2014], about half have tested positive for EV-D68. About 1/3 have tested positive for a rhinovirus or an enterovirus other than EV-D68. The new lab test will allow us to process the approximately 1000 remaining specimens at a much faster rate.

Testing for EV-D68 is not used to determine treatment for a particular patient. Treatment for patients with EV-D68 is supportive therapy, such as oxygen therapy. The outcome of the EV-D68 test is to collect surveillance data to help public health officials target our responses to the outbreak, not to determine the treatment plan for a specific patient. CDC prioritized testing for the most severe cases since the outbreak began in August [2014] to get a better understanding of the disease.

As CDC tests the remaining specimens it has received since mid-September [2014], the number of confirmed EV-D68 cases will likely increase substantially in the coming days. These increases will not reflect changes in real time or mean that the situation is getting worse. Ultimately, faster testing will help to better show the trends of this outbreak since August and to monitor changes that are occurring now. CDC expects to complete testing of the remaining specimens that were received since mid-September within about seven to 10 days; going from testing about 40 specimens per day to testing up to 180 per day. This will allow us to then test and report results for new specimens within a few days of receiving them.

CDC's new lab test is a "real-time" reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or rRT-PCR, and it identifies all strains of EV-D68 that we have been seeing this summer and fall [2014]. The new test has fewer and shorter steps than the test that CDC and some states were using for the EV-D68 outbreak. Also, the new test allows more specimens to be tested at the same time. The previous test, which CDC used for about 9 years, is very sensitive and can be used to detect and identify almost all enteroviruses; however, it requires multiple, labor-intensive processing steps and cannot be easily scaled up to support testing of large numbers of specimens in real time that is needed for the current EV-D68 outbreak.

Many viruses, including influenza viruses, cause respiratory illnesses. While there is not a vaccine to prevent illness from enterovirus infection, the single best way to protect against the flu is to get vaccinated each year. The timing of flu seasons can vary but activity usually begins to increase in October. CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine. Flu vaccination is especially important for those at high risk, such as children with asthma. To help stop the spread of germs and prevent respiratory illnesses, wash hands often with soap and water and practice good health habits.

[So far enterovirus D68 has affected 691 people in 46 US states in recent weeks, almost all of them children. "CDC has received substantially more specimens for enterovirus lab testing than usual this year (2014), due to the large outbreak of EV-D68 and related hospitalizations," said Anne Schuchat, MD, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a CDC news release. "This new lab test will reduce what would normally take several weeks to get results to a few days." Since the outbreak of EV-D68 began in August (2014), the CDC has tested 1163 specimens. Of the specimens tested by the CDC lab from 1 Aug to 10 Oct 2014, about half have tested positive for EV-D68. The new "real-time" lab test will greatly speed up the testing of specimens received by the CDC since mid-September 2014.

Human EV-D68 continues to be isolated erratically throughout the seasonal occurrence of gastrointestinal throughout the summer months in North America. This year (2014) such infections appear to be relatively severe, although EV-D68 is normally a prominent component of infant disease at this time of year. Although EV-D68 has only occurred sporadically and at low frequency it has tended to be associated with severe disease, but only sporadically and not coincident with individual cases of neurological and paralytic disease. However the association of EV-D68 with neurological disease has caused alarm but the association between this virus and severe disease outcomes still remains to be conclusively established. Historically EV-D68 has been associated with some outbreaks of neurological disease in the Americas, but currently cases of EV-D68 and severe disease are not always coincident and other compounding factors may be more important. Certainly the presence of EV-D68 has invoked alarm in 2014. The inability of most hospitals to identify EV-D68 has slowed analysis of the role of this virus in the current outbreak, although the virus appears to have now spread throughout North America.

CDC's new lab test is a "real-time" reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, that is claimed to have identified so far all strains of EV-D68 that have been encountered in the summer and fall of 2014. - Mod.CP]
