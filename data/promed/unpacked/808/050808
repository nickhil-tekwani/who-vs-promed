An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Mato Grosso do Sul in late
February,
1998 (the first in Brazil in four years) has, to date, put 2,940 cattle, 64
goats and 16 pigs at risk. All animals have been destroyed or slaughtered.
The diagnosis, done at the Regional animal Support Laboratory at Recife,
showed the causal agent to be serotype 01 virus. The source of infection is
suspected to be illegally introduced cattle. An investigation is underway.
Results of screening within a 25-mile km radius of the two outbreak sites,
as well as in all herds that were in contact through animal movements, have
been negative.

[This outbreak is serious in its implications as Brazil is well on its way
to FMD eradication. Convalescent cattle can shed FMDV for an extended period
and this was the traditional and common mode of inter-provincial/state
spread of this disease in South America. Obviously, the control of cattle
movements has not kept pace with science in Brazil. - Mod.MHJ
