A top official said that 30 people have died due to encephalitis in the past 10 days at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.

"More than 100 people hailing from the districts of North Bengal were admitted with symptoms of encephalitis during this time," Dr Amarendranath Sarkar, Superintendent of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, said.

Most of the patients came from Jalpaiguri district and some others from Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and North Dinajpur districts, he said. They were admitted with high fever and other symptoms of encephalitis, he said.

[Not enough information is provided to speculate on the etiological agent that might be involved in this outbreak. Cases are occurring in several localities, indicating that whatever is causing the encephalitis is present in more than one place.

West Bengal state neighbors Bihar state, which has had a significant number of encephalitis cases this year (2014). These cases in West Bengal may or may not be related to those that have been occurring in Bihar state.

Encephalitis with fever could be caused by a variety of viruses, and the start of the monsoon season brings on the Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season. There is no indication in the above report that laboratory tests are being carried out. ProMED would appreciate receiving results of any tests that are being done.
