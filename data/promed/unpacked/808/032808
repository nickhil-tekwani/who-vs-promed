The Public Health Ministry has issued an alert about the return of
chikungunya disease, which has spread to 23 provinces and affected more
than 20 000 people since January [2009]. The southern provinces are hardest
hit with almost 8000 cases reported in Songkhla province alone.

The announcement, released yesterday [23 May 2009], said health authorities
will intensify their war on garden-striped mosquitoes, which spread the
disease [virus], after 20 541 cases were recorded in 23 provinces from the
start of this year to 20 May [2009].

The number of people taken ill, which has increased by more than 5000
people in less than a month, has persuaded provincial public health
officials to step up their mosquito eradication campaign, particularly in
the south, where dark and humid rubber plantations make ideal mosquito
breeding grounds.

The southern provinces of Nakhon Si Thammarat, Narathiwat, Pattani,
Songkhla, Trang, and Yala have reported unusually high numbers of people
infected with chikungunya disease since January [2009].

Pattira Thangrattanasuwan, director of the Crown Prince Hospital in
Pattani's Sai Buri district, said the vector-borne disease [virus] had now
become the most serious health threat to people in the deep South.

"The hospital has made chikungunya the number one health threat, ahead even
of the southern violence which had been ranked the top cause of physical
and mental illness among Sai Buri people," said Dr Pattira. More than 800
people had come down with the disease in the district over the past 6
months, she said.

The re-emergence of the disease in rural areas after a long period of
absence in 1995 prompted health authorities to question whether chikungunya
disease had developed into a more dangerous strain. Vichai Satimai,
director of the vectorborne disease bureau, said the current chikungunya
outbreak was related to the African strain of virus, which could spread
rapidly.

A specific study on changes in virus virulence had not yet been made.
However, an expert in vectorborne diseases believed climate change might
affect the life cycle of mosquitoes, enabling them to produce a minimum
infective dose of the dengue or chikungunya viruses faster than before.

"Chikungunya fever is not life threatening. But patients may experience
persistent joint and muscle pain up to a year or more, which obviously can
affect their way of life," he said. Symptoms of chikungunya fever occur
among adults more than children, unlike dengue fever. Pain medication and
long-term anti-inflammatory therapy might be required, he said.

Paijit Warachit, Public Health Ministry deputy permanent secretary, said
health agencies were trying to contain the disease by sending provincial
staff and health volunteers to spray rubber plantations with chemicals that
kill mosquitoes and larvae in water sources. Residents would be told to
destroy breeding grounds of the disease carrier and protect themselves from
mosquitoes by using mosquito nets and repellent lotion.

Dr Paijit said the opportunity for chikungunya flare-ups in other areas
apart from the south was slim due to geographical differences. However,
reports of isolated cases in different parts of the country were possible
and national surveillance was needed among targeted police, military, and
students returning home from the south to ensure that the outbreak was
contained.

Meanwhile, 13 cases of chikungunya disease have also been reported in the
north eastern province of Ubon Ratchathani. These people developed the
disease after returning from working at a rubber plantation in the south,
said Sarayut Uttamangkapong, director of the disease control and prevention
north eastern office.

[A genetic analysis of the chikungunya virus circulating in Thailand,
comparing it to isolates of the virus from Malaysia and India would be of
interest. Also, it would be of interest to know if the main mosquito vector
of the virus, the "garden-striped mosquito" mentioned above, is _Aedes
aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ in southern Thailand.

The chikungunya [virus] that has ravaged Southern Thailand has spilled
over, with 13 patients detected in Si Sa Ket, Ubon Ratchathani, and Amnat
Charoen, an official said yesterday [23 May 2009].

Most are rubber-plantation workers and soldiers returning from the south,
said Disease Control Office 7 chief Dr Sarayuth Uttamangkhapong. He
expressed concern that 9 more people had developed chikungunya symptoms
although they had not been outside their provinces.

Nakhon Ratchasima, which has had 92 dengue-fever patients this year [2009],
saw Muang district's Tambon Jor Hor villagers making a good use of cake
tins to eliminate mosquitoes. [A tambon is a local government unit in
Thailand below district (amphoe) and province (changwat) levels. - Mod.TY]
They placed open tins lined with black cloths in dark corners of their
homes to lure the insects and initially trapped 100 per container. With the
lids back on, the tins were left in hot sunlight to kill the mosquitoes,
making ideal fish food. The tambon has reported no single case of dengue fever.

[The widespread endemicity of dengue viruses in Thailand indicates that the
_Aedes_ mosquito vectors are also widespread there. Since the dengue
viruses and chikungunya virus are transmitted by the same species of
mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_), it would not be
surprising to see chikungunya virus infections occurring in additional
areas in Thailand in the near future.
