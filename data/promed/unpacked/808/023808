2003/093 Phytoplasmas of fruit trees and grapevine in Albania
------------------------------------------
***These are the first reports of phytoplasma diseases of fruit trees and
grapevine in Albania.***
Orchards and vineyards in 8 districts of central and southeastern Albania
were surveyed for the presence of phytoplasma diseases. Symptoms of
European stone fruit yellows, apple proliferation, pear decline, and
grapevine yellows were observed.
Laboratory test results showed that 5 fruit trees (apricot, myrobalan [also
called cherry plum], and plum) were infected by European stone fruit
yellows phytoplasma [ESFY], 5 apple trees by apple proliferation
phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), and 1 pear tree by pear decline
phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine pest).
All tested grapevines had bois noir, but were not infected by grapevine
flavescence doree phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine pest).
The situation of both apple proliferation and pear decline phytoplasmas in
Albania can be described as follows: Present, no details.

[Phytoplasmas are becoming more common in crops monitored by ProMED-Plant.
Phytoplasmas related to the ESFY subgroup were reported for the first time
in the UK in 2001. No cross-reaction was detected in western blots between
ESFY antibodies raised and the closely related apple proliferation and pear
decline phytoplasmas. - Mod.DH]
