re: Avian influenza (44): Viet Nam, civet
-----------------------------------------
Granted, the civets you mention are endangered, but what I find more
interesting is that 3 non-human primates also died. How are the non-human
primates of the H5N1-endemic world faring? Why don't we hear more about how
they are being impacted and what that means to humans?

[No primates have, so far, been included in USGS List of Species (wildlife
and domestic animals) Confirmed Infected by H5N1 (Avian Influenza), based
upon referenced reports. See
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/affected_species_chart.jsp>.

The 3 non-human primates Bill Edstrom refers to are 2 langurs (Family:
Cercopithecidae, Subfamily: Colobinae) and one loris (Family: Lorisidae,
Subfamily: Lorinae), which -- according to the cited media report -- died
in the Cuc Phuong National Park between 2 Feb and 2 Mar 2008. The report
mentioned that, during the said period -- in addition to the 5 Owston's
palm civets -- 2 common palm civets and 5 peewit hoopie birds died as well.
The director of Viet Nam's Central Veterinary Diagnosis Centre was cited
referring to H5N1 virus in the the 5 Owston's palm civets. It would indeed
be interesting to learn whether the other dead animals were autopsied and
laboratory-examined, and about the results of such investigations, if
performed. - Mod.AS]
