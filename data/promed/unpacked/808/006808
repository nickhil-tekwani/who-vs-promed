Unusually high numbers of dead Eastern bluebirds, _Sialia sialis_, were reported to the Cornell Wildlife Health Laboratory (CWHL) this past summer [2017]. The reports came mostly from people who have monitored nest boxes for years and knew this was a cause for concern. Postmortem examination of several birds revealed the cause of death was severe damage to the inner wall of the intestine: an ulcerative, or necrotizing, enteritis. Looking at data collected though our New York Wildlife Health Surveillance Program, no cases of necrotizing enteritis or high bluebird mortality have been recorded in the last 7 years.

Deaths from necrotizing enteritis with a similar presentation have been reported in Western bluebirds, _Sialia mexicana_. Originally the disease was thought to be a fatal synergy between a parasite and a bacterium. Traumatic damage to the wall of the intestine by the thorny-headed worm (acanthocephalid) _Plagiorhyncus_ sp, which lives in the intestine of several garden birds, was thought to provide a good environment for the development of a bacterial infection. The combination would cause ulcers (areas of tissue death or necrosis in the wall of the intestine) and eventually kill the bird. The theory doesn't always hold, however. Some of the affected birds, both in the Western reports and in the ones examined by the CWHL, had necrotizing enteritis but did not seem to be carrying any acanthocephalids. Acanthocephalids are also commonly found in healthy bluebirds and other garden species, indicating that their presence is not necessarily linked to disease.

A total of 27 separate reports regarding dead bluebirds were received by the CWHL, from early April to mid-August [2017]. In 23 instances, dead bluebirds were submitted for necropsy, and approximately half of them were suitable for a full postmortem examination by a wildlife pathologist. Necrotizing enteritis was confirmed as the cause of death in just over a 3rd of those examined. Similar to what is now known about the disease in Western bluebirds, acanthocephalids were not present in all cases: a 3rd of our Eastern birds with necrotizing enteritis carried no parasites.

It seems clear that this disease affects both Western and Eastern bluebirds, but what triggers it and why it only happens sporadically remains unknown. Please be on the lookout for sick or dead bluebirds next spring, and contact the CWHL (<cwhl@cornell.edu>) if you see any. The more we look into this mysterious disease the more chances we have to figure out what causes it and whether we can do something to prevent it.

[The scenario described resembles other wildlife die-off episodes where there is no single culprit, but perhaps a multifactorial web of causation. When parasites that are part of the normal parasite community of a host are unusually pathogenic, there might be some underlying context that is affecting that host-parasite relationship. When the stress-host-parasite equilibrium is broken, the tolerance to parasites is reduced and hosts become increasingly deteriorated (for a review on the subject see <www.dx.doi.org/10.14409/favecv.v14i1/2.5160>).

Further research should be aimed at establishing the underlying predisposing factor. It is very likely that these recurrent die-offs are caused by the combination of multiple factors that interact synergistically. Do to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts.
