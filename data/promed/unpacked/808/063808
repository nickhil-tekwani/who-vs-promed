The 1st coronavirus infection in Kuwait
---------------------------------------
Communicable disease alert following suspected transmission of the infection to a physician.

Informed medical sources revealed to the Al Rai journalist the 1st MERS-CoV case in a Kuwaiti citizen. The doctors stated that the patient is in serious condition in the intensive care unit in Adan Hospital [in Kuwait City].

The sources stated that a female physician supervising the patient is suspected to have contracted the virus as well, after developing symptoms of high temperature.

The sources pointed out that the doctors at the communicable diseases hospital were not able to transfer the patient because of his serious condition, noting the state of emergency in anticipation of receiving infected cases. Kuwait joins the rest of the Gulf States that have reported MERS-CoV cases with the exception of Bahrain.

[If this case is confirmed through official sources, this will represent the 1st confirmed infection in a Kuwaiti national and the 156th laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the world, including 65 deaths. If the physician who had contact with the case is also confirmed as positive it will increase the total number of laboratory confirmed cases to 157.

Helpful information would include history of travel during the incubation period, history of contact with other ill individuals (possible or known clinical cases of MERS-CoV infection), history of contact with animals, history of prior illnesses, age, and gender.
