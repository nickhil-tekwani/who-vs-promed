I think the issue isn't just about virulence. Virulence will vary with
strain, and this is probably independent of mecA status (i.e. some MRSA
strains will be more virulent, and some MSSA strains will be more
virulent). Also, some strains have a greater spreadability potential.
Haley (Ann Int Med 1991 114,162-164) also questioned whether we should just
leave MRSA alone (i.e. no special attention). On the other hand, I was
vigorously rebutted by Dr Mehta, another UK microbiologist, at a meeting
when I expressed sentiments similar to Dr Barrett's.
The issue about trying to contain MRSA is also very much about:
1. Cost to the hospital in vancomycin use (to treat MRSA infections and for
empiric treatment in units where MRSA is endemic)
2. Microbial cost - potential for VRSA, emergence or selection of VRE and
other vancomycin-resistant organisms.
As a microbiologist, I think the latter is the greatest longterm problem.
The question is, whether the effort and money spent on MRSA control
measures are worth it and whether the measures are effective. Experience
varies, but some people have documented reduction or elimination of MRSA
from their units with strict control measures. In our hospital, we used to
have an endemic MRSA problem in our neonatal ICUs. We have now managed to
obtain MRSA-free months, although we do get repeated reintroductions of
MRSA, probably orginating from other hospitals, as doctors rotate through
hospitals in our health service and most hospitals have significant MRSA
prevalence.
My personal impression is that there is probably a critical limit
of MRSA prevalence beyond which control measures are largely futile (I hope
to be proved wrong, perhaps by a case-control study of wards with and
without control measures), and that control measures are most beneficial in
hospitals which have a near-zero rate of MRSA. I hear, for example in
Australia, that in certain states MRSA rates are high, but that in Perth,
MRSA is virtually non-existent or eliminated and contained with every new
introduction. Can anyone give input on this?
