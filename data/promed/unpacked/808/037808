Between 9 and 15 Oct 2020, EU Member States reported 14 human cases of WNV infection: Italy (11), Greece (2) and Bulgaria (1). Pazardzhik Province in Bulgaria reported a locally acquired human case of WNV infection for the 1st time through TESSy. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, 3 deaths were reported by Italy (2) and Bulgaria (1). No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU-neighbouring countries.

On 15 Oct 2020, Dutch health authorities reported the 1st locally acquired human WNV infection in the Netherlands. The patient had no travel history, and it is suspected that he may have contracted the virus through a mosquito bite in the region of Utrecht. In this region, WNV-infected birds and mosquitoes have been detected in August and September [2020]. As this case has yet been reported through TESSy, it is currently not represented on the maps and in the Surveillance Atlas.

Since the start of the 2020 transmission season and as of 15 Oct 2020, EU Member States have reported 299 human cases of WNV infection and 34 deaths through TESSy: Greece (137, including 20 deaths), Spain (75, including 7 deaths), Italy (65, including 5 deaths), Germany (12), Romania (6, including 1 death), Hungary (3) and Bulgaria (1). Pazardzhik Province in Bulgaria, the Province of Badajoz in Spain, and 5 regions in Germany (regions of Barnim, Ostprignitz-Ruppin, Saalekreis, Halle (Saale) and Meissen) reported locally acquired human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU-neighbouring countries.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 167 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (127), Germany (18), Italy (12), France (5), Portugal (2), Austria (2) and Hungary (1) through ADNS. Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 2 outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS, both by Bulgaria.

A male patient has been diagnosed with the West Nile virus last week. The man has not been abroad recently. He may have contracted the virus in the region of Utrecht due to a mosquito bite. In this region, birds and mosquitoes have been detected with the West Nile virus in August and September [2020]. This is the 1st time that an infection with this virus has been diagnosed in a person who has contracted it in the Netherlands.

The West Nile virus circulates in birds and is transmitted by mosquitoes. The mosquitoes get infected by feeding on infected birds. Afterwards, these mosquitoes spread the virus to other birds and sometimes to humans and other mammals, such as horses. People and horses can become ill from infection with this virus but do not play a role in the further spread of the disease. The virus is not transmitted from human to human or from human to animal.

Most people do not develop disease following an infection with the West Nile virus. About 80% do not display any symptoms at all; 20% develop mild symptoms such as a fever and flu-like disease. However, about 1% of the people who are infected can develop severe neurological disease, such as brain inflammation. In that case, treatment in a hospital is necessary. A small percentage of people with such a severe disease can die. An infection with the virus has previously been detected in the Netherlands, but all these infections were contracted abroad.

The West Nile virus has spread over large parts of the world in recent decades. The disease has been occurring for some time in southeastern Europe and the Mediterranean. In recent years, the disease has spread to Central Europe, including the central part of Germany. Further spread to Western Europe was in line with expectations.

In the Netherlands, in August of this year [2020], West Nile virus was detected for the 1st time in a whitethroat in a nature reserve near Utrecht. The bird was examined within the framework of the One Health PACT research project. Within this project, the occurrence and prediction of mosquito-borne viruses in the Netherlands are being investigated. As a result of this discovery, the Dutch microbiological laboratories and specialists were informed to be more vigilant of this infection. That the virus had been circulating in the Utrecht region was confirmed by research carried out on mosquitoes and the discovery of 2 more positive birds.

With the weather change and dropping temperatures of the last few weeks, the mosquito season is coming to an end. This minimises the risk of contracting an infection with West Nile virus. Before the next mosquito season, advice and possible further actions will be proposed.

[On 16 Sep 2020, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) announced that a bird, a type of migratory warbler, in the Utrecht region of the Netherlands has tested positive for the West Nile virus (WNV) (https://www.horse-international.com/west-nile-virus-found-in-the-netherlands-for-the-first-time/).

Excerpt from the NL Times:
The warbler was caught towards the end of August [2020] as part of a program organized by the Erasmus Medical Center. The RIVM said that warblers arrive in April and leave for Africa towards the end of the summer. Because this particular bird was captured and tested at the end of the summer, researchers suspect it became infected in the Netherlands.

"The consortium is working on the development of an early warning system as part of a research project. The system must detect the introduction of a number of exotic viruses, including the West Nile virus, as early as possible," the RIVM said.

Over a thousand wild birds have been captured and tested since January [2020]. In previous years, birds with West Nile virus antibodies have been found, but never one with an active infection. "Because they were not migratory birds, these birds probably contracted the infection in or around the Netherlands" (https://nltimes.nl/2020/09/16/west-nile-virus-surfaces-netherlands-first-time-ever).

WNV appears to be expanding its geographical range in Europe and in the rest of the world, causing increasing numbers of outbreaks associated with human morbidity and mortality. Given this continuing unpredictability and the rapid development of epidemics, timely surveillance for WNV infection is warranted at the country and EU levels. This includes veterinary and entomological surveillance, as well as molecular surveillance of emerging strains. - Mod.UBA
