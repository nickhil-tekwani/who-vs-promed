A 30 year old Indonesian man has died of avian influenza, a senior health
ministry official said on Fri 28 Apr 2006, citing the results of local
tests. His blood samples have been sent to a World Health
Organization-affiliated laboratory in Hong Kong for confirmation, Hariadi
Wibisono, a director at the Health Ministry, told Reuters. Local tests are
not considered definitive.
If confirmed by the Hong Kong laboratory, the man who died on Wed 26 Apr
2006 would be Indonesia's 25th death from H5N1 virus [infection], which is
endemic in poultry in the world's 4th most populous nation.
"We have another positive local test on a 30 year old man. He had a history
of contact with sick chickens near his house. He died on 26 Apr 2006,"
Wibisono told Reuters. "We just received the result this morning and the
samples have been sent to Hong Kong."
Contact with infected birds is the most common means of transmission of the
bird flu virus in humans. So far, the WHO has confirmed 24 human deaths
from the H5N1 virus in Indonesia.
