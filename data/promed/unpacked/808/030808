[There continue to be some new cases recognized, although nowhere near as many as early in this very large, preventable outbreak.

Case counts by state are based on the state where the procedure was performed, not the state of residence.

Although the dates of onset of the newly reported cases are not given, it is likely that the increase is not primarily due to newly presenting cases but rather just newly reported cases. Based on a report regarding the 1st 346 cases (Smith RM, Schaefer MK, Kainer MA, et al: Fungal infections associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections -- preliminary report. N Engl J Med 2012. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1213978; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1213978), the weekly case count peaked in mid-October 2012, and the peak incubation period from last injection was approximately 28 days with only 8 (2.3 per cent) having an incubation period from last injection of more than 40 days. Some late outliers, however, have appeared, but the onset of symptoms after last injection is not reported in the CDC updates.
