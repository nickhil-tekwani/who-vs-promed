Recent reports of tularemia activity among animals and humans in northern Wyoming are raising concerns this summer about the disease, according to the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH).

"Recently, we are hearing about rabbit die-offs and have seen tularemia cases confirmed in 2 Weston County residents, in dead voles near Devils Tower in Crook County and in a Washakie County cat," said Dr. Tracy Murphy, state epidemiologist with WDH. "Tularemia is always a concern but is not common. To see this activity is concerning."

Murphy said tularemia can be a serious disease and, in rare cases, deadly. Tularemia symptoms can include fever, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, skin ulcers and diarrhea. If the bacteria are inhaled, symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough and progressive weakness and pneumonia.

Recommendations to help avoid tick-related diseases include:
- Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to see ticks crawling on clothing.
- Tuck pant legs into socks.
- Apply insect repellents such as those containing 20 percent or more DEET and/or picaradin.
- Upon return from potentially tick-infested areas, search self and children for ticks and remove if found.
- Check pets for ticks; use tick control products recommended by veterinarians.

Added precautions to help reduce tularemia risk include:
- Avoid bathing, swimming or working in untreated water and avoid drinking untreated water.
- Avoid handling rabbits, squirrels or other animals that appear sick.
- Wear rubber gloves when skinning animals, especially rabbits and squirrels; skin animals in a well-ventilated area.
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling sick or dead animals.
- Cook meat thoroughly before eating, especially rabbit and squirrel.

[In the latest report on tularemia in the USA (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/state.html), between 2004 and 2013 Wyoming reported no more than 4 human cases per year.

Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology.

Humans become infected through various mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. - Mod.LL
