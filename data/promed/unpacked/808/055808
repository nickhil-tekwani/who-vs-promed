Regarding James Chin's correspondence on a new chick cell origin rabies
vaccine for humans: are any data available concerning the breadth of
protection, or cross-protection, generated by the currently licensed human,
and animal use rabies vaccines against the different subtypes or variants
of rabies viruses found throughout the world?
Is post exposure treatment the same irrespective of the possible source
(fox versus bat, for example) of exposure?

[Good question. One has always presumed that there is equal protection, but
that need not be the case. Does anyone have hard data? - Mod.MHJ
