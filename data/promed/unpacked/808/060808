--------------------------------------------------------------------

In July 2020, PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for enteric disease surveillance, detected a cluster of 17 _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections. The isolates were closely related genetically to each other (4 allele differences) by whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis and related to isolates from 2 previous outbreaks of _S._ Typhimurium infections linked to pet hedgehogs (1,2). An investigation was initiated to characterize illnesses and identify the outbreak source.

A case was defined as the isolation of _S._ Typhimurium closely related by WGS to the outbreak strain in a specimen from a patient with illness onset during April-November 2020. State and local officials interviewed patients about hedgehog exposures and purchase information. Animal and environmental sampling of hedgehog enclosures was conducted at some patient residences. Hedgehog purchase locations were contacted in an attempt to identify a possible common source or supplier of hedgehogs. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (45 C.F.R. part 46, 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. Sect. 241(d); 5 U.S.C. Sect. 552a; 44 U.S.C. Sect. 3501 et seq.).

Forty-nine cases were identified in 25 states, including 14 (29%) in children aged less than 5 years. Eleven (26%) of 42 patients with available information were hospitalized, and no deaths were reported. Among 36 interviewed patients (or their parents or guardians), 30 (83%) reported hedgehog contact before becoming ill. Seven of 13 patients reported awareness of the risk for salmonella transmission from hedgehogs and other small mammals. Samples collected from hedgehogs in patients' homes in New York and North Dakota and from a hedgehog habitat in California yielded the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium. Isolates were closely related genetically (23 allele differences). The Public Health Agency of Canada identified 31 cases highly related by WGS to US cases, also linked to hedgehog contact (3).

Hedgehog purchase locations were available for 20 of the 36 patients interviewed and included US Department of Agriculture-licensed breeders, unlicensed breeders, pet stores, and online sales (Figure [see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). No common hedgehog supplier was identified as the source for either the US or Canadian outbreaks. Among 27 identified US hedgehog sources, 6 breeders were interviewed. All 6 breeders reported that they provide educational information to new owners when they purchase hedgehogs; 4 of the 6 provide information on prevention of disease transmission from pets to humans. Five of the 6 breeders reported that they work with a veterinarian or veterinary clinic; of these, only one breeder reported having a protocol in place for testing hedgehogs for salmonella.

This particular salmonella strain has continued to cause disease despite targeted outreach to hedgehog breeders and industry groups during 2 previous outbreaks with the strain linked to hedgehogs (1,2), highlighting that additional efforts are needed to reduce the prevalence and spread of salmonella among hedgehogs and to limit transmission from hedgehogs to humans. CDC recommendations to pet owners during this outbreak focused on handling hedgehogs safely, including proper hand hygiene (4). Recommendations to hedgehog breeders included working with veterinarians experienced in reducing salmonella prevalence in animal populations to evaluate sanitation and husbandry practices and monitoring hedgehogs for salmonella through diagnostic testing.

Prevention and control of salmonella in hedgehogs is complicated because of asymptomatic carriage and persistent or intermittent fecal shedding; however, salmonella mitigation is possible through prevention and control measures focused on good sanitation and husbandry practices (5,6). To prevent future outbreaks linked to contact with pet hedgehogs, breeders and veterinarians need to educate owners on the risk and prevention of salmonella transmission from hedgehogs and advise that hedgehogs might be inappropriate pets for children aged less than 5 years. The pet industry, veterinarians, and public and animal health officials could collaborate to help prevent disease transmission to humans by establishing and disseminating information on ways to reduce the prevalence of salmonella in hedgehog breeding colonies intended for use in the pet industry.

[A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. A number of outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been linked to contact with these animals. Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (order Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated rodent porcupines and monotreme echidnas.

The name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge ("hedge"), because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge ("hog"), from its piglike snout. Other names include urchin, hedgepig, and furze-pig.
