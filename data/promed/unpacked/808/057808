New Reports of Avian Influenza Emerge in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
New reports of animal outbreaks across Turkey were rapidly
increasing, with 6 of 81 provinces now reporting ongoing disease in
birds, up from 3 just a few days ago. By this evening [8 Jan 2006],
the Agriculture Ministry said the count was up to 10.
"Things are unfolding quickly, but we do not yet know how extensive
the outbreaks are," Juan Lubroth of the United Nations Food and
Animal Organization said. He added that the organization now believed
that they had been occurring "for some time," starting perhaps as
early as October or November [2005].
In light of the 9 human cases over the last 4 days, the failure of
the Turkish officials to quickly detect and publicize animal
outbreaks could have been a deadly oversight.
Humans almost always acquire bird flu through close contact with sick
birds. In areas with known outbreaks, all birds are supposed to be
quickly culled to contain the disease, and farming families in the
surrounding area must take extreme precaution in handling poultry to
prevent human infections. Because there were no reports of bird flu
in the area, the patients in Van and Ankara had no way of knowing
they were at risk.
The officials said that while Turkey had responded swiftly to its 1st
outbreak of bird flu, which occurred in the more developed western
part of the country in October 2005, government officials had been
far less efficient in dealing with the disease in impoverished eastern regions.
"The veterinary structure is weak there," said Mr. Lubroth, who added
that the United Nations had offered its assistance. "I'm not sure if
officials in the capital were even aware for a long time that there
was a problem."

[Detection of avian influenza at the earliest after its introduction
into a virgin territory is essential for effective control.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
Since the start of the H5N1 panzootic at the end of 2003, 1st in
Eastern Asia and later elsewhere, situations which resemble the
Turkish one have been observed several times. In Thailand, for
example, the disease had been spreading in poultry for at least 2
months when diagnosed for the 1st time in humans. This was followed
by its reporting in poultry. According to (unofficial, but seemingly
reliable) information from Ukraine (Crimea), the disease was present
there since September 2005, but reported for the 1st time (5
outbreaks in different locations) at the beginning of December 2005.
The quick and massive spread of the virus in Turkey is indeed a cause
for grave concern, locally and internationally. Its true distribution
must be determined with the utmost urgency. An official update is
anticipated shortly. - Mod.AS]
