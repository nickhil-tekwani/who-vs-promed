The death of a beluga whale mother at the Shedd Aquarium last month
apparently was caused by bacteria-contaminated fish fed to her by keepers,
sold by wholesalers who supply the nation's restaurants and supermarkets,
according to test results released Wednesday. The fish is government
inspected, it is the highest grade of fish available, rated as "human
consumption quality."
The 14-year-old whale, Immiayuk, was killed by an invisible bacterium found
on the skin of fish causing a lethal blood-borne infection in whales and
dolphins, Shedd officials said.
Five years ago, the same disease, erysipelas, killed Quitz, a young Pacific
white-sided dolphin at the Shedd. The cause of Immiayuk's death on 26 Dec
1999 was confirmed through detailed, microscopic analysis done on tissue
taken from her carcass.
Cooking the fish kills the bacteria. Whales and dolphins, of course, eat
the fish raw, including the scales and outer mucous membrane, where the
bacteria resides.
Humans eating raw fish, such as sushi, presumably don't eat the outer
mucous membrane and scales and so are unaffected by the bacteria, except
for a slight chance of minor skin irritations.
Erysipelas is one known causes of death for whales and dolphins in the wild
and has caused death for whales and dolphins in many zoo and aquarium
collections in the past, said Jeff Boehm, Shedd vice president and chief of
veterinary services. "The course of this disease is so swift, and the
symptoms typically are not visible until the animal is near death, making
it difficult to detect in time to treat effectively," Boehm said.
The bacterium lives in the exterior mucous coating of healthy wild fish.
All wild and captive dolphins are thought to be exposed to the bacteria
onoccasion, but it usually passes harmlessly through their digestive systems.
It is impossible to obtain fish without bacteria, Boehm said.
Since Quitz died from erysipelas in 1995, Shedd keepers periodically take
samples from the frozen fish it stocks to grow cultures in search of the
bacteria. "We have never been able to isolate this bacteria," Boehm said.
"It just seems to appear in wild fish from time to time."
Most often the fish supplied by wholesalers is frozen, but freezing does
not kill the bacteria. It is thawed but raw when fed to the whales and
dolphins. Boehm said researchers are working to discover how often the fish
might be carrying the erysipelas bacteria, and why the bacteria can be so
deadly to one animal while others around it appear unaffected.
The most logical way it could breach the immune system would be when the
animal is weakened by injury, other illnesses or age, he said. That did not
seem to be the case with Immiayuk, who checked out as perfectly healthy in
an exam a few weeks before her death.
"Her immune system was robust," Boehm said. "She even had evidence of
antibodies for erysipelas a few years ago. So now we have to wonder if this
is a different strain of the bacteria from the one we have seen here
before. If so, we want to know how often and how much of the bacteria shows
up."
Because it is so difficult to detect, he said nobody knows how the bacteria
presents itself: "Do you find it in great amounts on a single, isolated
fish out of the thousands that come in a shipment? Is it found in moderate
amounts on a few fish in the batch? Is it present in small amounts on all
the fish of a given batch? We don't know."
Shedd officials have discussed the possibility of using a process of
irradiating the fish to kill the bacteria, but that process would sterilize
the food so completely, it might be even more dangerous than the erysipelas
bacteria, Boehm said.
"There are all sorts of bacteria that are part of normal physiological
system for which the animal has a natural immunity," he said. "If you
killed (all the bacteria), then any bacteria that later slipped back into
their system could be a killer. We don't want animals that are naive of all
potential pathogens."
Boehm said researchers at the Shedd and elsewhere are trying to find out
more about how the erysipelas bacteria spreads in nature and how it
conquers the immune systems of some animals and not others. From
thatknowledge, they hope to develop a vaccine that would protect captive and
wild whales, porpoises and dolphins.
Since Immiayuk's death, keepers have been training her calf Kayavak to eat
whole fish. Still nursing when her mother died, she has been weaned from
her milk diet and gained 10 pounds on her fish diet.
"It's an around-the-clock process to feed her," Ramirez said. "If she were
nursing, she'd be feeding from her mom every hour or so, so we have to
accommodate her digestion by feeding her throughout the day and night,
about once every three hours." Kayavak's current companions are keepers who
remain with her 24 hours a day.

[Erysipelas is caused by _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (insidiosa)_ which
is distributed worldwide and can live in water, soil decaying organic
matter, slime on the bodies of fish, and in carcasses, even after processing.
The bacterium is resistant to certain commonly used antiseptics, such as
phenols hydrogen peroxide, and alcohol, but is readily destroyed by caustic
soda and hypochlorite. The many different strains vary markedly in
pathogenicity. - Mod.TG]
