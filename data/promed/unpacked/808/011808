Taiwan detects avian flu virus (H5N1) on smuggled birds from China
----------------------------------------------
Taiwan intercepted a Panama-registered cargo ship from China on
October 14th and found hundreds of smuggled birds, mice and turtles.
Taiwan's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
(BAPHIQ), the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) were responsible for this joint operation. The
smuggled animals were destroyed the next day. 19 specimens were
collected from the 1037 birds and were sent to the Animal Health
Research Institute for RT-PCR and chick embryo inoculation to examine
whether these birds carried avian flu virus.
The result came out today (20th) and showed those birds were avian
flu H5N1-positive. Since the smuggled animals were completely
destroyed, we are able to timely prevent the invasion of avian flu.
Officials wore full protective gear in the process of making arrests
and destroying animals to protect their own health. They also
followed self-health-management regulations to monitor [their own]
health status for 10 days. All related personnel in the operation are
currently in good health, and the local health bureaus and the 3rd
Branch office of the Taiwan CDC will continue to monitor their health.
At the time of the operation, a total of 25 people were on board; 24
of them left the country on the same ship on 16 Oct 2005. One of them
was detained in the Taichung Detention Center on the charge of
smuggling. He showed no bird flu symptoms, and he will be
administered preventive medication starting today.

Some birds [which species?! - Mod.AS] smuggled into Taiwan from China
have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, but an
outbreak is unlikely, as all the seized birds had already been
destroyed, health officials said.
"Samples collected before the birds were destroyed were later tested
positive for H5N1," said Ying Yeh, deputy director of the Bureau of
Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.
The number of infected birds is not immediately available, Yeh said.
China yesterday announced its 1st reported outbreak of bird flu in
more than 2 months, saying the disease had killed 2600 birds, mostly
chickens, on a farm in its northern Inner Mongolia region.
Taiwan's coast guard last week confiscated and destroyed some 1500
birds smuggled from the southeast Chinese city of Fuzhou [capital of
Fujian province, southeast China] aboard a Panama-registered vessel
in the island's central Taichung harbour.
"There shouldn't be any worry about a bird flu outbreak, as all birds
including the affected ones were killed right on the spot where they
were confiscated," Yeh said.
It was the 2nd time Taiwan has seized birds smuggled from mainland
China since the coast guard launched a crackdown on the illegal trade
in August [2005].

[In December 2003, the Taiwan authorities destroyed 6 smuggled ducks
which were found on the water near Taiwan's front-line island of
Quemoy. Reportedly, the ducks were found infected with the H5N1 virus
that hit Hong Kong in 1997.
From the current Taiwanese CDC report, which is gratefully
acknowledged, it might be assumed that the confiscated birds were
probably not domestic poultry. Were they pet-birds? Otherwise? Which
species? Did they show disease symptoms? Any pathological changes?
Details, if available, will be appreciated.
China has sent to the OIE its 3rd follow-up report on avian influenza
on 19 Oct 2005. The report describes an outbreak of highly pathogenic
avian influenza caused by an H5 virus, in chicken and ducks in the
village of Tengjiaying, Huhehot municipality, Inner Mongolia.
According to the report, the outbreak started on 14 Oct 2005 and the
diagnosis performed by the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, on 19 Oct 2005. HI
was positive, RT-PCR positive, and IVPI (Intravenous pathogenicity
index, performed in 6-weeks-old chicken) "highly pathogenic". The
report says that the source of infection is "contact with wild
animals," indicating that "migrating birds pass and stay around the
pool where the HPAI outbreak [was detected]." In response to the
outbreak, vaccination was carried out, applying inactivated mono H5N2
vaccine. The report is available at

Could it be assumed from the above newswire that a previous
consignment of birds smuggled from China, confiscated after August
2005, was tested and not found positive? - Mod.AS]
