1st Report of White Leaf Spot Caused by _Pseudocercosporella
capsellae_ on _Brassica juncea_ in Australia.

W.A. 6009, Australia. Plant Dis. 89:1131, 2005; published on-line as
DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-1131B. Accepted for publication 7 Jul 2005.
_Brassica juncea_ (L.) Czern & Coss (mustard) has potential as a more
drought-tolerant oilseed crop than _Brassica napus_, and the 1st 2
canola-quality _B. juncea_ cultivars will be sown as large strip
trials across Australia in 2005. This will allow commercial
evaluation of oil and meal quality and for seed multiplication for
the commercial release Australia-wide in 2006.
Inspection of experimental _B. juncea_ field plantings at Beverley
(32 deg 6 min 30 sec S, 116 deg 55 min 22 sec E), and Wongan Hills
(30 deg 50 min 32 sec S, 116 deg 43 min 33 sec E), Western Australia
in September 2004 indicated the occurrence of extensive leaf spotting
during _B. juncea_ flowering. Symptoms of this disease included as
many as 15 or more grayish white-to-brownish spot lesions per leaf,
often with a distinct brown margin. Some elongate grayish stem
lesions were also observed as reported earlier for _B. napus_ oilseed
rape (1).
When affected materials were incubated in moist chambers for 48 h,
abundant conidia typical of _Pseudocercosporella capsellae_ (Ellis &
Everh.) Deighton were observed that matched the descriptions of
conidia given by Deighton (2) and those on _B. napus_ in Western
Australia (1).
5 single-spore cultures from lesions were grown on water agar (WA),
where the colonies characteristically produced purple-pink pigment in
the agar after 2 weeks growth in an incubator maintained at 20 deg C
with a 12-h photoperiod (3). Since agar cultures of _P. capsellae_
rarely produce conidia (3), this observation helped with the
verification of the cultures.
Mycelial inoculum from these cultures was used to inoculate
cotyledons of 50 7-day-old plants of _B. juncea_ to satisfy Koch's
postulates. Small pieces of mycelia were teased out from the surface
of the growing margin of potato dextrose agar (PDA) cultures and
inoculated onto both lobes of each cotyledon and plants incubated in
a 100 percent humidity chamber for 48 h within a controlled
environment room maintained at 20/15 deg C (day/night) with a 12-h
photoperiod.
After 2 weeks, lesions 5 to 8 mm in diameter were observed on the
cotyledons. There were no symptoms on control plants that were
treated with water only. Lesions on infected cotyledons incubated on
moist filter paper for 24 h produced abundant cylindrical conidia
showing 2 to 3 septa measuring 42.9 to 71.4 micrometers long and 2.9
to 3.1 micrometers wide. Single-spore isolations from these conidia
produced typical _P. capsellae_ colonies showing purple-pink pigments
in WA, and dark, compacted, and slow-growing colonies with a dentate
margin on PDA.
White leaf spot caused by _P. capsellae_ is an important disease of
crucifers worldwide, but to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of
_P. capsellae_ on _B. juncea_ in Australia. In Western Australia, _P.
capsellae_ occurs on _B. napus_ oilseed rape (1) and in 1956, 1984,
and 1987, it was recorded on _B. rapa_, _B. oleracea_, and _B.
chinensis_, respectively (4), and on the same range of _Brassica_
hosts in other regions of Australia.

[_B. juncea_ has advantages over _B. napus_ including more vigorous
seedling growth, quicker ground-covering ability, greater tolerance
to heat and drought, and enhanced resistance to the blackleg fungus,
_Leptosphaeria maculans_. WLS survives on residues of infected
plants. Under favourable autumn and winter conditions, it produces
wind-borne conidia, which mainly cause leaf lesions. In turn, the
conidia produced in these lesions are carried by wind and rain to
cause secondary spread of the disease. WLS is also spread from
infected seeds and from pieces of infected debris present with the
seed.
Optimum temperatures for WLS infection are 13 to 18 deg C, but high
moisture levels are necessary for disease development. WLS disease
usually develops after periods of high rainfall. It can be found in
most plantings, but is not usually a cause of heavy yield losses. WLS
can cause complete loss of leaves in highly susceptible varieties,
with yield losses as high as 30 per cent if the disease is severe.
However, losses are unlikely to exceed 5 to 10 per cent with current
Australian cultivars. Nitrogen-deficient crops seem to be more
severely affected by WLS.
Disease management is similar to that of blackleg which means using
crop rotation and good hygiene. Sow only cultivars expressing very
high levels of resistance, and practice crop rotation. All varieties
recommended for sowing in Western Australia have good adult plant
resistance to blackleg. Canola fields should be in a rotation for at
least 3 years to allow diseased residues to decompose and reduce the
risk of ascospore infection. In recent years, some growers have
successfully reduced this break period, but there is increased risk
from this practice. If the seedling stage of crop development
(cotyledon to 1- or 2-leaf stage) coincides with heavy airborne spore
discharges from nearby stubbles, even adult resistant varieties can
suffer substantial damage. If there is no erosion risk, destroy crop
residues after harvest to reduce carryover of the fungus on infected
stems.
Graze stubbles heavily to reduce fungus carryover. Canola should be
planted as far as possible from previous canola crops to reduce the
risk of infection by wind-borne ascospores. Do not plant in areas
downwind from old stubbles where the prevailing winds are likely to
blow air-borne spores.
