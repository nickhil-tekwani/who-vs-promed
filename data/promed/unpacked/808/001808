The 3rd phase of the program against rabies, implemented in March [2012], revealed that 3 dogs were found with the disease in the entire state, 2 in Merida and one in Tekax, stated the vterinarian in charge of the program, Enrique Marín Pech.

He explained that in the case in Tekax, the virus was brought from Chiapas [state] by a group of people who came to this municipality with everyting including their pet that died without their owners supposing that it was infected [with rabies virus].

Concerning the epidemiological barrier established to detect the 2 cases or rabies in dogs in the Cholul region, he explained that there were good results in that of the 32 people who were in contact with the animals, none presented [rabies] symptoms, nor did the 6 individuals of the same familty in Tekax.

In addition to the sanitary barrier, in the past 4 months not only were dogs vaccinated and neutered, cats were as well in the Cholul, Xcuytun, Sitpach y Chichí Suarez regions and in the Las Aguilas, Altabrisa, Maya, Montecarlo, Vista Alegre Norte, Montebello neighborhoods and the Conkal municipality.

Concerning the Tekax case, it was detected 2 months ago, but the case came to attention [of the authorities] because the tests done on a dog that was sacrificed had rabies and had been infected by another dog that was brought from Chiapas. "In the beginning, we thought that the dog was infected by a bat, but when we knew how it was infected, we established a barrier in nearby neighborhoods. We sacrificed the animals and vaccinated the family," he explained.

The Cholul rabies case occurred in the Guadaoupana neighborhood, where 2 dogs were infected, and a barrier was established that included that population, Sitpach and the Altabrisa area.

[Interestingly, 32 persons were given vaccine against rabies in the Cholul community, after 3 dogs in the area were reported to have the disease in early March this year (2012) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120303.1059884). The Tekax situation is another example of how pathogens can be moved from one place to another in non-vaccinated animals. The prompt response to the positive rabies cases is a good example of disease detection and containment. It is good to learn that cats as well as dogs were being neutered and vaccinated.
