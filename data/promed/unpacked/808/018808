Measles outbreak in Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab province
----------------------------------------------------
In Kot Hebat Busti Doom Wala a measles outbreak has affected hundreds of
people. A total of 11 children are currently suffering from the disease.
One of the children died from measles on Tue 11 Jan 2011 and 2 are in
critical condition. Locals in the area have complained about the
unavailability of medical aid.

"There are no health teams that visit this area and the closest THQ
[hospital/aid centre] is miles away," said a local resident. A team of
doctors confirmed that there was a measles outbreak in the village.

"Many of the villagers think this is cholera or chickenpox but it is
clearly a case of measles," Dr Fazal said. The team said that all the
patients would be provided with basic health facilities.

A parent said: "These are just words. My son had to die for the doctors to
even show up here and they will [not return] until someone else dies." The
villagers said that not a single medical team had visited the area since
the floods and there were no medicines at the local THQ.

The villager said that his entire family [of 11 children] had been affected
by the measles outbreak. "We were forced to visit quacks as no vaccine was
available at the BHU [hospital/aid centre] and my 6-year-old son died
yesterday," he said. His mother said that her other children were suffering
from "cholera" and the authorities had done nothing to help them. "It isn't
cholera but they want to say it is because they think that will make the
medical authorities take the case more seriously," Dr Fazal said.

A BHU doctor said that the reason they were out of measles vaccines was
because the hospital transformer had been stolen 6 months ago and they
couldn't store any vaccines. When District Health Officer (DHO) Dr Fazal
Karim Khan was informed of the situation he sent a team led by deputy DHO
Dr Sajad Sarwar Naqvi. The team will vaccinate all villagers in 5 union
councils adjacent to Kot Hebat. The [bereaved] father has requested that
the Punjab chief minister assist in the treatment of his surviving children.

[The resurgence of measles is one of the many unfortunate accompaniments of
the recent catastrophic flooding in Pakistan. Restoration of routine
vaccination of children deserves high priority.
