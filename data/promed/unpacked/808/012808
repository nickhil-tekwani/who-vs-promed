The Ministry of Health is investigating 2 deaths in Luweero District
suspected to be caused by [ebolavirus infection]. Health workers in
Kasese District are also investigating a patient who was described to
have signs of the disease. The patient is currently admitted to
Kagando Hospital in Kasese.

In a press statement yesterday [24 May 2011], the acting director
general of health services, Dr Dennis Lwamafa, said the 2 died after
suffering high fever and unexplained bleeding. "Burial team was
expeditiously sent to the sites to support the burial arrangements and
avert any spread of the disease," Dr Lwamafa said.

The Ministry of Health yesterday [24 May 2011] confirmed it will
launch a national awareness campaign against [Ebola hemorrhagic
fever]. The decision comes 18 days after the country registered a 3rd
outbreak of the deadly disease in as many years. The head of
department of community health, Dr Anthony Mbonye, yesterday said
broadcast media has already rolled out the programmes through advert
commercials, but they were still lobbying for money to the print
messages.

Tullow Oil yesterday donated Shs 75m [about USD 31 000] to facilitate
the government in containing the disease. The ministry learnt of the
disease outbreak on 5 May 2011 after it was confirmed that a
12-year-old girl from Zirobwe Sub-county in Luweero had died of it.
The girl, who was admitted with severe fever, bleeding, abdominal
pains, died at Bombo Military Hospital.
