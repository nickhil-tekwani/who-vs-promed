Chikungunya outbreak in Montpellier, France, September - October 2014
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Delisle E, Rousseau C, Broche B, Leparc-Goffart I, et al]

Abstract
--------
In October 2014, an outbreak of 12 autochthonous chikungunya cases, 11 confirmed and 1 probable, was detected in a district of Montpellier, a town in the south of France colonised by the vector _Aedes albopictus_ since 2010. A case returning from Cameroon living in the affected district was identified as the primary case. The epidemiological investigations and the repeated vector control treatments performed in the area and around places frequented by cases helped to contain the outbreak. In 2014, the chikungunya and dengue surveillance system in mainland France was challenged by numerous imported cases due to the chikungunya epidemic ongoing in the Caribbean Islands. This 1st significant outbreak of chikungunya in Europe since the 2007 Italian epidemic, however, was due to an East Central South African (ECSA) strain, imported by a traveller returning from West Africa. Important lessons were learned from this episode, which reminds us that the threat of a chikungunya epidemic in southern Europe is real.

[This report illustrates the very real risk of ongoing transmission where a viremic individual brings the virus into areas where there is a population of competent vectors. There are many areas in the world where the vectors are present and long-distance air travel moves people quickly from virus endemic areas.
