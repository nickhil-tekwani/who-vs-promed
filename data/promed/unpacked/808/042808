Merlin responds to suspected plague epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo
-----------------------------------------------
Merlin, the British medical aid agency, has launched an emergency response
to a suspected pneumonic plague epidemic that stemmed from a diamond mine
in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has claimed at least 38 lives.
More than 1300 people identified with symptoms -- including high fever and
acute shortness of breath -- have already been treated by Merlin's mobile
medical teams, working alongside local health staff across 3 districts of
the eastern province of Maniema. Merlin led the 1st emergency response team
that conducted the preliminary investigation in August 2005 at the remote
diamond mining area of Libaku ya Suka in Punia district, where the outbreak
of disease 1st emerged.
Merlin head nurse Prosper Tunda, who is leading Merlin's mobile team, said:
"The situation is very difficult. The hospitals and health centers are not
equipped to deal with this kind of emergency. Patients are lying on the
floor, as there are not enough beds or mattresses, and all the health
facilities lack basic equipment and essential drugs. We have to bring in
not only the drugs to treat the epidemic, but also to manage other
life-threatening illnesses, such as malaria, anemia and diarrheal diseases.
Despite these difficult working conditions, we are saving many lives."
Merlin currently has outreach medical teams on the ground working with
staff from local health centers and other agencies to identify and treat
new cases across the Punia, Lubutu and Obokote districts of Maniema
Province. A total of 1332 cases have been identified, and 38 deaths have
been recorded in the 3 districts.
Quarantine has been a particular challenge, because the outbreak occurred
in an open diamond mine with about 8000 miners working under extremely poor
sanitary conditions. The disease spread outside the mining area during the
early phase of the outbreak in July 2005, when an unknown number of
infected workers were expelled and sent home to their villages in Lubutu
and Obokote.

[It still seems quite unlikely that pneumonic plague would be the cause of
this outbreak, given the low case fatality rate. No information is given
regarding diagnostic or therapeutic methodology. - Mod.LL]
