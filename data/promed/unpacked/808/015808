Comments about an oubreak of acute febrile respiratory disease among
US tourists who visited Acapulco, Mexico
------------------------------------
The Secretariat of Health of Mexico (SSA) and the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are collaborating in a joint
investigation of an outbreak of acute febrile respiratory illness
among US travelers returning from Acapulco, Mexico, during March
[2001.
This cluster of illness was reported to CDC after a number of US
university students, who traveled to Acapulco during March [2001,
sought medical care for acute febrile respiratory illness, with
symptoms that included high fever, headache, dry cough, and chills.
Initial tests indicate that in most cases the illness was
histoplasmosis. However, according to CDC some students have tested
positive for infection with _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_.
Until this moment and despite an intensive investigation conducted by
Mexican and American researchers in the hotel where the students
stayed and other sites (nightclubs) they visited, there are no obvious
sources of exposure to Histoplasma and it is not known whether the
Histoplasma and/or Mycoplasma infections were acquired before, during,
or after travel to Mexico.
It is very important to emphasize that there have been only a few
cases of acute febrile respiratory disease among hotel workers or
Mexican guests that stayed in the supposedly involved hotel during
March [2001, and that none has tested positive for Histoplasma.
The SSA emphasizes that its primary concern is to preserve not only
the health of all Mexican citizens, but the foreign visitorsÂ´ also.
Because of this, the SSA is absolutely willing to cooperate with other
agencies in matters that could affect the health of foreign tourists,
but at the same time it also wants to point out that premature
assumptions about this outbreak can cause heavy damage to the tourist
industry of Acapulco.
The SSA will continue the study of this event and currently is
conducting a serological survey among hotel workers and a telephone
inquiry among Mexican guests.
