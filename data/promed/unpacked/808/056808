New Era Canning Company of New Era, Michigan is announcing a new
recall to include Mexican style chili beans, green beans, and dark
red kidney beans that were shipped to food service and retail
customers because a records review identified the possibility that a
small number of cans from each lot may not have been adequately
cooked.
New Era is recalling these products as a precautionary measure
because cans of vegetables that have not been adequately cooked have
the potential for the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_.
This recall only affects a small number of cases from the products
with the specific codes listed below:
GFS [Gordon Food Service] brand Fancy Mexican Style Chili Beans in 6
lb, 12 oz (3 kg) cans, GFS Reorder No. 192015, UPC 9390119201. The
recall is limited to 43 cases of product with 6 cans per case of lot
number 00249 5AJ6LC with a 4-digit time stamp number ranging from
2113 through 2235 printed on the end of the can after the lot number
(For example: 00249 5AJ6LC 2113). Only product bearing time stamps of
2113 through 2235 are included in the recall. The canned Mexican
style chili beans were distributed to Gordon Food Service foodservice
customers in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,
Missouri, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin and sold through GFS
Marketplace stores in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Michigan.
Kitchen brand Blue Lake Mixed Cuts Green Beans in 6 lb, 6 oz (2.9 kg)
cans. This recall is limited to 57 cases with 6 cans per case with
lot number 00249 6FG5GA printed on the end of the can. (All cans of
this lot are under recall). The canned green beans were not sold at
retail, but were distributed to a Michigan restaurant by North
Oakland Commodities.
Great Value brand Dark Red Kidney Beans in 15.5 oz (440 gm) cans, UPC
7874237085. This recall is limited to 12 cases with 12 cans per case
with lot number 00249 CKJ6LD printed on the end of the can. (All cans
of this lot are under recall). This lot of canned dark red kidney
beans was sold at Wal-Mart Stores in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.
We have been alerted that some of our cans may be missing the can
codes. Any cans of these products without a code should not be opened
or used, and should be disposed of as outlined below.
Neither New Era nor the FDA are aware of any illnesses related to
these products. New Era Canning in conjunction with the US Food and
Drug Administration and the Michigan Department of Agriculture is
thoroughly evaluating all processes and procedures to determine the
cause of the problem.
Any food that may be contaminated should be disposed of carefully.
Even tiny amounts of toxins ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through
the eye or a break in the skin can cause serious illness. Skin
contact should be avoided as much as possible, and the hands should
be washed immediately after handling the food. Customers who have the
product or any foods made with these products should throw them away
immediately. Double bag the cans in plastic bags that are tightly
closed, then place in a trash receptacle for non-recyclable trash
outside of the home. Restaurants and institutions are encouraged to
assure that such products are only placed in locked receptacles,
which are not accessible to the public.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.
However, during the original part of this recall, it was stated that
the organism was indeed identified. - Mod.LL]
