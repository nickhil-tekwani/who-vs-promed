[According to a press release published on 16 Nov 2021 by the National Reference Laboratory for African Swine Fever of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI https://www.fli.de/en/news/short-messages/short-message/erster-fall-von-afrikanischer-schweinepest-in-mastschweinebetrieb-in-mecklenburg-vorpommern/; original in German, translated, abridged, and edited):

"The epidemiological advisory group of the FLI investigates the outbreak at the request of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania together with the responsible veterinary office on site in order to determine the possible entry route as well as possible other endangered farms."

"In the affected farm, there had been an increase in deaths in fattening pigs in recent days, so an investigation of the dead animals was initiated by the locally responsible authorities. The initial examination of samples in the veterinary laboratory of the State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fisheries (LALLF) in Rostock was positive for ASF, after which samples were immediately sent to the National Reference Laboratory of the FLI and examined here."

"The national authorities responsible for animal disease control have taken the measures in force under EU law and the Swine Fever Regulation. This includes, among other things, the killing and destruction of all pigs on the holding concerned in order to prevent the spread of the animal disease."

"So far, ASF has appeared in Germany in Brandenburg and Saxony. Since September 2020, over 2700 cases have been detected in wild boar. In Brandenburg, there were also 3 cases in pig farms in July 2021, 2 of them small farms with a few animals and a farm with around 330 animals. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, there have been no cases of ASF in wild boar and the now discovered infection in a fattening pig farm is the 1st case ever."

"The FLI strongly recommends that biosecurity measures in pig farms be reviewed and, if necessary, optimized in order to prevent further introductions of ASF as far as possible."
