A total of 80 domestic animals were slaughtered and incinerated in
the Bulgarian town of Harmanly, where some days ago, doctors
confirmed that cattle [sic; reportedly, the affected animals were
goats; see in the commentary] in the town [were] infected with brucellosis.
The veterinary report revealed that there is a connection between the
brucellosis infection in Harmanly and the one in the Valche Pole
village, where an elderly woman was infected last month [August 2007].
The infection came from 27 goats, which were stolen from a Greek
village and illegally transported to Bulgaria, the report reads.
That was the 1st time in 60 years that an outbreak of the dangerous
disease was detected in Bulgaria [see commentary].
Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus
_Brucella_. These bacteria are primarily passed among animals and
cause them to miscarry.
Humans become infected by coming into contact with animals or animal
products that are contaminated with these bacteria. In humans,
brucellosis can cause a range of symptoms that are similar to the flu
and may include fever, sweats, headaches, back pains, and physical
weakness. Severe infections of the central nervous system or lining
of the heart may occur. Brucellosis can also cause long-lasting or
chronic symptoms that include recurrent fevers, joint pain, and fatigue.

[This is not "the 1st time in 60 years that an outbreak of the
dangerous disease was detected in Bulgaria." On 12 Jun 2006, the
Bulgarian authorities officially reported to the OIE an outbreak of
brucellosis (_Brucella melitensis_) in goats in the village Smoljan,
province Zlatograd, southern Bulgaria. The reason for notification
was "reoccurrence of a listed disease;" the given date of previous
occurrence was 1941. All 4 "susceptible and infected" goats were
destroyed. The source of infection was, reportedly, "contact with
infected animal(s) at grazing/watering;" this may point at the
possible presence of infection in additional animals in Bulgaria. For
the official immediate notification, including map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5406>.
During 2007, 2 additional outbreaks in animals have been recorded in
southern Bulgaria, one in August in the village of Valche pole, the
2nd one (probably in contact with the previous one), in September, in
Harmanli, where -- according to a published statement of the
veterinary services -- 36 goats out of a herd of 70 had tested
positive for the infection. This high infection rate may indicate
that the introduction of the pathogen had taken place several months
earlier. The current newswire reports the destruction of the entire flock.
The outbreak in Valche pole was discovered following a clinical case
of brucellosis ("Malta fever") in a woman; the media reported that "a
national veterinary service statement said 19 animals had been
infected in the village of Valche pole, where the 65-year-old woman
fell ill with the disease."
The current newswire says that the infection (apparently in Valche
pole) came from goats stolen from a Greek village and illegally
transported to Bulgaria. No date of introduction (which may have
occurred a considerable time prior to disease detection) nor results
of serological tests in local, in-contact livestock are disclosed.
The role of humans as sentinels for animal infection is cause for
concern; the disease may have gained ground since its reoccurrence in
Bulgaria, officially reported in 2006.
The Bulgarian authorities may contemplate a systematic serological
surveillance in small ruminants to assess the real situation within
its southern territories and, in case disease has already gained some
ground, to consider a "test and slaughter" policy while this is still
feasible, namely during the initial phase of the outbreak and before
it spreads to northern territories. - Mod.AS]
