Mysterious BSE-like disease found in sheep
------------------------------------------
A massive research programme to find out whether BSE is circulating in
British sheep has turned up its first suspicious result. But while
scientists say the sheep did not have conventional BSE, they cannot rule
out the possibility that it could have had a new form of BSE (mad cow
disease) that has adapted to sheep.
Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] has
announced that the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) in Weybridge,
England, had found "a type of scrapie not previously seen in the UK".
Scrapie is a sheep disease similar to BSE which is not generally thought to
harm people.
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said the
disease-causing prion detected in the sheep's brain "had some
characteristics similar to experimental BSE in sheep", but that on other
tests it resembled neither BSE nor "previously recognised types of
scrapie". The UK's Food Standards Agency said in a statement:
"Uncertainties still remain on this issue. However, based on the best
scientific evidence to date, we are not advising against eating lamb and
sheep meat."
There have long been fears that sheep which ate cattle-derived meat and
bone meal during Britain's BSE epidemic in the 1980s might have acquired
BSE, although they have never been confirmed. Unlike BSE in cattle, prion
diseases spread directly from sheep to sheep. So any BSE in sheep could
still be circulating despite subsequent bans on animal-derived feed.
Furthermore, sheep experimentally fed BSE develop a disease
indistinguishable from ordinary scrapie, making detection very difficult.
Yet the prion from such animals still behaves like BSE, and could cause the
fatal human disease vCJD. Worse, sheep carry prions in more tissues than
cattle, including the muscle that people eat, so BSE-infected sheep could
cause more human disease than mad cows.
A previous attempt to determine whether British sheep had acquired BSE went
spectacularly wrong in 2001 when sheep and cattle brains were mixed up in
the lab. But since then, the VLA has tested the brains of all 1019 newly
reported cases of scrapie, as well as 1125 scrapie brains dating back to
1998, with tests designed to distinguish scrapie from BSE.
The new result announced on Wednesday, from a sheep recently reported with
scrapie symptoms, is the first to give results that resembled BSE. Danny
Matthews of the VLA told New Scientist that in a prion test called a
western blot, the sheep's brain did not bind an antibody called P4. P4 also
does not bind prions from sheep experimentally infected with BSE, but does
bind all but one forms of scrapie tested with it.
Also like BSE, the form of the prion without a sugar attached to it had a
lower molecular weight than the form found in scrapie. But the ratio of
prions with different numbers of sugars on them looked like scrapie, not
BSE, says Matthews. Most conclusively, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in which
thin slices of the sheep's brain were stained with various antibodies,
showed prions had accumulated in different parts of the brain and different
kinds of cells from BSE -- or any known form of scrapie.
The IHC pattern reliably indicates BSE, says Matthews, having been constant
in the 100 experimentally infected sheep of different genetic varieties
tested so far. But so little scrapie has been tested, he says, it is not
known if one strain might give these results on the tests. One possibility,
he says, is that the sheep might have been carrying a prion initially
derived from BSE. Passage into new species is well known to change prions.
BSE from experimentally infected sheep has so far been passed to just one
more round of sheep, with no apparent change. "But we don't know if passage
through many sheep, of different genetic types, might change it so it no
longer gives the same pattern in IHC or western blots," says Matthews.
"Those experiments are underway now."
Any such new incarnation of BSE in sheep may -- or may not -- have lost its
ability to harm humans.

[As rightly commented, the main current worry, related to a possible
presence of BSE in sheep, is its infection routes. Cattle are thought to be
infected with BSE mainly, if not only, orally -- namely by the consumption
of infected meat & bone meals (MBMs). The banning of this commodity is
regarded to terminate the infection cycle.
Scrapie spreads among sheep laterally (from one animal to another via
direct or indirect contact) and maternally (from a dam to its offspring,
either vertically or laterally by close post-parturient association). Thus
-- provided BSE, if infecting sheep, behaves like the scrapie agent -- the
discontinuation of feeding sheep with MBMs will not terminate the infection
cycle. - Mod.AS]
