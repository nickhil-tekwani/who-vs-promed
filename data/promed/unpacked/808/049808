[Health] authorities in Misiones, a province in northeast Argentina
that borders on Brazil and Paraguay, intensified measures against
yellow fever after having found that more than 20 monkeys died with
symptoms [lesions] of the disease.

According to the local press, there is more concern in the past few
days since some of the dead animals were found near Posadas, the
capital city of Misiones province, located 1000 kilometers (621
miles) north from Buenos Aires, and next to Encarnacion province in Paraguay.

Having acknowledged this situation, health authorities decreed an
"epidemiological barrier" in the area where the dead monkeys were
found. Actions to be taken include immunizing the population and the
detection of suspicious cases. Also, insecticide spraying was
performed and other measures were taken for stopping proliferation of
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, which are vectors for yellow fever and
also dengue fever [viruses].

"We are taking measures similar to those taken in January 2008, when
the disease spread, reaching Brazil, Paraguay, and the Northeastern
part of Argentina," declared Dr. Carlos Baez, Health Subsecretary for
Misiones province, to "El
Territorio," a local newspaper.

During 2008, 9 persons developed yellow fever, and one of them died.
Between the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, yellow fever took
the lives of 8 persons in Paraguay, while there were 19 deaths in the
central-western part of Brazil.

[Last October, health authorities in Misiones province reported
yellow fever epizootics and high mortality rates in affected monkeys
(see previous reports from ProMED Esp). At that time, an intensive
vaccination campaign covering local people was implemented, and the
coverage was between 95 to 97 percent; therefore, the risk for urban
epidemic outbreaks of yellow fever is not significant. However
non-immunized individuals are at risk for getting infected when being
bitten by vectors that maintain the sylvatic cycle, therefore
justifying the epidemiological barrier measures taken. - Mod.JT]

[This is additional information following up on the earlier report of
yellow fever virus mortality in monkeys is Misiones province,
Argentina (see ProMED archive no. 20081023.3353). The number of dead
monkeys has increased from 8 to more than 20 in the report above.
Presumably, these additional dead monkeys are black howlers
(_Alouatta] caraya_ ) also, a species which dies of yellow fever
virus infection.
