Death of camels and cows due to pox near Tabuk, Saudi Arabia
-----------------------------------------------
A number of camels and cows have died because of pox near Tabuk. The cattle
owner notified the ministry of agriculture after he noticed the symptoms on
one camel. The medication [Which? - Mod.AS] given to the animals did not
help [and] a number of them died.

[The accuracy of this news item is in doubt. With the exception of Foot &
mouth disease (FMD), no other vesicular disease is known as common to
cattle and camels. FMD will affect cattle, but its clinical manifestations
are not similar to pox, and its (natural) infectivity in camels is debatable.
The possibility that a pox-related infectious agent, such as camel pox (CP)
and/or Lumpy skin disease (LSD), might be involved cannot be ruled out;
however, each of these diseases is species-specific: CP affects camels,
while LSD affects only cattle.
