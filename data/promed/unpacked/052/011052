- Wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) has been declared globally eradicated. At an event held on World Polio Day 2019, Professor David Salisbury, chair of the independent Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC), presented the official certificate of WPV3 eradication to WHO director-general Dr Adhanom Ghebreyesus (see http://polioeradication.org/news-post/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated/).

[The good news is the declaration of eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) globally.

The depressing news is the reports of 13 poliovirus-associated paralytic cases (6 WPV and 7 cVDPV) reported this past week, with 2 countries reporting WPV1 cases (Afghanistan and Pakistan) and 8 countries reporting cVDPV-associated cases. More disturbing is that 6 of the 8 countries are reporting cVDPV cases related to outbreaks in Nigeria, 5 of the 6 related to the ongoing outbreak in Jigawa. Very reminiscent of the outbreaks of WPV associated with Nigeria in the early 2000s.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 23 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.
