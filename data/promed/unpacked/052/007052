re: Brucellosis, buffalo - Italy: (Campania)
--------------------------------------------
An ongoing epizootic in Campania highlights the fact that human brucellosis
is more common in Italy than in any contiguous countries. I've compared
regional disease rates on the graph at

[We are grateful to Steve for the additional background. Though the
incidence of human brucellosis in Italy is indeed higher than the one
recorded in neighbouring countries (Switzerland, France, Austria,
Slovenia), only France is traditionally known to be brucellosis infected.

In Italy, a clear decrease, since 1996, is apparent from the graph referred
to: from 3.3 per 100 000 in 1996 to 0.5 in 2004, followed by a very slight
increase. The EU member countries, which should have been compared with
Italy, in addition to France, are Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Cyprus, all
-- as Italy -- with significant _Brucella melitensis_ incidence. - Mod.AS

Campania, a region of Southern Italy, can be located on the map at
