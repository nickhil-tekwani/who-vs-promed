Another patient confirmed in _E. coli_ outbreak linked to local, organic yogurt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another child has been added to the list of patients in an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak linked to local, organic yogurt. Some production at the implicated dairy, Pure Eire, remains shut down.

The Washington Department of Health reported to Food Safety News that the state has confirmed 16 people are sick. As many as 10 have had such severe symptoms that they had to be admitted to hospitals. A total of 4 of the patients have developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure that can be fatal. Of the patients, 10 are less than 1 to 9 years old. There are 2 confirmed patients in Arizona who became infected after contact with visitors from Washington state.

Health department inspectors and investigators from the state's Department of Agriculture are continuing their investigation into the outbreak. Most of the sick people report eating organic yogurt made by the Pure Eire Dairy in Othello, WA. Both PCC brand and Pure Eire brand yogurt have been recalled. Yogurt production at the dairy remains shut down, according to a spokesperson from the agriculture department.

"The dairy has resumed production of pasteurized milk, but its production of yogurt remains offline. We anticipate collecting samples of the milk for testing," the spokesperson told Food Safety News. Previous test samples collected at the farm were negative for the outbreak strain of the pathogen, but the implicated lots were likely no longer available for testing.

[More cases have appeared in Washington mostly, and in Arizona. It is noteworthy that 4 of the 16 cases developed HUS (25%) which is a high percentage, usually less than 10%. The early use of antimicrobials seems to be a risk factor for the development of HUS but some strains of enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ seem to have a higher risk probably due to the production of higher amounts of Shiga toxin or certain Shiga toxin subtypes.

The post does not state that the vehicle was made from unpasteurized milk. - Mod.LL
