[The addition of the above 6 outbreaks brings the total of officially reported lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreaks in Turkey, which reportedly started early September 2013, to 12 outbreaks.

For a map of the 2013 LSD situation in the region, subscribers are referred to the OIE map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (select lumpy skin disease, period from 1 Jan 2013, centre and zoom in). In addition to Turkey, the disease has been reported during 2013 from Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian authority (West Bank), Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt (where LSD has been endemic since the late 1980s). It may be assumed that the LSD virus has also been circulating in other countries in the region, particularly Syria.

Recent media reports from Turkey about additional cases in 4 affected villages located in the Kahramanmaras province have been kindly forwarded by the contributor; see (in Turkish), including a picture, at http://www.ensonhaber.com/kahramanmarasta-4-koy-karantinaya-alindi-2014-01-07.html.

The actual total number of cases (7) in the 6 Turkish outbreaks reported in the above notification is exceptionally low; probably, additional clinical cases have remained undetected. Renewed spread of the virus during the coming spring and summer may be prevented if vaccination is timely and extensively applied. - Mod.AS
