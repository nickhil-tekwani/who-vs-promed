Due to a case of equine herpesvirus, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Posse 7 Jun 2015 poker ride in South Beach will not be held. Four cases of equine herpesvirus have been identified in horses housed in the Willamette Valley. Horse owners who had their animals at recent events at the Linn County Fairground or Oregon Horse Center in Eugene are urged to closely observe their horses for signs of the disease.

Cases of equine herpes began showing in late April and early May 2015 in horses that had attended shows in the Willamette Valley. The disease is highly contagious among horses. The neutropic strain of the disease can be fatal or cause lasting neurologic damage that leaves the animal with a permanently reduced level of function.

"About 80 per cent of the horses who develop neurologic problems from EHV-1 have the neurotropic form of the virus," Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine specialist John Schlipf said. "It's a significantly more serious concern. The disease can be fatal, or it can cause lasting neurologic damage that leaves the animal with a permanently reduced level of function."

Early clinical signs of the neurologic form of equine herpes -- also known as EHV-1 -- often begin with the hind limbs and include:
- uncoordinated, stumbling movements;
- an unusual gait;
- a weak tail tone;
- difficulty urinating, and dribbling of urine;
- nasal discharge, frequently accompanied by a fever.

Owners of horses that may be at risk are encouraged to monitor their animals closely for a fever and any signs of respiratory or neurologic disease. "We must reiterate the need for horse owners to practice biosecurity," Schlipf said. "People handling horses should wash their hands and clothing to reduce spread of a virus. Animals should not share tack, and horses that have traveled or mingled with other animals should be segregated."

Three more cases have been found in Oregon of horses infected with equine herpesvirus 1, or EHV-1, and one animal has the most serious "neurotropic" form of the virus that is far more likely to cause serious, sometimes permanent neurological damage.

An initial case of EHV-1 reported last week, and also being treated in isolation at OSU, only had the commoner wild strain of the virus. That horse did show neurologic symptoms, although animals with that strain of EHV-1 more often have a disease that causes respiratory infection or abortion in pregnant mares. Two more cases have been identified of horses with the wild strain that are not showing signs of neurologic disease, and they are being treated at their home stables in Polk County. Both forms of EHV-1 are highly contagious to horses, but not transmissible to people.

However, a 4th case has been confirmed with the neurotropic form of EHV-1, veterinary experts say, which increases the seriousness of the current outbreak, and makes it increasingly important that horse owners in Oregon practice strong biosecurity management of their animals.

The most recent case was brought to OSU's Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital from the Salem area. Both cases are being treated in isolation, and all OSU veterinary teaching hospital facilities are open for business as usual.

The initial case last week was in a horse housed in Marion County that had recently attended events at the Linn County Fairgrounds in Albany on 16-19 Apr 2015. Prior to the development of clinical signs in the initial case and institution of the quarantine, horses housed with the initial case had attended an event at the Oregon Horse Center in Eugene on 25-26 Apr 2015. The newest case was not at the Linn County event, Schlipf said, but had been in contact with other horses that attended.

Since there's a 10-14 day incubation period for this virus, Schlipf said, it is possible that more horses will be found to be infected. Owners of horses that may be at risk are encouraged to monitor their animals closely for a fever and any signs of respiratory or neurologic disease. More information about the virus and biosecurity recommendations is available online at http://bit.ly/1GNttiS.

Horses with these signs should be isolated from other animals, and owners should contact their veterinarians immediately. EHV-1 can also affect alpacas and llamas, Schlipf said. "All of these steps can help, and are especially important right now. It may be a while yet before we are out of the woods with this outbreak."

[This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. - Mod.TG
