Marburg Virus: Laboratory Infection in Russia
---------------------------------------------
In addition to Bob Swanepoel's overview on earlier Marburg cases I would
like to mention that there was one published laboratory infection with
Marburg virus in Russia (VV Nikiforov, et al. A case of laboratory
infection with Marburg haemorrhagic fever [in Russian, Zh Mikrobiol
Epidemiol Immunobiol 1994; 3:104-6). According to personal communications
from Russian colleagues, there have been 2 more laboratory infections with
Marburg virus, one of them fatal.
