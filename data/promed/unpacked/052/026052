[1] Pakistan, 1st case of 2019 confirmed - Bajaur, FATA, KP

Pakistan on Saturday [2 Feb 2019] reported its 1st polio case of 2019 from northwestern Bajaur tribal district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering with Afghanistan, an official said [FATA voted to merge with KP in May 2018 so we have referenced both - Mod.JH]. "Today the 1st polio virus case of the current year [2019] has been reported from Bajaur district, where the crippling virus paralyzed an 11-month-old child," Babar Atta, head of the polio eradication program of Pakistan, told Anadolu Agency.

Six polio cases have been reported from Bajaur in the last 3 months. In several other big cities, including Karachi, Quetta, Lahore, Peshawar, and Faisalabad, there is active polio virus circulation in the sewage, which is a big risk for our children, Atta said.

Pakistan is among 3 countries in the world, including Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio virus still exists, and the country remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2014, WHO made it mandatory for all people traveling from Pakistan to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

Armed assailants belonging to militant groups have frequently targeted polio vaccinators and their security detail in several parts of Pakistan. The groups see the anti-polio campaigns as part of an elaborate anti-Muslim and Western conspiracy, and often issue death threats to vaccinators, many of whom are women, for administrating the vital vaccines to children. In April 2016, assailants gunned down 7 policemen who were providing security to polio vaccinators in the southern port city of Karachi. According to Pakistani officials, around 88 people associated with the drive have been killed across Pakistan since December 2012.

[According to the End Polio Pakistan website, the date of onset of paralysis of this case was 18 Jan 2019, making this the 1st case of polio transmitted in 2019 in Pakistan (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019).

The previous 2 confirmed cases in January 2019 (with dates of onset in late December 2018) were also from Bajaur district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. As a reminder, in last week's Global Polio Eradication Initiative update, there were reports of 10 positive environmental specimens collected since 1 Jan 2019. Only one was from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but it was collected in Peshawar. It's important to highlight that, as a reminder, there was evidence of widespread circulation of the wild poliovirus in Pakistan.

It's also worthwhile to note that 88 people associated with the polio vaccination effort have been killed since 2012. A very sad state of affairs.

A map of the FATA districts can be found at: http://www.understandingfata.org/uf-volume-iv/images/fata-map.jpg. Bajaur is the most northerly district of the FATA, to the northeast of Jalalabad and the east of Asadabad. - Mod.MPP

[2] Pakistan - polio 1st responders

Dr. Ujala Nayyar dreams, both figuratively and literally, about a world that is free from polio. Nayyar, from the World Health Organization in Pakistan's Punjab province, says she often imagines the outcome of her work in her sleep.

In her waking life, she leads a team of health workers who crisscross Punjab to hunt down every potential incidence of poliovirus, testing sewage and investigating any reports of paralysis that might be polio. Pakistan is one of just 2 countries that continue to report cases of polio caused by the wild virus.

In addition to the challenges of polio surveillance, Nayyor faces substantial gender-related barriers that, at times, hinder her team's ability to count cases and take environmental samples. From households to security checkpoints, she encounters resistance from men. But her tactic is to push past the barriers with a balance of sensitivity and assertiveness.

"I'm not very polite," Nayyar said with a chuckle during an interview at Rotary's World Polio Day event. "We don't have time to be stopped. Ending polio is urgent and time-sensitive."

Women are critical in the fight against polio, Nayyar says. About 56% of frontline workers in Pakistan are women. More than 70% of mothers in Pakistan prefer to have women vaccinate their children.

That hasn't stopped families from slamming doors in health workers' faces, though. When polio is detected in a community, teams have to make repeated visits to each home to ensure that every child is protected by the vaccine. Multiple vaccinations add to the skepticism and anger that some parents express. It's an attitude that Nayyar and other health workers deal with daily.

"You can't react negatively in those situations. It's important to listen. Our female workers are the best at that," says Nayyar.

With polio on the verge of eradication, surveillance activities, which, Nayyar calls the "back of polio eradication," have never been more important.

Q: What exactly does polio surveillance involve?

A: There are 2 types of surveillance systems. One is surveillance of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and the 2nd is environmental surveillance. The surveillance process continues after eradication.

Q: How are you made aware of potential polio cases?

A: There's a network of reporting sites. They include all the medical facilities, the government, and the hospitals, plus informal healthcare providers and community leaders. The level of awareness is so high, and our community education has worked so well, that sometimes the parents call us directly.

Q: What happens if evidence of poliovirus is found?

A: In response to cases in humans as well as cases detected in the environment, we implement 3 rounds of supplementary immunization campaigns. The scope of our response depends on the epidemiology and our risk assessment. We look at the drainage systems. Some systems are filtered, but there are also areas that have open drains. We have maps of the sewer systems. We either cover the specific drainage areas, or we do an expanded response in a larger area.

Q: What are the special challenges in Pakistan?

A: We have mobile populations that are at high risk, and we have special health camps for these populations. Routine vaccination is every child's right, but because of poverty and lack of education, many of these people are not accessing these services.

Q: How do you convince people who are skeptical about the polio vaccine?

A: We have community mobilizers who tell people about the benefits of the vaccine. We have made it this far in the program only because of these frontline workers. One issue we are facing right now is that people are tired of vaccination. If a positive environmental sample has been found in the vicinity, then we have to go back 3 times within a very short time period. Every month you go to their doorstep, you knock on the door. There are times when people throw garbage. It has happened to me. But we do not react. We have to tolerate their anger; we have to listen.

Q: What role does Rotary play in what you do?

A: Whenever I need anything, I call on Rotary. Umbrellas for the teams? Call Rotary. Train tickets? Call Rotary. It's the longest-running eradication program in the history of public health, but still the support of Rotary is there.

[I've included the media report on the realities faced by the 1st responders in the war against polio in Pakistan (and probably also Afghanistan), especially for the female workers. These women have been risking their lives and working in the face of adversity to achieve the goal of polio eradication in Pakistan.

It is also noteworthy to highlight the effort Rotary International continues to exert to reach the goal of polio eradication. They all (the polio 1st responders and the Rotary International volunteers) deserve our respect and admiration for the work they do. - Mod.MPP]
