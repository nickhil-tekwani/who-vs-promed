Almost 5 million Totino's and Jeno's frozen pizzas with pepperoni toppings
are being recalled because the pepperoni may be contaminated with _E.
coli_, General Mills Inc said on Thu 1 Nov 2007. General Mills, which owns
the Totino's and Jeno's brands, said the recall affects about 414 000 cases
of pizza products currently in stores and all similar pizza products that
might be in consumers' freezers. Each case contains 12 pizzas.

The possible _E. coli_ contamination was uncovered by state and federal
authorities investigating 21 _E. coli_ related illnesses in 10 states.
General Mills said 9 of the 21 people reported having eaten Totino's or
Jeno's pizza with pepperoni topping at some point before becoming ill.

_E. coli_ O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacteria that can cause bloody
diarrhea and dehydration. The very young, old, and people with compromised
immune systems are the most vulnerable to foodborne disease.

General Mills said the earliest case reported to authorities occurred on 20
Jul 2007, and the latest case reported occurred on 10 Oct 2007.

The recall includes 8 types of Totino's brand frozen pizza and 3 types of
Jeno's brand frozen pizza with pepperoni topping, or pepperoni in
combination with other toppings.

The frozen pizzas were produced in its Wellston, Ohio plant and distributed
throughout the USA. The plant is currently making other pizzas but not with
pepperoni, General Mills spokesman Tom Forsythe said.

[This is another example of a contaminated product in which adequate
cooking would negate any contamination. One would think, since pizza is
generally served piping hot, that the risk would be zero, although how well
the frozen pepperoni pizzas were cooked is unclear.
