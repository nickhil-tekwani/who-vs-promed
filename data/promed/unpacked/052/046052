Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever in Kosovo - WHO Update 5
---------------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 26 Jun 2001, WHO has reported 69 suspected cases, out of
which 6 have died. Of these, 18 are confirmed as Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (CCHF); 15 by laboratory diagnosis and 3 on
clinical/epidemiological grounds. A total of 34 are laboratory
negative and 17 are still under investigation.
WHO Kosovo continues to support the epidemic response committee
managing the outbreak, assisted by partners in the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network: the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus
and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
is providing laboratory support; and a clinician with specific
expertise in hospital infection control from the North Manchester
General Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases, United Kingdom,
is helping to strengthen procedures at the isolation unit.
In response to a WHO request from partners in the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network for epidemiology support to the Institute
of Public Health, Kosovo, 2 Canadian field epidemiologists from Health
Canada will be assisting the Institute with data management in the
CCHF outbreak. Their assistance is supported by the Canadian Public
Health Association and the Canadian International Development Agency.
