France braces for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak after farm under
quarantine
----------------------------------------------------
France on Saturday [3 Mar 2001] braced for a possible outbreak of FMD
disease as a farm in the center of the country was placed under quarantine
amid suspicions the animal virus had hit a herd of sheep.
French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany sought to reassure the population,
saying no case of FMD, which is currently sweeping through Britain, had yet
been detected in France.
"For the time being, I am saying, and I repeat, there is not yet a case of
FMD in France and I am keeping my fingers crossed in the hopes there will
not be one," Glavany said in an interview on the French radio station
Europe 1. "We are taking all possible measures to prevent it, but the virus
spreads like lightning, so I cannot be certain," he added.
Results of preliminary tests from a farm in France's Loire region showed no
evidence of the animal virus on the premises, administrative officials said
Saturday. But more test samples from a herd of 24 sheep were sent to Lyon
and Paris, amid suspicions among veterinarians the scourge may have hit
livestock.
Meanwhile, police and gendarmerie placed a security cordon around the farm
in Roche-la-Moliere, and residents were told to respect strict sanitary
procedures when leaving the premises.
In an interview with a French newspaper, Health Minister Bernard Kouchner
sounded a note of alarm, saying it would be a "virtual miracle" if the
disease spared France. "If we do nothing, the disease will quickly spread
across our country. My experts are convinced of that. And if it doesn't hit
France it will be a virtual miracle," the outspoken minister told the
Journal du Dimanche.
Kouchner also said the virus would spell economic catastrophe for Britain,
whose agricultural industry has already been battered by mad cow disease.
France adopted a series of tough measures Friday to protect its farms as
the highly-contagious animal illness, which can be carried on clothing,
footwear and vehicles, continued to ravage Britain and to threaten Ireland.
French authorities issued a ban on livestock fairs and on animal imports
from Ireland to its embargo on British meat products, stepped up the
disinfection of vehicles and passengers at Channel ports and continued to
slaughter suspect animals. France also banned imports of live animals from
Belgium after a suspected outbreak there.
On Saturday, a herd of 220 sheep from Ireland were slaughtered in Isse,
near Chateaubriant, in western Loire. France imports more than half of its
lamb and much of its pork and beef from Britain and Ireland.
8 new cases of the disease in Britain were reported on Saturday, bringing
the total number there to 48. Until Saturday, the FMD outbreak was believed
to have been confined to the British mainland, where it surfaced last week,
and in Northern Ireland, where a case was reported on Thursday.
