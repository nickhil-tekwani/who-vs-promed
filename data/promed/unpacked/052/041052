Case of tularemia registered in Donetsk city
--------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of emergency situations of Ukraine, a case
of tularemia has been reported in Donetsk.
A resident of Shandrigolovoye village (Krasnoliman rayon [district]) of
Donetsk born in 1955 was hospitalized in the infectious disease department of
the central rayon hospital with a diagnosis of tularemia. Specialists from
the sanitary epidemiological surveillance station are currently working to
identify the source of the infection.
Tularemia is a bacterial infection usually associated with feral
animals. Tularemia was common in the 1940s (during World War 2),
especially in Russia. Since the disease has features similar to those
of plague, it has been called the "minor plague."
Currently, tularemia is reported from time to time. The agent of the
disease [_Francisella tularensis_ - Mod.LL] can be transferred
through 125 types of vertebrates, mainly through rodents (muskrats,
hares, mice). The agent can be transferred to humans by inoculation,
oral intake, or inhalation. Inoculation can occur through direct
contact with the animal or its remains or via the tick, mosquito, or
horsefly.

[Although classically transmitted to man via infected animals such as
rabbits or a tick vector, infection with _Francisella tularensis_ may
also be acquired from contact with soil or water harboring the
bacterium.
Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49
cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),
and an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to
contamination of a water supply (3).
_F. tularensis_ is designated as a category A bioterrorism agent. At present,
no licensed tularemia vaccine is available in the USA. However, the LVS
vaccine (live vaccine strain) is available to military personnel under an
investigational new drug protocol held by the US Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases (4). It is administered via scarification
using multiple punctures of a bifurcated needle. LVS is derived from strain
15 developed in the former USSR and was obtained by the US military in 1956
(5). It is not well-standardized and contains 2 phenotypes of _F.
tularensis_, only one of which seems to be immunogenic (6). However, in
studies published in 1977, the vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the
incidence of typhoidal tularemia in US government laboratory workers from 5.7
to 0.27 cases per at-risk employee years (7). It did not reduce the
incidence of the ulceroglandular form, but the disease in vaccinees was
reported to be milder. I am not aware whether the vaccine is effective if
given postexposure.
