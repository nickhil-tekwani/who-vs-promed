Hand-foot-mouth epidemic still spreads
--------------------------------------
The number of Chinese children infected with hand-foot-mouth disease
(HFMD) continues to rise, with reported cases exceeding 8531 on Mon 5
May 2008. All were below the age of 6, with the majority being under
2. Altogether [at least] 25 children have died of the disease. Tests
have confirmed 24 of the deaths were triggered by the virus known as
enterovirus 71 (EV71).

According to the Guidelines Regarding Prevention and Control of HFMD
published on the Ministry of Health website, HFMD can be caused by a
host of intestinal viruses, but EV71 and the coxsackievirus A16 (Cox
A16) were the most common.

Anhui Province, in east China, and Guangdong Province, south China
were the worst hit areas. 22 of the deaths occurred in Fuyang, a city
in northwestern Anhui, and the rest happened in Guangdong. These 2
regions were followed by Beijing, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Hubei,
according to statistics released by local health departments.

In Anhui alone, 622 new cases were reported on Saturday [3 May 2008],
including 362 in Fuyang, driving up the number of children with HFMD
to 5151 in Anhui. Beijing has recorded at least 1010 cases of the
disease, while Guangdong registered 925 cases as of Sunday [4 May 2008] .

Both EV71 and Cox A16 can cause HFMD, which usually starts with a
slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and rashes
on the hands and feet. Those sickened by EV71 often show serious
symptoms. It can also lead to meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary
edema, and paralysis in some children. There is no vaccine.

Saying reports of HFMD could increase in the next few months, the
Health Ministry issued a circular late last month [April 2008]
requiring better management and surveillance of the disease. The
ministry asked hospitals for daily reports on the disease, and for
local health departments to report emergencies promptly and increase
investment in research into the disease.

China says hand-foot-mouth disease spreading among children
-----------------------------------------------------------
More than 11 900 children have been reported sick with
hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in China, and at least 26 of those
cases have died, a state news agency said. 24 of the deaths, in the
central province of Anhui and Guangdong province in the south, have
been blamed on enterovirus 71, one of several viruses that cause the
disease, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday [5 May 2008]. 2
other children -- one in Guangdong and another in the coastal
province of Zhejiang -- have also died of hand-foot-mouth disease but
it wasn't immediately clear which strain of virus killed them, it said.

The Xinhua News Agency said 10 212 children had been reported
infected in the hardest-hit areas, including the provinces of Anhui,
Guangdong, Zhejiang, and the capital Beijing. All were below the age
of 6 and most were under the age of 2, it said. The total number of
infections reported nationwide by Monday [5 May 2008] was 11 905,
Xinhua said, with smaller outbreaks in Hebei, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei,
Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Henan provinces and in the city of Chongqing.

Although nearly all the deaths have been blamed on enterovirus 71
(EV71), it was not immediately clear how many of the overall
infections were traced to that virus. Zhejiang's provincial health
bureau said on its website that only 9 of its 1198 cases had tested
positive for EV71. Chongqing said none of its 42 infections have been
confirmed to be cause by EV71.

Xinhua said the jump in cases was due in part to a new regulation
from the Ministry of Health classifying hand-foot-mouth disease among
those that have to be reported to the central government. The agency
said a majority of the cases were reported in Anhui province, where
5840 cases were reported, nearly all of them in the fast-growing city
of Fuyang.

Enterovirus [71] causes a severe form of hand-foot-mouth disease with
symptoms including fever, mouth sores, and rashes with blisters. It
is easily spread by sneezing or coughing. The viruses mainly strike
children ages 10 and younger. Some cases can lead to fatal swelling
of the brain.

The illness is not related to foot-and-mouth disease, which afflicts
livestock. There is no vaccine or specific treatment, but most
children affected by mild forms of the disease typically recover
quickly without problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) says
the virus normally peaks in June and July so there could be an
increase in infections as the weather warms.

Chinese province reports 1198 hand-foot-mouth cases
---------------------------------------------------
Zhejiang Province in east China has recorded 1198 cases of
hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), including one death, this year
[2008], the provincial health department said on Monday [5 May 2008].

A 5-year-old boy died of the epidemic triggered by the intestinal
virus known as EV71 in Wenzhou city on 6 Apr 2008 when medical
efforts failed. Another 8 HFMD cases also tested positive for EV71, a
highly contagious virus that preys on children usually aged between 2
and 6. The rest of the registered cases were possibly caused by Cox A
16 [human coxsackievirus A 16] or [an echovirus], according to Lin
Junfen, an expert with the provincial center for disease control and
prevention.

Zhejiang has witnessed an increasing number of HFMD cases in recent
years. It reported 101 cases in 2005, 793 cases in 2006, and 1607
cases in 2007, said Zhao Feng, an official with the health
department. A medical emergency reporting mechanism has been
established in the province to closely track suspected cases, and
local authorities have been reminding people of paying more attention
to sanitation.

Altogether 26 children have died of the disease across the nation,
with 22 registered in Anhui Province and 3 in Guangdong Province.
Tests have confirmed 25 of the deaths were triggered by EV71.

CDC reports 2nd death from enterovirus
--------------------------------------
Public health officials reported the death of a 3-year-old boy in
southern Kaohsiung yesterday [5 May 2008]; the 2nd fatal enterovirus
case this year. They urged all parents and schoolteachers to be more
vigilant against enterovirus [infection], as temperatures in Taiwan
continue to rise into the summer months. Chou Jih-haw, deputy
director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department
of Health (DOH), said that the latest victim was a boy aged 3 years
and 4 months who had probably been infected by his 5-year-old sister.

On 11 Apr 2008, the boy developed a fever, with rashes and sores in
his mouth, and he was checked into the hospital with spasms the
following day [12 Apr 2008], Chou said. The boy lapsed into a coma
shortly after he was admitted, and died 5 days later despite efforts
to save him, Chou said. An investigation found that the boy's sister
also had an enterovirus infection, and had been admitted to the
hospital on 13 Apr 2008. But she fully recovered because her case was
not that serious.

"Children under 3 years old are most vulnerable to the disease
because they have no antibodies, making them a high risk group in
serious cases of enterovirus, especially in cross infection
situations," Chou said. The 1st enterovirus death occurred in March
[2008] in Yunlin County, southwestern Taiwan, the CDC reported.

Health officials at the CDC said that the number of confirmed serious
cases of enterovirus has reached 60 this year [2008], and among them
there have been 2 deaths; 7 other patients remain in intensive care,
while one has been hospitalized for about 4 months due to
encephalitis complications.

Enterovirus infections can be deadly for young children. The virus
enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract and often moves on
to attack the nervous system, leading to symptoms of fever, muscle
aches, and aseptic or viral meningitis. In a massive outbreak in
Taiwan in 1998, 405 children were infected and 78 of them eventually
died. The most recent outbreak came in 2005, with 145 children
infected and 15 dying from the virus.

DOH officials said people should maintain good personal hygiene by
frequently washing their hands. Parents and teachers at elementary
schools and kindergartens should especially supervise young children
to clean their hands in southern Taiwan during warmer weather, they
said. Young children should also be kept away from places with big
crowds, they advised.

[The HFMD outbreaks continue to spread through China with up to 12
000 children affected and 26 fatalities reported. The province of
Anhui has been hardest hit with almost 6000 cases, almost all of
which have been reported from the vicinity of Fuyang city where 22 of
the 26 deaths have occurred. In most provinces enterovirus 71 has
been confirmed as the cause of the infection.

In striking contrast in Taiwan 2 deaths have been reported among 60
serious cases, but the number of non-serious cases is not stated.
Here also enterovirus 71 has been confirmed as the cause of the outbreak.

Fuyang in the northwest of the province is available at

[In the 2nd newswire, there is mention that HFMD has just recently
been added to the list of diseases to be reported to the central
level. As a result, there is an expected major increase in reported
numbers of cases as more provinces e change in regulations. What is
needed here to help monitor the actual progress of the outbreak will
be epidemic curves showing numbers of cases by date of onset, rather
than by date of report. - Mod.MPP]
