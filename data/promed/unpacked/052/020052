WHO tells countries with established swine flu outbreaks to stop
counting cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Countries should change the way they track the spread of swine flu,
the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday [16 Jul 2009],
noting that it no longer serves any useful purpose to count individual
confirmed cases. That type of resource-intensive surveillance isn't
needed in places where outbreaks are already established and the work
required for case-by-case counting is not sustainable, the
Geneva-based agency said in a statement.

Instead the WHO asked countries to look for signs of "unusual events"
-- indicators that might suggest alterations in patterns of disease
severity or spread that might be signs of changes in the pandemic
virus. "The increasing number of cases in many countries with
sustained community transmission is making it extremely difficult, if
not impossible, for countries to try and confirm them through
laboratory testing," the WHO said. "Moreover, the counting of
individual cases is now no longer essential in such countries for
monitoring either the level or nature of the risk posed by the
pandemic virus or to guide implementation of the most appropriate
response measures."

The WHO had signalled last week that it would soon be asking countries
with established outbreaks to make this change. And on Thursday,
Canada's chief public health officer said that is the direction in
which Canadian reporting is heading. "We always only see a small
percentage of the total" flu cases, Dr. David Butler-Jones said in an
interview. "And that, as more and more people become ill, is less and
less relevant. What's really key from a public health standpoint is
making sure we're not missing anything (significant)."

Case counts have never provided a full picture of the degree to which
the infection is spreading. That's because influenza is a sort of tip-
of-the-iceberg illness, with only a portion of cases coming to the
attention of medical authorities. As with seasonal flu, most people
who have contracted the new pandemic virus have recuperated without
the need to seek medical care and are therefore not reflected in
national or global case counts.

The WHO said countries that haven't yet seen cases or are in the early
days of their outbreaks are still being asked to report weekly
estimates of case numbers and a description of the disease pattern
being seen. Countries with established outbreaks should still keep a
sharp eye out for unusual events, the WHO said, pointing to things
like clusters of cases of severe or fatal infection or of respiratory
illness requiring hospitalization, or unexplained or unexpected
clinical patterns associated with serious or fatal cases. Other
potential signals the virus may be changing include "unexpected,
unusual or notable changes in patterns of transmission," spikes in
absenteeism from schools or workplaces or surges in emergency
department visits.

"A strategy that concentrates on the detection, laboratory
confirmation and investigation of all cases, including those with mild
illness, is extremely resource-intensive," the WHO said. "In some
countries, this strategy is absorbing most national laboratory and
response capacity, leaving little capacity for the monitoring and
investigation of severe cases and other exceptional events." The
agency said it would no longer be issuing case counts by country, but
would periodically update on pandemic developments.

The statement did not say if the agency would continue to tally deaths
due to the infection and a spokesperson for the WHO was not able to
say Thursday if a global death toll would still be calculated. As of
Wednesday [15 Jul 2009], the Public Health Agency of Canada reported
10 156 confirmed cases and 45 deaths.

[According to CIDRAP News of 16 Jul 2009
(<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/jul1609cases-br.html>), Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the change in the WHO's case-reporting policy isn't unexpected, because the WHO and the CDC have been emphasizing over the past several weeks that the number of lab-confirmed cases is just the tip of the iceberg of the true number of people who are or were sick with the novel H1N1
virus.

Specific case counts were once needed to help characterize the early
spread of the disease, he said. Now that the virus is widespread and
poised for a potential surge in the fall, "specific case counts are no
longer needed, and since they don't represent the true picture of the
situation, they are not necessary," Skinner said. The CDC will likely
make a similar move to downplay the number of confirmed cases, but it
will maintain, if not expand, surveillance to gauge the health impact
of the pandemic and the severity of the illness, he said.

Peter Sandman, PhD, a New Jersey-based consultant and
risk-communication expert, said that early on in the novel H1N1
outbreak the WHO had a good technical reason to urge countries to
track the number of confirmed cases -- to help assess community
transmission -- but the usefulness of the numbers quickly waned.

"The big problem is that almost everyone has used the number of
confirmed cases as if it were the true number of cases," he said.
"Everyone was pouncing on those numbers. The downside of the focus on
the confirmed case numbers has been that the public perceives the
pandemic as less pervasive than experts know it to be," Sandman said.
Sandman said another problem is that an emphasis on the number of
confirmed cases, along with the number of deaths, gives the public --
and even some government and public health officials -- an inflated
impression of the case fatality rate. "The pandemic H1N1 virus could
get more deadly at any time," Sandman said. "But if you compare the
number of pandemic deaths in the USA to the CDC estimates of how many
people have already had the disease, it calculates out that the
pandemic is less deadly than seasonal flu so far. People compare the
number of deaths to the number of confirmed cases, and that makes the
pandemic look much more deadly, because all the cases that never got
confirmatory testing are missing from the denominator."

Since the start of the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak, the
WHO has issued 58 updates, the last on 6 Jul 2009:
