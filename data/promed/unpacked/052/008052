Affected Population On 1 Jun 2011, in the central part of Lithuania,
in the village of Sils, during an investigation in the pig farm of the
joint-stock company Berzs kompleksas, an outbreak of classical swine
fever (CSF) was confirmed by the National Food and Veterinary Risk
Assessment Institute (NFVRAI), which is the designated National
Reference Laboratory for CSF of Lithuania.

Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments On 1 Jun 2011, in the central part of
Lithuania, in the village of Sils, during an investigation in the pig
farm of the joint-stock company Berzs kompleksas, an outbreak of
classical swine fever (CSF) was confirmed by the National Food and
Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute (NFVRAI), which is the designated
National Reference Laboratory for CSF of Lithuania. Out of 63 samples
tested, 36 were found positive for antibodies against CSF, 13 were
doubtful and 14 were negative. All the samples were analyzed by RT-PCR
and three samples were found positive. Further investigation is
continuing by virus isolation and virus neutralization. Genotyping of
the virus is being performed. The positive samples are being sent to
the EU Reference Laboratory for further analysis.

All the CSF eradication and prevention measures have been applied in
the outbreak and around it in accordance with the provisions of
Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 Oct 2001 on measures for the
control of classical swine fever. Clinical examination and all
sampling and testing procedures are carried out according to
Commission Decision 2002/106/EC of 1 Feb 2002 approving a Diagnostic
Manual establishing diagnostic procedures, sampling methods and
criteria for evaluation of the laboratory tests for the confirmation
of classical swine fever.

A standstill regime for pigs is introduced in the whole territory of
Lithuania for trade and export. No movement, no trade (in or out) of
pigs from the infected farm was done to EU countries. On all the
industrial pig farms of Lithuania which export live pigs, trade in
pigs with other EU Member States and move pigs within the country,
clinical and laboratory examination starts to be performed. State Food
and Veterinary Services start the investigation of the outbreak and
all the measures.

Control measures - Measures applied. Control of arthropods; Control
of wildlife reservoirs; Quarantine; Movement control inside the
country; Screening; Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected
animals

Measures to be applied - Stamping out; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Dipping / Spraying

[Many of the critical epidemiologic details are missing from this
report and will probably be forthcoming. An example of how to report
outbreaks correctly is provided by the 2009 EU report referenced below
(See Classical swine fever - Lithuania (03): (PA), EU report 20090719.2569)

We do know that this CSF strain is classical swine fever virus type
2.1, which is the same one causing the 2009 outbreak in the breeding
stock for a commercial swine operation in Lithuania. Often times, in
Europe outbreaks are associated with wild boar or backyard pigs but
this does not appear to be the case in either this outbreak or the
2009 one in Lithuania. Also, of interest would be the details of the
clinical presentation and whether or not there were no clinical signs
in all pigs such as the high fever, CNS signs and whether the signs
were typical and similar to the ones described in the 2009 outbreak.

The location of the outbreak is in the central part of the country
and can be seen from the map appended to the OIE report referenced
above or located on the Healthmap interactive map
