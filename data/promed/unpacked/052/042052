[1] Guinea (Kankan)
- Sat 20 Feb 2021. 1st case identified

The confirmation was given to us this Sat 20 Feb 2021 by the health authorities of the region. This is, according to the regional health director of Kankan, Dr. Mohamed Sacko Sylla, a man in his 30s who left the forest region to go to Lero, in Siguiri prefecture.

He was diagnosed at the Lero health center and then, using an ambulance chartered by the Kankan regional hospital, he was transported to the N'Zerekore epidemiological treatment center.

"Indeed, a 30-year-old man was confirmed to be carrying the Ebola virus in Lero. We were informed of this by the local health district and the prefectural health directorate of Siguiri. He is originally from N'Zerekore. We brought in an ambulance from the Kankan regional hospital to send it to the treatment center in N'Zerekore," he confirmed.

According to Dr. Mohamed Sacko Sylla, a team was immediately dispatched to the infection zone to identify the contacts.

"As soon as we had the information, we sent a team to go and identify all the contact cases that this gentleman had. So right now, it's still time to work; they are looking for contacts. When they finish, we will be able to take stock of the situation with greater precision and announce other urgent measures to be taken," he added.

Note that this is the 1st time since the 1st appearance [of Ebola] in Guinea, in 2013, that a case testing positive for the Ebola virus has been found in the administrative region of Kankan.

[It is not clear where the infection actually took place, but the patient "left the forest zone to go to Lero," where he was diagnosed. He then went by ambulance to N'Zerekore, where he was originally from. It is suggested that "the patient contracted Ebola in N'Zerekore before travelling north and falling ill." This would be the most likely and best-case scenario.

It is of particular concern because Societe Miniere de Dinguiraye (SMD) has a large gold-mining facility in Lero, near the Malian border. Mines have been associated with Ebola in the past. In 2019, during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) said that cases had been linked to the Biakato Mines health area (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/who-biakato-mines-region-linked-recent-ebola-cases). However, as long as the virus does not spread from this infected individual, it is still somewhat contained. - Mod.LK]

- Sat 20 Feb 2021. Lero: 9 contacts identified

The prefecture of Siguiri recorded yesterday, Fri 19 Feb 2021, its 1st case of Ebola since the resurgence of the disease in Guinea. And, according to information given to <Guineematin.com> this Saturday [20 Feb 2021], 9 contacts of this confirmed case of the Ebola virus have already been identified. These include members of the family of this patient and some of his close associates.

"Indeed, there were 9 contacts that have been identified," said Moussa Cisse, the prefectural director of health in Siguiri. "This morning [Sat 20 Feb 2021] I prepared another team to continue to identify other contacts. So the team has just moved."

Recall that the confirmed case of Ebola that was recorded in Siguiri has just returned from a stay in N'Zerekore. It is in this prefecture that he would have come into contact with "an Ebola patient already known to the health service."

[2] Guinea: MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] interview
Date: Fri 19 Feb 2021
Source: MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres, edited]
https://www.msf.org/five-questions-2021-ebola-outbreak-guinea


On 14 Feb 2021, the authorities in Guinea declared a new Ebola outbreak. As one of the key medical organisations responding in the huge 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) immediately started mobilising a team of Ebola-experienced specialists to form the core of a response team. Anja Wolz is the Ebola emergency coordinator overseeing MSF's response and outlined the current situation in this interview.

How concerned are you by this new Ebola outbreak?

With all epidemic responses, it is important to be calm and focused. This is, however, Ebola, and that is always concerning. This is why we have mobilised a team of some of MSF's most experienced Ebola specialists, who will travel to Guinea as soon as the administrative and visa processes allow. We may find that this is a small outbreak -- easy to control and contain -- or we may find that the problem is bigger and more complex.

What needs to happen at the start of an Ebola response?

1st of all, you need a clear picture of the problem. An epidemiological surveillance team, with one MSF epidemiologist included, departed Mon 15 Feb [2021] for the affected areas of N'Zerekore and Goueke, in the far south of the country. They have started to do the epidemiological surveillance work, but we do not yet have full clarity about what we are facing.

Then there are a series of key basic things that have to be done rapidly and well:

- contact tracing (identifying all people who have been in contact with someone who has Ebola in order to be able to monitor their health and stop that chain of transmission);
- having medical facilities with the right set-up for isolating and treating Ebola patients;
- ensuring there are safe funeral practices for anyone who dies of Ebola or suspected Ebola;
- passing good, clear, health education information;
- making sure there is a good triage set-up in all health facilities to minimise the chances of Ebola having knock-on consequences on the rest of the health system; and
- above all else, community engagement.

Community engagement is particularly vital. You need to invest time and energy in talking -- and listening -- to the communities in affected areas. You need to adapt the response according to what they say, and you need them to adapt to the risks of Ebola. It has to be a 2-way conversation.

What about the prospect of an Ebola vaccine?

It is certainly true that the existence of Ebola vaccines is one of the key differences from the outbreak in 2014-2016. And this is great news, but we need to be careful in how expectations are set. It is unlikely there will be enough vaccines to cover entire regions or prefectures. This will mean the choices about the use of the vaccine need to be very clearly explained to avoid misunderstandings and potential distrust in communities affected by Ebola.

It all comes back again to community engagement. If a community feels sidelined, unheard, and becomes nervous or distrustful, then an Ebola response will likely face multiple difficulties, with or without vaccines.

What about the new Ebola treatments?

It is true that Ebola treatments did not exist at the start of the 2014 outbreak, and so this is a significant difference today. We do not yet know which of the treatments will be used in this response in Guinea, but the very fact of having a treatment option is good for 2 reasons:

1. it significantly increases a patient's chances of survival, particularly if the patient starts treatment reasonably early; and
2. it means we have better chances of encouraging people to come early for isolation and treatment. Before there was a treatment available, it was understandable that people would stay away from Ebola treatment centres, which often became feared as places of death. But with a treatment available, that could change substantially. This matters for outbreak control, because when someone with Ebola is isolated, they are not spreading the virus to others.

What will MSF be doing in the response?

We will have a small Ebola-expert, multidisciplinary team, able to turn their hand to pretty much all aspects of the response. We already have an initial advance-team that moved to the area to help with the epidemiological surveillance and to start understanding the communities' knowledge of Ebola, so that health education information can be adapted appropriately.

When the dedicated Ebola team arrives, they will combine forces and make quick decisions about where and how MSF can be of most help. The team will have the skills and equipment to do whatever is most needed; from Ebola medical treatment to epidemiological surveillance work, health education, contact-tracing, community engagement, or vaccination.

There is an essential thing to keep in mind, for MSF and for all other teams engaged in the response. You need to bring your technical skills (medical or epidemiological or infection control or health education, etc.), but you also need to bring your soft community engagement skills. Both are needed in an Ebola epidemic response.
