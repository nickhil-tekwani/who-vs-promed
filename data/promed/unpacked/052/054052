[Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and human cases occur there annually. As mentioned in previous reports, it is not clear how many of the reported cases above are laboratory confirmed. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may have been chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. The situations under which the cases acquired their MPX infections are not reported, but some presumably were from handling infected wild rodents. Other individuals may have become infected from contact with MPX cases. Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spillover hosts. - Mod.TY
