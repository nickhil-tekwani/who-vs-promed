Mystery substance in Washington investigation was a Chromium
compound. Milk from affected cows did not get in food supply. Criminal
investigation still under way. FDA names substance that sickened cows
---------------------------------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was cited as saying Wednesday
it has identified the toxic substance that killed 3 cows after it was
splashed on a farmer's dairy herd earlier this month.
Tests showed that a chromium compound was to blame for the previously
unexplained deaths, the agency said. Such compounds are used in a wide
range of products, from multivitamins to glass cleaners.
Dr. Robert Brackett, the FDA's food safety director, was cited as saying he
could not release details about the specific compound found on several cows
in the Enumclaw herd because of the ongoing criminal probe.
Jay Gordon, executive director for the state Dairy Federation, was quoted
as saying, "It's not something we use in the dairy industry."
[The dairy farm owner] found the tacky, reddish-brown substance on cows in
his herd 6 Jun 2004. 10 became sick and 3 eventually died. Each had
blisters on its back from exposure to the chemical.

Statement on FDA test results from Washington State dairy cattle
--------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration's Forensic Chemical Center (FCC)
laboratory in Cincinnati has completed its testing of milk samples from
cows exposed to a toxic substance in Washington State. The results of the
tests reveal no identifiable risk from this agent associated with the milk
from any of the exposed cows.
The FCC lab, which has been working around the clock since Sun 20 Jun 2004,
tested samples from exposed and non-exposed animals. Initial testing was
focused on identifying the toxic substance. An ear tag containing a residue
of the toxic substance was removed from a dairy cow directly exposed to the
toxic agent and tested. Milk from dairy cattle directly exposed to and made
ill by the toxic agent was tested, as was milk from an additional group of
cattle that came into contact with the toxic agent but did not become ill.
In addition, milk samples from unexposed healthy animals were also tested
as a control group.
FDA's testing of residues from directly exposed animals identified the
substance as a strong oxidizing chromium compound. Consequently, FCC
focused on analyzing milk samples for the presence of chromium.
Because the investigation of this case is continuing, precise test results
for individual samples will not be released. Concentrations of chromium in
all samples of milk from dairy cattle directly exposed to and made ill by
the toxic substance were well below the level of 100 parts per billion
allowed for drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Chromium levels in all milk samples tested from the cows that came into
contact with the toxic substance but did not become ill were below the
minimum detection level of less than 1 part per billion.
These results are reassuring, especially since milk would have been diluted
some 5000 to 50 000 times when it is combined with milk from other farms in
preparation for processing.
Some milk from healthy animals in this herd has been voluntarily held
pending the test results. FDA's Seattle District today is advising any
firms that have been holding milk or milk products that those products may
be released into commerce. No milk from the 10 ill animals has entered the
food supply.

FDA says chromium compound poisoned dairy cows
----------------------------------------------
A substance that was smeared on dairy cows near Seattle, killing 3 and
sickening 7 others, was a chromium compound, but the episode did not
endanger consumers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said late yesterday.
The FDA called the substance "a strong oxidizing chromium compound" but did
not identify it more specifically. Tests revealed "no identifiable risk
from this agent associated with milk from any of the exposed cows," the
agency said.
The FDA announced 21 Jun 2004 that it and several other agencies were
investigating the incident at a dairy farm in Enumclaw, Wash., about 50
miles southeast of Seattle. The dairy farmer reported that 10 cows got sick
on 6 Jun 2004, and all had a reddish-black substance and blisters on their
backs, according to stories this week in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and
the Seattle Times.
3 of the cows later died, and the dairyman said he dumped thousands of
pounds of milk as a precaution, according to reports. It wasn't clear
exactly how many cows were exposed to the toxin, but the FDA said the
number was fewer than 20.
The FDA said its Forensic Chemical Center in Cincinnati had been working on
the case "around the clock" since 20 Jun 2004. The lab first analyzed
residues of the substance found on the cows and identified it as a chromium
compound.
A report by the Post-Intelligencer today quoted an unnamed federal
investigator as saying the compound contained "chromium 6 -- a known
carcinogen with a variety of pharmaceutical and industrial uses." The story
also quoted James Mayer, a University of Washington chemistry professor, as
saying that chromium 6 compounds are "corrosive, aggressive chemicals" that
are used in industry but not in any household products.
The FDA said it tested for chromium in milk from the sick cows, milk from
cows that were exposed to the agent but didn't get sick, and milk from
unexposed cows. "Concentrations of chromium in all samples of milk from
dairy cattle directly exposed to and made ill by the toxic substance were
well below the level of 100 parts per billion allowed for drinking water by
the Environmental Protection Agency," the agency said.
"Chromium levels in all milk samples tested from the cows that came into
contact with the toxic substance but did not become ill were below the
minimum detection level of less than 1 part per billion," the statement
said. In addition, the milk would have been diluted by a factor of 5000 to
50 000 when mixed with milk from other farms before processing, officials said.
The FDA said no milk from the sick cows entered the food supply. Some milk
from healthy animals in the herd was voluntarily held pending the test
results, but FDA officials in Seattle yesterday were advising firms that
they could release the milk, the agency said.
In a Times story yesterday, Seattle FBI agent Patrick Adams was quoted as
saying there was no evidence of any link to terrorism in the case. He said
the agency was looking at former employees or anyone else who might have
held a grudge against this particular dairyman.
Newspaper reports said there was speculation that the episode could be
linked to a recently resolved labor dispute between West Farm Foods, the
marketing arm of the Northwest Dairy Association, and the Teamsters Union.
The dairyman is a member of the association's board. The lengthy dispute
was settled 26 May 2004.
On 4 May 2004, vandals hit 2 trucking companies that haul milk for WestFarm
Foods, according to a Post-Intelligencer report. The vandals opened valves
and removed plastic covers on tanker trucks, resulting in the loss of 600
000 pounds of milk, and also punctured truck tires, the story said. A union
official denied any knowledge of the attacks and said the union didn't
condone them.

[The veterinarian of record did not know what the substance in question
was, or how to treat the cows that had been exposed.
In light of world terrorist incidents, there was fear on the part of the
authorities, primarily the FBI and the FDA, because this situation involved
food-producing animals.
The news around the Washington area has picked up this story. Unfortunately
the sensationalism of the coverage has worried many producers across the
country.
The FDA and FBI today released their results:
