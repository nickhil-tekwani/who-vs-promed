Volume 1 of revised EPPO Standards:
Guidelines for the efficacy evaluation of plant protection products is now
available.
With the publication of Volume 1, the whole set of revised EPPO standards
'guidelines for the efficacy evaluation of plant protection products' is
now complete. These EPPO Standards provide an essential aid to all
institutions, both private and governmental, involved in efficacy
evaluation trials of plant protection products for registration purposes.
More than 200 guidelines are included in 4 separate volumes (see below),
covering a very large number of crops and all types of plant protection
products.
Volume 1 contains: an introduction; general guidelines, in particular nos.
135 (phytotoxicity), 152 (trial design and analysis) and 181 (trial conduct
and reporting); miscellaneous guidelines (molluscicides, nematicides,
rodenticides, side effects on natural enemies); and a general index.
All revised guidelines are available as four separate paperback books,
according to the topic concerned:
Volume 1: Introduction, general and miscellaneous guidelines, new and
revised guidelines.
Volume 2: Fungicides, bactericides.
Volume 3: Insecticides, acaricides.
Volume 4: Herbicides, plant growth regulators.
Volume 2 appeared in 1997, Volumes 3 and 4 in 1998, and Volume 1 has just
been published. The set of revised EPPO guidelines is on sale, either as a
whole or as separate volumes. A special discount price of 240 EUR is
offered for the complete set of four volumes. Otherwise, separate volumes
can be ordered at the price of 80 EUR each. These prices apply separately
to the English and French versions. The Plant Protection Services of EPPO
member countries and regular subscribers to earlier versions of EPPO
guidelines have already been informed individually by the EPPO Secretariat.
