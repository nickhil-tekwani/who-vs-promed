In the Kara-Buura district of the Talas region, 4 people showed symptoms of anthrax. Elina Kachybekova, chief physician of the regional department of the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, confirmed the information to Azattyk.

According to her, they are all in the hospital and their condition is satisfactory.

"In the village of Kok-Sai, a supposedly sick cow was slaughtered, the meat was divided among about 10 families. Four people had ulcers on their hands and were taken to the district hospital. But the tests are clean, it turned out that they had previously taken antibiotics. In 3 days, they will be tested again," Kachybekova said.

She added that 53 people who had contact with the hospitalized were taken under observation. Veterinarians collected the remaining meat and burned it.

In 2021, in Kyrgyzstan, an anthrax outbreak was recorded in the Suzak district of the Jalal-Abad region; the disease was detected in 8 people. It was also reported that 7 people were hospitalized with suspicion of anthrax in the Aksy region.

Anthrax can affect both humans and animals. It infects not only cattle and small cattle, but occasionally dogs and cats. In the external environment, anthrax bacteria can be active for 100 years. If this disease is detected in livestock, the bones of the animal are to be burned, after which the ashes are buried deep into the ground, and the pit is filled with concrete from above. Such animal burial grounds are fenced around the perimeter.

[Talas Region (Oblast) is on the north-west border of Kyrgyzstan with Kazakhstan, and adjoins an area of the latter country with regular sporadic anthrax cases in livestock; see Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talas_Region. For a map of Kyrgyzstan showing Talas, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.jpg. Kara-Buura district is on the Kazakh border.

While Talas appears to have had its share of outbreaks, unfortunately they are seldom reported. The earliest report we have is in a 2008 review of outbreaks in Kyrgyzstan, when 23 "foci," or outbreaks, were reported in the province. These cases usually follow from slaughtering and butchering of sick animals, mainly cattle, so that the meat can be shared with neighbours and sold in local markets. This is a classic outbreak of rural human anthrax, fortunately all cutaneous, in this part of the world. Bishkek is efficient and if these 4 human cases are in the newspapers there should be a follow-up report of any veterinary investigation and response. It is probably too late to collect any contaminated meat; what remains of the carcass needs to be burnt or buried; and the livestock in the village must be vaccinated to prevent any more cases. - Mod.MHJ
