Namibia's Environment Ministry confirmed on [Mon 16 Apr 2018] that the anthrax outbreak in the west part of Bwabwata National Park in the Kavango East Region has been contained. The anthrax outbreak in the country which was detected last year [2017] in October in one of the country's biggest game parks killed around 120 hippopotamuses and 25 buffaloes, amongst others.

The Environment Ministry, Public Relations officer, Romeo Muyunda in a statement said the Anthrax Containment Team which included the environment, health and agriculture ministries had contained the situation. "During the outbreak, no clinical cases of anthrax were detected in human and livestock. The Health Ministry put 724 people on prophylaxis against anthrax mainly in the Mukwe Constituency as a precautionary measure," said Muyunda.

According to Muyunda, the Agriculture Ministry also managed to vaccinate a total of 216 wild animals while 3000 cattle and 1010 goats were also vaccinated.

Muyunda added that to avoid future outbreaks, the Regional Containment Team resolved that a National Standard Operating Procedure or Action Plan for the containment of anthrax outbreaks should be developed.

[These numbers differ slightly from the November 2017 report to OIE which had 33 deaths of Hippopotamus: _Hippopotamus amphibious_ (Hippopotamidae) and 16 deaths of African buffalo (Cape buffalo): _Syncerus caffer_ (Bovidae). Vaccinating 216 hippos and Cape buffaloes would have been exciting.

The Agriculture Ministry is to be congratulated on their vaccination efforts for both wildlife and domestic livestock. Time will test whether their Action Plan is effective. Nature does what nature does and is illiterate, unable to read Minister's directives. But we wish them every success. - Mod.MHJ
