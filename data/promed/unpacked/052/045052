[1] Graphic: Timeline
21 Dec 2005: Vado Diomande, a dance performer and drum maker, returns
from the Ivory Coast with (4 unprocessed goat) hides.
15 Feb 2006: Mr Diomande last works with the animal hides at his
workplace near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn.
16 Feb: Mr Diomande collapses after a dance performance at the
Steadman Theatre in Mansfield, PA. He is taken to Solders & Sailors
Memorial Hospital in Wellsboro, PA.
17 Feb: The hospital takes a blood sample to determine if Mr Diomande
has an infection.
18 Feb: Mr Diomande is transferred from Solders & Sailors Memorial
Hospital to Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA.
20 Feb: The samples of Mr. Diomande's blood begin to show signs of
anthrax. A sample is sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Health
for further testing.
21 Feb: The Pennsylvania Dept of Health detects anthrax, and a public
health investigation begins. Officials notify the New York City
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Centers for Disease
Control & Prevention, and the F.B.I. The CDC receives a sample for
its own testing.
22 Feb: The CDC confirms the diagnosis of anthrax. New York City
officials announce that Mr Diomande has inhalation anthrax. They say
they have sealed his workplace in Brooklyn and his apartment building
in the West Village. Officials suggest that the case is isolated, and
discount terrorism. At least 3 other people are given antibiotics.
[2] Possible prior exposure:
Dr. Melanie A. MacLennan, a friend and personal physician of Mr.
Diomande, said she believed that he had been infected with anthrax
overseas in the past. In December 2003, she said, he was hospitalized
for 6 weeks in the Netherlands with a skin infection so severe that
he had to receive several skin grafts on his left thigh. She said he
probably contracted the bacteria in Africa. "When he became ill in
2003, in the Netherlands with a serious skin infection, his friends
worried whether he would live. He was deathly ill, almost to the
point where people didn't think he was going to survive," Ms. Becker
said. "He was very, very, very sick. Somehow he came through it, and
is back in tiptop form."
[3] Hide handling by Diomande:
In his work as a maker of drums, Mr. Diomande has used both domestic
and imported skins, but he and his relatives have told investigators
that he worked with the imported skins in the Brooklyn warehouse in
the days preceding his trip to Pennsylvania.
He made the drums by "soaking the hide and then stretching and
scraping it to remove the hair, which is potentially a scenario where
he could aerosolize any spores," said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. [This is the traditional means of removing hair from a
sun-dried hide. - Mod.MHJ] [But] Mr. Diomande told investigators that
he uses a razor to strip off the hair, then pours water over it so he
can more easily manipulate the skin.
In fact, the [CDC] officials said they could not rule out the
possibility that the germs had come from some of the domestic animal
skins that Mr. Diomande also worked with in his Brooklyn warehouse.
The authorities were just beginning their search and examination of
the musician's warehouse and his Manhattan home last night.
Even though Mr. Diomande might have traveled across the city with
contaminated hides, officials said that it likely took aggressive
handling to release enough anthrax spores to do any damage. The
process of making a drum is ideal for such a release.
[4] Hide importation:
Mayor Bloomberg and officials in Pennsylvania said the chain of
events leading to Mr. Diomande's illness began on 21 Dec 2005, when
he returned from a 2-week trip to Ivory Coast. There, he obtained raw
animal hides to bring home with him, the mayor said. A city official
who is close to the investigation and spoke on the condition of
anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case said Mr. Diomande
arrived at Kennedy International Airport with 4 goat skins and took
them in suitcases directly to his studio in Brooklyn. The skins were
probably never taken to his Manhattan apartment, the official said. A
relative disputed the officials' account. "I think the officials are
confused," said a brother-in-law, Alexander Harman, 43, a computer
animator in Jersey City. "He is not importing, by hand this quantity
of skins. I've always understood that he buys them from local
distributors, and I am positive that he does not carry skins through
customs himself. They are heavy, and he goes through sometimes 100 in
a month. He's only made 2 trips to Africa in the last 14 years."
Mark J. Mershon, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I. field
office in New York City, said there was no indication that the skins
were smuggled into the country.
[5] Official Responses:
(a) NYC Building:
Yesterday [22 Feb.] morning, federal authorities concluded
definitively that Mr. Diomande had inhalational anthrax. About 5 p.m.
yesterday, federal agents, police officers, firefighters and other
city workers surrounded Mr. Diomande's apartment building at 31
Downing Street in the West Village of Manhattan and the warehouse at
2 Prince Street, near the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn,
where he used animal skins to make drums for his dance troupe and for
other musicians. Mr. Diomande's 5th-floor apartment was sealed.
Residents on the first 4 floors were allowed to enter the building.
The officials set up a command post near the warehouse, an 8-story
building, and police cordoned off the area as workers -- some
carrying radiation detectors, others wearing protective suits --
prepared for a floor-to-floor search.
At 8:30 p.m. [22 Feb], Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, said the
tests at both the apartment building and the warehouse were complete
and showed no evidence that anthrax had been produced there. Outside
Mr. Diomande's apartment building, city health officials distributed
fliers saying the residents were not "at risk for anthrax," but
federal officials said they were actively investigating whether any
of the hides were passed along to others.
The warehouse, identified as Pinnacle Storage on a sign, is mostly
used for storage, but parts of several floors have been converted to
recording and art studios and other commercial uses over the past
year or so, according to occupants.
(b) USDA/APHIS:
Officials with the United States Department of Agriculture said no
animals or animal products are allowed into the country from Africa.
Customs officials said agents generally questioned anyone trying to
import animal skins and seized any untanned or partially tanned hides.
Among the animals plagued by anthrax are goats, which are prized for
their skins. When stretched tight, those skins provide the perfect
acoustical top for a drum. And that most pre-modern of instruments is
wildly popular in the most modern of cities, sold on street corners
from London to New York. It is through this bit of commerce, the
authorities now suspect, that the germ was brought to New York in
December 2005, lurking in the hairs of a hide that was carried in a
suitcase through Kennedy International Airport by an unsuspecting
African musician. Now, officials are investigating how that musician,
Vado Diomande, was able to transport infected animal carcasses
thousands of miles without being detected.
Regulations on the importation of animals or animal byproducts from
Africa are clear, said Teresa Howes, a spokeswoman for the United
States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection
Service. "We restrict the importation of animal product from
slaughtered animals, including hides, skins, wool, hair, and bristles
from countries where anthrax infections occur," she said, noting that
she was based in Colorado and not familiar with the details of Mr.
Diomande's case. "African animals and animal byproducts are
prohibited entry into this country entirely."
Judging, however, by even a cursory survey of the brisk trade among
sidewalk vendors, shop owners and Internet vendors in drums made with
African animal skins, it seems to be a difficult ban to enforce.
The agency responsible for regulating the importation of animal
skins, along with the Agriculture Department, is Customs and Border
Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security. "If you're
trying to come into the country and you have animal skins, we're
going to question you about your use of them," said Kelly Klundt, a
spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. The goal, she said, is
to determine whether the goods are illegal and whether they pose any
danger. [Note the FBI comment above.]

[It would seem that Mr. Diomande's good fortune may have resulted
from a prior exposure in 2003. The print version has him having a
skin transplant to his thigh at some point in the Netherlands in
2003. It is not unusual for physicians without prior experience
attending a cutaneous anthrax case to see the grossly inflamed
oedematous lesion as worse than it is and resort to surgery. Left to
themselves and antibiotics, cutaneous lesions do heal well if slowly.
In the weeks to come we will hear much about the official speed or
lack of it in responding to this incident.
Haiti has long been recognised as a source of anthrax-contaminated
goat hides for drums. We can clearly add West Africa to this list of
risky sources. Regardless of what is said, the USDA's major concern
regarding importing raw animal products is not anthrax but serious
contagious diseases such as foot & mouth. Until the industry went
abroad, New England imported enormous volumes of hides, hair, and
wool for processing, with resultant risks to downstream livestock
from the contaminated washwater. Since that industry shut down in the
1960s, anthrax has disappeared from the eastern states. Obviously it
has re-emerged as a metropolitan niche-risk to humans. - Mod.MHJ]
