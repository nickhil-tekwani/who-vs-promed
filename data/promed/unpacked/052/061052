A report commissioned by the Government that recommends the abolition of
anti-rabies quarantine for pets travelling between Britain and the rest of
the EU and some other countries is to be published later this month. As
late as last week, ministry officials were saying there was no chance of
Professor Kennedy's report being published before Parliament returned from
the summer recess in mid-October. Apparently the RSPCA sent a letter to Mr
Brown last week criticising the delay. Peter Davies, the society's
director-general, said thousands of rabies-free animals were being
quarantined unnecessarily.
By yesterday, however, a senior spokesman had changed the official line,
saying the report's findings would be released later this month. The
report, which has been in the hands of the Ministry of Agriculture for some
weeks, was commissioned last October by Mr Brown's predecessor, Jack
Cunningham.
Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, is understood to be sympathetic. The
report, by Ian Kennedy, Professor of Health Law, Ethics and Policy at
University College London, is understood to say that vaccination and
microchip identification of pets could keep rabies out just as effectively
as quarantine.
Publication of the report will be followed by several months of
consultation with interested parties. If he wished, Mr Brown could then
implement its recommendations fairly swiftly simply by amending existing
legislation. Its publication had been expected by the spring or early
summer.
The RSPCA also says that ending quarantine would reduce the number of pets
being smuggled into Britain. Some 9,000 dogs and cats go through Britain's
81 licensed quarantine kennels every year. The animals spend six months in
solitary confinement, to eliminate any risk of cross-contamination, at an
average cost of BPS 1,500. Understandably the strongest opposition to
reform has come from quarantine kennel owners who had invested hundreds of
thousands of pounds in facilities and from some vets who fear controls
based on vaccination would be difficult to enforce.
