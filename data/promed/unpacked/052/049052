[According to the report above, a total of 82 881 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 1 case in the 24 hours since yesterday's (3 May 2020) report. The newly reported case is in Shanghai and is an imported case. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there was 1 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. A total of 1676 imported cases have been identified.

As best as I can tell from the machine-translated report above, there were 15 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, there were no imported cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 947, and 94 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

- Based on recent situations in relation to COVID-19 outbreak and response and discussions in Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters presided by the Prime Minister, the Korean government has decided that Korea will transition into a "distancing in daily life" policy/campaign on [6 May 2020].

- Noting that COVID-19 outbreak is not likely to end within a short period of time and is expected to prolong globally, KCDC asked the public to follow the "5 everyday infection prevention rules for everyone" with a sense of responsibility.
(1) stay home for 3-4 days if you're sick;
(2) keep a distance of 2 arms' length between you and other people;
(3) wash your hands for 30 seconds. Cough/sneeze into your sleeve;
(4) ventilate your space at least twice a day. Disinfect regularly;
(5) keep in touch with family and friends even during physical distancing.

- KCDC also provided 4 supplementary guidance for daily infection prevention (summary below)
(1) mask wearing (proper mask wearing practices/methods)
(2) disinfection (how to disinfect homes/offices)
(3) guidance for the elderly and high-risk population (what to do when leaving home or under stress)
(4) healthy lifestyle habits (regular exercise, regular health checkup, balanced diet, mental health)

- Since facemasks are effective at helping to prevent viral transmission through respiratory droplets, Korea has decided to recommend mask wearing for everyone in any of the following situations:
- people with respiratory symptoms;
- caring for COVID-19 suspected patients;
- visiting hospitals, clinics, pharmacy, or care facilities for the elderly or disabled;
- people whose work environment puts them come in contact with many people;
- using public transit or other indoor spaces that are not well-ventilated and used by many people with possibility of close contact;
- using indoor publicly used venues;
- outdoor environment where it is difficult to keep 2-meter distance from other people.

- KCDC stressed that the new "distancing in daily life" policy should not be interpreted as signalling a return to life before the pandemic but rather as entering a "new normal" in which infection prevention practices become a part of everyday life including social and economic activities for everyone.
- KCDC also noted the possibility that a return to enhanced social distancing may be required if situation becomes worse in the future;
-- KCDC urged everyone to work together to keep COVID-19 away by practicing distancing measures in their everyday life.

Imported cases: 91 (72%)
Contacts of previous confirmed cases: 11 (9%)

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 3 cases and 2 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (3 to 4 May 2020) when there were 8 newly confirmed cases and 2 deaths. A total of 10 804 confirmed cases and 254 deaths were reported today (3 May 2020), up from 10 801 cases and 252 deaths yesterday (2 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 33 consecutive days and below 50 for 26 consecutive days. 16 of the 17 regions did not report any newly confirmed cases; all of the 3 newly confirmed cases were imported cases, including 2 newly confirmed cases in quarantine. While transmission hasn't been interrupted, the move to social distancing helped impact local transmission, so during the past 2 weeks, 71.7% of newly confirmed cases were importation related. As they move to the next phase "Distancing in Daily Life," all eyes will be on the country to see if they can maintain the level of control they have had.

[4] Iran: 98 647 total cases, 6277 deaths

https://www.arabnews.com/node/1669681/middle-east


Iran has reopened mosques in parts of the country deemed at low risk from the novel coronavirus as it announced another 74 deaths from the disease. Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the new fatalities brought to 6277 the total number officially recorded in Iran since it reported its 1st cases in mid-February [2020]. That was a jump in deaths compared with 47 on Sunday, which was the lowest daily count that Iran has recorded in 55 days.

Another 1223 cases of COVID-19 infections were recorded in the past 24 hours, Jahanpour said, raising the total to 98 647.

Mosques were allowed to reopen to worshippers in 132, or around a 3rd, of Iran's administrative divisions which are considered low-risk. The country has started using a color-coded system of "white," "yellow," and "red" for different areas to classify the virus risk. Worshippers have to enter mosques with masks and gloves, can only stay for half an hour during prayer times and must use their personal items, said the health ministry. Mosques must also refrain from offering food and drinks, offer hand sanitizers and disinfect all surfaces, it said in a statement published by ISNA news agency.

According to Jahanpour, 79 397 of those hospitalized with the disease since Iran reported its 1st cases in mid-February [2020] have been discharged, while 2676 are in critical condition. He declared that Iran was among "top 5 countries in the world" with the highest number of recoveries.

[In the 24 hours from 3 to 4 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 97 424 to 98 647, an increase of 1223 compared with 976 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (3 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6203 to 6277, an increase of 74 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 4 May 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening. The past 3 days have seen slight increases in newly confirmed cases from 802 to 976 to 1223.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 212 835, including 69 921 deaths, an increase from 1 188 122 cases and 68 598 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 327 374 (27.0%) cumulative case reports and 3491 (14.1%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 170 534 as of 1:00 PM on 4 May 2020, including 13 536 confirmed deaths and an additional 5373 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2341 -- 9.5% of total), New Jersey (1907 -- 7.7%), California (1230 -- 5.0%), Texas (1034 -- 4.2%), Massachusetts (1000 -- 4.0%), Maryland (946 -- 3.8%), and Pennsylvania (874 -- 3.5%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, New Jersey, Turkey, and Brazil as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Pennsylvania, 18 Belgium, 19 Peru, and 20 India. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between the UK and France (it would be number 5).

The US military has confirmed 7434 cumulative cases, with 289 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 9627 cumulative cases and 298 new cases today (4 May 2020). There have been 2340 cases reported from federal prisons (64 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2373 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (0 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1843 cases (35 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available on the daily update website. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 356 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24 hour period from 2 to 3 May 2020, bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 218 011 [248 301] as compared with 217 466 PCR [247 122] confirmed cases on 2 May 2020 a decrease from 838 change reported in yesterday's update (situation report 94 -- 3 May 2020).

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 50.99, a continual slow decrease over the past 25 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 50.99 today (4 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 218 011 [248 301] cases, approximately 118 889 (54.5%) [47.9%] -- an additional 394 cases have been hospitalized and 10 994 (5.0%) [4.4%] an additional 20 cases were admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to the ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7300349,43. Catalonia, Castile and Leon, and La Rioja are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. Castile and Leon and neighboring La Rioja are located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. - Mod.MPP]

[7] Italy: phase 2 opening explained
Date: Mon 4 May 2020

The gradual easing of Italy's lockdown starts today, [4 May 2020], with the reopening of manufacturing activities taking around 4.4 million workers back out of their homes. It is now possible for everyone to go out to do exercise in Italy's parks, which are reopening, and to visit relatives and "steady" loved ones, and no longer just to do the shopping or for health reasons.

Here is a roundup of which sectors are reopening, which are not and what you can do.
- Manufacturing: the manufacturing and construction sectors are returning to work, along with wholesale retailers linked to the active sectors. According to labour consultants, 4.4 million people are returning to their workplaces.
- Restaurants: bars and restaurants can reopen, but only for takeaway services and home deliveries.
- Retail: retail activities remain suspended apart from those shops already authorised (food, personal hygiene, news agents, pharmacies, tobacconists, bookshops, stores selling clothes for children, those selling flowers and plants, and, very soon, bicycles).
- Visiting relatives: people are also being allowed out to visit relatives and other loved ones, but they will have to wear facemasks and big family gatherings are not permitted. Visits to friends are not allowed.
- No travel outside the region: it is only permitted to move in one's region of residence.
- Second homes: people are not allowed to visit their holiday homes, unless it is for necessary maintenance work, although even in this case, the trip must be within one's region of residence.
- People away from their home town: students and workers who were blocked away from their home towns during the lockdown, can now return to their "domicile, home or residence", but they will not be able to then go back to the region that they set off from.
- Public transport: public transport is one of the key factors for phase 2. The regional governments have the job of making sure services operate while social-distancing rules are respected. There are criteria limiting how many people can be inside a vehicle and it is obligatory to wear facemasks and, in some regions, single-use gloves.
- Parks and physical exercise: parks and public gardens are reopening, but children's play areas are not and distances must be respected. Limitation on doing exercise only "in the vicinity of one's home" has been removed. So it is possible to move, including by car, to reach the area where one wants to go jogging or do exercise.
- Individual sports: training is permitted behind closed doors for individual sports for athletes (professional and amateur) declared of national interest by Italian Olympic Committee CONI. The interior ministry has said that individual training "in public and private spaces" is also allowed for team-sport athletes.
- University: universities can hold exams and sessions for the presentation of degree theses, while respecting social distancing. Laboratories can operate too as well as placement programmes.
- Funerals and cemeteries: funerals are permitted but a maximum of 15 people can attend and facemasks must be worn. It is also possible to visit cemeteries but Masses remain banned for the moment.
