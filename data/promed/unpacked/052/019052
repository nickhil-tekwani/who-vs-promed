PLAGUE: CURRENT WORLD SITUATION

Plague is often regarded as a scourge of medieval times, from which the
world is now largely free. But the latest evidence suggests that incidence
of the disease is on the increase...... cases occur in areas that had
apparently been free from the disease for many decades.

American Public Health Association, 1995, pp. 353-354.
-------
Plague continues to be a threat because of vast areas of persistent wild
rodent infection; contact of wild rodents with domestic rats occurs
frequently in some enzootic areas.
Wild rodent plague exists in the western half of the USA; large areas of
South America; north-central, eastern and southern Africa; central and
Southeast Asia. There are several natural plague foci within the Russian
Federation and Kazakhstan.
While urban plague has been controlled in most of the world, human plague
has occurred recently in:
Africa: (Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Namibia, South Africa,
Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zaire and Libya).
Asia: Plague is endemic in China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Myanmar (Burma),
India and especially in Vietnam, where thousands of cases of bubonic plague,
both urban and rural, with scattered outbreaks of pneumonic plague, were
reported between 1962 and 1972.
Americas: foci in northeastern Brazil and the Andean region (Peru and
Bolivia) continue to produce sporadic cases and occasional outbreaks.
[- Latterly it has appeared in domestic cats in New Mexico, having
spilled over from the local ground rodent reservoir. MHJ]
