Seven people believed to have the Ebola virus disease [EVD] have died in recent days in the 1st deaths reported in the Liberian capital [Monrovia] since the outbreak began, a health official said Tuesday [17 Jun 2014].

Deputy Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah told The Associated Press that brings to 16 the number of people believed to have died from the virus in the West African country; 4 of the deaths were confirmed by tests to be EVD, he said.

The deaths, recorded since 8 Jun 2014, are worrying because no new cases had been confirmed in Liberia in about 2 months. Nyenswah said the new wave of cases was believed to have begun on 30 May [2014]. The ebolavirus, which causes severe bleeding and high fevers, has continued to ravage neighboring Guinea in that time and has spread to Sierra Leone. "The 1st phase of the epidemic was contained," said Nyenswah. "But because of proximity to Guinea and Sierra Leone, we did not declare the outbreak over." Other officials have previously downplayed the significance of the virus jumping borders, saying that it is to be expected since people travel and trade frequently across the borders of the 3 countries.

One of the 7 [recent] deaths was a woman who had recently traveled from an infected area in Sierra Leone and is believed to have passed the disease on to others in the house where she was staying in Monrovia. Fear of the disease, which has no known cure, appears to have helped its spread. There have been several reports of relatives taking sick loved ones out of isolation wards; that makes the work of stopping the disease's spread harder.

The outbreak appears to have begun in neighboring Guinea, where the vast majority of the cases and deaths have been recorded. Amara Jambai of Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health said Tuesday [17 Jun 2014] that the number of confirmed deaths from EVD in his country has risen to 20 in recent days.

The new deaths reported in Liberia and Sierra Leone would push the World Health Organization's death toll for the current outbreak to over 250.

There is no vaccine and no known cure for Ebola, which causes severe bleeding, although proper care can increase the survival rate.

The update as of 16 Jun 2014 is as follows: Cases tested since March 2014 are 193 with 83 laboratory confirmed for Ebola, and 20 confirmed deaths. Total numbers of cases that have survived and been discharged from the Kenema Government hospital are 10. Contact tracing investigation continues.

Taking into consideration the magnitude of the growing case fatalities in the Kailahun district, the Ministry of Health, Line Ministries, and partners have intensified sensitization and health promotion as well as providing adequate manpower resources, Personal Protective Equipment and Universal Precaution Materials, which included masks, gowns, gloves and head gear. Also provided are chlorine, tricycle ambulances, 5000 disposable thermometers, tents, and solar lights at check points erected at strategic crossing points. In a bid to enhance effective communication between security personnel and health officials at check points and the health facilities, mobile phones have been provided per check points for efficient service delivery.

Meanwhile, the Ministry would like to re-emphasize that the erection of check points is not a measure to restrict movement of people but to avert the risk of contacting the Ebola disease and its possible spread from one place to another.

[In Liberia, the presence of cases in the capital, Monrovia, with a population of approximately one million, will complicate contact tracing. In Conakry, which has twice that number population, the Guinean minister of health [said]: "At present, the rate of follow up of contacts identified in the country is 98 per cent for the Guekedou prefecture, 100 per cent for Macenta, and about 68 per cent for Conakry." See ProMED archive (64) below.

In Sierra Leone, the figures have been revised to show 55 more suspected cases, 30 more confirmed, and one additional death. - Mod.JW
