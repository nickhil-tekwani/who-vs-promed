1st focus of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in the Tver region
---------------------------------------------------------
According of orders 268 and 269 issued by the State Veterinary Inspectorate of the Tver oblast, 2 animal farms, one in the village of Kozlovo (Andreopolsky district, map at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Tver-oblast-Andreapol.png) and the other, a cattle breeding center, in the village of Verhanovo (Konakovsky district, map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tver-oblast-Konakovo.png), have been declared as "hotspots" of SBV, a disease which affects cattle, sheep, and goats.

The decision was based upon the test results of cattle serum samples performed by the Federal Centre for Animal Health (State Organization "ARRIAH"). Antibodies to the virus have been identified in 29 samples. All suspect animals were imported into Tver from abroad. Now they are isolated from the main herd; their slaughter is prohibited, the premises have been disinfected.

[The country of origin of the suspected cattle is not mentioned in the report above. The location of Tver oblast, in western Russia, is available at http://tinyurl.com/cj5mvwu; of the Andreopolsky district (within Tver), at http://tinyurl.com/cnwsk4w, and of the Konakovsky district at http://tinyurl.com/bqo275c.

The ban on the slaughter of the animals was probably based upon a decision to follow the fate/health-status of their offspring. It will be interesting to obtain information on the gestation status of the animals upon arrival (from where?) in Russia and the results of the undertaken clinical follow-up. - Mod.AS]

OIE requested to add Schmallenberg virus to the list of notifiable diseases
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A special session of the Intergovernmental Council for Cooperation in the field of veterinary medicine of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] countries has been held in Russia according to Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance]. The meeting was attended by members of the executive committee of the CIS, heads of the veterinary services of CIS countries (10 countries), including Rosselkhoznadzor and the Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of Russia, representatives of the Eurasian Economic Commission, heads and specialists of veterinary biosecurity and associations.

The meeting discussed the epizootic situation on infectious animal diseases in the countries of the CIS. The participants developed an action plan for cooperation, coordination and harmonization of actions aimed at prevention and control of specific dangerous infectious diseases of animals in the CIS.

Special attention was paid to the initiative of the Belarusian delegation regarding the emergence and spread throughout Europe of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] disease and the measures undertaken by countries to prevent its spread. It was decided to send an official letter to the World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties -- OIE) and to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO), requesting the inclusion of SBV disease in the list of infectious animal diseases with mandatory notification to the OIE.

[The OIE will hold its 81st General Session from 26 to 31 May 2013 in Paris, where the mentioned CIS proposal might be discussed.

OIE's criteria for the inclusion of a disease, infection or infestation in the OIE List are laid out in article 1.2.2. of its Terrestrial Animal Health Code, as follows:
"1. International spread of the agent (via live animals, their products or fomites) has been proven.
AND
2. At least one country has demonstrated freedom or impending freedom from the disease, infection or infestation in populations of susceptible animals, based on the animal health surveillance provisions of the Terrestrial Code, in particular those contained in Chapter 1.4.
AND
3.
a. Natural transmission to humans has been proven, and human infection is associated with severe consequences.
OR
b. The disease has been shown to cause significant morbidity or mortality in domestic animals at the level of a country or a zone.
OR
c. The disease has been shown to, or scientific evidence indicates that it would, cause significant morbidity or mortality in wild animal populations.
AND
4. A reliable means of detection and diagnosis exists and a precise case definition is available to clearly identify cases and allow them to be distinguished from other diseases, infections and infestations.
OR
5. The disease or infection is an emerging disease with evidence of zoonotic properties, rapid spread, or significant morbidity or mortality and a case definition is available to clearly identify cases and allow them to be distinguished from other diseases or infections."
(see http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.1.2.htm).

On 7 Mar 2013, the OIE and the government of the Russian Federation, signed an agreement launching a new OIE representation based in the capital city of Moscow. - Mod.AS]
