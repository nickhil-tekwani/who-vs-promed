Anzoategui State Governor, Antonio Barreto Sira said Saturday (computer translated) [14 Aug 2021] there is a salmonella outbreak in the state. He notes 571 cases of salmonellosis are registered in state in northeastern Venezuela, including 2 deaths. According to the epidemiological records of the Anzoatiguense Institute of Health (Saludanz), the disease mainly affects the Simon Bolivar municipality, with 262 cases in the El Carmen parish and 276 in San Cristobal, while in the Sotillo municipality they have diagnosed 23, and 9 in Urbaneja.

The outbreak is attributed to the poor services in the distribution of drinking water throughout the state and especially in the north. "The lack of maintenance and repair of fallen collectors in the capital of this entity, coupled with little or no collection of garbage and solid waste, are causes of this new outbreak," he said.

The governor reported that in response to the notification of cases, specialists in epidemiology and in engineering and sanitary inspection, together with social visitors from Saludanz, activated actions to characterize the outbreak, carry out rapid water sampling in order to check the chlorination and presence of bacteria and other components harmful to health. He also stated that brigades were organized to make house-to-house visits in order to deliver water treatment tablets and offer health education. "In response to the problem, we are seeking medical treatment to avoid the chain of infections, and promote other types of prevention activities such as monitoring and treating tank trucks and drinking water distributors," added Barreto Sira.

[In a previous post from 7 months ago, about 500 people had fallen ill in a _Salmonella_ outbreak in the Venezuelan state. It is not clear if these numbers are additional to those cases and whether the cases are related to a single serotype of _S. enterica_. Likely, multiple serotypes of the pathogen are involved.

Anzoategui State is one of the 23 component states of Venezuela, located in the northeastern region of the country (see map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzo√°tegui). Anzoategui is well known for its beaches that attract many visitors. Its coast consists of a single beach approximately 100 km (62 mi) long. Its capital is the city of Barcelona, and significant cities include Puerto la Cruz and El Tigre. - Mod.LL]
