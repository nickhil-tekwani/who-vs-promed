[A woman's teenage daughter] lay sprawled on a hospital bed, under observation
for avian influenza. In an adjacent room, her haggard husband was sitting
wrapped in a gray blanket, also under treatment for the virus. 2 of her other
children had already died from it. "I don't know exactly why I'm healthy," she
admitted from a cot where she was keeping vigil late last month for her
family. "I don't have a fever, a cough or other symptoms. I really don't know
why not."
In the weeks before the family became sick, the virus raced through their
small flock of chickens. When the last 6 birds developed symptoms, the woman's
husband helped his brother slit their throats beside a large palm in the front
yard. The chickens were plucked and cooked in coconut milk for a family feast.
With 4 cases confirmed or suspected, her family represents one of the largest
clusters of bird flu among humans in the world. It is also notable in sharing
a characteristic with nearly all the other family clusters: Those infected by
the virus were related to each other by blood and not by marriage. This raises
the possibility that genetics play a role in determining who among those
exposed contracts the often-lethal disease.
"It's intriguing," said Sonja J. Olsen of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Bangkok, who has studied family clusters of avian influenza. If
a biological explanation were ultimately proved, she added, "perhaps we could
identify people at genetic risk."
Since H5N1 avian influenza began spreading across Asia in 2003, there have
been 25 recorded family clusters involving confirmed or suspected cases. In
the overwhelming majority, these have involved blood relations such as
siblings, parent and child, children and grandfather, or niece and aunt. In
only 3 instances did both husband and wife test positive.
Worldwide, bird flu has infected at least 165 people and killed 91, according
to the World Health Organization. Health experts warn that the notoriously
changeable influenza virus could develop into a form more easily transmitted
among people and spark a global pandemic.
Outside the isolation ward in Hasan Sadikin hospital, a facility designated to
treat bird flu in Bandung, the capital of West Java province, the young
woman's relatives were camped on the lobby floor, spending nights on thin
woven mats, wondering, like the experts, why she was spared while the rest of
the family fell sick.
"It's a mystery. It's really incomprehensible to us," said the father's
cousin. "Everyone in the family had the same contact with chickens." There is
no evidence that properly cooked poultry or eggs can be a source of infection,
according to the CDC. Most cases of bird flu in humans have resulted from
direct or close contact with infected live or uncooked poultry or surfaces
contaminated with secretions and excretions from infected birds.
The family lives about 100 miles east of Jakarta in the village of Cipedung,
in the modest dwelling of a meatball peddler, with dirt floors, flimsy bamboo
walls and a ramshackle roof that leaks in the rain. Chickens often wandered
inside, sleeping beneath the platform beds. Health investigators have
attributed the outbreak to infected poultry, reporting that avian influenza
has been identified in chickens across much of the village.
2 days after the family killed and ate the infected birds, the 13-year-old
daughter, the 1st to fall sick, began coughing and developed a high fever. By
the time she was taken to a district hospital 6 days later, she was gravely
ill. The medical staff recommended she be moved to a better hospital, but she
died as the ambulance was coming to transport her. The day she died, the young
woman brought their son, 4, to the district hospital after he came down with
the same symptoms. The boy was urgently transferred to the provincial
hospital, but he survived for only 2 days. Another daughter, 14, was next to
become ill, with a slight fever, not enough to keep her out of school. But
health workers urged that she too be admitted to the hospital. Her father
joined her 3 days later after he began complaining of trouble breathing while
overseeing the funeral for another of the children.
Tests confirmed that the 13-year-old girl and the 4-year-old boy died of bird
flu. Initial results were inconclusive for the father and older daughter. But
international health experts said they expected that further testing would
show all 4 had contracted the disease. The father and daughter recovered and
left the hospital 2 weeks ago.
The question of how the mother eluded the virus is part of a puzzle now
stumping global influenza experts. Researchers acknowledge that they know
little about why some people become ill while others, with even greater
exposure to the infection, remain healthy.
For instance, thousands of agricultural workers, officials and soldiers have
been culling poultry across Asia in an effort to contain the spread of bird
flu, at times lacking even basic protection such as gloves, masks and goggles.
Yet according to WHO records, not one has fallen sick. This finding has
reinforced the suspicion that some people are more susceptible than others.
"We've discussed how it's always likely there's some genetic component going
on," Keiji Fukuda, WHO's influenza chief, said in a telephone interview from
Geneva. He cautioned that it was too soon to conclude that there is genetic
susceptibility. Although the family pattern is suggestive, Fukuda said the
size and number of clusters remain small. Moreover, even if research proves
that some people are more susceptible, he said this information may have
little practical benefit if the virus mutates into a form that spreads faster
than people can be tested for genetic risk.
Olsen and other researchers have noted that behavior and not genetics might be
the determining factor in who in a family gets sick. Could the rest of the
family have had more contact with sick chickens than the mother did? That's
doubtful, relatives and local agriculture officials said, reporting that as a
rural homemaker, she was in daily contact with livestock.
Perhaps the 3 children contracted the virus by playing with chickens. Could
they have then passed it to their father but not their mother? Relatives said
the mother was the parent who usually looked after the children and who
carried her ailing son in a sling across her chest for days.
When pressed by a reporter, the mother suggested she was spared because she
did not eat chicken when the rest of the family feasted on the sick birds. She
said she had high blood pressure and avoided meat. But back in the village,
next door to the family's home, her mother-in-law dismissed that
explanation. "Many people ate that chicken. I ate the chicken," recalled [the
mother-in-law], 70, sitting cross-legged on the porch. Beside her in the rain-
soaked yard were the abruptly abandoned reminders of her family: her son's
rickety meatball pushcart and her grandson's plastic tricycle. "The rest of us
didn't get sick," she continued, eyes reddening. "So that can't be the reason."

[On the basis of the predominance of blood relatives (siblings, parent and
child, children and grandfather, or niece and aunt -- rather than husband and
wife -- among those infected in so-called "clusters" of avian influenza virus
infection, it is reasonable to suggest that genetic constitution may play a
role in the susceptibility and resistance of individuals to infection.
However, the numbers are small and other factors such as age, nature of
exposure, and behavior cannot be discounted. A compounding factor is that
there is little published information on the immune status of the population
in the affected communities. The observation that none of those employed in
commercial poultry operations and in the culling of diseased fowl have been
victims of H5N1 avian influenza may indicate that asymptomatic infection and
development of immunity is widespread. Also the predominance of children and
younger people among the victims of infection could indicate protection of
older people by development of immune responses. Comprehensive data on
seroprevalence are still lacking. - Mod.CP]
