Variant CJD Cases on the Increase
--------------------------------
Scientists have reported a sharp increase in the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail - the human form of "mad cow disease." They also say that
people living in the north of England and Scotland are more than twice as
likely to get the disease as those in the south. The disease has now
claimed the lives of more than 100 people in the UK, and scientists say its
incidence increased by 20% last year. Estimates of the final total of cases
expected in the UK range from a few hundred to 140 000. There have been 15
confirmed cases so far this year, according to Department of Health figures.
Professor James Ironside, of the vCJD Surveillance Unit at Edinburgh
University, told BBC Radio 4's Today program on Wed 5 Sep 2001 that it was
difficult to tell how the disease would grow in the future. "Because of the
uncertainties associated with the disease, the unknown incubation period,
genetic factors that are probably associated with different susceptibility
-- modelling the future is very difficult," he said. He also said there was
no clear explanation why people in the north should be more susceptible to
the disease. One possibility was that genetic factors meant people in the
north were more susceptible to the disease. Another, which Professor
Ironside thought was more likely, was that northerners have had more
exposure to the disease, because they were more likely to have eaten more
pies and burgers containing low-grade meat. It is impossible to check this
theory unless the food industry reveals which of its products contained
low-grade meat.
The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) has spent 5 years
asking food companies how much "mechanically recovered meat" (MRM) was used
in the past, as they believe this type carries the most risk of passing on
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). MRM is meat residue which is left
on the carcass after all the prime cuts have been removed. However, SEAC
says it has been "continually thwarted" in its efforts to extract
information from the industry. Last month the Food Standards Agency (FSA)
launched a new investigation to try to extract information from the
industry. But Bill Jermey, President of the Meat Manufacturers'
Association, told the BBC that while they wished to cooperate, information
on where exactly MRM had been supplied was not available.

remains in the doldrums. - Mod.CP
