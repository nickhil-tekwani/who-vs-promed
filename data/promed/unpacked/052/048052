Killer virus could wipe out species
-----------------------------------
Frogs could be wiped out by a deadly disease
sweeping the UK, wildlife experts warned
yesterday. Millions [of frogs] have died over
the summer from Red Leg and the species is now
facing extinction.
Sores erupt along frogs' legs, and limbs are lost
before the amphibians die, but scientists know
little else about the virus.
Although Red Leg has existed in Britain for many
years, it has now reached "crisis levels". It is
feared the disease has not yet reached its peak
and if unchecked could totally kill off the
species, says nature group Froglife.
Director of conservation Tom Langton said frogs
were the "hub" of the food chain. And he warned
that predators such as foxes, stoats and
buzzards, which rely on them as a food source,
would suffer.
He said: "We are staring into an abyss. This
could devastate our amphibians and once a
critical species like a frog disappears, then the
environmental impact has only just begun. It's a
waiting game, either they will bounce back or
face extinction -- we just don't know."
Froglife has urged the Government to fund a
nationwide survey to find out how many of the
creatures have been lost.
If the disease is caught early it can be treated,
but after several days of infection the mortality
rate is 90 percent. But the Environment Agency
said: "All we can do is take samples and confirm
the disease but if it occurs naturally there is
little we can do."
There is no evidence Red Leg can spread to humans or pets.

[The etiology of the frog pestilence was explained in our previous posting
(see ref. below) by Mod.PC as follows:

"The virus implicated in this outbreak is a member of the genus _Ranavirus_
of the family _Iridoviridae_. Iridoviruses are large complex viruses
possessing a large double-stranded DNA genome, which infect a variety of
hosts. Iridoviruses have only been isolated from poikilothermic [cold-
blooded] animals, usually those inhabiting damp or aquatic environments,
including marine habitats. None are known to infect warm-blooded vertebrates".
An explanation of the term "Red legs" in the
above news item may be found in the following
abstract of the paper by the Veterinary Science
Group, Institute of Zoology, London, U.K.:
Cunningham AA, Langton TE, Bennett PM, Lewin JF,
Drury SE, Gough RE, Macgregor SK. (1996).
Pathological and microbiological findings from
incidents of unusual mortality of the common frog
(Rana temporaria).Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol
Sci., 351(1347):1539-57.
"In 1992 we began an investigation into incidents
of unusual and mass mortalities of the common
frog (_Rana temporaria_) in Britain which were
being reported unsolicited to us in increasing
numbers by members of the public. Investigations
conducted at 10 sites of unusual mortality
resulted in 2 main disease syndromes being found:
one characterized by skin ulceration and one
characterized by systemic haemorrhages. However,
frogs also were found with lesions common to both
of these syndromes and microscopic skin lesions
common to both syndromes were seen. The bacterium
_Aeromonas hydrophila_, which has been described
previously as causing similar lesions, was
isolated significantly more frequently from
haemorrhagic frogs than from those with skin
ulceration only. However, as many of the latter
were euthanased, this may have been due to
differences in post mortem bacterial invasion.
An iridovirus-like particle has been identified on
electron microscopical examination of skin
lesions from frogs with each syndrome and
iridovirus-like inclusions have been detected in
the livers of frogs with systemic haemorrhages.
Also, an adenovirus-like particle has been
cultured from one haemorrhagic frog.
A poxvirus-like particle described previously from
diseased frogs has now been found also in control
animals and has been identified as a melanosome.

Both the prevalence of the iridovirus-like
particle and its association with lesions
indicate that it may be implicated in the
aetiology of the disease syndromes observed.
Specifically, we hypothesize that primary
iridovirus infection, with or without secondary
infection with opportunistic pathogens such as
_A. hydrophila_, may cause natural outbreaks of
'red-leg', a disease considered previously to be
due to bacterial infection only". - Mod.AS]
