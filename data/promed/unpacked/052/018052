A fatal salmonella outbreak across the British Isles that has infected
90 people may be linked to sandwiches sold by the Subway sandwich
chain. Laboratory tests have shown a link between cases of illness and
one of the US chain's ingredient suppliers. Cooked beef, chicken, and
bacon have been impounded at Dawn Farm Foods in County Kildare, Ireland.

As a precaution, Subway has removed batches of its Philly Style Steak
and Chicken Fajita sandwiches from its 1250 shops in the UK and
Ireland. Other sandwich shops may also have bought the potentially
contaminated meat.

The discovery could end the mystery of what had caused the outbreak
of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona. The average age of victims
has been 29 but a one-year-old baby has also fallen victim to the
bug. Salmonellosis was a contributory factor in the death of a woman
in her 70s at Royal Liverpool University Hospital as well.

Salmonella is usually contracted from contaminated meat, which has
not been cooked at a sufficiently high temperature. Inquiries by the
Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) centre on the heat treatment
applied at the Irish plant.

In an apparent breakthrough in the inquiry into the outbreak, the FSAI
said: "Whilst the investigation continues to seek to establish the
exact source of the outbreak, laboratory testing of foods is providing
evidence of a possible link with Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, Naas, County
Kildare [Ireland] and some of its products. Information gathered by
the FSAI suggests that a potentially contaminated beef product was
supplied to the Subway chain of food outlets and the FSAI has received
assurance from Subway that this product has been removed from sale. In
light of this, as a precautionary measure in the interests of public
health, all products processed on the same production line as this
beef product at Dawn Farm Foods are being withdrawn."

In a statement, Subway confirmed that Dawn Farm Foods was one of its
ingredients suppliers and the possible link with the ongoing
investigation into the salmonella outbreak. It stressed that no other
products were affected and that it had found alternative suppliers.

[It will be interesting to know how many of the 90 reported cases are
linked to Subway. It is likely that other retailers may also be found
to have the implicated food vehicle. - Mod.LL]
