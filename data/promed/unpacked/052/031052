Anthrax reported in the Orenburg region
-----------------------------------------------
A case of anthrax has been reported in a domestic pig in the Orenburg
region. A message about a suspected case of anthrax on a private farm
in the village of Kuzminovka in the Grachevskiy district in the
Orenburg region was received by the Central Administrative Board in
the Ministry of Extreme Situations of Russia in the Orenburg area. On
the same day, compulsory slaughter of the pig was carried out in
connection with clinical symptoms of disease in the animal.
Bacteriological confirmation of anthrax was received on 11 Mar 2007.
The complex restrictive-administrative and anti-epizootic measures
are in place on the farm. Quarantine has been declared in the
Grachevskiy District until 25 Mar 2007, and round-the-clock
protection and a sanitary-epidemic processing post were established.
15 veterinary service staff, 4 employees of the Department of
Internal Affairs, and 5 units of special technicians are involved in
disinfecting the site. The pig farm premise has been burnt [sic]. 39
pigs and 4 sheep have been vaccinated; the animals were isolated, and
now they are under supervision by the veterinary service. All those
involved on the farm are under medical supervision, according to the
press-service of the Ministry of Extreme Situations of Orenburg.

[Anthrax in the Orenburg region is reported frequently enough. The
inhabitants of the village Istemas of Dombarovskiy district of this
region felt ill with anthrax in the summer 2006 after processing the
carcass of a sheep that died from anthrax. In the same village in
2004, some infected cattle were slaughtered and butchered, and the
infected meat was sold in the nearby city of Orsk, resulting in 8
villagers becoming ill as well as 2 market porters in Orsk, with one
death.
The Orenburg region is in the foothills of the Southern Ural
mountains. It borders Kazakhstan in the south, the Samara region in
the west and northwest, and the Republic of Bashkortostan and the
Chelyabinsk region in the north. The total area is 124 000 sq. km.
The population is 2 150 000 inhabitants (2005 census). The capital
city of the region is Orenburg. - Mod.NP]
[Pigs frequently suffer from oropharyngeal anthrax, so once seen, it
is easy to diagnose a 2nd time. On the other hand, they are usually
infected from either contaminated feed or from being fed parts from
an infected carcass, such as viscera. So there may well be a bigger
problem than this ministerial news release would indicate. I hope
that the burning did not involve the farm but just the carcass.
To find Orenburg go to:

It is in south-central Russia and lies along the Kazakhstan northern
border. - Mod.MHJ]
