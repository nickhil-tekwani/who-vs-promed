A 36-year-old Navajo police officer diagnosed with the hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome Monday morning [22 May 2000 is currently in critical condition at
University Hospital in Albuquerque [New Mexico.
Hantavirus* is spread through exposure to the infected urine, saliva and
feces of rodents. It is spread by inhaling fumes and dust from the infected
droppings and not through person-to-person contact [at least in N. America
- Mod.JW. Symptoms of fever, muscle aches, and possibly chills, nausea,
headache, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough develop within 1 to
6 weeks after rodent exposure. People who have these symptoms should seek
medical treatment immediately.
The police department's buildings have been inspected for [rodent
droppings, sanitized, and decontaminated.
Ralph Fulgham, with Indian Health Service environmental health, said that
the officer had been admitted to Gallup Indian Medical Center over the
weekend and was transferred to Albuquerque on Sunday. For two weeks prior
to symptoms the officer had been in training in Phoenix [Arizona. Fulgham
said it was not very likely the man contracted the virus there, but it is
one of the possibilities being investigated along with other places he had
been.
There is no cure for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, but chances for
recovery are better if it is diagnosed early. People are urged to take
steps to avoid contact with deer mice and other rodents.
This is the second confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year. In
April, a 38-year-old woman near Bloomfield was the first case confirmed.
She recovered shortly thereafter.

*[The media tend to use the word "hantavirus" as if there was only one
type. In fact, there are almost as many as there are different species of
rodent host. The type found in Navajo country is most probably the Sin
Nombre strain, carried by the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_. - Mod.JW
