The condition in bats that is labeled 'white-nose syndrome' was first
noted among dead and hibernating bats within several caves near
Albany, New York in February 2007. During the late winter/early
spring of 2007, observation of bats with a white substance on their
noses was also accompanied by a bat die-off, with an estimated 90
percent mortality in one affected hibernaculum.

This winter [2007-2008], although substantial bat mortality has not
occurred, bat researchers have identified bats presenting with white
noses at hibernaculae in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts. A
coordinated effort involving both state and Federal laboratories to
conduct postmortem evaluations of bats from sites harboring bats
presenting with white noses has been established.

Thus far, euthanized bats with and without white noses from affected
and unaffected sites have been examined, and laboratories are
standing by to receive additional specimens as mortalities occur. The
most noteworthy finding to date has been the poor body condition of
many of the bats examined -- they had little or no subcutaneous white
fat stores.

A primary etiological agent has not been identified, and
investigations of underlying environmental factors in conjunction
with potential secondary microbial pathogens or toxicants are
underway. Molecular based pathogen screening and analyses for
metabolic problems are also being pursued. Following is a brief
summary of laboratory and histological findings to date.

Bacteriology and mycology
-------------------------
Extensive culturing of skin and internal organs was conducted at both
room temperature and at 37 deg C (98.6 deg F). Room temperature
incubation yielded many more isolates than warm incubation. Numerous
bacterial and fungal isolates were cultured, especially from skin
samples, with little consistency from bat to bat. The majority of the
bacterial isolates are slow-growing, non-fermenters, and both
bacterial and fungal isolates are representative of the microflora
likely present in a moist cave environment.

Virology
--------
Culture analyses of numerous internal organs using vero cells and
bat-derived kidney and pulmonary cell-lines have not yielded
cytopathic effects nor have they yielded viral isolates.

Parasitology
------------
Some endoparasites (such as, intestinal trematodes, cysts in one
bat's kidneys) and ectoparasites have been observed. The parasites do
not seem to be eliciting any immune or pathological response.

Histology
---------
A subset of the bats examined exhibited a mild to moderate,
non-specific pneumonia. Microscopically, fungal hyphae were seen on
the external surfaces of the majority of bats examined, even when
fungal colonization was not grossly evident. Although in some cases,
fungi did invade into the dermis and sebaceous units of the skin, and
inflammatory response was minimal. The white fungal growth observed
on bats may represent an overgrowth of normal fungal colonizers of
bat skin and be an indicator of overall poor health, rather than a
primary pathogen.

[We appreciate the group providing us with a detailed report of their
findings thus far in the investigation. We look forward to other
results and hopefully a solution to stop the die-off. - Mod.TG]
