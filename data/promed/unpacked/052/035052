Ten deaths and 1751 rabies cases [see comment below] were caused by
stray dogs that were widespread throughout Dhamar governorate in
2010, said Mohammed Siylan, Rabies Programme Coordinator in Dhamar.
"1273 of those cases are males and 478 females," he added.

Siylan noted that this increasing number of rabies cases is due to an
increased number of stray dogs in the streets. "There is no more
treatment of this serious problem that threatens our families and
children," he said.

Children are the most affected group by these dogs [with] 854 rabies
cases and 4 deaths, according to statistics from the Rabies Program
[of] the Health Ministry. The problem is growing and a cause of
concern. "Many people [have died as a result of bites by
rabies-infected dogs]," he added. People have stopped walking at
night in streets and alleys fearing [attack by] the stray dogs roaming freely.

The programme receives dozens of people every day from outside the
province (such as the cities of Rada'a, Yarim, Al-Naderah, Bani Omar,
Al-Arsh) to receive [post-exposure vaccination and anti-rabies
immunoglobulin treatment].

According to Siylan, animals with rabies may act differently from
healthy animals. "Wild animals may move slowly or may act as if they
are tame. A pet that is usually friendly may snap at a person or try to bite."

Some signs of rabies in animals are: changes in an animal's behavior,
general sickness, problems swallowing, increased drooling, and
aggression. Rabies will kill if it is not treated. Once signs of the
disease appear in an animal or in a human, they usually die within 10
days. It is possible to get anti-rabies shots to fight off the disease.

[The text does not clearly indicate whether the number of cases
indicates the number of people receiving post-exposure prophylactic
treatment or simply the number of people bitten by stray dogs
presumed to be rabid. Whatever the meaning, the number of fatalities
in Dhamar province is alarming.

A map of the administrative districts of Yemen showing the location
of Dhamar governorate can be accessed at

Dhamar lies in the central highlands of Yemen, south-southeast of the
capital Sana'a, a region likely to lack resources and adequate
veterinary surveillance to undertake vaccination of the canine
population. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Yemen is
