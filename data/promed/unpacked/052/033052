[3] USA: Kansas prison outbreak
Date: Tue 21 Apr 2020 10:53 a.m. CDT
Source: 13WIBW [edited]
https://bit.ly/2KpZlWr


The coronavirus has arrived at a 3rd Kansas correctional facility as the state's largest prison outbreak grew to include nearly 90 positive cases.

Kansas Department of Corrections Secretary Jeff Zmuda said in a news release that one staff member tested positive Monday [20 Apr 2020] at the Topeka Correctional Facility, which is the state's only all-female prison with a capacity of 948. Health officials are conducting contact tracing to determine who has been in close contact with the worker.

The largest outbreak is at the Lansing Correction Facility, where 47 staff and 40 inmates are infected. An inmate at a work-release facility in Wichita also tested positive, prompting corrections officials to move 113 prisoners earlier this month [April 2020] to Lansing, where they are being quarantined.

With advocacy groups demanding action, Gov. Laura Kelly has said efforts are underway to identify inmates who are close to finishing their sentences and can be released.

Statewide, confirmed coronavirus cases increased Monday [20 Apr 2020] by 137 to 1986. The number of deaths increased by 8 to 100.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within 3 weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death.

[4] WHO situation report 93 (as of 22 Apr 2020)
Date: Wed 22 Apr 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200422-sitrep-93-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=35cf80d7_4


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 22 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- WHO is deeply saddened at the death of a member of personnel during a security incident in Rakhine district of Myanmar, who was transporting COVID-19 surveillance samples in support of the Ministry of Health and Sports. WHO condemns targeting of health workers involved in the COVID-19 response.

- As of 22 Apr [2020], Japan changed the method of reporting deaths, which now includes both the number of (i) deceased cases with complete data matching and verification; and (ii) deceased cases whose data matching and verification are in progress. The notable increase in the number of deaths reported from Japan can be attributed to this change.

- A WHO mission to Belarus has recommended the introduction of community-wide steps to increase physical distancing. More information is available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/belarus/news/news/2020/4/who-expert-mission-to-belarus-recommends-physical-distancing-measures-as-covid-19-virus-transmits-in-the-community.

- OpenWHO has launched a new online course on Standard precautions: Hand hygiene (https://openwho.org/courses/IPC-HH-en). The module has been prepared to help summarize the WHO guidelines on hand hygiene, associated tools, and ideas for effective implementation. To date, there has been more than 1.5 million enrolments in the platform's courses to support the COVID-19 response.

- The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) was launched at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, specifically for infodemic management. For updates and more information, see "Subject in Focus: Infodemic management: the right information at the right time" [at the source URL].

- WHO issued guidance on safe Ramadan practices in the context of COVID-19, which is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian, and Spanish (see "subject in focus" below).

Subject in focus: safe Ramadan practices in the context of the COVID-19
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramadan is the 9th month of the Islamic calendar and is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting from sunrise to sunset, prayer, and reflection. It is marked by numerous religious and social gatherings, as families and friends unite to break their fast together, after sunset during iftar or before dawn during suhour. As this year [2020] Ramadan is expected to start on 23 Apr and end on 23 May [2020], thus falling during the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, WHO has issued dedicated guidance on safe Ramadan practices in the context of COVID-19. The purpose is to provide advice on gatherings occurring during the month of Ramadan, or immediately preceding and following it. Guidance was released on 15 Apr [2020] and is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian, and Spanish (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331767). The document is addressed to national health authorities with the aim of facilitating their role in establishing policies for events. Early involvement of religious leaders in the decision-making process is also recommended, so that they may disseminate information to the faithful community. In general, a strong communication strategy should ensure that decisions taken are explained to all those concerned in a timely and consistent manner.

As a 1st step, WHO recommends that decisions to restrict, modify, postpone, cancel, or proceed with holding a mass gathering during Ramadan should be based on a rigorous and standardized assessment of the risks associated with such events in terms of contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Detailed guidance on risk-assessment protocols is included in Practical considerations and recommendations for Religious Leaders and Faith-based Communities in the context of COVID-19, with a risk-assessment tool and decision tree [links at source URL]. Cancelling in-person events and holding them virtually, using platforms such as television, radio, and digital and social media is therefore an option to be considered, especially if risk of transmission is significant.

The decision-making process can be facilitated by some overarching considerations related to physical distancing. For example, a distance of at least 1 m (3 ft) between people should be strictly maintained at all times during the event. People who are feeling unwell or have any symptoms of COVID-19, -as they may transmit the infection, and older people and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions, as they have higher likelihood of developing severe illness, should be discouraged from attending. If it is decided that physical gatherings shall go ahead, WHO recommends that mitigation measures be applied to further decrease risk of COVID-19 transmission during the planned event. Mitigation measures include improving the venue's facilities and arrangements (e.g., holding the event outdoors rather than indoors, or ensuring adequate ventilation), encouraging healthy practices by attendees (e.g., handwashing or taking safety steps in mosques, such as using personal prayer rugs), and ensuring that premises and often-touched objects are thoroughly and regularly cleaned. The document also provides recommendations tailored to many social activities typical of Ramadan, such as the practice of charity (sadaqat or zakah), or the traditional iftar banquets, suggesting ways to safely live fully in the spirit of Ramadan as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Additional considerations pertaining to fasting, physical activity, healthy diet and nutrition, and tobacco use, as well as to mental and psycho-social health and response to domestic violence, are also proposed with the aim of clarifying misconceptions, and providing advice that may help make the most out of the holy month of Ramadan and its myriad of celebrations.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 32 172 new cases (43.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 2089 deaths (34.5% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases, 79.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada at 6.2% and Brazil at 6.0%.

The European region reported 32 302 new cases (43.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 3618 deaths (59.7%) of the global newly reported deaths).

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4879 new cases (6.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 141 deaths (2.3% of the global newly reported deaths).

The African region reported 560 new cases (0.76% of the global newly reported cases) and 16 deaths (0.3% of the global newly reported deaths).

The Western Pacific region reported 1765 new cases (2.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 108 deaths (1.8% of the global newly reported deaths).

The South East Asia region reported 2242 new cases (3.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 86 deaths (1.4% of the global newly reported deaths).

Figure 4. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through [22 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and has rebounded today [22 Apr 2020] with the European region increasing following the weekend. The America's region does not appear to have decreased. One sees a gradual increase in the number of cases from the Africa Region. One wonders if the cases globally may have peaked near 6 Apr 2020. Time will tell.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA
