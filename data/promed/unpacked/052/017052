ProMED-mail, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, is seeking highly qualified individuals to fill part-time positions of Infectious Disease Moderator, covering human and/or animal diseases for the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) regional network that is under development. The individual will join an international team of over 40 global health specialists located in 25 countries.

Key Responsibilities and Duties:

Reporting:
1. Review email at least twice daily, morning and afternoon/evening, Sunday through Thursday, and at least once a day during weekends and holidays.
2. Actively and regularly search the Internet -- including the web, local media, disease outbreak sources of information (e.g. HealthMap), social media platforms, and relevant blogs -- for reports of outbreaks of "emerging infectious diseases" in your region.
3. Using an online dashboard tool, post relevant reports of events of interest in human/animal health to the MENA region with appropriate commentary in a timely manner (less than 24 hours). Reports should include short, knowledgeable, appropriate contextual commentaries with background information.

Subscriptions:
4. Find relevant regional and national email lists and websites of universities and professional societies to which you can post an invitation to subscribe to ProMED-MENA.
5. Assist in recruitment of new subscribers and outreach at local and regional professional conferences and meetings.
6. Respond to requests from subscribers.

Inter- and Intra- staff:
7. Assist in training of new staff.
8. Attend periodic meetings (annual or biannual) of ProMED staff.
9. Report to the ProMED Project Manager and Deputy Editor an informal monthly report and a formal quarterly report of your activities, specifying the number of outbreak items you've found in your region, the number of ProMED-MENA messages you moderated, and the number of invitations to join ProMED-MENA you forwarded to relevant individuals or lists, plus any other information you believe to be of interest to ProMED-MENA.
10. Set a regular schedule with the Regional Moderator and ProMED Deputy Editor and notify him/her in advance of any expected absence from moderation duties.
11. Contact the Regional Moderator with any questions or suggestions for improving ProMED-MENA.

Qualifications:

1. An advanced degree in the human/animal health field required (MD, MBBS, DVM, PhD in microbiology or similar field), additional advanced degree in a related field preferred (MPH or participation in an international Field Epidemiology Training Program) a plus.
2. Five or more years of experience in human or animal infectious diseases, specifically in diagnosis, treatment, and/or research.
3. A track record of achievement in academic, governmental or nongovernmental organization commensurate with career stage.
4. Ability and interest in maintaining expertise in infectious diseases through continuing education.
5. Email and World Wide Web proficiency and daily access.
6. Familiarity with ProMED archives.
7. Native fluency in written and spoken Arabic with a good working knowledge of written and spoken English. Knowledge of French is preferred but not required.
