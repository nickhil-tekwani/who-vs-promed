Update: Rashes Among Schoolchildren --- 27 States, 4 Oct 2001-- 3 Jun 2002
----------------------------------------
Since October 2001, a total of 27 states have reported investigations of
multiple groups of schoolchildren who have developed rashes. Rash illnesses
among schoolchildren in 14 states were reported in March (1); since the
initial report, rashes have been reported in 13 additional states (Alabama,
Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, and New Jersey). Rashes also have been
reported among schoolchildren in Canada. The investigations have not
identified a common source for the reported cases of rashes among U.S.
schoolchildren. This report summarizes available data on these rashes and
provides examples for 3 states. CDC is continuing to monitor reports of
rashes and is providing technical assistance to state and local health
departments investigating these reports.
United States
Although rashes among schoolchildren are common, public concern has been
growing because of the number of simultaneous cases reported in schools
across the United States. During October 2001--May 2002, rashes among
groups of students were reported in approximately 110 U.S. elementary,
middle, and high schools. The number of students affected in each school
ranged from five to 274; the proportion of students affected ranged from <1
percent to 47 percent. The sex distribution of cases varied among the
schools, ranging from 33 percent to 100 percent female. Rashes varied by
presentation, location on the body, and duration. Most affected children
were reported as having 1) a pruritic, sunburn-like rash that appeared on
the cheeks and arms, 2) a burning sensation on the skin that might be
associated with pruritis, or 3) a hive- or nettle-like reaction that was
observed moving from one part of the body to another. Rashes tended to be
self-limiting and ranged in duration from <1 hour to >1 month. Because of
the transient nature of the rashes, most children who were evaluated were
seen by school nurses; some children who had recurring or persistent rashes
were seen by dermatologists. Accompanying signs and symptoms such as
conjunctivitis, fever, vomiting, sore throat, or headaches were absent in
all but a few cases. The etiology of the rash illnesses remains unknown in
several states. Alaska, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, and New
York have received reports of cases associated with parvovirus B19, and
other states have investigated small reports of rash illness that appear to
be primarily psychogenic in response to a child with a diagnosed rash or
infection.
Case Reports
New York. On 8 Mar 2002, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH)
sent a notice to local health units and school superintendents across the
state to increase awareness and reporting of outbreaks of rash illness. At
the time, NYSDOH and a county health department were following an ongoing
outbreak of rash illness, which began in January and by 2 Apr 2002 involved
242 (7 percent) elementary- and middle-school students in a school district
with 3371 children. No fevers or other major signs and symptoms were
reported to accompany the rashes, and no rash illness was reported among
employees in affected schools. To assess the outbreak, school nurses
selected a sample of affected students with active rashes from 5 elementary
schools and one middle school; 17 children with rashes were interviewed on
2 Apr 2002 and evaluated by a team of health-care providers by physical
examination, serology for parvovirus B19, and viral cultures of throat and
stool specimens. Dates of rash onset for these 17 children ranged from 11
Mar to 1 Apr 2002. Of the 17 children interviewed, 12 (71 percent) were
females. The ages of the students ranged from 5--13 years (mean: 9 years).
A total of 5 (29 percent) children reported having had symptoms (e.g.,
fatigue, stuffy nose, and sore throat) that occurred within 4 days before
rash onset. Of 6 (35 percent) children who reported that another family
member had a rash, 4 (67 percent) had family members whose rashes occurred
before the child's rash onset, and 2 (33 percent) had family members whose
onset followed the child's rash. A total of 15 (88 percent) children
reported their rashes to be itchy; of these, 9 (60 percent) children
reported no association with time of day or place. Of the 17 children that
were interviewed, 3 (18 percent) reported having a low-grade fever (i.e.,
<100.3 degrees F [37.9 degrees C]) , 9 (53 percent) children reported that
the rashes were warm to the touch, 8 (47 percent) children associated the
rashes with a burning sensation, and 13 (77 percent) children reported that
the rashes reappeared; information for one child was not recorded. A total
of 5 (29 percent) children had rashes that began on the face and 9 (53
percent) children rashes that began on the extremities or stomach before
spreading; 2 (12 percent) children had rashes that did not spread. On
examination, health-care providers described the rashes as maculopapular in
13 (77 percent) cases, lacy and reticular in 14 (82 percent) cases, and
morbilliform in 6 (35 percent) cases. All 17 children submitted specimens
for viral studies; 16 (94 percent) had negative viral throat cultures, and
one was positive for influenza A. Stool specimens were submitted by 9
children; all were negative on viral culture. Human parvovirus B19 antibody
assays were performed on 14 children; 13 (93 percent) were positive for IgM
antibodies, and 14 (100 percent) were positive for IgG antibodies. The
results of this investigation support the conclusion that the outbreak was
due to parvovirus B19, which causes erythema infectiosum (i.e., fifth disease).
Georgia. During January, the Georgia Division of Public Health received a
report that 12 students from an elementary school had developed pruritic
rashes in a single day; 10 children were in the same class. Dermatologists
who examined all 12 children diagnosed the rashes as contact dermatitis.
The rashes resolved by the next day, and no additional cases occurred. The
school cleaned the classroom on the day the rashes occurred, including
vacuuming the carpet, washing table tops, and wet dusting all surfaces. The
school nurse determined that the pruritic rashes were the only sign or
symptom; one child had a history of a preceding illness (a cold the
previous week). The onset of rash illnesses began after one child developed
a pruritic eczematic rash on one arm. After several minutes, a second child
complained that her arm was itching; within the hour, 8 children seated at
the same table also were scratching their arms and complaining about
rashes. A child from another classroom reported a pruritic rash after
sitting with the other children at lunch; another child, also from another
class, reported a rash after seeing the index child in the school clinic.
Although environmental or allergic exposure cannot be ruled out, the school
nurse's description suggests that all the rashes (with the exception of the
index case) were caused by scratching secondary to observing, encountering,
or interacting with the child with the eczematic rash.
Missouri. During 5 Feb--19 Mar 2002, a total of 33 (21 percent) students
with rash illness was reported in a rural elementary school with 161
students; 12 (36 percent) of the 33 affected students sought medical care.
The illnesses were mild and lasted a median of 4 days (range: 6 hours--14
days). Of the 71 children in kindergarten through fourth grade, 25 (35
percent) were affected. Most affected students had rashes limited to the
hands and forearms, but 5 (15 percent) children had rashes that were
generalized or involved the face; 5 (15 percent) children had pruritic
rashes. Dates of rash onset were 19 Feb 2002 for 6 cases and 28 Feb 2002
for 12 cases; these 18 cases accounted for 55 percent of cases among
students. However, single cases continued to be reported as late as 19 Mar
2002. Of the 33 cases reported, 23 (70 percent) occurred among girls. Aside
from 2 siblings developed rashes 4 days apart; no other rashes among family
members were reported to the school nurse. Contact dermatitis was the most
likely explanation for most cases, possibly from frequent use of hand
cleaners and alcohol-based sanitizers or from surfaces cleaned with
ammonia-based products. Other possible etiologies offered by clinicians for
these rashes included scabies, dry skin, and parvovirus B19 infection;
however, none of these diagnoses was confirmed.
Public Health Response
Despite public perceptions that all rash cases are inter-related, even in a
single school, children's rashes can result from a variety of etiologies,
including medications, dry or sensitive skin, eczema, allergies, viral
infections, and psychogenic or environmental factors. Investigations have
identified cases for some of the rashes reported. In other cases, the
etiology remains unknown.
CDC is continuing to monitor reports of groups of schoolchildren with
rashes and is providing technical assistance to state and local health
departments investigating these reports. In addition, CDC is receiving
public inquiries from adults (with or without exposure to children) who
suspect they might have a related rash. These public inquiries are
forwarded to state or local health departments for follow-up.
Editorial Note:
-----------
Rashes reported in schools have affected school policies and practices.
Normal school operations were disrupted when students were moved or
evacuated from their classrooms, and the costs of conducting environmental
assessments have added a financial burden. In the absence of an
identifiable etiology for the rashes, many school administrators and board
members had to consider whether short-term school closures were warranted
and to decide if children with rashes should be excluded from school or if
children without rashes should be permitted to stay home from school.
Schools that identify groups of students and/or staff with rashes should
report cases to their state or local health department to determine what
kind of investigation should be conducted to ensure that no identifiable
hazards exist within the school setting. To assist with these efforts, CDC
has developed and distributed to health departments a document with
suggested approaches for investigating reports of rashes among groups of
schoolchildren. In particular, efforts should be made to 1) collect uniform
information from affected persons so cases of rashes reportedly associated
with school settings can be differentiated from rashes occurring from other
causes; 2) monitor reported cases to ensure that the rashes have resolved;
3) determine whether similar rashes are occurring among household members
who have not been exposed to the school setting; and 4) confirm that no
other associated signs and symptoms are occurring or developing subsequent
to the rashes.
At least 5 challenges might impede the investigation of reported rashes
among schoolchildren and the identification of the underlying causes.
First, school mechanisms for reporting and tracking students' health vary.
Second, because many rashes are of short duration, health-care providers
other than school nurses usually do not observe them. Third, parents and
health-care providers might be reluctant to collect biologic specimens that
would assist with determining an infectious etiology from otherwise healthy
children. Fourth, the logistics of organizing an environmental assessment
can delay collection of timely and complete information. Finally,
inconclusive and possibly misleading data might be collected if a
methodical environmental sampling plan is not followed (2).
When accompanied by other signs and symptoms, rashes can be an important
indicator of serious health conditions; however, few schoolchildren with
rashes had any accompanying signs and symptoms. The level of parental
concern and media attention elicited by reports of rashes among
schoolchildren underscores the need for continuing investigation.

[The investigations to date as presented above seem to be fairly extensive,
and the editorial note does mention the impact these outbreaks and
investigations have had on both the normal school policies and practices as
well as the cost implications of the investigations. Clearly this is not
one outbreak, but many different outbreaks due to a variety of
etiologies. It is interesting to see the description of the outbreak in
New York where parvovirus B19 infection was confirmed and compare it with
the outbreak in Georgia, which appeared to be a probable psychogenic
reaction to a single case of eczematic rash. In the case of the parvovirus
B19 outbreak there were secondary cases at home, the outbreak extended over
a longer period, and the rash was accompanied by other systemic signs and
symptoms. In the Georgia outbreak, the outbreak occurred while spending
time with the affected child. Unless there is additional information
providing further documentation of etiologies not previously confirmed,
this thread is now cut. - Mod.MPP]
