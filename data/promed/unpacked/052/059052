Transportation of coconuts, coconut plants and leaves from several areas in
the south to other parts of the country has been prohibited with immediate
effect. The gazette notification to this effect has already been published,
says D M Jayaratne, minister of plantation industries.

The restriction is due to coconut cultivation between Galle and Tangalle
being infected by a disease, says the Coconut Research Institute [CRI].
Revealing that an insect was the cause of the rapid spread of the disease,
senior researcher Dr Rohana Wijesekara said that the area had also been
named as the infected zone.

Coconut cultivators in this infected zone say that as a result of the
disease spreading rapidly among the coconut cultivations, they are faced
with numerous difficulties. "The quality of the coconuts have drastically
dropped due to the disease," they said. Furthermore, Dr Wijesekara said
that the infected coconut plants have to be uprooted to stop the spread of
the disease.

[Weligama wilt of coconut palm is a newly reported disease emerging in
southern Sri Lanka. Symptoms are described as similar to Kerala wilt in
India and may include leaf yellowing, necrosis and rapid decline of the
crown. An as yet unclassified phytoplasma was shown to be associated with
diseased palms, and nucleotide sequencing data suggest that it is 98 per
cent homologous to sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma and about 80 per cent
homologous to the lethal yellowing phytoplasma (ProMED-mail post
20080225.0757).

It is suggested that the phytoplasma infection may not be lethal by itself
but that it predisposes the palms to a secondary infection by fungal leaf
rot (LRD), which then causes the death of the palms. More than 200 000
symptomatic palms were identified by CRI in 2008 resulting in a programme
to remove all wilt affected trees in order to prevent further spreading.
Research at CRI is ongoing.

Initially, a 3 km exclusion zone was set up around the area where the
disease was 1st reported. This is now considered to be insufficient to
limit the spread of the phytoplasma since insect vectors are likely to be
involved in phytoplasma spread, which may be carried long distances by air
currents. The main concern is to keep the disease out of Sri Lanka's
"coconut triangle," the main coconut cultivation area in the north western
provinces, with around 45 per cent of the total national crop acreage.
Commercial control of phytoplasmas affecting coconut and other palms is
primarily achieved by replanting with resistant varieties or hybrids, but
no resistant or tolerant cultivars have as yet been identified for Weligama
wilt.
