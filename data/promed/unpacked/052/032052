From: John C. Steiner <jcsneuro@fuse.net>

The biology of Fire Blight, a plant disease which depends upon time,
temperature, humidity and stage of bud development has been 'captured' in a
computer program created by a University of Maryland plant pathologist,
Paul W. Steiner Ph.D., and is distributed at the following web site:
<http://www.intrepid.net/afrs/fb8.htm>.
There have been annual sessions at the plant pathology meetings regarding
this program, and it has been used in at least 20 countries overseas.
Additional information on this plant disease can be obtained at the
Kearneysville West Virginia Experiment Station site,
<http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/disease_update/mbatkv.html>
as well as at
<http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/disease_month/fireblight.html>
Additional information on Plum Pox can be found at:
<http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/wvufarm1.html>, and an excellent
plant pathology site which lists most of the plant pathology departments
and is maintained by the Penn State Department of Plant Pathology.
