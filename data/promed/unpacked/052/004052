There is another possible case of the plague in southwest Idaho. This one was found near Highway 19, immediately west of Caldwell [Canyon County]. This possible case is not connected to the plague found southeast of Boise[Ada County] last month [May 2015] [see archive list below.] The plague found in the desert southeast of Boise involved ground squirrels. This new potential case of the plague is tied to voles. Voles are also commonly called meadow mice.

State health officials say they tested dead voles found in the area near Highway 19 west of Caldwell and initial results indicate possible plague.
They say the case appears to be localized and not widespread. However, people are urged to take precautions.

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents that can cause serious illness to people and pets, if not treated quickly. Plague is generally transmitted to humans and animals through bites of infected fleas. People can be exposed to plague when pets have contact with rodents or fleas outdoors, or when pets bring infected rodents or fleas back into the home. [Or when people approach dead wildlife when the fleas are in the process of abandoning ship. Mod.JW]

"Don't let your pets sleep with you in your bed. If your pets roam free or they may hunt some of these rodents that may be a risk for plague. They may bring these infected fleas home and if they sleep in your bed they may have a chance to bite you as well," said epidemiologist Raemi Nolevanko with Southwest District Health. People can also become infected by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions.

People are urged to keep their pets from roaming or hunting voles or other rodents. Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite.

People are encouraged to avoid contact with wild rodents. Clean up areas near your home where rodents can live -- like wood piles or tall grass. Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far away as possible from your home.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. If you experience any of the symptoms, get medical help right away.

Plague was diagnosed recently in Idaho in a dog -- see archives listed below.

Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.

Ground squirrels, and other rodents are frequently the source of the bacteria. This suspected case is in a vole, a rodent with a short tail, short legs and short nose. They are really very charming little creatures. A photo may be viewed at http://www.arkive.org/field-vole/microtus-agrestis/.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through
1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals;
2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or
3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.
