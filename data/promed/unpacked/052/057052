Since [Tue 1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 1276 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [Tue 1 Aug 2017], primarily among homeless people and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 4 Aug 2018:

Total Outbreak: 1341
Hospitalizations: 759
Deaths: 8

The cases in Kentucky continue to increase dramatically. The weekly number of new cases reported remains about 50 or more. At this rate, Kentucky will surpass the total of the next highest 2 states combined. - Mod.LL

Tennessee health officials say at least 74 people have contracted hepatitis A in Nashville since last December 2017. Nashville's Metro Public Health Department said in a statement on Fri 10 Aug 2018 that it continues to work with state and local officials to urge people to get vaccinated in an effort to end the outbreak. The statement says free vaccines for at-risk groups are being offer at 3 public health centers. Health officials say at-risk groups include drug users, homeless people or men who have sexual contact with other men.

Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by a virus, but it can spread through close contact with an infected person. Symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dark urine. Other states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, have also reported outbreaks.

More than half of the state's new cases of hepatitis A in the past week came from Wayne County, as the liver-affecting disease continued to rifle its way through the area. While new cases of the virus have generally appeared to stagnate in most of Indiana, Wayne County has seen a steady, rapid increase in reported incidents in recent weeks.

The Indiana State Dept of Health on Fri 10 Aug 2018 reported that Wayne County has seen 60 total cases reported since the start of the year [2018], up from the 45 reported last week. The county accounted for 15 of the 29 newly-reported cases in that span, according to the state.

The spike was the largest one-week jump in reported cases for the county since the outbreak began. Unlike other areas that have been hit hard by hepatitis A, vaccinations and other efforts to stem spread of the disease have not seemed to have had an impact on the local health environment. In fact, the county is on pace to by next week surpass Clark County, which has seen 69 reported cases and is generally considered something of an epicenter for the disease in Indiana; health officials have attributed the origin of the hepatitis A outbreak, at least in part, to Louisville, which sits directly across the Ohio River from Clark County.

No other county aside from Wayne in the past week saw an increase of more than 2 cases of hepatitis A. The only other county in East Central Indiana with at least 5 cases of the disease is Fayette, which just had its 5th case reported this week. A majority of the other hardest hit counties are in southern Indiana.

[Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (California) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers will continue. It is not clear how many of this rapidly increasing total are in individuals outside the described cohorts. - Mod.LL
