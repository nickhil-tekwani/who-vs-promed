Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease"
-----------------------------------------------------------
During this year's [2013] General Session, the World Assembly of national Delegates recognised Israel, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Slovenia, and the United States of America as having a "negligible bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk".

Bulgaria and Costa Rica were recognised as having "controlled risk" status with regard to BSE.

The official status of all the countries that already had an officially recognised status remains unchanged.

[In May 2012, following the recommendation of the Scientific Commission based upon received questionnaires, the following 19 OIE member countries were officially recognised by the General Session as having a "negligible BSE risk" in accordance with chapter 11.5 of the Terrestrial Code: (total = total number of BSE cases reported; "first" and "last" = the year of the 1st and of the last reported BSE cases in this country):

Country / total / first / last
Argentina / 0
Australia / 0
Austria / 8 / 2000 / 2010
Belgium / 125 / 2000 / 2006
Brazil / 0
Chile / 0
Colombia / 0
Denmark / 15 / 2000 / 2009
Finland / 1 / 2001 / 2001
Iceland / 0
India / 0
New Zealand / 0
Norway / 0
Panama / 0
Paraguay / 0
Peru / 0
Singapore / 0
Sweden / 0
Uruguay / 0

During the May 2013 General Session, the following countries have been added to the "negligible BSE risk" group, in line with the recommendation of the Scientific Commission:

Country/ total / first / last / comment
Israel / 1 / 2002 / 2002 / single 2002 case in a 10 year old cow. MBM [meat bone meal] import ban July 1990, total MBM feed ban August 1996
Italy / 142 / 2001 / 2009 / -
Japan / 36 / 2001 / 2009 / -
Netherlands / 62 / 2000 / 2011 / the 2011 case was "atypical" BSE (L-type)
Slovenia / 8 / 2001 / 2007 / -
USA / 3 / 2005/ 2006 / the 2011 case one "atypical" BSE

The requirements for a member to be recognised as having a "negligible BSE" risk are laid out in article 11.5.3 of the Terrestrial Code; it can be accessed at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.5.htm.

Countries enjoying the status of "negligible BSE risk", which is the highest possible status according to the terrestrial code, are liable to relatively lenient BSE surveillance and control requirements. They must submit an annual reconfirmation form by the end of November every year.

As the official BSE status of a country or zone is determined on the basis of an overall assessment of risk, the occurrence of a new BSE case implies a re-assessment of the official risk status only in the event of a change in the epidemiological situation indicating failure of the BSE risk mitigating measures in place.

When the Scientific Commission determines that the conditions to demonstrate compliance with the relevant requirements of the Terrestrial Code are no longer met, a disease status may be suspended. The Scientific Commission may decide to reinstate the suspended status when a member country has submitted an application which fulfills all the requirements requested for the recovery of official disease status laid out in the relevant chapters of the Terrestrial Code. The suspensions and recoveries of disease status are announced by the director general of the OIE in consultation with the Scientific Commission and the list of these is kept up to date until adoption of a new Resolution by the World Assembly in the following May.

Following the addition of Bulgaria and Costa Rica to the list of countries recognised as having "controlled risk" status with regard to BSE, the updates list includes the following 27 countries:

Bulgaria, Canada, Chinese Taipei, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Korea (Rep. of), Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Nicaragua, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

The impact of this zoonotic disease, manifested in humans as vCJD, is reflected in the large (774) number of BSE postings in the ProMED-mail archives since November 1994. - Mod.AS]
