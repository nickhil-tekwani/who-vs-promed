In a follow-up on the mumps outbreak in New Castle County, Delaware, The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is confirming 2 additional cases of the mumps as part of its ongoing investigation of an outbreak among attendees at 2 multi-cultural dances in New Castle County. This brings the total number of mumps cases to 15.

All of the individuals infected with mumps reside in New Castle County.

Nine of the 15 persons with mumps attended either the 10 Feb or 3 Mar 2018 social dance (Baile Mejicano) that took place at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Two of the remaining 4 individuals live with someone who attended one of the dances, and the source of the mumps virus exposure for the remaining 4 individuals is still under investigation.

Mumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.

Symptoms typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands, which results in puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people with mumps may not have any symptoms. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.

People known or suspected to have mumps should stay away from school or work until 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands as there is no specific treatment for mumps.

The CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. Teens and adults who did not get the recommended MMR vaccines per the above schedule should be vaccinated so they are up to date. During outbreaks, CDC also recommends that those at highest risk due to exposure to people with mumps should receive a 3rd dose of MMR.

There has been a case of reported mumps at the College of William and Mary.

The announcement was sent out in an email by Virginia Wells, director of the student health center at William and Mary, and Virginia Ambler, vice president of student affairs, on 24 Apr 2018. The email said the Peninsula Health District identified a case of mumps, and the student has since been isolated. Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Peninsula Health District, said they are working with the college on this case. ...

Wells said in her email people known to have had contact with the sick student have been notified, but since college campuses are a close and compact environment, it's possible other students may have been exposed.

In Wells and Ambler's email, they recommended students to review their immunization status and contact their doctor to receive the vaccine as needed. This vaccine is usually to children at age 12 months and again between the ages of 4-6 years and is 88% effective in persons having received 2 doses. So, someone who received a full immunization may still develop mumps.

The Virginia Department of Health said people who are exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, and those infected can transmit mumps to others 2 days before symptoms appear. The email from Wells and Ambler suggested contacting your doctor and self-isolating until your doctor directs otherwise if you begin to have mumps-like symptoms.

"The university has taken all appropriate and recommended steps, including sharing this information with the campus community," the email said. "We will provide additional updates or recommendations if needed."

Update April 26
----------
A new announcement from Wells and Ambler said more cases of mumps have been reported on campus. The students who contracted the virus have been isolated, as with the 1st case.

While Hill said Peninsula Health could not release the exact number of students who contracted mumps, there were several cases reported.
