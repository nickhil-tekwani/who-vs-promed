[1] Cholera - Somalia (Banadir, Gedo, Lower Shabelle)
Date: Tue 13 Mar 2007

At least 42 people, mainly children, have died in the last 24 hours
from a suspected cholera outbreak in southern Somalia, doctors said
on Tue 13 Mar 2007. More than 240 others have been hospitalized, and
doctors fear more deaths because of the lack of proper medical
facilities or medicines in the war-ravaged country.
"The children are dying from the disease because of a lack of access
to proper medical centers," said Dr Ahmed Nour Afey, who works at a
provincial hospital in Marka town, in the Lower Shabelle region,
about 90 km. (56 miles) south of the capital, Mogadishu. "Most of
them die on their way to hospitals at the main towns in the region."
This latest outbreak has occurred in 3 southern regions of Somalia --
Banadir, Gedo, and Lower Shabelle. According to doctors, the 1st
cases were reported in December 2006, in 4 central regions of the
country, but have now spread.

[2] Cholera - Angola (Benguela)

From January to February 2007, 91 cases of cholera, from which 6
resulted in deaths, were reported by the municipal hospital of
Balombo, south Benguela province.
According to the official in charge of the local health sector,
Augusto Cacope, in spite of adequate medical treatment provided by
the hospital, local residents fail to stick to preventive measures
for the disease, prompting countless cases in the region. Cacope, who
did [not] reveal any statistical data, said that the Cavisselo suburb
in Balombo municipality registered the highest number of cholera cases.
From April to December 2006, Balombo district recorded 299 cases of
cholera, from which 15 resulted in deaths.
