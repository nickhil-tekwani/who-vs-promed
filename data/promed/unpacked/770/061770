Buyengero (southwestern Burundi), 4th January: Thirty people have
already died of typhus in Muzenga Zone (southwestern Burundi), Major
Felix Ntungumburanye, the interim administrator of Buyengero Commune,
told ABP on Thursday (31 Dec 1998).
Eleven cases of bacillary dysentery, including one death, were also
recorded at the site for displaced people in Mutwahero, the
administrator added. Health authorities in Bururi Province (southern
Burundi) say everything will be done to stop these epidemics,
especially dysentery and typhus, by providing drugs.
The authorities are counting on the support of the medical NGO
"Memisa" (Belgian aid organization) to provide health services in
Burambi and Buyengero communes.

[Typhus, which is caused by a bacterium-like organism called a
rickettsia, should not be confused with typhoid, which is caused by a
bacterium -- although both produce a fog-like mental condition in the
victim, hence their names, derived from the Greek word for "fog"
