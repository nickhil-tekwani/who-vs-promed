The increasing reports of bacterial black spot (BBS) in a number of mango farms across the country [see ProMED-mail post 20170601.5076304] appears to be casting doubts over [the] government's Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) programme. Farmers expressed worries about their losses to the disease, urging to furnish them with efficient and affordable agro-chemicals that can assist in controlling BBS.

Reports indicate that chemical control of BBS appears to be difficult. [The] government is being encouraged to build capacity to fight the disease. [The] Ghana Vegetable Exporters Association noted that many pests and diseases [of mango] need to be taken care of, stressing that government funding has not been encouraging.

Europe imports the majority of its mangoes from developing countries such as Ghana. As the disease continues without any measures taken to curb it, the possibility of the EU markets banning Ghana's mangoes is a danger.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango is caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _mangiferaeindicae_. It was first described from Africa but is now known to occur also in the Asian-Pacific region and South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 90 percent yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems, and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging. Symptoms include small, irregular or star shaped water-soaked lesions on fruit, which soon become raised and may crack open releasing bacterial ooze. Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers, which may crack lengthwise.

Leaves also show small water soaked lesions, which become angular and raised, increase in size and may coalesce to form large necrotic patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to distinguish BBS from fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_ or _Colletotrichum_ species) which forms flat, rounded lesions. Severe infections cause defoliation and/or premature fruit drop.

The bacteria live as epiphytes but occur in high concentrations in leaf and stem lesions. They are essentially wound pathogens but can also infect through natural openings. Incidence is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high, or in trees that lack vigour. BBS can be prevalent in both low and high rainfall tropical and subtropical areas.

The disease is spread by wind-driven rain, splashing water, and mechanical means (including insect and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material, and bacteriocidal sprays. Infected nursery trees have been a major source of BBS in new orchards. Susceptibility to BBS varies between mango cultivars, but no completely resistant varieties are known.

The pathogen was also reported as the cause of black spot on cashew in Ghana's neighbour, Burkina Faso (ProMED-mail post 20160601.4255664).
