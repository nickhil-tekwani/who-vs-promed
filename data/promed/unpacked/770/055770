In relation to the report of gastroenteritis after eating fish from Lake
Nagambie and surrounding watercourses (Victoria, Australia) we are able to
provide the following information:
A total of 7 cases of gastroenteritis have been reported after eating
redfin (English perch) over a 19 day period in Oct 2004. The index case was
an 11 year old boy who was hospitalized after developing profuse vomiting,
disorientation, and hallucinations. Only 1 other case had specific
neurological symptoms. Other symptoms experienced by cases included
abdominal pain, headache, sweating, weakness and dizziness. There appears
to be a dose-response relationship, with those who eat more fish being more
ill. The incubation period varies from around 30 minutes to 24 hours.
Sources of toxicity which are being explored are cyanobacterial toxins,
heavy metals, and pesticides. No algal blooms have been noted recently in
the water sources, and testing has not revealed any evidence of an algal
problem. The symptoms of the index case were ciguatera-like, however
ciguatera poisoning occurs where there are dinoflagellates associated with
tropical marine reefs.
This ecosystem is a freshwater lake in a temperate climate. Redfin (_Perca
fluviatilis_) are an introduced species living in still and slowly flowing
waters. They are carnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of foods, and are
known to carry the Epizootic Haematopoietic Necrosis virus, which is
transmissible to other fish. Their characteristics suggest the possibility
of bioaccumulation of a toxin, but the nature of this toxin has so far been
elusive.

Because the fish appear to have come from fresh water, isn't it more likely
that the cause is a cyanobacteria-produced toxin, such as an anatoxin or
saxitoxin, rather than a dinoflagellate-produced toxin? (These comments are
my own and don't reflect Agency policy)
