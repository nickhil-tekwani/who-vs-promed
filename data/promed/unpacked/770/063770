Lumpy skin disease [LSD] has recently spread in Asia following outbreaks in the Middle East and Europe. The disease emerged in Bangladesh in July 2019.

According to [a senior government] official, India too saw the 1st case of LSD in the same year, 2019, in eastern states especially West Bengal and Odisha. But this year [2022], the disease has been reported in western and northern states as well as in Andaman Nicobar.

"First, LSD was reported in Gujarat and it has spread to 8 states/union territories now. Over 185 000 cattle have been affected so far and more than 7300 cattle have died since the outbreak of the disease in July [2022]," the official told PTI.

About 74 325 cattle have been affected in Punjab so far, with the numbers 58 546 in Gujarat, 43 962 in Rajasthan, 6 385 in Jammu and Kashmir, 1300 in Uttarakhand, 532 in Himachal Pradesh, 260 in Andaman & Nicobar, he said and added the data from Madhya Pradesh is awaited.

The disease, caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, is spread through mosquitoes, flies and ticks.

According to the ministry's data, 7300 cattle have died so far, out of which 3359 animals died in Punjab, 2111 in Rajasthan, 1679 in Gujarat, 62 in Jammu and Kashmir, 38 Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Uttarakhand and 29 in Andaman Nicobar.

There are reports of LSD infection in Haryana as well.

The official mentioned that the mortality rate of LSD is 1-2% and it does not infect humans.

Currently, a vaccination drive is underway and 1 792 000 cattle have been vaccinated so far in these states/UT, he added.

The official said central teams have been deputed to Punjab, and Gujarat for taking first hand stock of the outbreak of LSD and states have been asked to implement strictly the advisories and bio safety measures, restriction of movement and isolation of infected animals, monitoring of stray animals besides safe disposal of carcasses.

The state governments have set up control rooms toll free numbers to help address the issues of animal owners and spread awareness.

A control room has also been established in the ministry to address the concerns of state governments, the official said.

India, the world's largest milk producer, had a cattle population of 192.5 million in 2019, as per the 19th Livestock census.

Even as some cattle were first detected with the vector-borne lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the region in early July [2022], the fact that it continues to spread alarmingly, affecting thousands of animals -- mostly cows -- across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat and border areas of Jammu and Kashmir is a poor reflection on the authorities' means to containing and managing the disease.

Resultantly, the dairy farmers have been hit economically as it affects the cows' milk yield and fertility. In addition, they are facing the daunting task of disposing of the carcasses scientifically. Gross mismanagement is evident as animal carcasses lie rotting in the open or are dumped into canals and rivers, particularly in Punjab and Haryana. In Punjab alone, nearly 4000 head of cattle have perished and 75 000 are afflicted. An urgent multi-pronged strategy, including sanctioning of special funds, to deal with the matter on a war footing from all angles is essential.

The reasons for this viral livestock outbreak to have deteriorated to this unhygienic level that is fraught with grave health and environmental consequences, sadly, cover the entire range of issues involved. Prominently, the response has bared an acute shortage of veterinarians. So has the administration of goatpox vaccine -- needed for healthy livestock -- been found wanting. Adding to the chaotic scenario is rumour-mongering; experts' voices quashing tales of consuming cow milk as being dangerous need to be amplified. The LSD has also exposed how traditional village lands reserved for burying animals, called 'hada rori', have been shrinking or being encroached upon over the past 7-8 years. The practice of annual contracts for lifting carcasses is dying due to low returns in the sale of leather, bones and hooves.

Awareness about preventive steps and preparedness should be spread as LSD has broken out fairly regularly in India in the past couple of years. With morbidity rate at a high of 50% and mortality rate 1-5%, a better grip on the condition is needed for the long haul as this havoc-wreaking ailment seems to cut across boundaries.

[India is divided into 29 states and 7 union territories. Since the start of the event, late 2019, the following states have become published as infected with lumpy skin disease [LSD]: Odisha, Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. According to item 1 above, the disease has been recorded also from the states of West Bengal, Uttarakhand and, likely, Haryana, as well as from the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Andaman & Nicobar (islands). An official update is warranted.

According to FAO's 2020 publication 'LSD qualitative risk assessment & management', presented in 20201112.7937140 (see citation below), the economic impact of LSD on South, East, and Southeast Asia's countries was estimated to be up to USD 1.45 billion in direct losses of livestock and production. The document discussed the trade implications for the infected countries. For India, a prominent exporter, globally, of live cattle, buffalo and their meat/meat products, the losses could become of concerning magnitude.

The cost effectiveness estimate in the FAO paper demonstrated a strong economic justification for vaccination under any scenario, since direct vaccination costs are lower than estimated direct losses, even without considering potential additional indirect losses, including exports.

To try decrease the direct and indirect losses, accelerated performance of the mass vaccination is essential.
