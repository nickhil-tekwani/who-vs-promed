New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: El Buen Retiro, El Retiro, Anton, Cocle
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Mar 2013
Outbreak status: resolved (9 Aug 2013)
Epidemiological unit: farm
The affected animals are cattle. There are 2000 susceptible animals, with 9 cases, 2 deaths, and 8 animals have been slaughtered.
Affected population: a dairy cattle farm (Jersey breed cattle) with cattle kept indoors. It is a farm composed of imported animals.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic laboratory tests performed by the Diagnostic and Veterinary Research Laboratory (LADIV) (national laboratory) were bacteriological examination [8 Aug 2013] and polymerase chain reaction [9 Aug 2013], both of which were positive.

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

The primary cause of tuberculosis in cattle is the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). This bacterium is in the same family with Johnes disease and leprosy. Adult cattle are usually infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing the bacteria into their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often infected by drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will ultimately determine the clinical signs of the disease.

Since the bacterium is usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows, the commonest clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the infection. When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for the productive life of the cow. If the infection overpowers the body defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary gland.

When calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the commonest lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.

Other species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical signs. _M. avium_, causing infection by ingestion and lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _M. tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.

Live, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_ with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce. In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not a different type of mycobacterium.

Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages. Science has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.
