The number of Japanese encephalitis affected victims went up 7 times in the past 3 months and 1326 people were found to have been infected in the state until 30 Nov 2022, said a study conducted by the Union Health Ministry.

It may be mentioned that during September-October last year [2021], encephalitis cases were detected in and around Kolkata. Nearly 20 patients were admitted to a private hospital for children at Park Circus in September last year. Encephalitis cases were reported amidst COVID last year.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus transmission has been active in West Bengal state over the past 3 months with a total of 1326 cases. Presumably, the JE virus transmission season is now ending as it usually does late in the year.

JE virus is endemic in northeastern India, including West Bengal state. However, ProMED has posted far fewer cases in West Bengal compared to Bihar or Assam states in the northeast.

Many reports of JE also mention cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), some as JE cases, but many others with no specific etiologies given. However, the report above does not mention AES cases, only JE cases. The report does not indicate which age groups were affected nor the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated against JE. Most JE cases in India are reported in children.

West Bengal state had an extensive JE vaccination campaign in 2015 (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (19): (WB) 20151130.3830275). - Mod.TY
