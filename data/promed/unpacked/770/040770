The 10 year old Afghan girl has big eyes, a shy smile, and a dark lesion
speckled with blood on her right cheek. The girl has leishmaniasis, a
disease caused by a parasite transmitted by a tiny sandfly that can lead to
severe scarring, often on the face. The girl, wearing a purple tunic,
trousers, and pale blue shoes, answers "no" softly when asked if the sore
hurts. But her father is worried about the lesion, the size of a big coin.
"Of course, this doesn't look good," the father said, at a leishmaniasis
clinic crowded with children with sores in the Afghan capital, Kabul. [The
man] said he first noticed a mark on his daughter's face 2 months ago. "It
was a very small dot but it grew and grew. If it grows any more it will
cover her whole face."
Leishmaniasis isn't a priority for the government and its aid donors,
grappling with shocking rates of infant mortality, tuberculosis, malaria,
and trauma.
The most common form of the disease is not fatal but it causes untold
misery. Victims with scarring on their faces are stigmatized: children are
excluded at school and girls often won't be able to find husbands. Long
neglected by the rich world, the disease is attracting a bit more attention
in the west, if not more funds. Some foreign troops in Afghanistan and Iraq
have also been bitten by the sandflies and developed the disease. NATO (the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization) saw about 150 cases in Afghanistan in
2005 and about 12 last year [2006], a spokeswoman said. NATO camps have
been fortified to try to stop the sandflies and soldiers are warned to keep
sleeves rolled down, to use insect repellant, and to watch for bites.
Kabul, battered and neglected for years, has the world's worst outbreak of
leishmaniasis, health experts say. "It's out of control, absolutely out of
control," said Reto Steiner, a medic with the German Medical Service which
helps run the Kabul clinic. "You won't control it until the sanitation has
recovered." The deep ulcers caused by the parasites will heal if left
untreated, but that invariably involves disfigurement and can take many
months. That has given rise to one of the diseases many nicknames:
'saldana', or one-year sore. Though present in all Afghan cities, it is in
Kabul's crowded neighborhoods that the disease has exploded and spread to
hundreds of thousands of people.
"When we have one case in a family, of course, it's not only one case: it
will be all the family and even the neighbors," said health ministry
official Abdullah Fahim. The sandflies that spread the parasites are
carried by animals including dogs and a species of gerbil, as well as
people. The insects often breed on waste land and in rubbish. Although they
don't fly well, the insects infest the cracks and crevices in people's
homes from where they emerge to bite exposed parts of the body -- noses,
chins, cheeks, and hands -- as people sleep, from late spring to autumn.
"It's a disease of destruction," said Toby Leslie, a researcher from the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "It will thrive in post-war
areas and areas where there's poor sanitation, poor community services."
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is not fatal although a less-common form, visceral
leishmaniasis, can cause organ failure and death. "Leishmaniasis is one of
the top neglected diseases, certainly outside Africa, and it just doesn't
attract the funding that's needed," Leslie said.
Doctor Faquir Amin says he's been treating leishmaniasis since the 1960s.
Refugees returning from abroad are particularly susceptible as they have no
resistance, he said. "No one's taking care of it. The people are coming,
it's crowded, the people are susceptible and the disease is increasing,"
Amin said at his Kabul clinic. "It is not a killer disease but mentally
people suffer. We have to deal with it." The sores are treated with a
course of injections, or cauterized to kill the parasites. Amin's clinic
has the only laser cauterizing machine in Afghanistan. Electric cauterizing
machines are also effective and much cheaper.
Prevention is also key, experts say. Bed nets impregnated with insecticide
are being distributed to stop malaria and they will also stop sandflies
spreading leishmaniasis. But only a few nets are being distributed compared
with the number needed. "The ministry is battling to get funds and no one's
interested. It's impossible to get funds," said Health Ministry adviser
Kathy Fiekert. "This is an issue that needs to be addressed."

[A survey in 2003 by HealthNet International in Faizabad, Badakshan
province, Afghanistan, found that 8.3 per cent of the surveyed people had
cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions (see ProMED-mail: Leishmaniasis -
Afghanistan 20030909.2267). The last WHO (World Health Organization) update
on the situation, from 22 May 2002, estimated that there were 200 000 cases
in Kabul alone, but it may well have deteriorated since then. The average
life expectancy at birth for male and females in Afghanistan is 42 years
(2005) and the annual expenditure on health per capita is USD 14 (2004)
