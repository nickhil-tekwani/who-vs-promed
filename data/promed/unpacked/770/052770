FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, PORCINE - CHINA (02): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Posting 20100411.1174, which addressed suspected FMD in China,
included the following sentences translated from the Chinese press:

1. During the Chinese New Year, there was a sudden outbreak of swine
5th disease, causing pigs to die;
2. This outbreak is primarily 5th disease (Class 1 Disease, actually FMD).

We asked: "Could somebody explain the background to the '5th' terminology?"

The following response has been kindly received from a
subscriber/correspondent in China:

"Following database search, it seems that 'Fifth disease' points to
'FMD'; 'Fourth disease' points to Duck plague (Duck virus enteritis).
For Chinese terminology of animal diseases, please refer to the
web-site
<http://www.epizoo.org/ch/Default.aspx>."
