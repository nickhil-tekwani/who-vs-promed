Regarding the statement "Polonium 210 has 33 isotopes, or forms, of
itself. This element decays over a period of months because it emits
alpha particles," it could be corrected if the number "210" were
removed from the first sentence and the second sentence "This element
decays over a period of months because it emits alpha particles" was
rewritten with "The polonium-210 isotope has a half-life of 138 days
and it decays to lead-206, which is stable, by emitting an alpha particle."
With respect to Dale Coffin's comment about the production of
polonium-210, he is correct, as the production can be done in a
nuclear reactor by bombarding bismuth-209 with neutrons. This
initially forms the radioactive isotope bismuth-210, which has a
half-life of 5 days, decaying to polonium-210 by beta decay.

Regarding:
"When you have dental x-rays or body x-rays, the parts of the body to
be protected against gamma radiation are draped in lead"
Gamma rays are far more energetic than medical x-rays, and are not
emitted by bombarding tungsten with an electron beam, or with a
fluoroscope. Gamma rays are used typically used in industry and use
radioactive isotopes as a source.
