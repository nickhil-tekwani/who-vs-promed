New strange diseases "onion blotch" and "dumping off" have been spotted in onions and cabbage crops in Ntungamo district. The diseases have already attacked a number of gardens causing losses. Farmers have used some agrochemicals but in vain. They were advised to apply some different new chemicals and to consider planting seasons since too much rain causes diseases like the ones observed.

[A large number of fungal, bacterial, and nematode pathogens, as well as several viruses and phytoplasmas, are known to affect onion (_Allium cepa_) and related crops. "Onion blotch" above may refer to purple blotch caused by the fungus _Alternaria porri_ which has previously caused losses in the region (e.g. ProMED post 20210607.8431139).

A range of pathogens affecting brassica crops (including cabbages, turnips, and oilseed rape) has been reported. "Dumping off" above may refer to _Rhizoctonia solani_, a ubiquitous soil borne fungus associated with damping-off and a range of rots (root, stem, fruit) in a large number of crops, including brassicas, other vegetables, cereals, and pasture grasses cabbages. For more information see previous ProMED posts in the archives.

Reliable diagnosis of the specific pathogen(s) involved is always required for designing effective management strategies for any local situation.
