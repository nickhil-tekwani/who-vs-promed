Canadian Surveillance Data 2005 (as of Sat 30 Jul 2005)
-----------------------------------------------
West Nile Virus National Surveillance Report
English Edition
24-30 Jul 2005 (Week 30)
Human:
To date, Ontario reported one new probable West Nile virus (WNV) case
of human illness. Quebec removed the probable human WNV case that was
reported previously after further laboratory tests were negative for
WNV.
Bird:
During week 30, 9 new health units [Ontario (6), Manitoba (2), and
Saskatchewan (1)] reported dead birds positive for WNV. Of the 325
dead birds tested, 35 (11 percent) were reported positive for WNV
within week 30 (see table). To date, positive dead birds have been
reported in 16 health units in Ontario (Halton, Hastings -Prince
Edward, Lambton, Middlesex-London, North Bay, Northwestern, City of
Ottawa, Peterborough, Thunder Bay, Toronto, Brant, Eastern Ontario,
Hamilton-Wentworth, Peel, Simcoe, and Waterloo), 8 health regions in
Manitoba (Winnipeg, North Eastman, Interlake, Brandon, Centra
Assiniboine, South Eastman, and Parkland), one health region in
Quebec (Laurentides) and one health region in Saskatchewan (Regina
Qu'Appelle). A total of 2484 dead birds have been tested since 2 May
2005, of which 63 (2.5 percent) were positive for WNV.
Domestic Animal:
No WNV-positive domestic animals have been reported to the Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) since the start of this season.
Mosquito:
As of week 30, mosquito pools positive for WNV have been reported in
Manitoba (27), Ontario (7), and Saskatchewan (2). National West Nile
virus surveillance data and maps can be found on the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC) web site at:
<http://www.phacaspc.gc.ca/wnv-vwn/index.html>
Provinces/Territories:
Detailed WNV information can be accessed through the Links section on
the PHAC WNV web site.
United States [covered by West Nile Virus Monitor, Public Health
Agency of Canada]
Human:
Between 1 Jan and 30 Jul 2005, a total of 109 WNV cases of human
illness were reported in the U.S. [Arizona (12), Arkansas (2),
California (45), Colorado (10), Georgia (1), Illinois (2), Indiana
(1), Kansas (2), Louisiana (1), Minnesota (4), Mississippi (3),
Missouri (1), New Mexico (2), New York (3), Ohio (1), Pennsylvania
(1), South Dakota (15), and Texas (3) ]. Of the 109 cases, 31 (28
percent) were reported as WN Neuroinvasive Disease, 69 (63 percent)
were reported as WN Fever (Non-Neuroinvasive Disease), and 9 (8
percent) were Other Clinical / Unspecified. To date, 3 deaths have
been reported since 1 Jan 2005.

[2] USA - More outbreaks expected in slow-to-start West Nile season
Date: Sun, 7 Aug 2005

More outbreaks expected in slow-to-start West Nile season
---------------------------------------------------
The West Nile virus season [of 2005] has been milder than it was at
this time last year [2004], but scientists say the worst is yet to
come.
"We might be right on the cusp" of outbreaks in several regions of
the country, says entomologist Harry Savage of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention division in Fort Collins, Colorado.
CDC's tally of 109 cases of West Nile infection nationally does not
reflect recently detected cases in several states. [CDC has yet to
catch up with the more recent cases in its update tally. - Mod.RY].
In Louisiana, health officials Friday reported 22 new cases,
including 2 deaths. Officials in Illinois, California and South
Dakota also have seen new illnesses.
"We're just on a hair trigger here," says Lon Kightlinger, state
epidemiologist in South Dakota, where 4 new cases reported early last
week brought the state total this year to 20. "Since then, we've had
about a dozen more human cases under investigation," and surveillance
has been increased.
"We're investigating (reported cases) as soon as we can and getting
information out to the community, so they can know the virus is
circulating."
West Nile virus infections [cumulative to date] this year, and at
this time in previous years:
Year / Cases / No. of states / Deaths
2005 /109 /18 / 3
2004/ 406 / 20/ 7
2003 /44 /11/ 1
Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
In Louisiana, too, "there's been a quick uptick" just in the past few
days, says Joe Dalovisio, chairman of infectious diseases at the
Ochsner Clinic Foundation in New Orleans. "The season so far has been
slow to start, but typically August and September is when you see
cases." [Coinciding with the increasing number of dead birds observed
in Canada at this time. - Mod.RY]
Entomologist Vicki Kramer of the California Department of Health
Services says West Nile activity also has picked up there in the past
week or so. 64 cases in humans have been detected thus far in 2005,
and 2 people have died.
This is the 2nd year the virus has been found in the central and
northern part of the state, she says, and if a pattern seen elsewhere
in which the 2nd year brings a spike in cases holds true, "we could
be hit pretty hard."
California has awarded $9 million to 75 local agencies to beef up
mosquito control services, she says, and "there's probably going to
be major aerial spraying in the Sacramento area soon."
West Nile is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause fever, achiness
and swollen glands in about 20 percent of those infected. In about 1
of every 150 people infected, the virus can cause encephalitis, a
swelling of the brain that can cause numbness, disorientation and
paralysis. It can be fatal.
In 2004, the CDC had reports of 2539 cases of West Nile infection in
people, including 100 deaths. Fewer cases have been found this year
compared with the same time last summer, Savage says.
"Certainly mosquito control has gotten a lot better in parts of the
country since 1999," when the 1st case in the USA was found in New
York, he says.
Once a person has been infected, immunity is thought to be lifelong.
But Savage says relatively few Americans have been exposed to the
virus, so most people are susceptible. "What we hope is happening is
that more people are taking precautions" to prevent being bitten by
potentially infected mosquitoes, he says. "Whenever you go to an
outdoor activity now, you see people with (insect repellents) they're
applying to themselves and their children."
