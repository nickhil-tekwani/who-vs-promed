The outbreak of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), an acute, fatal, septicaemic disease of cattle and water buffaloes in the districts of Peren and Dimapur [Nagaland], is under control, according to the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department.

At least 90 percent of the disease outbreak among the buffaloes has been brought under control, said Chief Veterinary Officer, Peren District, Dr P Atem Longchar on Friday [29 Apr 2016]. He also reported that the Veterinary department has taken up a "ring vaccination" drive in the surrounding villages so that the disease does not spread further.

The disease had affected 6 villages under Peren district, namely Punglwa, Gaili, Ngwalwa, Heninkunglwa, Dunki-Lamhai and Saijang. An estimate of 314 buffaloes succumbed to the disease within a span of one month, as per data obtained from the veterinary department.

Farmers in the said areas are fully dependent on the buffaloes for ploughing the rice fields. Dr Longchar said there were more than 1500 buffaloes owned by the 6 villages. With the outbreak of HS, around 20 percent of the buffaloes have already died, he added. A Rapid Response Team has also been made operational from Punglwa village area since the last 8 days. "There have been incidences of a few deaths during the last few days, but deaths in large numbers have subsided," another veterinary doctor from Peren district reported.

Dr Longchar said the reason for the high death toll is because most of the animals are left to graze freely on common ground without the owners monitoring their wellbeing. Because of this, he said staff of the Veterinary department had to undergo a tough time traversing the jungles and remote areas to administer vaccination to the animals and at the same time get proper data on the status of the affected animals.

Meanwhile, Dr Longchar reported that the 1st outbreak of the HS disease was initially detected from Razaphema area under Dimapur district. "The epidemic 1st started from Razaphema area, where there is a common grazing ground for the buffaloes. It then spread to Peren," he said.

While the outbreak of the disease may be under control at the moment, there are still apprehensions. Dr Longchar said the farmers and buffalo owners are finding it very difficult to contain the animals at home, with not enough fodder to provide for them. If the buffaloes are let loose to graze freely in the open area, there are high chances that the disease may spread further, he said.

[Common grazing ground is one of the risk factors for disease transmission.

[This event was initialy published by ProMED-mail as "undiagnosed," requesting information (20160418.4167911). In response, a brief report was gratefully obtained from one of EpiCore (ProMED-mail's Global Surveillance Project) participants in India. It indicated that the "Disease could be hemorrhagic septicaemia caused by _Pasteurella multocida_." Now, this diagnosis has been officially confirmed.
