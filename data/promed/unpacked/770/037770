[The inclusion in the agenda of a report from Bulgaria on bluetongue falls
in line with unofficial information on the possible recent detection of the
disease there.
Bulgaria's last official OIE report on BT dates back to September 2002. The
serotype involved was BTV-9. Readers are referred to the following recent
remarks of Dr Peter Roeder, included in archived 20060915.2615:
"Bulgaria resorted to vaccination in 1999/2000, using a pentavalent
(serotypes 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11) [live attenuated] vaccine imported from
South Africa. If I am not mistaken the vector of bluetongue in Bulgaria and
the Balkans was not _Culicoides imicola_ but was almost certainly _C.
obsoletus_ which is well represented in Netherlands, Germany, Belgium,
France and other European countries".
Official confirmation or otherwise from Bulgaria will be helpful; in case
confirmed, data on the BTV serotype, the animal species involved and their
vaccination status will be of interest. - Mod.AS]
