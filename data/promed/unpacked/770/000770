In Support of Adulticide Spraying
---------------------------------
It took [me about 20 seconds to enter the search "mosquito control" and
"adulticide" on PubMed, yielding 18 abstracts (103 more when you hit
"related articles" in reference to the best review) with everything from
details on appropriate particle size, agents to use against which species
of mosquito, differing results with aerial vs ground spraying, aerial
spraying at different altitudes, effects of time of day and weather,
efficacy (which can be brought up to 90%, even in residential areas), etc.
The best references were from the Journal of the American Mosquito Control
Association (web site - ).
"Do aerial and ground sprayings of adulticides really kill mosquitos?".
Yes, they kill mosquitos and can be extremely effective when done under
expert guidance (and apparently after the correct research has been done).
What it can do, and apparently did do very successfully, is control local
infection rates in areas which were sprayed. Anyone who seriously wonders
if things would have been different had there been no spraying should
compare the number of confirmed equine cases this year (53 at my last
count) to last [year (22), realizing the entire equine population of the
United States amounts to 1 to 3% of the human, and most horses did not have
the benefit of adulticide spraying in their locales. A notable exception
would be the horses of Suffolk County, Long Island, where equine cases were
clustered last year but this year accounted for only 2 cases (despite 193
dead birds and 106 positive mosquito pools to date).

[The horse data are intriguing. The fact that spraying has been proved to
be up to 90% effective in some studies does not automatically mean that it
worked like that in the Northeast this year. What we would like to hear is
whether mosquito trap catches fell after each spray cycle, how long they
took to bounce back up, what the droplet sizes of the spray runs were
(collected on glass slides at ground level inside & outside houses), what
the kill rate was in caged mosquitoes exposed to spraying compared with
controls caged in the insectary, etc. It is likely that in the rapid
response to the emergency, such studies were not done. - Mod.JW
