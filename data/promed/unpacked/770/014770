A mysterious disease is plaguing chickpea crops in southern Saskatchewan for a 2nd season [see ProMED-mail post 20190826.6640755]. Blighted and diminished plants are being found. No one seems to know why. "It's a complex issue, not one thing, so it might be a complex answer," said Dave Greenshields, Saskatchewan Pulse Growers [SPG]. The problem has the same symptoms as seen in the crop last year [2019], with a lot of chlorosis, wilting and some plant die-off [and] is affecting a broad area. 25 to 80 per cent of a specific field has been affected. It is difficult to estimate total yield loss because there has been some recovery on some fields.

"Last year [2019], disease testing was done. There was evidence for root diseases, of course for ascochyta, but it didn't really give an answer," Greenshields said. This year [2020], [SPG] received 27 samples from 15 different fields, as well as the field histories, and then tested for a range of different pathogens, performed nutrient analysis, and herbicide residue testing. "We didn't get a clear answer last year [2019] so we thought let's see if there's anything else. It would be good to know what symptoms [farmers] are seeing, combined with the cropping history of their field, and what kind of crop protection and management [were] used."

[A farmer] said, "They were sure going downhill in a hurry. It didn't seem to matter how many times or when they were sprayed with fungicide." He said it's difficult to know what the losses will be because even when there are pods on the plants many are empty [and] a significant percent are aborted.

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Didymella rabiei_ and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas worldwide. The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2 years under dry conditions and is seed borne at a high rate of 50% to 80%. Seed transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and worldwide. Disease management includes cultural methods, seed treatments, preventative fungicide applications, and use of varieties with improved resistance. Fungal strains with increased virulence are emerging and are considered a threat to national chickpea industries.

Previously in Saskatchewan, external stress factors were considered as potentially contributing to an increased susceptibility of crops to one or several pathogens, including AB. However, no consistent factors could be identified so far (ProMED-mail post 20190826.6640755).
