I would add the following to CHC's comment on the lack of information on
diagnostics:
There is not a "classic Dengue fever strain." There are strains that have
not been associated with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever. The strain does not rule
out the possibility of DHF, though the probability of DHF occurring when
infected w/such strains is low. In this report, the strain is not
identified, and the moniker [name "classic (DF) strain" should be viewed
with skepticism. This leads one to wonder, if the strain is one not
previously associated with DHF, why Minister Chiola says that the risk of
DHF has "increased."
Further, saying that DHF "in most cases can be fatal," is literally correct
(DHF can be fatal) but it is quite misleading, suggesting that most DHF
patients die. In fact, DHF fatality rates can be as high as 20%, but rarely
are.
Dealing with the potential epidemic increase in dengue transmission is
absolutely prudent, but whether or not such an outbreak will lead to a
"huge" tragedy is speculation on an overly dramatic scale. It will only
hurt future public health measures to predict a "huge" tragedy and have a
small tragedy or no tragedy at all.
Finally, can anyone comment on "sea weeds" as an _Aedes aegypti_ breeding
site?

[I can. It was an error on my part in not editing out that silly term in
the first place. Paraguay is land-locked and therefore might have weeds
around bodies of water but not around sea water. Subscriber Mike O'Dell
also pointed out that Paraguay is land-locked. The other country in South
America that has no ocean front properties is Bolivia. I agree with Bill
Messer on the other points he makes as well. The posting was taken from a
newspaper report and is not up to scientific standards, which may also be
the case for the Minister's comments. I could not find recent mention of
dengue in Paraguay and have no idea whether a prior epidemic of one or
another of the four dengue viruses might have primed the immunologic pump
there. Anyone know? - Mod. CHC
