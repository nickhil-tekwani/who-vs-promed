[1] Philadelphia [St. Joseph's] University outbreak

St. Joe's Student Health Center and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health have advised students on campus to take precautionary measures after an outbreak of mumps at nearby Temple University.

At the end of last month [February 2019], right before the school's spring break, Temple released a statement that there were 4 confirmed cases of mumps on campus. As of [18 Mar 2019], there have been 54 cases of mumps at Temple -- 12 confirmed and 42 probable --, according to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

Although mumps cases were rare in the years following the introduction of the Mumps, Measles and Rubella (MMR) vaccine in 1971, a resurgence of outbreaks has occurred in recent years among vaccinated individuals. Many of those 54 people at Temple had the MMR vaccine. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), experts do not know exactly why vaccinated individuals still contract mumps. They suspect it could have to do with the number of doses and the immune system not responding properly to the vaccine.

Dana Perella, program manager for the Acute Communicable Disease Program at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, said even though someone may have the MMR vaccine, cases can still occur years after vaccination, and the disease appears frequently on college campuses. "Mumps outbreaks can still occur, and in recent years, have been reported in settings like universities, where individuals have close, prolonged contact," Perella said.

Although contracting mumps is possible even with vaccination, symptoms are not as severe or life-threatening if vaccinated. Those symptoms include fever, painful, swollen salivary glands and pain while chewing or swallowing. There is currently no treatment for mumps, but the immune systems of vaccinated individuals can fight off the virus in several days.

Nene Okunna, Ph.D., assistant professor of interdisciplinary health services and public health specialist, said the outbreak is a public health issue resulting from people not vaccinating their children out of fear that vaccinations cause autism -- a connection that has been repeatedly disproved. "The problem is if people don't get vaccinated, then these diseases are spread across campus," Okunna said. "This is a problem particularly on university campuses because we have a lot of people on one campus. That's why it's so concerning what we are seeing at Temple."

St. Joe's requires all incoming freshman and transfer students to have 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, as well as 2 varicella, 4 polio and 4 tetanus/diphtheria/ pertussis with a booster within the past 10 years, according to Eileen Bevilacqua, director of the Student Health Center.

This is not the case at all universities. Some schools recommend rather than require vaccinations. Until the mumps outbreak, this was the case at Temple. "Temple did not have requirements for vaccine records other than meningitis, which is a federal law if a student lives in campus housing," Bevilacqua said. "On their website, they state they will now require proof of MMR, varicella and tetanus/ diphtheria/ pertussis of all incoming students."

Even though all St. Joe's students are required to have the MMR vaccine, Bevilacqua and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health still advise students to take precautionary measures, such as washing their hands, not sharing utensils and staying away from infected individuals for 5 days. "The SHC [Student Health Center] constantly discusses with students infection control measures such as washing your hands, coughing and sneezing into your sleeve and frequently wiping down surfaces that are touched regularly with a disinfectant wipe," Bevilacqua said.

[2] Ship outbreak
Date: Tue 19 Mar 2019
Source: CNN [edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/19/politics/new-virus-case-us-warship/index.html


A new case of a viral infection aboard a US navy warship was reported [Tue 19 Mar 2019], which means the USS Fort McHenry will continued to be quarantined at sea in the Middle East, according to the US Navy 5th Fleet.

The new case means 26 sailors and Marines have fallen ill on board since December [2018]. The Navy said it is awaiting findings from a medical team before deciding when the ship can be deemed safe to pull into a port.

Last week CNN reported that the Fort McHenry had essentially been quarantined at sea for over 2 months and has been unable to make a port call due the outbreak of the mumps-like virus. The 26 sailors and Marines aboard the amphibious warship have been diagnosed with parotitis, which causes symptoms similar to mumps, according to US military officials.

Until CNN asked about the incident, the US military had not disclosed it. "None of the cases are life-threatening and all have either already made or are expected to make a full recovery," the 5th Fleet said in a statement provided to CNN last week.

All 703 military personnel aboard the ship have received measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster vaccinations, according to the US Navy's 5th Fleet headquartered in Bahrain.

The ship is currently operating in the Persian Gulf region and military medical officials are assessing when it may be deemed medically safe to make a port call.

A US military official told CNN that when there are major disease outbreaks, a decision may be taken to halt port visits until 30 days after the last reported illness due to varying incubation periods. But the Fort McHenry did make a port call in early January in Romania when it was in the Black Sea before traveling back through the Mediterranean and into the Middle East.

After they became ill, the patients were quarantined and treated in the ship's medical facility. Living and work spaces were disinfected. None of the personnel had to be medivac'd off the ship and all are expected to make a full recovery. The ship, which carries Marines to perform amphibious warfare duties, did have some of its scheduled training modified to deal with the outbreak's impact.

[3] History of mumps and other vaccines

It was 1957 and Greg Cox, 7 years old, was at home in Altamont, Ill., a compress wrapped from chin to hairline. He was gazing wistfully out the window of the family's kitchen door at his younger brother, Doug, bundled up outdoors and ready to play. A sign was tacked to the door. "Greg can't play," it said. "MUMPS."

This was a decade before the start of the U.S. mumps vaccination program, and about 15 years before the combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella -- MMR -- was licensed in the U.S. In the early 1960s, hundreds of thousands of American children a year contracted those diseases. [...-more]

[A resurgence of mumps in the US among vaccinated young adults as seen in the above report [1] appears to be due to waning of vaccine-induced immunity, according to a recent analysis. Researchers found vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps lasts about 27 years after the last dose. The findings suggest that, in addition to the currently recommended 2 doses of mumps vaccine in childhood, a 3rd dose at age 18 may help sustain protection among adults. The study [was] published 21 Mar 2018, in Science Translational Medicine [full article is available at http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/433/eaao5945].

Earlier last year [2018] the MMWR published recommendations for a 3rd dose of mumps vaccine for those at particular risk of infection [reference below: subsequent numbered references can be found along with the full report at the URL below]: "A substantial increase in the number of mumps outbreaks and outbreak-associated cases has occurred in the United States since late 2015 (Lewnard JA and Grad YH. Vaccine waning and mumps re-emergence in the United States. Sci Transl Med. 2018; 10(433). pii: eaao5945. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aao5945; abstract available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29563321). To address this public health problem, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed the available evidence and determined that a 3rd dose of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and effective at preventing mumps. During its October 2017 meeting, ACIP recommended a 3rd dose of a mumps virus-containing vaccine for persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses who are identified by public health authorities as being part of a group or population at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak. The purpose of the recommendation is to improve protection of persons in outbreak settings against mumps disease and mumps-related complications. This recommendation supplements the existing ACIP recommendations for mumps vaccination."(Marin M, Marlow M, Moore KL and Patel M. Recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of a third dose of mumps virus-containing vaccine in persons at increased risk for mumps during an outbreak. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2018; 67(1): 33-8. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6701a7. Available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6701a7.htm.). - Mod.UBA
