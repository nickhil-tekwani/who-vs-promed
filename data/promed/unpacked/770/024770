The Minister of Environment and Water [Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates], Dr Rashid Bin Fahd, will be questioned at the Federal National Council's [FNC] meeting on Tuesday [17 Jun 2014] about a mystery disease that has killed more than 200 camels across the country and the control of wastewater treatment.

Mosabeh Saeed Al Katbi, a member from Sharjah, will put 2 questions to the Minister of Environment and Water about the spread of a mystery bug that has killed camels in the northern parts of Al Dhaid in Sharjah and the ensuing losses of farmers in the northern emirates as well as parts of Al Ain and Dubai.

Al Katbi warned the infection status has become a semi-epidemic, sending a wave of panic among farmers and scientists who are baffled as to what the disease is and its cause.

"The Ministry of Environment has to set up a contingency plan to closely monitor the situation, especially as the exact cause of this camel ailment is yet to be known," Al Katbi said.

Scientists had been investigating lines such as poisoning, antibiotic pollution, viruses, and climate change as possible causes.

An estimated 200 camels in Sharjah, Al Ain, and Dubai have died so far from the mystery bug.
