The source of an outbreak of food poisoning at a restaurant in Helsinki in June 2012 still remains a mystery. Some 28 diners were diagnosed with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona. Around 30 people became ill from a party of some 200 diners who gathered for a private function at a Helsinki restaurant. Almost all those affected were diagnosed as suffering from the same bacterial infection.

The Environmental Center of the city of Helsinki has examined the incident by means of a questionnaire together with the help of samples taken by the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). However, no food with the offending bacterium has been detected.

According to Riikka Aberg from the Environmental Centre, the precise cause [sic; source?] of such an epidemic is rarely determined. Final results will be ready in August 2012 when the questionnaire data are finally known.

Around 300 cases of salmonellosis are detected in the Finnish capital annually, of which around 10 percent are of domestic origin. An outbreak was last reported in Helsinki at the end of 2011 when more than 10 people fell ill after eating at the same luncheon diner.
