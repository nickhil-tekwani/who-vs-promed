SALMONELLOSIS, FROZEN CHICKEN DISHES - USA: ALERT

The USA government is urging consumers to thoroughly cook frozen
chicken dinners after 32 people in 12 states were sickened with
salmonellosis. The health warning by the USA Department of
Agriculture (USDA) cited frozen dishes in which the chicken is raw,
but breaded or pre-browned, giving the appearance of being cooked.
They include "chicken cordon bleu," "chicken Kiev," or chicken
breasts stuffed with cheese, vegetables, or other items.

USDA said many of the people who became ill apparently did not follow
the package's cooking instructions and microwaved the chicken dishes
even though the instructions did not provide for it. Microwaving
didn't heat the meals enough to kill the bacteria. The department
said consumers should cook chicken products to a minimum internal
temperature of 165 deg F (74 deg C).

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued the warning
Friday [3 Oct 2008] after Minnesota health officials found a link
between the chicken dinners with salmonella illnesses reported in
Minnesota and 11 other states. It did not name the states in its
release, and did not immediately respond to a message left at its
press office seeking that information.

The USA Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert due to concerns about
illness caused by _Salmonella_ that may be associated with raw,
frozen, breaded and pre-browned, stuffed chicken entrees.

This public health alert was initiated after an investigation and
testing conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota
Department of Agriculture determined there is an association between
products such as chicken cordon blue and chicken breast Kiev and 32
illnesses in Minnesota and 11 other states. The illnesses were linked
through the epidemiological investigation by their PFGE [pulsed field
gel electrophoresis] pattern (DNA fingerprint).

Although many of these stuffed chicken entrees were labeled with
instructions identifying the product was uncooked and did not include
microwave instruction for preparation, individuals who became ill did
not follow the cooking instructions and reportedly used a microwave
to prepare the product.

FSIS is reminding consumers of the critical importance of following
package cooking instructions for frozen, stuffed raw chicken products
and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any
raw meat or poultry. It is especially important to use a food
thermometer to check the internal temperature of these chicken
products such that all points of measurement are at least 165 deg F (74 deg C).

All poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal
temperature of 165 deg F (74 deg C) as determined by a food
thermometer. Using a food thermometer is the only way to know that
food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

Frozen, raw, breaded and pre-browned, stuffed chicken products
covered by this alert and similar products, may be stuffed or filled,
breaded or browned and therefore appear to be cooked. These items may
be labeled "chicken cordon bleu," "chicken Kiev" or chicken breast
stuffed with cheese, vegetables, or other items.

Consumption of food contaminated with _Salmonella_ can cause
salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses.
_Salmonella_ infections can be life-threatening, especially to those
with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons
with HIV infection or undergoing chemotherapy. The most common
symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever
within 8 to 72 hours. Additional symptoms may be chills, headache,
nausea, and vomiting that can last up to 7 days.

[This is the 3rd year in a row that this has been reported. The
serotype or serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ is not mentioned in
the posting. In 2007, Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- was involved in a
large (more than 270 cases in 35 states) outbreak. (A discussion on
salmonella nomenclature can be found in the previous ProMED-mail
posting "Salmonellosis, frozen poultry pie - USA (multistate) (04):
recall 20071013.3355"). In 2006, the outbreak was smaller and more
localized and involved serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium.

It cannot be overemphasized that following a packaged food cooking
and/or storage instructions is important to avoid such events.
Whether the packaging specifically stated that microwaving should not
be done is not clear. - Mod.LL]
