_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ -- near Melbourne, Australia.
--------------------------------------------------
A focus of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection has been identified at St.
Leonards, in Victoria, Australia. St. Leonards is a small coastal town of
some 2500 inhabitants on the Bellarine Peninsula, less than 50 km directly
south west of the central business district of Melbourne. The town is
separate from other areas where the disease is known to occur. 9 cases (8
confirmed by PCR and/or culture) who live in the town or who have had
contact with the town have been diagnosed with the infection since 1998. 6
cases have been reported in 2001, 5 of which were diagnosed in late
July/August 2001. They include 2 children, one an 18 month old boy with a
lesion on his right ear. This is the youngest known patient to have
developed _M. ulcerans_ infection in Australia and the only known
Australian case with disease affecting the head.
Inhabitants and clinicians in the area have been alerted. The source of the
outbreak has not been identified but environmental samples have been
obtained for _M. ulcerans_ DNA testing from ornamental lakes and open water
storages in the area.
