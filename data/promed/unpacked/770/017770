The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) said on
Tuesday [24 Jun 2008] outbreaks of _E. coli_ [O157:H7] in Michigan
and Ohio are linked, and health officials in both states suspect the
outbreak was caused by ground beef. Health officials in Michigan said
late Tuesday [24 Jun 2008] more than half of the 15 people in the
state with confirmed _E. coli_ cases reported purchasing ground beef
from Kroger Food Stores, the largest USA grocery chain.

"We were notified today that _E. coli_ illnesses reported in Michigan
and Ohio have been linked to products purchased in some of our stores
in those states," said Kroger spokeswoman Meghan Glynn in an e-mail.
She said the illnesses were reported between 31 May 2008 and 8 Jun
2008. "Any ground beef sold during that period is no longer available
in our stores," Glynn said.

Glynn said Ohio and Michigan health authorities have not identified
the supplier or the specific type of ground beef that caused the
illnesses. "We purchase our ground beef from major suppliers in the
industry and we are working with federal, state, and local agencies
to identify the supplier," she said.

As of late Monday [23 Jun 2008], the CDC said it had confirmed 24
cases of _E. coli_ that shared the same genetic fingerprint and
characteristics, indicating they were related. Of those 24, the CDC
said 11 cases were reported in Michigan and 13 in Ohio; 14 people
have been hospitalized, and one has developed a type of kidney
failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome, the CDC said. No deaths
have been reported.

Kristopher Weiss, a spokesman for the Ohio health department, said
there are now 17 cases in Ohio and the state is investigating 2
additional probable cases.

Michigan health officials said there are 15 confirmed cases that are
genetically linked and 10 of those people have been hospitalized.

Kroger's spokeswoman said concerned customers in Michigan and Ohio,
especially near the cities of Columbus and Toledo, should discard any
ground beef in their freezers purchased in late May or early June
[2008]. Glynn said Kroger will refund their purchase price.

Weiss said a sample of raw ground beef provided by one of the
infected patients in Ohio tested positive for _E. coli_ 0157:H7 at
the state's agricultural lab. That sample has been forwarded to the
Ohio Department of Health for testing.

The CDC said all ground beef should be cooked thoroughly to an
internal temperature of 160 deg F (71.1 deg C).

[At this point, as the number of cases has grown, ground beef seems
to be the vehicle. Possible "smoking" ground beef has been identified
and the O157:H7 strain isolated from the food sample is now being
examined to see if it is the outbreak strain. It is more than likely
that it is.

The proper cooking of ground beef cannot be overemphasized as the
major control step that the consumer can use to avoid this
potentially fatal disease. Unlike lettuce and spinach as vehicles,
which have a short shelf-life, frozen ground beef can be stored much
longer. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the source of
the ground beef sold at the Kroger stores. - Mod.LL
