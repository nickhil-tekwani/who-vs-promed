A new case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus-related infection has been registered in the kingdom [of Jordan], the Health Ministry said Sunday [30 Aug 2015].

The diagnosed 56-year-old patient suffers from diabetes, blood pressure-related diseases and kidney failure, said Mohammad Abdullat, director of the ministry's communicable diseases control department.

The patient also recently underwent open-heart surgery, Abdullat added. A team from the directorate is supervising the private hospital's measures to prevent the spread of the infection and is also following up on the situation of the patient's relatives and the medical staff who examined him. Since the MERS virus was 1st registered in Jordan in 2012, 17 cases have been recorded.

[This is now the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Jordan in the past week. Reading between the lines, it appears as though the individual may have been part of the nosocomial transmission reported the other day (see MERS-CoV (119): Jordan, Saudi Arabia, nosocomial 20150828.3608888).

The addition of this newly confirmed case raises the number of cases reported in Jordan to 24, including those 7 retrospectively confirmed through serologic testing involved in the 1st MERS-CoV outbreak in April 2012 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (31): Jordan, retro. case ID, WHO, RFI 20130617.1777989).

[The addition of these 6 newly confirmed cases and 2 newly reported deaths brings the total number of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 1184, including 509 deaths (reported case fatality rate 43.0 percent). Yesterday's (30 Aug 2015) cautious optimism that the outbreak in Riyadh may be coming under control may have been overly optimistic, albeit one should be cautious in interpreting cases by date of report rather than by date of onset (the latter date not reported as part of the daily case reports by the Saudi MOH but rather in the periodic updates reported by WHO).

There have been a total of 127 MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during the month of August 2015, of which 120 were reported from Riyadh. During this same period, there were 42 deaths reported, of which 40 were reported from Riyadh.

[3] Saudi Arabia, hospital for MERS patients attending Hajj - media report

The Ministry of Health has designated King Abdullah Medical Complex in North Obhur to handle possible cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the current Hajj season.

Any suspected MERS case among the Hajj pilgrims will be airlifted to the hospital, Al-Madinah daily reported, quoting a ministry source.

The 500-bed complex has a special center for the treatment of MERS. "All arrangements are in place to receive MERS patients at the complex.

An experimental air-evacuation was carried out recently," the source said. The ministry has said 15 more people have died in the kingdom after contracting the virus in the last 7 days amid a surge in infections in the capital, Riyadh.

The ministry's most recent figures on Thursday [27 Aug 2015] show that 498 people have died in Saudi Arabia after contracting the virus since it was 1st identified in 2012, compared to 483 a week ago.

The kingdom also registered 47 new cases in the past 7 days, all but 2 in Riyadh. That brings the total number nationwide to 1165, with 64 receiving treatment and 603 fully recovered. [Note that today's (31 Aug 2015) tally has a total of 1184 cases and 509 deaths. - Mod.MPP]

[It is comforting to see that there is a plan for dealing with possible MERS-CoV infected individuals as part of the Hajj health services provision. Presumably, the medical staff accompanying all Hajj groups internationally will have received training on MERS-CoV, and testing will be available at point of service to permit rapid identification of cases and rapid isolation. - Mod.MPP]
