Flood in Bangladesh and Diarrheal Outbreak
Dhaka, August 07, 1998. The government source disclosed that the number of
diarrhea cases in the flood affected areas are 54,000. Around 3,000 new
diarrhea cases have been recorded today. Flood situation is improving in
some districts. However, newspapers say that increasing number of diarrhea
and dysentery cases are being reported in those districts. Non-government
private sources claim that number of diarrheal patients could exceed
100,000. Children and people sheltered in the flood camps are mostly
affected. The flood rehabilitation teams of the government, NGOs and other
organizations are distributing food, cloths and water purifying tablets.
The Prime Minister has expressed in a recent speech during her visit in the
flood affected areas that around 3,000 medical teams are working so that
post flood disease outbreak can be kept within control. However, newspapers
say that effective control has not yet been possible.

[Gastro-intestinal outbreaks are inevitable following severe flooding,
because the drinking water supply becomes contaminated by sewage.
Commonest causes of diarrhea are cholera, _Salmonella typhi_ (typhoid) &
_S.paratyphi_ (paratyphoid), and of dysentery, _Shigella_. - Mod.JW
