19 people exposed to 2 rabid cats found in the Lehigh Valley
----------------
2 stray cats found in Lehigh County recently tested positive for rabies, prompting health officials to issue an alert to residents.

The Allentown Health Bureau said in a news release on Thursday that a resident who found the cats on the streets had brought them to the Lehigh County Humane Society.

"In both cases, the cat was sent for rabies testing to the Pennsylvania Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories after exhibiting aggressive behavior, including the biting and scratching of people who had handled them," the release states.

As of Thursday, the health bureau had identified 19 residents, including 11 in 1 family, who have been exposed to the cats. Each is receiving post-exposure vaccinations and is under medical care, according to the release.

The bureau says in the release that 1 of the cats was found on Baker Drive in South Allentown and the other was picked up along Vera Cruz Road outside of Coopersburg.

"While rabies has been seen locally in wild animals, such as skunks, raccoons and bats, rabid cats are a rare occurrence within the city," Allentown Associate Director of Health Jeff Stout says in a statement.

The Allentown Health Bureau says residents should take the following precautions to prevent rabies:
- Vaccinate your pets against rabies. Rabies shots need to be boosted, so check your pet's records or talk to your veterinarian.
- When walking or hiking with your dog, protect them and wildlife by keeping your dog on a leash.
- Keep cats and other pets inside to reduce the risk of exposure to wildlife and other domestic animals.
- Keep dogs within your sight (in a fenced yard, or on leash) during the day while outside.

Contact your veterinarian promptly if you believe your pet has been exposed to a wild animal.

Do not touch or feed wild animals. Wild animals like skunks and foxes adapt to residential environments if food is available -- please don't leave pet food outdoors.

If you or a family member is bitten or scratched by a wild or unknown animal, call your doctor and Animal Control at 610-437-7535.

If you encounter a lost or stray dog or cat, contact the City of Allentown Animal Control office at 610-437-7535 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday or the Lehigh County Humane Society after hours and on weekends and holidays at 610-791-1112.

[2] Connecticut - human exposure, skunk

A Watertown [CT] woman is undergoing a series of vaccinations after being bitten by a rabid skunk outside her home.

Faith Lustik of Jefferson County Public Health said the woman was outside her home on State Street on the city's east side Thursday when the animal attacked.

Watertown police responded to the scene and shot the skunk, Lustik said. The animal was also seen fighting with another skunk, but officials were unable to find it.

Rabies is a fatal disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. It may take several weeks to several months for rabies symptoms to appear. Early treatment after an exposure can prevent rabies.

Any mammal can get rabies, but it is most often seen in bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes.

Public Health has tips to help prevent rabies:
1. Teach children to stay away from unfamiliar animals, either wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly.
2. Do not leave pet food outside as it attracts wildlife to your home.
3. Wash any wound from an animal thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately.
4. Be a responsible pet owner by keeping your pet's vaccinations current. Getting your pet vaccinated by your vet or at a clinic can help stop the spread of rabies from wild animals to humans.

[Remember to vaccinate your animal, even horses -- as ANY mammal can get rabies. Having your animal vaccinated against this disease builds a barrier between you and the disease, and may save your pet's life. - Mod.TG
