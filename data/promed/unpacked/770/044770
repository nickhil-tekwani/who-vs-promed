Chikungunya Fever Diagnosed Among International Travelers -- United
States, 2005 --2006
-----------------
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus indigenous to tropical
Africa and Asia, where it is transmitted to humans by the bite of
infected mosquitoes, usually of the genus Aedes (1).
Chikungunya (CHIK) fever, the disease caused by CHIKV, was first
recognized in epidemic form in East Africa during 1952-1953. The word
"chikungunya" is thought to derive from description in local dialect
of the contorted posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint
pain associated with this disease. Because CHIK fever epidemics are
sustained by human-mosquito-human transmission, the epidemic cycle is
similar to those of dengue and urban yellow fever. Large outbreaks of
CHIK fever have been reported recently on several islands in the
Indian Ocean and in India (refs. 2-6). In 2006, CHIK fever cases also
have been reported in travelers returning from known outbreak areas
to Europe, Canada, the Caribbean (Martinique), and South America
(French Guyana) (2,3,5-7). During 2005-2006, 12 cases of CHIK fever
were diagnosed serologically and virologically at CDC in travelers
who arrived in the United States from areas known to be epidemic or
endemic for CHIK fever. This report describes 4 of these cases and
provides guidance to health-care providers.
Clinicians should be alert for additional cases among travelers, and
public health officials should be alert to evidence of local
transmission of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), introduced through
infection of local mosquitoes by a person with viremia.
Case Reports
------
Minnesota. On 12 May 2005, an adult male resident of Minnesota
returned from a 3-month trip to Somalia and Kenya. He had onset of
illness hours after arrival in the United States, including fever,
headache, malaise, and joint pain mainly in a shoulder and a knee.
Serum obtained on 13 May [2006] was tested at CDC and determined to
be equivocal for CHIKV RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), consistent with low-level viremia. A recent CHIKV
infection was confirmed by demonstration of IgM antibody in this
acute-phase serum specimen and neutralizing antibody in
convalescent-phase serum (collected 214 days after illness onset).
Arthralgias resolved after several weeks.
Louisiana. On 15 Jan 2006, an adult female resident of India had
onset of an illness characterized by fever, joint pain (in the knees,
wrists, hands, and feet), and muscle pain (in the thighs and neck).
In March 2006, she traveled to Louisiana, where she sought medical
attention for persistent joint pain. At CDC, tests of a single serum
sample collected on 30 Mar [2006] (74 days after illness onset) were
positive for IgM and neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV. The patient
was subsequently lost to follow-up.
Maryland. An adult female resident of Maryland visited the island of
Reunion in the Indian Ocean from October 2005 through mid-March 2006.
On 18 Feb 2006, during an ongoing CHIK fever outbreak on the island,
she had onset of fever, joint pain (in the hands and feet), and rash.
A local physician clinically diagnosed CHIK fever, but no laboratory
tests were conducted. After returning to the United States, the
patient sought medical attention for persistent joint pain. At CDC,
tests of a single serum sample collected on 22 Mar [2006](32 days
after illness onset) were equivocal for IgM and positive for
neutralizing antibody to CHIKV, consistent with a recent CHIKV
infection in which IgM antibody was waning. At 5 months after onset,
the patient had persistent joint pain (in the hands and feet).
Colorado. An adult male resident of Colorado visited Zimbabwe during
17 Apr -- 29 May 2006. On 29 Apr [2006], he had onset of illness with
fever, chills, joint pain (in the wrists and ankles), and neck
stiffness; a rash appeared a few days later. All symptoms resolved
within 2 weeks, except for joint pain, which persisted for
approximately 1 month. At CDC, tests of a single serum sample
collected on 12 Jun [2006] (44 days after illness onset) were
positive for IgM and neutralizing antibody to CHIKV.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Most CHIKV infections are symptomatic (8). In clinical infections,
the incubation period typically is 2-4 days. Illness is characterized
by sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, arthralgias or
arthritis, myalgias, and low back pain. Skin rash occurs in
approximately half of cases (9). Joint symptoms can be severe and
involve small and large joints. Although CHIK fever typically lasts
3-7 days and full recovery is the usual outcome, certain patients
experience persistent joint symptoms for weeks or months and
occasionally years after illness onset (1).
Serious complications (e.g., neuroinvasive disease) are rare, and
fatal cases have not been documented conclusively. Transplacental
CHIKV transmission and severe congenital CHIKV disease have been
described (10). CHIKV infection is believed to confer life-long immunity (1).
Because no specific drug therapy is available, treatment of CHIK
fever is supportive. No licensed CHIKV vaccine exists. Therefore,
prevention recommendations for travelers to tropical Asia and Africa
should emphasize mosquito repellent and avoidance measures.

During May 2004-May 2006, approximately 300 000 suspected CHIK fever
cases were reported on islands in the Indian Ocean, including
approximately 264 000 suspected cases on Reunion, a French overseas
department (2,3). Other affected areas included Mombasa, Kenya, and
the islands of Comoros, Lamu, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, and the
Seychelles. In addition, since early 2006, an estimated 180 000
suspected CHIK fever cases have occurred in the Indian states of
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra (4). In recent years,
extensive CHIKV activity also has been documented in Southeast Asia
(9). In 2006, as of 11 May, approximately 340 imported CHIK fever
cases were reported in Europe, mainly in France, reflecting the high
frequency of travel between Europe and islands in the Indian Ocean
(2). To date, no known local mosquito-borne CHIKV transmission has
occurred in Europe or other nonindigenous areas.
_Aedes aegypti_ is the primary CHIKV vector in Asia, but _Ae.
albopictus_ (the Asian tiger mosquito) likely was the primary vector
in Reunion (2,3). In Asia, CHIKV epidemics involve a human-mosquito
cycle, with humans serving as the sole vertebrate amplifying hosts
(1). In Africa, sylvatic cycles involving nonhuman primates and
forest-dwelling Aedes species (e.g., _Ae. furcifer_) also occur. Most
CHIKV epidemics occur during the tropical rainy season and abate
during the dry season (1,9). Human CHIKV infections include a
transient, high-titered viremia (typically detectable during the
first 2 days of illness, ranging up to 6 days after illness onset)
that is adequate to infect feeding mosquitoes (1). _Ae. aegypti_ and
_Ae. albopictus_ are abundant peridomestic species and aggressive
daytime blood-feeders in all tropical and most subtropical areas of
the world, and _Ae. albopictus_ now lives in many temperate areas of
the eastern and western hemispheres, including Europe and th!
e United States. Therefore, some risk exists that CHIKV might be
introduced into previously nonendemic areas by travelers with
viremia, leading to local transmission of the virus, especially in
tropical or subtropical areas of the United States (e.g., the Gulf
Coast and Hawaii) or its territories (e.g., Guam, Puerto Rico, and
the U.S. Virgin Islands). Early recognition of local transmission
followed by prompt, aggressive vector control and other public health
measures might prevent long-term establishment of the virus in new
areas. Of the 4 patients described in this report, 3 posed no
substantial public health risk because they probably no longer had
viremia upon arrival in the United States; although the 4th patient
was likely viremic upon arrival in Minnesota in mid-May, transmission
to competent local mosquito vectors in that climate was unlikely.
In early illness, the clinical features of CHIK fever can be similar
to those of dengue and malaria, especially in patients without joint
symptoms. In both dengue and CHIK fever, rash usually is generalized
and maculopapular, but petechial rashes occur in certain dengue
cases. During 1991-2004, 9 confirmed or probable cases of CHIK fever
were diagnosed serologically at CDC among travelers to the United
States (CDC, unpublished data, 2006). Additional imported but
unrecognized cases likely occurred. Clinicians should be aware of
possible CHIKV infection in travelers returning from
CHIK-fever--endemic or outbreak areas, particularly if an acute
febrile illness with arthralgias or arthritis occurs. Suspected cases
should be reported promptly to local and state public health
officials and to CDC. Mosquito exposure should be strictly avoided
(e.g., by staying within a screened environment and using barrier
clothing and repellents) during the first week of illness to prevent infecti!
on of local mosquitoes.
In the United States, diagnostic tests for CHIKV infection are not
available commercially but are available at CDC by special
arrangement through state health departments. Laboratory diagnosis
depends on antibody-capture IgM ELISA and plaque-reduction
neutralization tests of serum. Comparative serologic tests for
closely related alphaviruses (e.g., o'nyong-nyong and Sindbis
viruses) should be conducted as geographically appropriate, and tests
for dengue usually are indicated. Virus isolation attempts and PCR
assays are performed selectively. Serologic tests should be performed
on both acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens collected at
least 2 weeks apart, but clinicians should not delay submission of
acute-phase samples pending collection of convalescent-phase samples.
To arrange submission of specimens to CDC for diagnostic testing,
clinicians should consult their state public health laboratory and
CDC's Arboviral Diseases Branch (telephone, 970-221-6400). Specimen
shipping and handling instructions are available at

[Given the CHIK cases that have come into continental Europe and the
UK, it is not surprising that infected individuals are coming into
the USA as well. Taking accurate travel histories of such patients
will be critical if CHIKV infection is to be suspected, followed by
rapid laboratory diagnosis and aggressive vector control in the
locale where the possibly viremic patients reside. - Mod.TY]
