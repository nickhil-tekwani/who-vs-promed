Indonesia: 9th human avian influenza death
------------------------------------------
An Indonesian man who died last month has been confirmed as the country's
9th bird flu victim. Tests in Hong Kong showed that the 35 year old man
died from the lethal H5N1 serotype of avian influenza virus, a top
Indonesian health official said. The official, Hariadi Wibisono, said the
man had a history of contact with poultry but gave no more details. The
Hong Kong laboratory is affiliated with the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The H5N1 virus has killed at least 70 people in South East Asia since the
latest outbreak began in 2003. The latest victim lived in a residential
areas in the capital, Jakarta, where he had contact with chickens that
carried the virus, reports say. Five other people have contracted the H5N1
bird flu virus but survived in Indonesia, according to WHO.

Indonesia: 9th human death from avian influenza confirmed
---------------------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: The Indonesian authorities have confirmed their 9th human death
[and 14th case - Mod.CP] from avian influenza, senior Health Ministry
officials said on Tue 13 Dec 2005, taking the global death toll from the
disease to 71, all in Asia. A Hong Kong laboratory affiliated with the
World Health Organization confirmed an Indonesian had died from H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection. "We have received confirmation." The death toll
is now 9, Hariadi Wibisono told Reuters. The victim was a 35 year old man
who died last month, making him the latest confirmed death in Indonesia,
the world's fourth-most populous nation.
Another senior health ministry official told Reuters the man lived in West
Jakarta where he had contact with live chickens that carried the H5N1
virus. "He was building his house and around it there were many chickens
and birds running free. Researchers tested those birds and they were
positive" carriers of H5N1, said I Nyoman Kandun, director general of
disease control at the health ministry. He added that the man had died in a
local hospital before he could be treated at the government-designated
hospital for avian influenza patients. The H5N1 virus has killed 71 out of
138 people known to have been infected. Five other people have been
confirmed to have contracted the virus in Indonesia but have survived.
Separately, WHO regional director for South East Asia Samlee Plianbangchang
said in Jakarta that Indonesia must have good teamwork between the
ministries of agriculture and health to prevent the virus from infecting
more people. "I think it's a matter of working together. They have to
cooperate and education to the people is very important," Plianbangchang
told reporters. He was speaking during a visit to recognize the Indonesian
health ministry for its efforts after last December's tsunami disaster.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus is endemic in poultry in
parts of Asia, and has affected birds in two thirds of the provinces in
Indonesia, an archipelago of some 17 000 islands and 220 million people.
The country has millions of chickens and ducks, many in the backyards of
rural or urban homes. Plianbangchang said culling was not effective for
cash-strapped Indonesia, due to the high number of backyard fowl, and
vaccination for poultry may be a better approach. "We have to make sure
there will be no transmission of the bird flu virus from chicken to man.
Therefore, we have to control bird flu in chickens, then automatically bird
flu in man is under control," he said.
Jakarta is preparing an early bird flu warning system aimed at reaching
remote areas to speed up reporting of any outbreaks. The "village
preparedness policy" involves local governments setting up health posts in
all villages, where personnel including doctors would be alert to flu cases
in birds and humans, particularly in infected areas.
