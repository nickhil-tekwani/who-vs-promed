An elderly man is dead and 4 more people have been isolated in different hospitals as a result of an outbreak of Congo fever [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] in Namibia. The 4 new cases have been admitted to hospitals for treatment and observation purposes in different regions across the country.

Selma Robert, National Surveillance Officer on the spread of disease in the Ministry of Health confirmed that a 77-year-old man died as a result of the viral infection on [Tue 7 May 2019].

Robert said the diseased elderly man was the neighbour of the 1st confirmed Congo fever case patient, a 54-year-old female from Ontananga village [Oshikoto region] who visited the health facility with complaints of tick-bite, headache, body weakness and blood-stained vomit on [26 Apr 2019]. She added that the 54-year-old female is still alive and is under medical treatment and tight observation.

According to Robert of the 4 new incidents of possible infection, 2 patients were admitted and isolated in the Oshikoto region, one in Outapi [Omusati region], and one person in Windhoek [Komas region].

Robert added that Congo fever has been a seasonal occurrence in Namibia with outbreaks in different towns reported in places such as Gobabis [Omaheke region] last year [2018], Keetmanshoop [!Karas region], and the Omusati region in previous years.

She stated that infected ticks are almost everywhere in the country and that the situation is worsened by the drought as human to animal contact has increased due to the deteriorating health of livestock.

She advised members of the public to wear bright clothing in high risk areas in order to easily notice if they have ticks on them and to wear protective clothing and gloves when handling animals.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks and death in humans.

Symptoms of Congo fever include muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may also be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion.

The disease was first described in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, and linkage of the 2 place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.

[From the information above, it is quite possible that one the 4 suspected cases mentioned had contact with the recently reported fatal case (see Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Africa (05): Namibia (OT) 20190509.6460573) but information on the remaining cases is not available. Further epidemiological data and the final laboratory results in this regard would be quite helpful and any updates would be appreciated. - Mod.UBA
