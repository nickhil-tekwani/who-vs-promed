The deaths of 69 children from acute kidney injury in Gambia is linked to 4 cough syrups made in India and imported into the West African country via a US-based pharmaceutical company, the Gambian police said in a preliminary investigation report on Tuesday [11 Oct 2022].

World Health Organization (WHO) investigators had already found "unacceptable" levels of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, which can be toxic, in 4 products made by New Delhi-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

The police report did not name Maiden directly but listed the company's same 4 products which were mentioned by the WHO: Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup.

Atlanta-based Atlantic Pharmaceuticals Company Ltd, which has permission to export medicines into Gambia, ordered a combined total of 50 000 bottles of those syrups, according to the police report.

"It is established from the aforesaid sum of 50 000 bottles of contaminated baby syrups, 41 462 bottles have been quarantined/seized...and 8538 bottles remained unaccounted for," the statement said, adding investigations were ongoing.

Atlantic Pharmaceuticals could not be reached for comment. Maiden told Reuters last week it was trying to find out details.

Gambian authorities launched a probe in September [2022] after doctors in July noticed a number of children developed symptoms of kidney failure after taking a locally sold paracetamol syrup used to treat fevers. Kidney injuries have caused 69 child deaths, according to the government, which has suspended sales of all brands of paracetamol cough syrup and recalled it from pharmacies and households.

The contaminated Maiden Pharma syrups have so far only been distributed in Gambia, although they may have arrived elsewhere through informal markets.

"We are all victims of the malpractice from manufacturers. As a country, we don't have all the resources and the personnel. We don't have a drug testing laboratory," Health Minister Ahmad Lamin Samateh said last week.

International partners will help the country tighten medicine monitoring systems and import regulations, he added, noting the government was taking action against manufacturers in India.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an alert over 4 cough and cold syrups made by Maiden Pharmaceuticals in India, warning they could be linked to the deaths of 66 children in the Gambia. The UN health agency also cautioned the contaminated medications may have been distributed outside the West African country, with global exposure "possible".

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters the 4 cold and cough syrups in question "have been potentially linked with acute kidney injuries and 66 deaths among children The loss of these young lives is beyond heartbreaking for their families." Tedros said WHO was also "conducting further investigation with the company and regulatory authorities in India".

According to the medical product alert issued by WHO Wednesday [5 Oct 2022], the 4 products are Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup. On Thursday [6 Oct 2022], Gambian authorities began collecting paracetamol and promethazine syrup from rural households in the West Coast Region and Upper River Region.

A Gambian health ministry investigation, which began in July [2022] and is ongoing, also cited the _E. coli_ bacteria as a possible cause of the acute kidney failure outbreak. [The _E. coli_ possible cause seems to have been speculated before the investigation had much traction. - Mod.TG]

"The preliminary results from the ongoing investigation indicate it is most probably the paracetamol and promethazine syrups which caused the acute kidney injury cases in this outbreak," Abubacarr Jagne, the nephrologist leading the health ministry's investigation, told AFP Wednesday [5 Oct 2022]. Health authorities had on 23 Sep 2022 ordered a recall of all medicines containing paracetamol or promethazine syrup.

The Gambia experienced its severest flooding in years in July [2022], causing sewers and latrines to overflow. [This is likely where the possibility of _E. coli_ may have surfaced. - Mod.TG]

"Since July 2022, there has been an increase in the number of severe kidney disease with high fatality among children mainly following diarrheal diseases," the ministry said in a statement in September. _E. coli_ bacteria were found in the stools of many children, but many had also taken paracetamol syrup, it said.

"To date, the stated manufacturer has not provided guarantees to WHO on the safety and quality of these products," the alert said, adding laboratory analysis of samples of the products "confirms they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants".

Those substances are toxic to humans and can be fatal, it said, adding the toxic effect "can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state and acute kidney injury which may lead to death".

Maiden Pharma declined to comment when approached by Reuters, while calls and messages to the Drugs Controller General of India went unanswered.

Two people from India's health ministry told Reuters that India is investigating the deaths and Maiden manufactured and exported the syrup only to the west African nation. India's government has asked the WHO to share its report linking the deaths with the cough syrup and will take "all required steps in the matter", the people said.

WHO said information received from India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation indicated that the manufacturer had only supplied the contaminated medications to the Gambia.

"However, the supply of these products through informal or unregulated markets to other countries in Africa, cannot be ruled out," the UN agency said in an email. "In addition, the manufacturer may have used the same contaminated material in other products and distributed them locally or exported," it warned. "Global exposure is therefore possible."

Tedros urged caution, calling on all countries to work to "detect and remove these products from circulation to prevent further harm to patients".

[Diethylene glycol was previously mentioned in some of the ProMED posts as a possible cause of the situation. Readers are encouraged to read the previous posting regarding the ingredients of the cough syrup (see See Also section below).

We are most sorry for the affected families. We urge the authorities to establish testing prior to distribution. Any remaining product should be withdrawn from distribution. Other countries should carefully check these products. - Mod.TG]

[This large outbreak of fatal acute kidney failure in children in Gambia was associated with use of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) syrup. Paracetamol syrup used in Gambia has subsequently been found to be contaminated with diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, both known nephrotoxins. Large outbreaks associated with pharmaceutical products contaminated with diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol have been described in the past (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.311.6997.88 and https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00043194.htm). - Mod.ML
