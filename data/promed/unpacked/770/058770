National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Colorado State University (CSU) scientists have provided experimental evidence supporting dromedary camels as the primary reservoir, or carrier, of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The study, designed by scientists from CSU and NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, involved 3 healthy camels exposed through the eyes, nose and throat to MERS-CoV isolated from a patient. Each camel developed a mild upper respiratory tract infection consistent with what scientists have observed throughout the Middle East.

Samples taken from the camels showed high levels of infectious virus in secretions, primarily from the nose, for up to a week after infection; the scientists detected components of the virus for up to 35 days. Although the camels quickly recovered from infection without apparent complications, the researchers say the nasal secretions provide a likely source of transmission to people who handle the animals.

The researchers theorize that vaccinating camels could reduce the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to people and other camels; NIAID and others are supporting research to develop candidate vaccines for potential use in people and camels. The MERS outbreak, which began in 2012, continues throughout the Middle East. Since the outbreak began, NIAID researchers have focused on understanding how the virus causes disease and how it can be treated effectively. As of 23 Jul 2014, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 837 human cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 291 deaths [see comment below].

Abstract
--------
In 2012, a novel coronavirus associated with severe respiratory disease in humans emerged in the Middle East. Epidemiologic investigations identified dromedary camels as the likely source of zoonotic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here we provide experimental support for camels as a reservoir for MERS-CoV. We inoculated 3 adult camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV and a transient, primarily upper respiratory tract infection developed in each of the 3 animals. Clinical signs of the MERS-CoV infection were benign, but each of the camels shed large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract. We detected infectious virus in nasal secretions through 7 days postinoculation, and viral RNA up to 35 days postinoculation. The pattern of shedding and propensity for the upper respiratory tract infection in dromedary camels may help explain the lack of systemic illness among naturally infected camels and the means of efficient camel-to-camel and camel-to-human transmission.

Discussion [for the omitted references, please go to the full text at source URL above]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiologic and surveillance data on the emergence of MERS-CoV strongly point toward a role for dromedary camels as a reservoir for zoonotic transmission. To understand the ecology of MERS-CoV in the most likely reservoir host, we experimentally inoculated 3 young adult dromedary camels with MERS-CoV. The disease observed was clinically benign, in agreement with the absence of overt illness reported from field surveillance studies. A large quantity of MERS-CoV and viral RNA was detected in nasal swab specimens from each of the 3 camels. Infectious virus was detected through 7 dpi [days postinoculation], and RNA was detected through 35 dpi in camel 3, which was euthanized on day 42. This route of shedding is consistent with data on naturally infected camels, and the pattern of shedding suggests that the infectious period of camels may be short. MERS-CoV was not detected in either urine or feces, again consistent with field observations.

The large quantities of MERS-CoV shed in nasal secretions by each of the 3 camels suggest that camel-to-camel and camel-to-human transmission may occur readily through direct contact and large droplet, or possibly fomite transmission. Histopathologic examination revealed that the URT [upper respiratory tract], specifically the respiratory epithelium in the nasal turbinates, is the predominant site of MERS-CoV replication in camels.

Neutralizing antibodies were detected from 14 dpi onward, reaching a maximum neutralizing titer of 640 after 35 days. Serologic studies in camels in the field have reported MERS-CoV neutralizing titers as high as 5120, potentially indicative of repeated exposure and re-infection.

The study reported here was done on the basis of inoculation of 3 male animals with a human isolate of MERS-CoV, and the study design we used imposed several limitations on how these data inform what occurs in natural infections. The camels we inoculated were exposed to a high dose of virus by 3 simultaneous routes of inoculation. In retrospect, the inoculation dose does not seem excessive, based on the large quantity of virus shed nasally in all 3 animals (Fig 2 at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/12/14-1280_article#tnF2). The total dose inoculated was relatively equivalent to the amount of virus present in a single nasal swab sample taken during the 1st days postinoculation, and it seems probable that a camel shedding this quantity of virus would readily infect other camels or humans with which it had direct contact. The fact that we inoculated the camels with the virus by 3 routes precludes drawing conclusions regarding efficiency of transmission by a particular route, which is a topic that should be addressed in future studies. The influence of camel age on susceptibility and dynamics of virus shedding is another notable parameter that requires further study. It seems likely that productive infection and shedding of virus in natural settings occurs predominantly in juvenile camels. This could be the result of an intrinsic difference in age-related susceptibility, but is more likely related to the immunologically naive status of the animals in the context of a high force of infection after decay of passively acquired antibodies. The animals we infected were young adults, but were seronegative and therefore probably as susceptible as juveniles from MERS-CoV-endemic regions. Another aspect of pathogenesis not addressed here is whether virus is present in milk or meat from infected camels and thereby poses another potential route of exposure to humans who consume such products. Despite these limitations, the magnitude and pattern of virus shedding was essentially identical in all 3 animals and supports the available epidemiologic data indicating that camels are likely a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. Additional experimental and field studies are clearly required to address the duration of shedding of infectious MERS-CoV from infected camels, to determine whether infection results in protective immunity, and to clarify the burden of illness among humans resulting from transmission from camels.

[The experimental infection trial described is a commendable step forward in the study of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of MERS-CoV. This rather small-scale experimental infection trial provides basic data which will enable planning and performance of additional trials of larger scale.

On top of nasal secretion from affected camels found as being the major potential source for MERS-CoV infection to camels and humans, the non-detection of the agent in either urine or feces is another significant finding. Other issues remain to be addressed in further trials, including the duration of shedding of infectious MERS-CoV from infected camels, reinfection potential, duration of post-infection antibodies, and the possible role of camel milk and meat as vehicles of the virus. The absence of identification of the virus in urine and feces is curious, as clinical disease with MERS-CoV in humans has included diarrhea and primary renal failure, suggesting both gastrointestinal and renal involvement. Is the absence of virus in urine and feces a function of true absence of involvement or just related to a small sample size (3 camels)?

It would be interesting to note the age (years/months) of the experimental "young adult" animals and their origin (for example, had they been kept in contact with other animal species, such as cattle?).

Between October 2013 and September 2014, MERS-CoV was detected in dromedary camels in Kuwait (5), Qatar (4), Oman (5), and UAE (1) and in October 2012 in a bat in Saudi Arabia. It was detected also in milk samples in Qatar. Saudi Arabia has not (yet) notified the OIE of MERS-CoV infection in camels. - Mods.AS/MPP
