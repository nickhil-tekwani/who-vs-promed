[The significance of the above report remains to be cautiously assessed. According to the given information, a total of 443 animals, including cattle, sheep, goats and camels, the respective numbers of each nor their age distribution, husbandry or origin not given, were sampled in 4 locations along the border with Niger, apparently on a single day [Tue 11 Jul 2017]. Reportedly, the samples were serologically tested for RVF on the same day (rate of seropositive animals and their details not given). The event was apparently "resolved" on the very same day.

The above information is in need of clarification, including the "Reason for notification" presented as "1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country." According to available literature, RVF virus was isolated in Nigeria and antibodies recorded in animals as early as 1959 (ref 1). In 1967-1970 the virus was isolated from mosquitoes and culicoides (Ref 2, 3); in 1980, antibodies were demonstrated in human (Ref 4).

The above and additional historical information on RVF in Nigeria can be found in the Ref 5 review.

According to Nigeria's 2016 annual report to the OIE, RVF is included among the diseases "Never reported".
