Residents in northeastern Thailand on alert after 5 die of dengue fever
--------------------------------------------
Residents in a northeastern Thai provinces have been warned to keep
alerted of dengue fever after 5 people recently died of the
mosquito-born disease.

The public in the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima is being
urged to protect themselves against the infection and to see a doctor
if they are suffering from high fever, vomiting or bloody stools, a
senior public health official named Samrueng Yangkratok on Thursday
was quoted by Bangkok Post as saying.

5 people have recently died of dengue fever in the central district
of the province lying some 259 kilometers northeastern of Bangkok, he
said.

Besides, around 1300 people have fallen ill from the disease, most of
them children aged 10-14.

In early September 2004, the public health officials have warned a
possible rebound of dengue fever in next year despite of the
country's success in fighting down the disease in the past 2 years.

The dengue fever is expected to flare up early in 2005 as part of its
3-year cycle, and the authorities are now trying to map out risky
areas so as to prevent further spread, said the Public Health
Ministry's Dengue Fever Control Division's head Kitti Pramatpol.

As of 28 Aug 2004, the number of dengue cases reported in the country
had reached 22 438, about half of the number registered in the same
period of 2003.

Mosquito Ovitrap index falls in August
----------------------------------------
The monthly ovitrap index, which reflects the distribution of the
mosquito vector [_Aedes albopictus_ - Mod.MS] for dengue fever
transmission, was 17.7 percent last month [August 2004], compared
with 21.1 percent in July.

At the district level, the index recorded in 12 locations exceeded 20
percent. In July, there were 19 locations with an index exceeding 20
percent and one exceeding 40 percent.

It dropped significantly in Diamond Hill to 14.8 percent, from 42.3
percent, but remained high in Tung Chung at 38.9 percent. In port
areas, it rose slightly from 5 percent to 5.4 percent.

Food & Environmental Hygiene Department Consultant Dr Ho Yuk-yin said
the falls are the result of joint efforts made by the community in
eliminating mosquitoes. However, he warned the indices could rise
again if effective measures are not sustained.

Dr Ho said dengue fever is endemic in our neighbouring countries, and
there have been 4671 confirmed cases in Singapore, 59 321 in
Indonesia and 45 830 in Vietnam this year. "Although Hong Kong fares
well when compared with these countries with 22 cases this year
[2004], there is no room for complacency as local dengue fever tends
to strike around this time of the year," Dr Ho said, adding that all
22 cases originated in neighbouring areas, mainly Southeast Asia.

Dr Ho said the concerted efforts of Government departments and public
participation is essential to resolving mosquito problems and
reducing the dengue threat.

With the active participation of the departments, anti-mosquito
efforts are carried out in a more co-ordinated manner with the Home
Affairs Department taking a pivotal role, he said.

In the last 2 months, the Lands Department has eliminated over 120
illegal cultivation sites and cut grass at over 600 vacant Government
sites. The Housing Department has formed special cleaning squads to
conduct daily anti-mosquito work and arrange special clean-up
operations and campaigns.

Dr Ho called for full community support for the 3rd phase of this
year's anti-mosquito campaign, which runs until 23 Oct 2004.

People should play their part by eliminating potential mosquito
breeding grounds in and around their homes and reporting problems to
the department's hotline at 2868 0000.

Information on anti-mosquito measures can be obtained from the
department's website

[Ovitraps are employed to monitor the presence of aedine mosquitoes,
mainly _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. A trap consists of a
plastic beaker, glass jar or tin can (e.g small baked bean tin)
painted black and with about 4 cm of water to which leaves, hay
infusion or some other oviposition attractant is often added. Most
_Aedes_ species lay their eggs not on the water surface but on damp
substrates, so an attractive oviposition "paddle" consisting of a
strip of hardboard, paper toweling or roughened tongue depressor is
inserted. Paddles are normally removed weekly and put into plastic
envelopes, and replaced by new ones. Species identification is
undertaken in the laboratory, based on the eggs, or larvae hatching
from the eggs when paddles are immersed in water.

Although not stated, I presume that the vector of dengue in Hong Kong
is _Aedes albopictus_. This mosquito will lay eggs in cut bamboo,
rock pools and tree holes, but in urban situations most oviposition
is in domestic water containers, discarded utensils such as bottles,
jars and tin cans, and vehicle tires.

Control is normally directed at removing peridomestic larval
habitats, for which community participation is usually necessary. In
epidemic situations, or threats of epidemics, insecticidal spraying
may be used to kill mainly adult mosquitoes, including virus-infected
ones.

The significance of the reported reductions in monthly ovitrap
indices (i.e. percentage ovitraps with eggs of _Ae. albopictus_) will
depend on design of the trap lay-out and numbers used. - Mod.MS]
