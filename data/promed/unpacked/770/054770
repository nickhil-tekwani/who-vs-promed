Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE:EBS) today [Mon 17 Dec 2018] announced that Health Canada has approved the company's new drug submission (NDS) for its anthrax vaccine, BioThrax (anthrax vaccine adsorbed). BioThrax is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ in individuals 18 through 65 years of age whose occupation or other activities place them at risk of exposure, regardless of the route of exposure. BioThrax is administered in a 3-dose primary schedule (at 0, 1, and 6 months) with boosters at 3-year intervals recommended thereafter. BioThrax was approved under the Extraordinary Use New Drug Regulations, which provide a regulatory pathway for products for which collecting clinical information for its intended use in humans is logistically or ethically not possible.

"With the growing awareness of biological and chemical threats around the globe, Emergent is committed to partnering with allied governments and providing preparedness solutions to meet their national security needs," said Abbey Jenkins, senior vice president and vaccines and anti-infectives business unit head at Emergent BioSolutions. "We are pleased to receive Health Canada licensure of BioThrax, fulfilling our commitment to the Canadian government and enabling future procurement of this critical medical countermeasure. We look forward to continuing our decades-long partnership in our quest to fulfill our mission: to protect and enhance life."

BioThrax is designated by Health Canada as an innovative drug, giving it market exclusivity for 8 years. Earlier this year [2018], Emergent completed the mutual recognition procedure for BioThrax, expanding licensure of BioThrax in 5 European countries, namely, the UK, Poland, France (marketed as BaciThrax), Italy, and the Netherlands, in addition to Germany, where BioThrax received market authorization in 2013.

BioThrax is also licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ in persons 18 through 65 years of age for both pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylactic use. Please follow link for full US prescribing information (http://www.biothrax.com/prescribinginformation_biothrax_us.pdf) and for full Canadian prescribing information in English (https://emergentbiosolutions.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/Product%20Monograph%20BioThrax%20%28EN%29.pdf).

BioThrax has also received market authorization from the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore and the Paul-Ehrlich Institut in Germany.

Where approved in Europe, BioThrax is indicated for prevention of disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ in adults at risk of exposure. Please follow link for full details of EU prescribing information (https://emergentbiosolutions.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/SmPC_EN%20v.11.5%2003Apr2018_5.pdf).

The safety and efficacy of BioThrax have not been established in pediatric or geriatric populations. Individuals are not considered protected until they have completed the 3-dose primary immunization series. Vaccination with BioThrax may not protect all individuals.

BioThrax is manufactured from a culture filtrate made from a non-virulent strain of _Bacillus anthracis_. Over 14 million doses of BioThrax have been administered to more than 3 million individuals.

Emergent BioSolutions Inc. is a global life sciences company seeking to protect and enhance life by focusing on providing specialty products for civilian and military populations that address accidental, intentional, and naturally occurring public health threats.

[BioThrax was originally designed as a pre-exposure human vaccine and did its job well, though some military [personnel] complained at the discomfort involved (see links below). The standard procedure for post-exposure to a possible anthrax aerosol involved some 60 days of ciprofloxacin oral antibiotic, which frankly carried a very high risk of a _Clostridium difficile_ infection, which can be lethal; from personal experience _C. difficile_ infection is also very painful and can involve peritonitis. (I joke not; it nearly killed me.)

The vegetative form of _Bacillus anthracis_ is very sensitive to antibiotics, but in a clinical case, it does nothing to remove the anthrax toxins. However, thanks to the various heroin-related outbreaks in the UK, we now know how to efficiently deal with the toxins. But that still leaves those who have yet to show symptoms and are incubating the disease. This new protocol of vaccine and antibiotics is full of common sense and will reduce antibiotic exposure to just a matter of a week, 2 max, while the basic 3 vaccinations are given at 10-day intervals. For adults at risk of future exposure, BioThrax is administered in a 3-dose primary schedule (0, 1, and 6 months) with boosters at 3-year intervals recommended thereafter.

I wish we had a similar vaccine for veterinary use during an outbreak, as Sterne, an excellent livestock vaccine, is live and therefore, if given simultaneously with the antibiotics, will lose some of the initial dose (unless the antibiotics are given 1st, and after 7 days, when the antibiotic titre has fallen, the animals can be vaccinated). It would be more efficient if the animals just had to be collected up and run once through the chute. - Mod.MHJ
