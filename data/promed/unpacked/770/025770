So far in 2022, Panama has registered 39 cases and 2 deaths from hantavirus [infections]. The deaths were reported in Herrera and Veraguas provinces.

The current case is a 25-year-old woman who lives in the La Solidad community in Sona. She was attended to in the Ezequiel Abad√≠a Hospital, where the autopsy was done. [An additional report (https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/provincias/registra-primera-defuncion-hantavirus-veraguas_1_2007554.html) indicated that samples were taken and sent to the Gorgas Memorial Institute, providing the result positive for a hantavirus. - Mod.TY]

According to the data of the Epidemiology Department of MINSA [Ministry of Health], together with Social Security (CSS), investigation of the case is initiated while the departments of Public Health and Vector Control are carrying out surveillance operations.

MINSA indicated earlier that 39 cases of hantavirus have been registered in the country, of which 15 have hantavirus fever and 24 have been diagnosed with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS); with this death, the number of deaths rises to 2.

Hantavirus [infection] causes a severe acute viral illness caused by the hantavirus. Cases of hantavirus infection in humans usually occur in rural areas such as fields or farms, where rodents harboring the virus can be found, but transmission in urban areas is also possible.

The virus is acquired by inhalation of [particles contaminated with] feces, urine, and saliva of infected rodents.

Infected people may experience headache, dizziness, chills, fever, and myalgia, according to information provided on the portal of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

MINSA calls [the public] to maintain cleanliness in their houses and eliminate the elements that can attract rodents near them, and thus avoid more infections and deaths due to this disease.

[This is the 1st hantavirus infection case in Veraguas province that ProMED has posted. Most past cases have occurred in Herrera and Los Santos provinces. Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases, (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
