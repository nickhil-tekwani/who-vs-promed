At least 2 people out of 20 patients suffering from cholera died from the
disease in Bocoio district, south western Benguela province.
Speaking to Angop [Angola Press Agency] on Monday [28 Jan 2008], the head
of fight against cholera program, at the local hospital, Antonio Avelino,
said that the disease started early in January 2008. The source blamed the
spread of the disease on lack of treated drinking water and hygiene within
the community.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR: (Katanga)

A team of 15 from MSF's Congo Emergency Pool (PUC; Pool d'Urgence Congo) is
currently working to fight a cholera epidemic that has been raging since
the start of 2008 in the heart of Lubumbashi, the capital of Katanga
province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Lubumbashi, a mining
city in the south east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with a
population of 1.3 million, is the 2nd largest city in the country (next to
the capital, Kinshasa).
To date, 767 cholera patients have been treated in the MSF supported
cholera treatment center (CTC) and the number of patients is rising
slightly. There were 278 new patients admitted over the course of last week
-- an average of 30 to 40 new patients every day.
On 10 Jan 2008, while the PUC team was working in the city's only CTC,
located in one of the general referral hospitals in the Kenya district, the
number of patients rose so rapidly that hospital staff were completely
unable to cope.
The MSF team first reorganized patient care by placing the entry and exit
disinfection areas outside of the hospital, which also increased the
center's capacity. The severely ill, those suffering from severe
dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea caused by cholera, are placed in
an isolated room and put on an intravenous drip. They then go through
various phases of treatment until the convalescence area.
It was necessary to open a 2nd treatment center. On Sat 19 Jan 2008, MSF
opened a CTC in the Katuba district, 8 km (5 mi) from the Kenya district
where 24 patients have already been admitted. Over several days, community
awareness raisers informed the population about the imminent opening of the
centre. "We were able to reduce the overload on the Kenya center and
provide closer care to a greater number of patients," explained Elke Frans,
an MSF nurse. The Katuba district is one of the largest focus areas of
cholera in the city. Until now, due to the lack of a centre, patients had
been crossing Lubumbashi before receiving treatment.
MSF is now focusing its efforts in order to limit the spread of the
epidemic, while aware that it could not be contained in time due to the
lack of adequate resources deployed for the poorest population of this rich
mining city.
A serious epidemic previously hit Lubumbashi in 2003 and MSF provided
assistance on that occasion. Once again, it is the people living in
difficult hygiene conditions and without access to drinking water that are
affected.

Uganda: cholera DREF (International Federation's Disaster Relief Emergency
Fund) bulletin no. MDRUG003 final report
----------------------------------------------
In December 2006, Uganda's Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 305 cases of
cholera in a span of 3 weeks and 10 deaths confirmed in Kampala city.
Starting with some 212 cases on 1 Dec 2006, some additional 93 cases were
reported in the next 3 days. This equaled a daily infection rate of 23 to
24 cases with a case-specific mortality rate of 3 per cent. A cholera
treatment center established in Mulago Referral Hospital reported a
caseload of 10 to 15 cholera patients per day, an indicator that if the
epidemic was not addressed promptly, it could result in the doubling of
caseload in less than 2 weeks. The cholera treatment center also reported
that most patients suffered from acute diarrhea resulting from consumption
of contaminated food and water. The most affected communities were those in
low lying areas that are overcrowded.
A case fatality rate of 1 per cent with an attack rate of 7 per cent was
reported marked by 11 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak. A total
of 1099 cases were recorded with 30 per cent from Kawempe Division of
Kampala city as shown in the table below. The proportion of males to
females diagnosed was 95 to 100 and about 22 per cent of the cases were
from children under the age of 5.
Distribution of cholera cases in Kampala
----------------------------------------
Kampala city divisions / Number of cases
Kawempe / 333
Makindye / 249
Rubaga / 212
Central / 128
Nakawa / 68
Others / (especially Wakiso) 108
Total 1099
According to MOH reports, the epidemic started to spread from internally
displaced persons' (IDP) camps in Kitgum and Pader Districts as well as the
south western parts of Uganda and increased over the next 2 months
spreading to other districts. The 1st case was recorded on 31 Oct 2006
where a woman from Mengo-Kisenyi in central Division was admitted at Mulago
Referral Hospital. The outbreak was contained after 4 months by 10 Mar 2007
followed by closure of the cholera treatment center. According to the
health authorities in Kampala, the cholera outbreak was the 6th to occur in
Kampala City in a space of 10 years since 1997 giving an average of one
cholera epidemic after every 2 years.

The government of Laos has urged all provinces to prevent an outbreak of
cholera similar to the one in southern Xekong province in December 2007,
which has so far killed 3 people and affected 364 others, Lao newspaper
Vientiane Times reported Thursday [24 Jan 2008].
The government called on authorities at provincial, district, and communal
levels to continue raising public awareness about cholera prevention and
treatment, and conduct activities to ensure that neighborhoods are clean
and instruct local residents to eat properly cooked food, drink boiled
water, and wash their hands before eating.
"All 364 people who were infected with cholera have now returned home,"
said Phetsamay Thepvongsa, a senior official from the Xekong Health Department.
In addition to the cholera outbreak in Xekong, 2 other southern provinces
(Champassak and Saravan) have recently reported 9 and 30 cases of cholera
infections, respectively, the newspaper said.

[5] Gastroenteritis - India: (Karnataka)

A 50 year old woman died and at least 20 were rushed to hospital with
symptoms of gastroenteritis in Bharatinagar on Sunday [27 Jan 2008]
following suspected water contamination. This has set in panic among the
residents, forcing the BWSSB [Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board] to
stop piped water supply and call in water tankers.
Neither the police nor the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike [BBMP-Greater
Bangalore Municipal Body] confirmed the death by water contamination. BBMP
medical health officer, Dr Dharmendra, admitted examining at least 12
patients on Sunday [27 Jan 2008], but denied reports of death. "We suspect
water contamination. Our officials have taken water samples for testing.
The patients were suffering from fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and dysentery.
4 patients were in Popular Clinic, 5 in GM Healthcare and 3 at Thimmaiah
Road Maternity Hospital."
Dr Murali Krishna of GM Healthcare said all 8 patients showed
gastroenteritis symptoms. "Patients admitted on Saturday night [26 Jan
2008] are stable. We're administering intravenous fluids and antibiotics to
patients who got admitted on Sun 27 Jan 2008. They will be discharged in a
day or 2."

[The etiology or etiologies of these illnesses is not clear. Cholera is
certainly a consideration. Karnataka is a state in the southern part of
India. Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in
1973. Bangalore is the capital city of the state, which can be seen on a
map at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka>. - Mod.LL
