Rare disease found in the Similkameen
-------------------------------------
Psoroptes, a skin-boring mite, has been discovered in a bighorn sheep
found near Keremeos. A rare disease that has not been seen in Canada
for nearly a century has been found in the Similkameen.

Wildlife biologists are worried the highly contagious disease may
spread, and are now keeping a close eye on the bighorn population.
Bighorn sheep travel in herds throughout the Okanagan and
Similkameen.

The sick sheep was found with 15 other animals. The sheep was very
thin and weak and covered with scabs. So far, no other sheep have been
found suffering the same effects.

Brian Harris, a wildlife biologist with the Ministry of Environment,
says it is important to find out how widespread the disease is, where
it originated from and where it is expanding to. Harris says the
disease itself may not kill the animal but it will weaken it. Harris
adds the disease poses no risk to humans. However, it can be carried
by domestic sheep, deer and rabbits.

Anyone who sees a bighorn sheep showing signs of psoroptes is asked
to call the Ministry of Environment in Penticton immediately.

[What a challenge to treat these sheep, or to allow the disease to
run its course and consequently potentially lose portions of this
herd! With other animals such as rabbits capable of transmitting this
mite, this is even more of a challenge.

To effectively reach the mite in the skin requires dipping several
times to get rid of the mite. These mites burrow into the skin and
cause pain and itching in many cases, but almost always hair loss.

The following web site provides excellent pictures of the variety of
burrowing skin mites:
