There have been sporadic cases of chikungunya fever on Reunion Island,
Indian Ocean. In 2005-2006 a major epidemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
occurred on Reunion Island and in the south western Indian Ocean region. In
Reunion, the cumulative attack rate was of 36 per cent and corresponded to
the seroprevalence rate of 38 per cent measured at the end of the epidemic.
Since December 2006, no new autochthonous confirmed cases of CHIKV were
detected on Reunion Island.

In Madagascar, the sentinel surveillance network reported sporadic cases
within the past 3 years. More recently, viral movement has been documented
through imported viremic cases from Madagascar to metropolitan France in
June 2009 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20090611.2156). At the same time, a
Malagasy diabetic patient who traveled to Reunion for medical follow-up,
developed typical chikungunya [virus infection] symptoms. An early blood
sample was found positive for viremia, tested by real time RT-PCR and for
specific anti-chikungunya IgM.

On August 2009, an autochthonous confirmed case of CHIKV was reported to
the Regional office of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance
in Reunion (Cire Reunion-Mayotte, Institut de Veille Sanitaire) by the
Pasteur CERBA laboratory. This person was a 65 year old woman living in
Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains (West-Reunion). On 18 Jul [2009], she presented with
an acute febrile syndrome associated with arthralgia, myalgia, and a
cutaneous rash. A 1st [blood] sample, drawn on 24 Jul 2009, was found
positive for specific anti-CHIKV IgM but negative for IgG and [CHIKV]
genome detection. Seroconversion (that is, IgM positive and IgG positive
has been confirmed by the National Reference Centre for arboviruses at the
Institut Pasteur-Paris on a 2nd blood sample obtained on 11 Aug [2009].

2 other autochthonous cases of CHIKV, who are also living in
Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains, were diagnosed by Saint-Denis and Saint-Pierre
hospitals. Both patients reported an acute febrile syndrome associated with
arthralgia, myalgia, and cutaneous rash on 23 Jul and 3 Aug 2009,
respectively. The 1st one was found positive [for virus] by RT-PCR whereas
for the 2nd, seroconversion was demonstrated on paired sera. All results
were confirmed by the National Reference Centre for arboviruses at the
Institut Pasteur-Paris.

None of these 3 confirmed cases of CHIKV [infection] reported a recent
travel history [off the island] or a contact with persons with a travel
history or having received a package [from abroad].

An investigation is ongoing for 2 other probable cases, (i) a French
tourist who reported an acute febrile syndrome associated with arthralgia
and cutaneous rash on 4 Aug 2009 who reported a stay in the same area of
confirmed cases and (ii) a permanent resident of Saint-Paul, a neighbouring
town of Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains who reported a stay in Saint-Gilles.

Sequence analysis is in course to tentatively determine the origin of the
CHIK virus (re-introduction of a new isolate or re-emergence of a 2005-2006
Reunion strain).

Biological investigation of theses cases provides evidence for active
transmission of chikungunya virus in Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains, a tourist zone
of Reunion Island. The response to this alert has been organized by the
Cire Reunion-Mayotte and the Vector Control Team (Drass) of Reunion for
control measures. Active mosquito control measures and population education
regarding individual mosquito prevention were rapidly implemented.
Entomologic investigation found low vector activity correlated to winter in
the Southern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, mosquito density seems to be
sufficient to support CHIKV transmission. An epidemic situation has not
been detected and the austral winter may contribute to moderate the
transmission.

Reinforcement of epidemiological and entomological surveillance has been
organized to prevent the risk of potential spread of the virus on the
island. Information on the situation and recommendations for prescription
for medical staff have been issued.

Currently, in Reunion, health services have collapsed from the pandemic A
(H1N1) 2009 flu pandemic. However, despite the small number of cases of
chikungunya virus infection, special attention should be focused on
arbovirus activity to prevent, or at least minimize, the spread of the
virus during next summer. Physicians should be aware to sample the patient
for chikungunya investigation when facing a flu syndrome without
respiratory symptoms. The Reunion-Continental France laboratory network,
built up in 2005, has been reactivated to reinforce diagnostic
capabilities. Specific information of persons living in the area or
visiting this island, focusing on individual mosquito bite prevention,
should be intensified.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr D'Ortenzio and colleagues for this
interesting report. First-hand news from health care professionals in the
field and their supporting laboratories is particularly valuable. The
results of the chikungunya virus sequence comparisons will be of particular
interest, providing evidence of endemicity of the virus on the island or
its reintroduction. One hopes that the detection of chikungunya cases at
this time is not a harbinger of an outbreak later in the season.
