_Salmonella_ outbreak linked to onions
--------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 808 (156 new)
Hospitalizations: 157 (28 new)
Deaths: 0
States: 37 and Puerto Rico (1 new)
Recall: Yes
Investigation status: Active

CDC, FDA, and public health and regulatory officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Oranienburg infections linked to onions.

Epidemiologic and traceback data show that this outbreak of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg infections is linked to onions.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
Since the last update on 18 Oct 2021, 156 more sick people were added to this outbreak. As of 28 Oct 2021, 808 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg have been reported from 37 states and Puerto Rico (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 31 May 2021 to 13 Oct 2021 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/oranienburg-09-21/epi.html).

Sick people range in age from less than 1 year to 101 years, with a median age of 37, and 57% are female. Of 505 people with information available, 157 (31%) have been hospitalized.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Laboratory data
---------------
Whole genome sequencing of bacteria from 709 people's samples did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Five people's samples were predicted to be resistant to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 3 people's samples by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory also found no resistance. Most people with salmonellosis recover without antibacterials. However, if antimicrobials are needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of therapy used to treat most people because it is rare.

Recalled food
-------------
Multiple companies have recalled onions. All recalled onions were supplied by ProSource Produce LLC and Keeler Family Farms and imported from the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, between 1 Jul 2021 and 31 Aug 2021.

FDA's website has a table (https://www.fda.gov/safety/major-product-recalls/2021-recalls-food-products-associated-onions-prosource-produce-llc-and-keeler-family-farms-due) with information about each company's recall.
