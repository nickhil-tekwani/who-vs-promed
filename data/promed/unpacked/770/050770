Bangladeshi health officials reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in September [2015] a human infection with an avian influenza A(H9N2) virus. The case, which occurred in a toddler in February [2015], is the 2nd known case in Bangladesh (1st case in 2011).

The patient, a 3.5-year-old girl, developed mild illness on 1 Feb 2015 and recovered from her illness by 7 Feb 2015.

An influenza A(H9) virus was detected upon testing of a respiratory sample from the case, and the virus was later confirmed as an influenza A(H9N2) virus, similar to other A(H9N2) viruses previously isolated in Bangladesh. The case had close contact with poultry, including sick quail, prior to her onset of illness.

Avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses are known to be circulating in poultry populations in Bangladesh.

Further human cases and small clusters could occur as this virus is circulating in poultry populations across Asia and the Middle East. This virus does not seem to transmit easily between humans and tends to result in mild clinical disease; therefore, the current likelihood of community-level spread and public health impact of this virus are considered to be low.

[Avian influenza subtype H9N2 is endemic in many bird species in Asia and the Middle East and has contributed to the genesis of H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8, which are potential pandemic threats. H9N2 viruses that have spread to Bangladesh have acquired multiple gene segments from highly pathogenic (HP) H7N3 viruses that are presumably in Pakistan and currently co-circulate with HP H5N1.

H9N2 viruses rapidly evolve and acquire mutations that can facilitate their ability to replicate in mammalian hosts. Some H9N2 isolates have crossed to pigs and humans. Additionally, in recent years, these H9N2 viruses have enabled other subtypes to evolve and infect humans by donating their internal genes. The 1st human H9N2 infection in Bangladesh was identified in 2011, and the virus subtype was antigenically and molecularly closely related to the then-circulating avian H9N2 viruses.

The 2011 Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses emerged from multiple reassortment events that occurred over time between multiple H9N2 sublineages originating from the prototypical G1 lineage and from HP- H7N3 isolated from Pakistan. The continued evolution of these H9N2 viruses, with the steady accumulation of mutations in their genomes, has led to the increasing differentiation of Bangladeshi H9N2 viruses from other H9N2 lineages circulating in neighboring countries, leading to the generation of a new H9N2 sublineage in chicken and quail hosts in Bangladesh.

There have been only a limited number of human infections with AI H9N2, including a handful in China between 1998 and 1999, Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and December of 2013. In late 2014, 2 mild cases were reported out of China. In 2015, Egypt has reported 3 cases. Because of the mild nature of the disease and the reporting problems in some of the countries where the virus has been detected, incidence of human infection is likely under-reported.

In the absence of intervention, the generation of novel H9N2 clades with varying host range and pathogenicity is unavoidable and can potentially become a major public health concern. Thus, there is a need for continual monitoring and surveillance of H9N2 viruses in Bangladesh to identify the evolution and incremental adaptation of viruses to humans to be better prepared for potential future outbreaks.
