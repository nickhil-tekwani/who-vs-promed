A 4-year-old doe killed on a deer-damage shooting permit in Dickinson County's Waucedah Township has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), marking the 1st confirmation of the incurable deer disease within Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP).

According to the Michigan Department of Natural of Resources, the finding was verified by Michigan State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in East Lansing and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

The deer was shot on an agricultural farm about 4 miles from the Michigan-Wisconsin border.

"We remain committed to maintaining healthy Michigan wildlife for the residents of, and visitors to, this great state, now and into the future," said Michigan Department of Natural Resources director Keith Creagh. "Fortunately, over the past few years, with the help of hunters, the UP CWD Task Force, DNR staffers, and others, we are far better prepared to respond to threats posed by chronic wasting disease in the UP."

Chronic wasting disease is a fatal nervous system disease found in deer, moose, and elk. The disease attacks the brain of infected animals, creating small lesions, which result in neurologic symptoms. The disease is always fatal in animals that contract it. To date, there have been no reported cases of CWD infection in humans.

"We are taking immediate action to address this situation in the Upper Peninsula. In the short term, stepped-up testing and active surveillance is the priority to better understand where the disease exists," said Russ Mason, chief of the DNR's Wildlife Division. "To do this, we need to step up our efforts to collect deer heads for testing in this area. We need to determine if this deer is an individual outlier or whether there are more deer infected in the area."

The DNR has tested hundreds of deer from Upper Peninsula counties bordering Wisconsin. In 2018 alone (as of 11 Oct 2018), a total of 625 deer-damage permit, roadkill, and hunter-killed deer have been tested from Dickinson, Gogebic, Menominee, and Iron counties.

"It was our surveillance efforts that revealed the disease in this particular deer," said Kelly Straka, state wildlife veterinarian. "It is now especially important that these efforts continue."

CWD has been found in free-ranging deer in 6 additional counties in Michigan: Clinton, Ingham, Ionia, Jackson, Kent, and Montcalm. A total of 63 deer within these counties have tested positive for the disease.

The DNR recognizes that deer movements, densities, and habitat vary from the UP into the Lower Peninsula. DNR officials will review Michigan's CWD Surveillance and Response Plan and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies' CWD Best Management Practices in considering additional measures going forward.

"For next hunting season and beyond, the DNR will discuss possible response actions with UP hunters and other stakeholders to determine the best approach to fighting CWD in the region," said Chad Stewart, DNR deer management specialist.

A conference call with stakeholder groups is scheduled for early next week [week of 22 Oct 2018].

A roughly 10 mi [ about 16.1 km] core area has been set up, centered on Waucedah Township. Within this area, the DNR has set a goal to test a minimum of 600 deer to better determine the extent of possibly infected deer.

"We need hunters to help us reach this goal by voluntarily submitting entire deer heads for testing. Hunters can keep the venison," Mason said. "At this point, we are not establishing a mandatory deer check in the area, but that may become necessary if we don't reach our goal."

Several actions will be taken by the DNR including the following:

- Providing additional drop boxes for deer heads within the area, especially in convenient, high-traffic places;
- Offering disease control permits to interested landowners who have more than 5 acres of land and are within 5 miles [about 8 km] of the center of the surveillance area;
- Allowing baiting for deer to continue for the rest of this year [2018]. Future decisions on feeding deer will be based on the results of the surveillance efforts; and
- An ongoing DNR UP deer migration study will be adjusted to include the affected area within its boundaries. Deer will be collared in the area to better understand the movements of deer.

"The actions of hunters matter in battling CWD," Stewart said. "Keep hunting and get your deer checked. Responsibly transport, process, and dispose of your deer carcass. Visit the website to learn about proper carcass transportation into Michigan from out of state. Please pass these tips on to other hunters."

In North America, a total of 25 states and 3 Canadian provinces have confirmed the presence of CWD in free-ranging or captive deer, elk, or moose, or both.

[The Upper Peninsula has been free of chronic wasting disease [CWD] for many years. It is indeed sad news, although not necessarily unexpected, that the UP is now affected.

CWD is a contagious neurological disease affecting deer, elk, and moose. It causes a characteristic spongy degeneration of the brains of infected animals resulting in emaciation, abnormal behavior, loss of bodily functions, and death.

The World Health Organization has reviewed available scientific information and concluded that currently there is no evidence that CWD can be transmitted to humans. During the period 1997-1998, 3 cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurred in the USA in young adults. These individuals had consumed venison. This led to speculation about possible transmission of CWD from deer or elk to humans. However, review of the clinical records and pathological studies of all 3 cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, did not find a causal link to CWD.

Nonetheless, health and wildlife officials advise caution. Hunters are encouraged not to consume meat from animals known to be infected. In addition, hunters should take common-sense precautions when field dressing and processing deer or elk taken in areas where CWD is found. - Mod.TG
