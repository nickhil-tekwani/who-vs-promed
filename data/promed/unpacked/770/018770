RABIES, FOX - USA (TX) (02)

Since 1988 an epizootic of Texas gray fox rabies variant (TF) has affected
50 counties in West-Central Texas. A total of 1134 cases of rabies due to
that variant have been confirmed through 2002. The majority of cases have
been foxes (57 percent), but there has been significant spillover into
other wildlife species such as bobcats and raccoons, and into domestic
animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, dogs, and cats. Numerous humans have
received rabies prophylaxis as a result of attacks by foxes, bobcats,
raccoons, barn cats, and by exposure to rabid livestock and pets.
In 1996, a TF bait zone was added to the Oral Rabies Vaccination Program
(ORVP), initiated in 1995 to combat the domestic dog/coyote rabies variant
in South Texas. A baited perimeter was established around the leading edge
of the epizootic. In subsequent years the perimeter has been moved inward
as much as possible.
This year a zone was baited along the Rio Grande River creating a complete
perimeter for the first time. The concept is that of a purse string that
will be tightened until the entire area within the perimeter is
baited. The limiting factor has been, and will continue to be,
funding. Almost 11 million baits have been distributed in West-Central
Texas through this year's ORVP. Since advent of the TF portion of the ORVP
in 1996, cases of that variant have decreased by over 50 percent compared
to the total cases confirmed in 1988-1995.
More information is available at the Texas ORVP website:
<http://www.tdh.state.tx.us/zoonosis/orvp/information/>
San Angelo is the county seat and largest city in Tom Green County with a
population of approximately 100 000. The county is within the perimeter
but below the northern edge of the baited zone, so baits have not yet been
distributed there. In 1994, the county recorded 80 cases of the TF variant.
Last year 11 cases of that rabies variant were confirmed in the county,
including 7 foxes, 2 cats, 1 raccoon, and 1 bobcat. In addition, there
were 7 cases of rabies due to skunk variants (6 skunks and 1 cow) and 1
rabid bat. This year through 14 Feb 2003, 5 cases of the TF variant have
been confirmed in the county (4 foxes and 1 goat). Additionally, 2 rabid
skunks have also been confirmed.
According to the Texas Department of Health (TDH) recommendations, rabies
prophylaxis should be initiated immediately if a high-risk species, such as
a fox, causes an exposure. However, the final decision for beginning
treatment rests with the physician handling the case. According to
Dr.Charles Gaiser, TDH Zoonosis Control Veterinarian for that region, the
regional TDH staff was not aware of the incident until the results were
reported by the TDH laboratory. At that time an investigation was begun
and it was learned that prophylaxis had been initiated.
