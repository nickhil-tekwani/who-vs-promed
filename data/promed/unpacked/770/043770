Avian influenza detected in Saskatchewan
---------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza has been detected in a
commercial poultry operation in Saskatchewan, the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced today [27 Sep 2007]. This virus is
not the same as the strain circulating in Asia, Africa and Europe,
which has been associated with human illness. H7N3 is not normally
associated with serious human illness.
Avian influenza viruses do not pose risks to food safety when poultry
and poultry products are properly handled and cooked. In this case,
the affected birds were not destined for immediate slaughter and were
not producing eggs for human consumption.
All birds on the infected premises will be humanely euthanized and
disposed of in accordance with provincial regulations and
internationally accepted disease control guidelines. Normally, birds
on any commercial operations within one kilometre [0.62 miles] of an
infected premises would also be destroyed, but early information
indicates that no such operations are present in the immediate area.
Once all birds have been removed, the CFIA will oversee the cleaning
and disinfection of the barns, vehicles, equipment and tools to
eliminate any infectious material that may remain.
To limit any potential virus spread, the CFIA will apply restrictions
on the movement of poultry and poultry products within three
kilometres [1.86 miles] of the infected premises. As an additional
safeguard, any poultry operations within ten kilometres [6.2 miles]
of the infected premises will be closely and regularly monitored for
signs of illness.
The CFIA is investigating the recent movement of birds, bird products
and equipment onto and off of the property. Through this activity,
additional cases of infection may be detected.
The CFIA's actions are consistent with internationally recognized
animal health guidelines and the CFIA's established avian influenza
response protocols.
It may be difficult to identify the source of the virus, but the
possibility of exposure to wild waterfowl -- which are the natural
hosts for the virus -- cannot be discounted. Poultry owners are urged
to take an active role in protecting their flocks by keeping them
away from wild birds and areas frequented by wild birds.
Under the Health of Animals Act, the CFIA has authority to compensate
producers for animals ordered destroyed during disease responses. The
producer might also be eligible for assistance under other Government
of Canada or provincial programs.
The Province of Saskatchewan and industry are actively collaborating
in this response effort. The CFIA wishes to acknowledge the
responsible actions of the owner, who reported signs of illness at
the earliest possible moment. This commitment to animal health
protection has maximized the Agency's ability to contain and
eliminate this situation as quickly as possible.
New information emerging from the CFIA's activities will be
provided to the public as it becomes available.

[The following post is in reference to ProMED-mail
post 20070928.3210 - Mod.TG]
The current outbreak in Saskatchewan poultry has been linked to a
highly pathogenic strain of H7N3 avian influenza
(<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/newcom/2007/20070927e.shtml>).
Management of this outbreak is well underway by the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency.
The H7N3 strain of avian influenza is a potential zoonosis with low
risk of transmission, causing mild conjunctivitis in 2 heavily
exposed people in the 2004 outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N3 in the
Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada. The concern, of course, is
that people co-infected with avian and human influenza viruses could
serve as mixing vessels for viral recombination and subsequent
development of human adapted, virulent strains of influenza.
Wild birds are frequently implicated in outbreaks of avian influenza
in poultry, often with little or no supporting evidence (Please
reference ProMED-mail post 20051124.3409).
Highly pathogenic strains are not commonly carried in migratory
waterfowl; indeed the recent highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreak in
Eurasia is an anomaly in that wild birds may be acting as carriers
and victims of a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Wild
birds are the natural hosts of low pathogenicity strains, which can
mutate into high pathogenicity strains in intensively managed
poultry. As such, enhanced biosecurity to prevent bidirectional
spillover between wild and domestic birds is well warranted, but
speculation about the source of the virus in this outbreak is
premature pending epidemiological and molecular characterization.
Investigation into the source of the virus will be facilitated by
recent surveillance for avian influenza in 1000 wild ducks in
southern Saskatchewan in August 2007, which occurred as a part of
Canada's Interagency Wild Bird Influenza Survey, in collaboration
with the United States Department of Agriculture to enhance
surveillance in the Central Flyway. Results from 2007 are pending.
In 2006, no H5 or H7 strains were detected in samples from 56 ducks
(primarily northern pintails) in southern Saskatchewan, although
there were 6 positives for non H5/H7, low pathogenicity influenza A
viruses (based on PCR). Canada-wide, no H7 subtypes or highly
pathogenic strains were detected in 4268 samples from wild ducks in
2005, nor in over 12,000 samples from wild birds in Canada in 2006:
(<http://wildlife1.usask.ca/en/aiv/index.php>).
At the moment, there appears to be no scientific justification for
increased concern over the avian influenza status of hunter-killed
wild birds in Saskatchewan, including export to the USA. Resident and
non-resident hunting of wild waterfowl is a major activity in
Saskatchewan at this time of year. As usual, hunters should observe
common sense food safety and handling precautions:
