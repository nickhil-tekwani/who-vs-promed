Please let me make some general comments on the prevention of virus caused
diseases, in this case on Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in Iraq.
As we all know , there is no treatment available against virus diseases.
The only possibilities to control and eradicate virus diseases is stamping
out of diseased, infected, and suspicious animals, possibly supported by
vaccination. Furthermore, vaccination is prevention only, meaning
measures have to be put into place before an outbreak occurs to prevent the
outbreak.
In the face of an outbreak and during an outbreak, vaccination may be used
as a supportive measure only. FMD diseased animals should be stamped out
and carcasses should be discarded safely to prevent further spread of the
virus. Vaccination may be used successfully by putting a vaccination belt
around the focus, this will help avoid further virus spread. Vaccination
does not prevent the infection of animals but it prevents the clinical
signs of the disease and, consequently, the shedding of the virus.
In case a country has decided to control and eradicate diseases like FMD,
this must be done using the vaccination really as a preventive measure.
Vaccination must be performed in the form of a blanket immunization of all
FMD susceptible animals in that country.
Depending on the specific vaccine used, this blanket vaccination has to be
done at least every six months. The vaccine itself should cover
immunologically all different virus strains circulating in the country .The
vaccine must be inactivated and preferably have a potent adjuvant.
Additionally, care must be taken that no new virus will be imported into
the country. Import of animals, animal products, and live or dead vectors
which may carry the virus, must be prohibited. These measures have to be
performed until there is no virus circulating in the country.
There are lots of examples proving this eradication strategy can be
successful. In Europe, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, The
Netherlands, and Spain eradicated FMD using the vaccination strategy. In
Latin America, Uruguay succeeded the same way and Argentina, Paraguay, and
the southern states of Brazil are successfully on their way to becoming
free of FMD using or having used preventive vaccination against FMD.
