The Jordanian Ministry of Health announced on Friday [31 Jul 2020] the death of a man in his 40s, 2 days after the death of a child, as more than 800 people have suffered from foodborne illness from eating contaminated shawarma meals from a restaurant in the Al-Baqa'a area, northwest of Amman.

The official TV in Jordan quoted the Minister of Health, Saad Jaber, as announcing the ministry's registration of a 2nd death from the mass poisoning incident in Al-Baqa'a. He pointed out that the deceased was receiving treatment in hospital, while his wife was also in the intensive care unit as a result of the poisoning.

The Ministry of Health announced in a statement last Wednesday [29 Jul 2020] that a 5-year-old child had died in hospital due to food poisoning. The ministry indicated that 825 cases were received by the hospital, of which 4 were in the intensive care unit.

"The laboratory tests showed the presence of bacterial contamination in meat and chicken with the _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Campylobacter_ bacteria," the ministry said.

The TV quoted the assistant secretary general for primary healthcare in the ministry, Adnan Ishaq, as saying that "the failure to cool poultry spoiled the food and caused poisoning."

[There are no reports of significant cultures from any affected patients, but certainly campylobacteriosis could be a cause. Enterococci are generally not considered to be foodborne pathogens.

Shawarma is a dish in Middle Eastern cuisine consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Originally made of lamb or mutton, today's shawarma may also be chicken, turkey, beef, or veal.

The symptoms related to the illness are not stated nor is the time from food ingestion until the development of symptoms. - Mod.LL
