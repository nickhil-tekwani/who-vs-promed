There have been 27 cases of whooping cough confirmed by the KDHE [Kansas Department of Health and Environment] in Barton County this year [2015]. The outbreak in Barton County started in December last year [2014] when an infant died from whooping cough. When more cases were confirmed, Barton County's Health Department held a free TDaP [DTaP] vaccination clinic and had over 1000 people immunized.

Whooping cough can appear just like a cold or allergies when it first starts. "It depends on if it's associated with a low-grade fever; pertussis does have just kind of like cold-like symptoms, viral-like symptoms in the beginning. If that progresses and doesn't go away you need to go see your provider," said Debra Brockel a physician's assistant with Clara Barton Hospital.

Just because it's summer doesn't mean that whooping cough will be less prevalent. "Just because school isn't in session doesn't mean kids aren't in close proximity; they're at the pool; they're at camp, so that doesn't lessen the risk any," said Brockel.

Immunizations are the key to preventing whooping cough, but good hand-washing can help.

So far, there have been 143 total confirmed cases of whooping cough in the state this year [2015].

[In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Pertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955. Pertussis again declined during 2013 and by 2014, more than 28 000 cases were reported nationwide.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf). Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old.

In 2014, Kansas reported 357 cases (incidence rate 12.3 cases per 100 000 population); whereas the nationally the incidence rate was 9.1 per 100 000 (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf).
