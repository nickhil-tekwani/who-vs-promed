The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [has] confirmed 3 additional cases of virulent Newcastle disease in backyard birds in San Bernardino County, California. A complete list of confirmed cases is available on our website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd.

Virulent Newcastle disease has not been found in commercial poultry in the United States since 2003.

Samples from the flocks were tested at the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS). The APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirms all findings. APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to respond to these findings and to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Federal and State partners are also conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area.

[The list of confirmed outbreaks in fact shows 3 listed on 30 May 2018 and one on 1 Jun 2018, all in San Bernardino county. This appears to be a repeat of 2003 in that these flocks are of fighting cocks, probably all with a common source event. It would not be a surprise if this virus has a Mexican origin.
