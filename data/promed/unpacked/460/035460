A total of 724 people are receiving prophylaxis treatment against anthrax, which killed 117 hippos and 7 buffaloes 2 weeks ago in Kavango East Region. Ministry of Environment and Tourism's (MET) spokesperson Romeo Muyunda said in a media statement on [Mon 23 Oct 2017] that the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) had placed residents in the Mukwe Constituency on treatment as a preventative measure.

"There are no clinical cases of anthrax detected so far in humans and livestock. Livestock movement restrictions in Mukwe Constituency remain in place," Muyunda said. Prophylaxis is treatment taken to prevent the spread of diseases, such as anthrax, an infectious disease caused by bacterium known as _Bacillus anthracis_ that affects both wild and domestic herbivores, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, elephants, and antelopes.

Due to the rapid course of the disease, most animals that are exposed to anthrax are soon found dead and may ooze dark blood from their orifices. Anthrax carcasses normally bloat and decompose rapidly.

Muyunda said awareness campaigns are currently ongoing and the public's support towards the outbreak has been remarkable. He further reported that a total of 117 hippos and 7 buffalo carcasses were destroyed since the operation to dispose the carcasses started on [13 Oct 2017]. He added that the vaccination process of livestock would continue this week in the affected area and farmers are advised to take their livestock to the vaccination points.

[As long as the prophylactic treatment is brief it should do no harm and at the same time reinforce the need to get surrounding livestock vaccinated. African villages traditionally have livestock collection places dating back to colonial times and regional tick control dips and such. These make it easier and quicker to vaccinate community livestock, which will otherwise lack the animal managing corrals and chutes found on commercial farms. A problem with oral antibiotic treatment in humans is that it can initiate _Clostridium difficile_ infections (CDI). I speak from personal experience after 10 days of ciprofloxacin for a cat-inflicted wound. Among FDA-approved antibiotics for post-exposure prophylaxis after potential anthrax spore exposure, doxycycline may pose a lower risk of CDI than quinolones. - Mod.MHJ
