Occurrence of bacterial spot disease, caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pv. _vesicatoria_, on pepper in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey
Y Aysan <aysanys@mail.cu.edu.tr> (Department of Plant Protection, Faculty
of Agriculture, Cukurova University, 01330 Balcali, Adana , Turkey); F
Sahin (Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Ataturk
University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey), F Sahin (Biotechnology Research and
Application Center, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey). Accepted
for Publication 3 Jun 2003.
During the summers of 1999 to 2002, a survey of commercial pepper fields
was conducted in the eastern Mediterranean (Adana and Osmaniye) region of
Turkey. All pepper fields planted with a local cultivar (cv. Salcalik) were
found to be infected with a bacterial spot disease. Disease incidence was
estimated at 50-95 percent.
A yellow-pigmented bacterium was consistently isolated onto Tween medium
(Mcguire et al., 1986) from diseased pepper plants grown in 82 different
fields. 30 representative strains selected were gram-negative, rod-shaped,
motile, aerobic, oxidase negative, catalase positive, and amylolytic
positive. All of the strains were identified as _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pv. _vesicatoria_ (Doidge) Dye (Xav) (similarity 66 to 94 percent) using
fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and Sherlock Microbial
Identification System software (Microbial ID, Newark, DE, USA) (Bouzar et
al., 1994, Jones et al., 1998). They all produced positive hypersensitive
reactions on tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_ cv. Samsun), and were pathogenic
on pepper (cv. Salcalik) and tomato (cv. H-2274) plants.
Xav strains were also recovered from seed lots of cv. Salcalik, suggesting
that the primary inoculum source of the disease was contaminated seed used
in this region. Occurrence of Xav on pepper grown in the eastern Anatolia
region of Turkey has been reported previously (Sahin, 2001), but this is
the first report of the observation of Xav in the eastern Mediterranean
region of Turkey.

[Bacterial spot is one of the most economically damaging diseases of
pepper. Xav occurs worldwide, and the disease is most common in warm and
moist climates. Recent evidence suggests that there are 3 species involved:
_Xanthomonas vesicatoria_, Xav, and _Xanthomonas gardneri_. There is
further specialization into strains; some infect pepper only, others infect
only tomato, and those that infect both hosts. Most pepper-infecting
strains are Xav. Contaminated seed is certainly an effective means of
distributing the pathogen in plantings. - Mod.DH]
