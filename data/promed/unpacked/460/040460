Summary
------
Background: Partial artemisinin resistance is suspected if delayed parasite clearance (i.e., persistence of parasitaemia on day 3 after treatment initiation) is observed. Validated markers of artemisinin partial resistance in southeast Asia, _Plasmodium falciparum kelch13_ (_Pfkelch13_) R561H and P574L, have been reported in Rwanda, but no association with parasite clearance has been observed. We aimed to establish the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and genetic characterisation of _Pfkelch13_ alleles and their association with treatment outcomes.

Methods: This open-label, single-arm, multicentre, therapeutic efficacy study was done in 2018 in 3 Rwandan sites: Masaka, Rukara, and Bugarama. Children aged 6-59 months with _P. falciparum_ monoinfection and fever were eligible and treated with a 3-day course of artemether-lumefantrine. Treatment response was monitored for 28 days using weekly microscopy screenings of blood samples for _P. falciparum_. Mutations in _Pfkelch13_ and _P. falciparum_ multidrug resistance-1 (_Pfmdr1_) genes were characterised in parasites collected from enrolled participants. Analysis of flanking microsatellites surrounding _Pfkelch13_ was done to define the origins of the R561H mutations. The primary endpoint was PCR-corrected parasitological cure on day 28, as per WHO protocol.

Findings: 228 participants were enrolled and 224 (98.2%) reached the study endpoint. PCR-corrected efficacies were 97.0% (95% CI 88-100) in Masaka, 93.8% (85-98) in Rukara, and 97.2% (91-100) in Bugarama. _Pfkelch13_ R561H mutations were present in 28 (13%) of 218 pre-treatment samples and P574L mutations were present in 2 (1%) pretreatment samples. 217 (90%) of the 240 _Pfmdr1_ haplotypes observed in the pretreatment samples had either the NFD (N86Y, Y184F, D1246Y) or NYD haplotype. Eight (16%) of 51 participants in Masaka and 12 (15%) of 82 participants in Rukara were microscopically positive 3 days after treatment initiation, which was associated with pre-treatment presence of _Pfkelch13_ R561H in Masaka (p = 0.0005). Genetic analysis of _Pfkelch13_ R561H mutations suggests their common ancestry and local origin in Rwanda.

Interpretation: We confirm evidence of emerging artemisinin partial resistance in Rwanda. Although artemether-lumefantrine remains efficacious, vigilance for decreasing efficacy, further characterisation of artemisinin partial resistance, and evaluation of additional antimalarials in Rwanda should be considered.

[Resistance to the artemisinins has not been widely documented in tropical Africa. The _Pfkelch13_ R561H mutations are well documented from South East Asia and known to signal reduced susceptibility to artemisinins. This is of concern, as the artemisinins are the key drugs used against _Plasmodium falciparum_ in tropical Africa, and major new drugs are not close to being available for daily management. - Mod.EP
