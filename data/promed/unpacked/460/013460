On 18 Oct 2007, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), Sudan,
requested WHO support to investigate and control a suspected
haemorrhagic fever outbreak in White Nile and Sinnar States.

WHO has mobilized technical and logistics support for a joint Federal
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries
field investigation. The field team included staff from the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and field diagnostics capacity from
the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3), a WHO
Collaborating Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases based in Cairo, Egypt.

The joint field team arrived in Kosti, White Nile State on 24 Oct
2007, and investigated reports of human and animal illness in the
surrounding area. The team implemented outbreak response activities,
including intensified surveillance and case management, social
mobilization, and outbreak communications. The investigation team
reported its findings and recommendations to the FMoH in Khartoum on
28 Oct 2007, at which point, the FMoH requested additional WHO
support for controlling an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF).

As of 2 Nov 2007, 125 cases including 60 deaths have been reported
from more than 10 localities of White Nile, Sinnar, and Gezira
states. Young adult males are predominantly affected. More than 25
human samples have been found positive for RVF [virus] by PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] or ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay].

Samples from animals have been sent to the Central Veterinary
Research Laboratory, Khartoum for analysis, but results are not yet
available. Efforts are ongoing to intensify surveillance, case
management, health education and vector control in the affected
areas. WHO is working with the FMoH on an outbreak response plan of
action and to identify the priority technical and operational support needed.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[This statement from WHO records that more than 25 samples from 125
human cases of Rift Valley fever have tested positive by laboratory
diagnosis (PCR or ELISA). As yet there are no data indicating the
extent of the outbreak in animals. As Rift Valley fever is
predominately an animal disease, it is likely that a large number of
animals are affected. Further information regarding the extent of the
outbreak is awaited.

Nile, Sinnar, and Gezira, just south of the capital Khartoum is available at
