Over the past several days we have received information from our very helpful Rapporteur Mary Marshall of speculation on social media regarding a possible outbreak of MERS-CoV in Hafr al Batin, Saudi Arabia (in the Eastern Province - Ash SharqÄ«yah).

Reviewing the reports, put out on a blog site on [Sat 10 Feb 2018] (http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2018/02/saudi-arabia-possible-nosocomial-mers-outbreak-in-hafar-al-batin.html) that are based on an Arabic language media report; these suggested the closure of a hospital after the death of a 67 year old male with chronic diseases attributable to MERS-CoV infection, as well as possibly 3 additional cases (a machine translation of this article is suboptimal https://www.alyaum.com/article/4227642).

The Saudi MOH MERS-CoV website in English has reports on MERS from [29 Jan 2018], followed by reports on [8 Feb 2018] and [10 Feb 2018] -- of note is there is a report on the Arabic language website for [9 Feb 2018], with no reports entered for the period [30 Jan 2018] through [7 Feb 2018]. The most recent ProMED-mail update on MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia was dated [28 Jan 2018], (see MERS-CoV (07): Saudi Arabia 20180128.5590493), which covered reports through [27 Jan 2018]. There is an additional report on the Arabic language (Arabic MERS-CoV website of the Saudi MOH).

On [28 Jan 2017] there was a report of a newly confirmed case in a 40-year-old female from Riyadh who was noted to be in stable condition. She was classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

In addition, there was a report of a fatality; a 50-year-old expat male from Al Qunfodah with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities who had been reported as a newly confirmed case on [27 Jan 2018] at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. He had been classified as a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

(Both reports available at: https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-01-28-001.aspx).

On [29 Jan 2017] there were no newly confirmed cases reported. There were reports of 2 recoveries:
One was a 60-year-old Saudi male from Tabuk with no co-morbidities who had been reported as a newly confirmed case on [11 Jan 2018] at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. He was classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

The 2nd recovery reported on [29 Jan 2018] was a 57-year-old Saudi male from Buraidah with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities most likely the 58-year-old male from Buraidah reported as a newly confirmed case on [20 Jan 2018] at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. He was classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

(Both reports available at https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-01-29-001.aspx)

On [8 Feb 2018] there were no newly confirmed cases reported. There was a report of 1 recovery; a 45-year-old Saudi female from Hail who had been reported as a newly confirmed case on [25 Jan 2018] at which time she was noted to be in stable condition. She was classified as a secondary case in a household contact.

(The report is available at: https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-02-08-001.aspx).

On 10 Feb 2018 there were no newly confirmed cases reported, nor where there any outcomes reported (fatalities or recoveries).

(The report is available at https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-02-10-001.aspx).

On the Arabic language MERS-CoV website, there was an additional report entered for [9 Feb 2018] which mentions a newly confirmed case from Riyadh, and 2 recoveries reported from Riyadh (see below for details).

Reconstructing available information since our last update reveals the following:
[29 Jan 2018]: total 1785 newly confirmed cases, 727 reported fatalities and 1049 reported recoveries with 9 currently active cases.
[8 Feb 2018]: total 1789 newly confirmed cases, 730 reported fatalities and 1054 reported recoveries with 5 currently active cases
[10 Feb 2018]: total 1790 newly confirmed cases, 730 reported fatalities and 1056 reported recoveries with 4 currently active cases.

[Comparing the reports from the Saudi MOH website on MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia over the period 29 Jan 2018 through 10 Feb 2017 it appears as though there have been 5 newly confirmed cases identified in the country of whom only 1 was reflected in a report. Rather than contribute to rumors and speculations, it would be very helpful if knowledgeable sources in the region might be able to clarify the situation in Saudi Arabia, including commenting on the media report, and providing information on the 4 newly confirmed cases reflected on the website summary data that have not had accompanying information as to demographics including age, geographic location of report and other variables usually covered in MOH reports.

[Due to personal internet difficulties, the above posting was incomplete, pending more information and translation assistance]. In the 36 hours since its initial preparation, the below additional information became available:

On 9 Feb 2018, there was a report of a newly confirmed case in a 68-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh who was noted to be in stable condition and was classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

In addition, there was a report of 2 recoveries on 9 Feb 2018:

One in a 40-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh who had been reported as a newly confirmed case on 28 Jan 2018 at which time she was noted to be in stable condition, and had been classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

The other is a 45-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh. [I could not find this individual's confirmation report. - Mod.MPP]

[these reports are available at: https://www.moh.gov.sa/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-02-09-001.aspx. They are in Arabic and were translated by Mod.GMM]

On 12 Feb 2018, there was an MOH report of 3 recoveries:
All 3 were from Hafr-al-Batin
All 3 were expat healthcare workers
All 3 were reported not to have co-morbidities

[reports are available at https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-02-12-001.aspx.]

On 13 Feb 2018 there was a report of a newly confirmed case in a 42-year-old expat male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh, noted to be in critical condition. He was classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

[report available at: https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2018-02-13-001.aspx.]

[Continuing the reconstruction of reported information on MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia in the past few days, the following additional information is available on the daily MOH reports:

12 Feb 2018: total 1793 newly confirmed cases, 731 reported fatalities and 1059 reported recoveries with 3 currently active cases
13 Feb 2018: total 1794 newly confirmed cases, 731 reported fatalities and 1059 reported recoveries with 4 currently active cases.

Thus, since the last ProMED MERS-CoV update, in the period 28 Jan 2018 through 13 Feb 2018, the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV website summary tallies note an increase of 9 newly confirmed cases, 4 fatalities and 10 recoveries, whereas confirmation reports were available on 3 cases, 1 fatality and 8 recoveries.

Returning to the "rumor" of a nosocomial outbreak in Hafr-al-Batin, the media report mentioned a fatal case in a 57-year-old male with pre-existing co-morbidities and 3 additional cases. While the official confirmation reports are not available, presumably the 3 recoveries of healthcare workers in Hafr-al-Batin reported on 12 Feb 2018, are the additional cases mentioned in the media report.

Clarification of the actual situation of MERS-CoV transmission in Saudi Arabia in the period since our last update would be greatly appreciated. It is of interest to know if the 3 cases in healthcare workers in Hafr-al-Batin were identified as asymptomatic contacts vs. clinically ill cases, if the summary numbers of cases, fatalities and recoveries are correct tallies, and specific details on the demographics of the cases, fatalities and recoveries.

Locations of all reported cases and recoveries mentioned in the above reports can be found at the source URLs for each of the reports mentioned. - Mod.MPP]
