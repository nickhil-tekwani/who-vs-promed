Waterfowl have been reported dead at 7 areas in northeast and east-central Arkansas during the last 4 weeks [Nov 2017], according to the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission.

A total of 4 of these incidents included white-fronted geese (specklebellies) and a small number of dabbling ducks; 3 other incidents have included mostly snow geese. Tests are pending for some birds found dead, but test results from the 1st case indicated those birds died from avian cholera.

Dr. Jennifer Ballard, state wildlife veterinarian for Game and Fish, said the birds all showed signs of the disease, but confirmatory testing was needed to be certain.

"Avian cholera is very common in waterfowl," Ballard said. "Snow and Ross's geese have been reported to act as silent carriers of the bacteria that cause it." Carriers can shed the bacteria into the environment, Ballard said, where it can wait in the water for weeks. Birds can die in a matter of hours after being exposed to the bacteria.

"Avian cholera isn't new to Arkansas," Ballard said. "The most recent large-scale event on record was in 2008, when close to 1000 snow geese were found dead."

The disease is not expected to have any population-level effects, but it can cause high rates of death in small areas, particularly when waterfowl densities are high. This year's [2017] widespread drought conditions may be a contributing factor in the most recent occurrences, concentrating geese in small areas with surface water.

Bacteria causing avian cholera can infect a wide range of species, including birds and mammals. It can infect humans but is not the same bacteria associated with human cholera. Domestic livestock, such as chickens, also are susceptible to avian cholera.

The Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission and Game and Fish are coordinating on the issue. Dr. Brandon Doss, Arkansas state veterinarian, considers the occurrence of avian cholera in wild ducks and geese to pose a minimal risk to the state's poultry industry. However, poultry producers are encouraged to maintain good biosecurity measures at their facilities at all times to prevent disease transmissions to and from wild birds.

[Avian cholera is a disease caused by the bacteria _Pasteurella multocida_. Bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds, or by birds carrying the disease, can subsequently infect healthy birds. In addition, dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission to susceptible birds. As a result, avian cholera can spread quickly through a wetland, killing thousands of birds in a single outbreak. Pickup and disposal of carcasses has become the primary management strategy to reduce transmission to susceptible birds.

The relationship between avian cholera and environmental factors is not entirely clear-cut. Associations between outbreaks and drought are inconsistent. Some researchers found a positive correlation with precipitations. Others suggest that absence of rain lead to high concentration of waterfowl leading to unusual high mortality. - Mod.PMB
