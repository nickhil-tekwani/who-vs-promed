The local paper had an article this morning concerning this strain,
isolated from a boil in an infant who had had surgery [no comment on what
previous antibiotic exposure]. It is an intermediate resistant strain,
M.I.C. 8 I understand.

TIME Daily is also reporting the emergence of a VRSA at:


Staphylococcus, the bacterium responsible for most hospital-acquired
infections, is rapidly becoming resistant to the antibiotic which has kept
it in check for decades, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed
Wednesday (first reported by the Dallas Morning News). The new strain,
discovered in Japan, showed an "intermediate" level of resistance to the
antibiotic vancomycin.Dr. Francisco Sapico, an infectious disease
specialist at USC's Rancho Los told TIME Online the possibility of losing
vancomycin as a weapon against Staphylococcus is cause for concern. "It
would become very serious, because there are not many other antibiotics
that could be active against the organism," he said.
