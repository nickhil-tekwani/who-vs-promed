3 people have been sickened with the same strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in Wisconsin, and officials suspect that raw milk may be to blame. According to Food Safety News, a 3-year-old is among the sick. Officials are investigating the illnesses and testing raw milk samples from a suspect dairy.

"Raw milk was the most likely commonality we've been able to identify," Wisconsin Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Raechelle Cline told Food Safety News.

Raw milk has been linked to several disease outbreaks across the country. This week, raw milk cheese was responsible for sickening 13 people in Minnesota. In March 2013, 24 people in Alaska fell ill in a campylobacter outbreak linked to raw milk. Washington officials urged consumers in February to stop drinking raw milk after tests confirmed _E. coli_ in raw milk from a local dairy.

[Although it is not yet established that unpasteurized dairy products are the vehicle of transmission in this outbreak, certainly these products are well known sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ either O157 or non-O157, as well as a large selection of other pathogenic microbes including zoonotic organisms such as:

_Brucella abortus_,
_Brucella melitensis_,
_Mycobacterium bovis_,
_Salmonella_ species,
_Listeria monocytogenes_,
_Campylobacter_ species,
_Yersinia_ species, and
_Coxiella burnetii_.

Pathogenic microbes also include non-zoonotic organisms such as:
_Streptococcus pyogenes_,
_Salmonella_ Typhi,
_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_,
_Shigella_ species,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi A,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi B,
enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and
hepatitis A.
