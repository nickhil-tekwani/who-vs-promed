An immigrant from Guatemala died while in US custody from what doctors diagnosed as rabies, immigration officials said on Wednesday [12 Jun 2013].

A 28 year old man died on Tuesday [11 Jun 2013] at Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital in Corpus Christi [Texas], according to a statement from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The US Border Patrol apprehended the patient on 9 May 2013 after he entered the country illegally near Hidalgo [Texas]. On 18 May 2013, he was taken to a Kingsville [Texas] hospital after showing rabies-like symptoms. He was transferred the next day to the hospital in Corpus Christi.

The rabies diagnosis was confirmed on Friday [7 Jun 2013] by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ICE said. Tests indicated it was a canine rabies virus variant common in Central America. He showed no symptoms when apprehended and officials believe he contracted the disease before entering the country. Health officials are investigating who may have come into contact with the patient in the United States.

Alba Caceres, Guatemala's consul in McAllen, Texas, said on Wednesday [12 Jun 2013] that she was at the hospital Tuesday [11 Jun 2013] when the decision was made to take the patient off life support. She said he had entered a coma within a couple [about 2] days of displaying rabies symptoms.

She said doctors conducted 2 additional tests on Tuesday [11 Jun 2013], which showed no brain activity before the decision was made to end life support.

Guatemalan officials have contacted his family but will await an autopsy before repatriating the body, Caceres said. The family authorized the autopsy and was on the phone when he was disconnected from life support Tuesday [11 Jun 2013], she said.

[Rabies exposure to people occurs through a bite from an animal with rabies.

Scratches, abrasions, open wounds, or mucous membranes (that is, eyes, nose, mouth) that become contaminated with virus-containing saliva or other potentially infectious material from a rabid animal constitute non-bite exposures. Non-bite exposures from animals rarely cause rabies.

The incubation period, which is the time period between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms, can range from about 3 weeks to 8 weeks, but can be as short as 9 days or as long as 7 years. The incubation period depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the wound, the location of the bite and the susceptibility of the person to infection. People who are immunocompromised are more susceptible to rabies.

With such a variable incubation time, it is understandable why authorities believe exposure to the virus occurred prior to their encounter with the man.

In humans, rabies usually begins with fever, cough, or sore throat and is followed in several days by more serious and rapidly progressing symptoms such as hallucinations and seizures. The 1st symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may also be discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.

Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive.
