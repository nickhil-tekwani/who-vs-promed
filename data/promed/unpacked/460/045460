A viral haemorrhagic disease similar to Ebola and dengue but not as fatal, is on the rise in parts of India.

The Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) or the monkey disease as it is known popularly, has a fatality rate of 3-5 percent.

What has caused concern is how the virus seems to have developed a foothold in the region where it was 1st reported from, and seems to be expanding its range. What is also alarming is the number of human infections in spite of the availability of a vaccine.

Last year [2014], 137 people suffered from the disease in the southern Indian state of Karnataka during January-May, after a break from the year 2003 when over 300 cases had been reported. More alarming has been the discovery of new cases from neighbouring states.

It vindicates the claim of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune that antibodies against the pathogen were found even earlier in human blood samples collected from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Though no research has been done on the disease, it is known that KFD spreads from infected monkeys. Ticks (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_) that live on them harbour the pathogen and pass it among the monkey population.

When infected monkeys die, ticks drop from the bodies to the ground from where it can be picked by a human or animal. Humans can also catch the infection when they come in touch with infected monkeys.

Down to Earth writes that KFD is yet another instance of environmental degradation affecting human health.

Deforestation could be the primary reason as it increases contact between humans and wild animals. Shivamogga district [Shimoga district, Karnataka state], where the maximum cases have been reported from, has lost 4000 hectares of forest between 2001 and 2007.

While primary symptoms are low platelet count and red blood cells, in a 2nd phase that infects 10-20 per cent of the cases, severe neurological disorders have been recorded.

A vaccine available for 25 years helps prevent the 2nd phase but remains untested in children.

Since 2006, vaccination has been carried out only in outbreak areas.

The WHO classifies the KFD virus as a group 4 virus which can cause severe disease besides being a hazard to lab personnel.

There is evidence that global warming increases the population of insects like ticks that harbour the virus, and lead to the spread of the disease.

First identified in 1957, when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka, KFD has since been reported to be enzootic (regularly affecting animals in a region during a season).

Tick populations will flourish when opossum populations decline, as opossums kill ticks.

[The above report provides an interesting overview of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) and its spread in southern India. There have been previous reports of KFD cases in several areas in Kerala state and adjoining Karnataka state last year (2014). KFD virus is endemic in this area. As noted in the ProMED post of 4 Mar 2014 (archive no. 20140304.2313813), the disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state), where it is endemic. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
