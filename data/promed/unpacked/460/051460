'Foot and mouth-scale disaster' looms after thousands of diseased
specimens are illegally imported
--------------------------------
Thousands of diseased fish smuggled into Britain from eastern Europe
have killed up to a million British carp and are threatening to wipe
out native stocks, according to Government scientists.
Common carp, a coarse fish coveted by anglers, and Koi carp, an
ornamental fish, are being illegally imported from countries
including Poland, Moldova and the Czech Republic, where they are
cheap to buy.
The foreign fish carry 2 highly infectious diseases that are not
immediately visible to purchasers, according to a Government report.
Their impact on the carp population has been described as equivalent
to that caused by foot and mouth disease on cattle. Among the areas
affected during the past year are Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Greater
London and West Yorkshire.
Dr Kevin Denham, a senior fish health inspector at the Centre for
Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, the Government body
that monitors disease, said that there was great concern about the
risk to the British carp industry, which is worth 1 billion GBP [USD
1.7 million] a year. "Fish are being brought to Britain in large
numbers from Europe, but many people do not realise that they carry
diseases similar to the foot and mouth that we see in sheep and
cattle. They can kill off a lake of fish very, very quickly."
Dr Denham said that the "invasion" of diseased fish could devastate
the British carp industry. The carp, once seen as an unfashionable
fish, is being smuggled into Britain to satisfy an unprecedented
demand among anglers and ornamental fish enthusiasts.
"Because there is a healthy trade in carp, there is a real danger
that these diseases could spread across the country very quickly," he
added. Smuggled European common carp, a brown-grey coarse fish, tend
to be bigger than the native fish and can change hands for up to 3000
BP [USD 5300] for a 50-lb [25-kg] specimen. They are used to stock
lakes fished by fee-paying anglers. Koi carp, a brightly coloured
ornamental pet, can be sold for up to 10 000 BP [USD 17 700] each.
The 2 imported diseases identified by scientists in a report by the
Fish Health Inspectorate are spring viraemia, which is particularly
contagious, and Koi herpesvirus, which usually affects ornamental
carp and has been detected in fish imported from Germany.
Symptoms of spring viraemia include darkening of the eyes, abdominal
swelling, and bleeding gills and skin. It is a notifiable disease,
increasingly common in Germany and eastern Europe.
Koi herpesvirus, which can be identified by erratic swimming and
bleeding gills, can kill fish in a matter of hours.
Under present rules, fish importers are supposed to notify the
Government if they intend to bring carp into the country. Mark
Anthony Dallas, an established fish trader, was caught in 2003
transporting 262 diseased common carp, worth about 90 000 BP [USD 159
000], across the English Channel in the back of a lorry. Tests found
that they were carrying a rare strain of spring viraemia that was
traced back to Moldova.
Carp specialists said last week that the profits were worth the risk
for smugglers. A 30-lb fish that can be sold in Britain for 1000 BP
[USD 1770] can be bought in Poland for as little as 40 BP [USD 70].
Gary Jacques, who owns a fishing lake in Bourne End near Hemel
Hempstead, said that he had been offered illegally imported common
carp on 2 occasions over the past year. He suspected that the fish
were diseased and refused to buy.
"I knew the fish were stolen, they knew the fish were stolen. I
thought it would be better left alone because I suspected they might
have a problem," he said. "Fishery owners like me are under pressure
to buy bigger fish because these are the fish that anglers want to
catch. Anglers have become lazier, and want to catch big fish with
the minimum of effort."
Mary Madeley, a publisher from north London, bought 2 fish for 1000
BP [USD 1770] from an unauthorised dealer for her pond where she
already had a carp. After 2 weeks, all 3 fish died. "I think they
were diseased, and the Europeans killed off my original fish. The
episode has left me out of pocket and upset," she said.

[Though the above article somewhat sensationalises the facts,
comparing SVC and KHV to FMD, the 2 diseases are indeed a serious
hazard to the British carp industry.
SVC is mainly concentrated in countries of the European continent
that experience low water temperatures during winter. The disease has
been known to be present in the UK for decades; 6 outbreaks have
officially been reported to the OIE during the years 2001-2003.
KHV was first isolated in the UK in 2000 during a disease outbreak in
northern England. Outbreaks of clinical disease with signs similar to
KHV disease had been reported in 1998 and 1999. More KHV outbreaks
were confirmed in each of the years 2001-2003 using PCR and cell
culture-based assays. Later, KHV DNA was detected in tissue samples
taken in 1996 during an unexplained mass mortality of koi and common
carp in the UK.
The above and additional data are available in the following papers
published in "Trout News", No 38, July 2004, available at
<http://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/troutnews/tnews38.pdf>.
1. Enforcement of Fish Health Regulations, by Stephen Maidment, page 28.
2. Fish Health Controls: The activities of the Fish Health
Inspectorate in England and Wales, by Kevin Denham, page 29.
3. Koi Herpesvirus - a threat to wild carp, by Keith Way, page 32.
4. Koi Herpesvirus International Workshop, by Mark James, page 35.
KHV is not currently listed as a notifiable disease by the European
Union nor by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE).
Consequently, there is no requirement for exporting countries to
provide any health certification to show freedom from the disease.
However, in a number of countries, ornamental fish trade
organisations have introduced a number of initiatives in an attempt
to control the spread of the disease. This has included the
establishment of trade networks where wholesalers and importers are
notified when the disease is diagnosed in batches of koi. Other
initiatives include the establishment of disease-free broodstock and
the provision of quarantine facilities for importers.
The virus has already been identified in at least 10 European
countries, in Israel, the USA, Japan and Indonesia. Though the great
majority of the outbreaks have affected ornamental fish, KHV disease
has been reported in common carp farms in Germany and poses a serious
threat to the extensive pond culture of food carp in East-European
countries as well as wild carp populations all over Europe. It could
become a serious world threat to carp production, diminishing the
protein supply for large human populations.
According to FAO statistics, the world cyprinid (mainly carp) annual
production is approximately 17 million tons, of which more than 12
million tons produced in China. The KHV situation in this huge
subcontinent is not known; we would appreciate any available
information on relevant KHV monitoring activities there. - Mod.AS]
