Black rot arrived in northern Germany
-------------------------------------
Climate change does not spare the German fruit growers. Warmer summers
and more rainfall promote an increase in infestation of fruit trees
with fungal pathogens.

The region of 'Altes Land' along the lower Elbe river, with nearly 10
000 hectares [24 711 acres] of orchards and northern Europe's largest
continuous fruit growing area, is suffering especially from black rot
of apple. This disease caused by the fungus _Diplodia seriata_ was
until recently completely unknown in Northern Europe. Today it causes
crop losses of up to 10 percent in certain varieties -- fatal in an
area that produces every 3rd German apple.

In response, a new centre for diagnosis and advice for fruit tree
diseases was established at Jork, which will work primarily on the
detection, infection biology, and control of new fungi. This measure
was made possible through a project by the Federal Ministry for
Education and Research on the effects of climate change, covering 7
selected German regions over a period of 5 years.

[Black rot of apple can be caused by _Diplodia seriata_ or
_Botryosphaeria_ species in different areas. The disease attacks the
fruit, leaves, and bark of trees and can cause major losses in apple
orchards. Symptoms may include fruit rot, 'black mummies' of fruits,
which may remain on the tree for over a year, leaf spots ('frog eye')
and cankers on limbs and trunk. Severe leaf spotting can result in
defoliation, which weakens trees, and cankers can girdle and
eventually kill entire branches. Disease management usually includes
application of fungicides and pruning of infected limbs.

Since black rot is favoured by warm and humid conditions the report
above suggests that the recent spread in Germany may be due to these
conditions now arising more frequently in northerly regions of Europe.
However, other factors may also be involved, for example better
adapted fungal strains, and this will probably be investigated as well
during the new research programme.
