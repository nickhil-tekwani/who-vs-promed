The Somerset Health Authority in the U.K. was cited today as saying that
they have ended their investigation into an outbreak of Legionnaire's
Disease that killed an elderly woman and put five other people in hospital.
[The Authority named two Glastonbury firms - a plastics company and a
Wessex Water sewage treatment plant - as the likely potential causes of the
infection.
But as both companies had taken remedial action and no new cases had
emerged the Authority declared itself satisfied that the potential risk of
a further outbreak of the rare condition had been eradicated.
