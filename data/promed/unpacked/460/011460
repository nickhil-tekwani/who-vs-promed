The disabling mosquito-borne disease, chikungunya, has been diagnosed
in 98 people from Bekasi, the capital city of the regency, and the
number is expected to rise, a health official said Monday [5 Mar 2007].
Titin Restuwatuti from the Aren Jaya community health center said
most of the cases were detected during routine health checks. The
center has already notified the Bekasi Health Agency as required by
the regency's post-flood program.
"The disease is spreading rapidly. Shortly after the flood (early
last month [February 2007]), it was confined to areas that had been
inundated, but now we're also diagnosing chikungunya in people from
other areas," she said.
To curb the spread of the disease, the center has fumigated homes in
areas where cases have been reported.

[One wonders if the heavy rains associated with the floods have
created water catchments suitable as breeding sites for the mosquito
vector, _Aedes aegypti_, over a broader geographic area. Although
fumigation of homes may temporarily reduce the vector population, a
vigorous, community-based campaign educating home and business owners
to constantly search for and eliminate the breeding sites of this
mosquito and reduce the risk of chikungunya and dengue virus
transmission long-term.
