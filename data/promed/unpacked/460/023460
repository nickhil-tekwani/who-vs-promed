L.A. hospital confirms women poisoned by thallium
--------------------------
A Los Angeles hospital confirmed on Friday that 2
U.S. women who became ill during a trip to their
native Russia, prompting investigations by both
countries, were suffering from thallium poisoning.
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center said the victim and
her daughter, were receiving "appropriate
treatment" for thallium poisoning. They have been
listed in fair but stable condition.
"Their date of discharge has not been determined
but they are expected to remain in the hospital
this weekend," Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman Sandy Van said in a statement.
The U.S. State Department asked Moscow on
Thursday [8 Mar 2007] to investigate the
suspected poisoning of these victims with
thallium, a highly toxic metal that can cause a
slow, painful death. The 2 women were initially
hospitalized in Moscow and returned to Los Angeles on Wednesday [7 Mar 2007].
Thallium was originally suspected in the murder
in London last year of former Russian spy
Alexander Litvinenko, which sparked worldwide
condemnation. He was later found to have died of poisoning by polonium.
There has been no official explanation of how or
why the 2 women, who according to family members
do not work for either government and have no
known political or business ties to Russia, were poisoned.
Russian media said the victim and her daughter
emigrated to the United States from the Soviet
Union in the 1980s but frequently visited there.
On the most recent trip, they arrived in Moscow
in mid-February [2007] and became ill about a week later.
"There was no reason in the world to poison this
woman and her daughter . They were not involved
in anything at all," the victim�s brother told
the Los Angeles Times in an interview.
The victim�s brother told the newspaper that,
because the Russian hospital where his sister and
niece were being treated had no antidote for
thallium poisoning, he flew there with one called
Prussian Blue and, after they began taking it,
saw an immediate improvement in their condition.

[There are several ways for exposure to thallium
to occur -- through ingestion of contaminated
food, through workplace exposure and through
environmental contamination/exposure. Oftentimes
work place exposure is associated with inhalation
of the substance, which can result in a higher
exposure level, which in turn may lead to
neurologic system involvement. Ingestion of
thallium usually results in a lower level
exposure with resultant gastrointestinal
involvement such as vomiting, diarrhea, and often
there is a temporary alopecia (hair loss) associated with the ingestion.
Thallium is a metal and may be obtained from the
smelting of other metals. It is generally used in
electronic devices and the semiconductor
industry. It has also been used for special glass
manufacturing. As a pure metal is it odorless and
tasteless, but it is often found in combination
with other substances such as bromine, chlorine,
fluorine, and iodine. When it's combined, it
appears colorless-to-white or yellow.
When there is environmental contamination with
thallium, usually associated with the smelting
process, it remains in the air, water and/or soil
for a prolonged period of time. Rain or snow may
remove it from the atmosphere, but it is still
available for plants as well as fish and
shellfish to absorb it from the environment.
In humans the results of low dose chronic
ingestion has not been well characterized.
Ingestion of large amounts of thallium in a short
period of time has resulted in hair loss,
gastrointestinal effects, as well as effects on
the nervous system, the heart, lungs, liver and
kidneys. It can result in death.
To date there have not been reports of birth
defects resulting from pregnant women exposed to
low level contamination of food products such as
fruit and vegetables. However, developmental and
reproductive effects associated with low level
contamination of food products has been
documented in rats. Studies on rodents suggest
the male reproductive system may be susceptible.
Industrial exposure is most often associated with
inhalation of the substance but it is not known
if short time high level exposure impacts on
human reproduction. The impact of exposure to
thallium via skin contact has not been well
characterized in either humans or animals. As
thallium is a soluble substance there is the
theoretical concern that there would be absorption through skin contact.
There have not been studies in either humans or
laboratory animals addressing the issue of
thallium as a carcinogenic substance.
Blood, urine and hair may be tested for thallium
exposure. Treatment includes Prussian Blue or ferric ferrocyanide.
Thallium is used in rodenticides (poisons) in some parts of the world.
A curious question here is what made the brother
suspect thallium and why did he fly over to
Russia with Prussian Blue?. In the United States
it is available through appropriate medical channels. - Mod.TG]
