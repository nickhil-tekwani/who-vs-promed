CHOLERA - CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
**********************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Sat, 20 Sep 1997 22:40:42 +0200
From: "Philippe Glaziou" <glaziou@pasteur.fr>

Cases of cholera were detected and confirmed in Central African Republic
for the first time in more than 10 years between June and August 1997. The
first case was detected 50 km south of Bangui in June, then 3 cases in
Kouango (100 km West of Bangui) in July, 2 cases in Ngaoundaye
(north-eastern part of the country) by the end of July, 2 cases in Mobaye
(250 km West of Bangui) in August and the last 3 cases (one fatal) in
Ngaoundaye by the end of August. All cholera strains were O1 Inaba. No
suspected case was detected in the South since the end of June. The
emergence of cholera along the Oubangui River might be related to the
influx of Rwandan refugees coming from ex-Zaire last May. Molecular
analysis of the strains is being performed at Pasteur Institute in Paris.
