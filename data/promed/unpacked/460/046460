Georgia's bell peppers [capsicum] and other Southern vegetables in
early October [2008] experienced lower yields from the effects of
Tropical Storm Fay, which deluged the growing region with
double-digit rainfall. Rains from the late-August [2008] storm have
caused disease problems on peppers and other crops such as cucumbers
and squash, growers report.

Steven Johnson, salesman for South Georgia Produce Inc., Lake Park,
Ga., said, "There is a lot of damage to the pepper from Fay that
didn't really show up until the last couple of weeks as far as
disease. We should see volume cut almost in half."

Jim Monteith, sales manager for Pacific Collier Fresh Co., Immokalee,
Fla., said, "We will see a reduced yield with this crop due to
Tropical Storm Fay. There are bacteria problems in Georgia with the
crop in every grower's fields and I'm sure that some growers may have
more problems than others."

Jeff Stepanovich, salesman, said, "On crops like peppers and squash,
there is a lot of disease pressure that is affecting (them) and will
continue to affect yields. I would say that Georgia will only yield
around 70 percent of its normal volume on bell pepper."

[Bell peppers are a group of cultivars of the species _Capsicum
annuum_, which can produce red, yellow, green, and orange fruits.
Bacterial diseases of capsicum, which are mentioned above, are know
to be caused by species in the genera of _Xanthomonas_ (leaf spot),
_Ralstonia_ (wilt), _Clavibacter_ (canker), and _Pseudomonas_
(seedling blight, leaf spot). Bacterial, fungal, and
insect-transmitted viral pathogens can be expected to thrive on crops
under conditions as are currently being found in the area described.
