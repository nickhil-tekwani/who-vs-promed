There is an outbreak of the groundnut rosette disease in Gushiegu [district] in the Northern Region. The disease is caused by a virus that leads to stunting and distortion of the shoots of the plant. The disease [was] found in 10 communities and so far has affected 25 acres [about 10 ha] of groundnut farms. Some farmers [said] that the disease was fast spreading but they did not have any chemical to control it, there were many other farmers who were also struggling to deal with the disease.

A municipal crop officer in the district confirmed the outbreak. "Once the field is infested, they should clear the entire area to avoid spread of the disease because as of now, there is nothing to use in controlling it," he said. The directorate introduced some groundnut varieties resistant to diseases but could not continue the supply of seeds. "We are relying on last year's [2017] harvest, trying to spread these varieties to reduce the disease." [He] cautioned that if not tackled immediately, the disease could cause extensive damage. Crop officers were yet to visit all communities in the area to advise farmers. There is a need for a coordinated approach [that] will help ensure rapid movement of new cultivars to farmers.

[Rosette is the most destructive disease of peanut (_Arachis hypogaea_) in Africa and was first reported from Tanzania in the early 1900s. It is endemic to the sub-Saharan region and its off-shore islands, including Madagascar. 3 types of disease have been described which are due to synergistic complexes of different strains of _Groundnut rosette virus_ (GRV; genus _Umbravirus_), its satellite RNA and _Groundnut rosette assistor virus_ (GRAV; unassigned to genus, family Luteoviridae). All disease types can cause up to 100 per cent yield loss if infection occurs before flowering: chlorotic rosette with faint mottling, yellowing, curling and malformation of leaflets, some veinbanding and blotching; green rosette with mild mottling and dark green, severe stunting; mosaic rosette with green blotching and severe chlorosis, less severe rosetting.

Both GRAV and GRV alone do not lead to symptoms in peanut. Umbraviruses have an ssRNA genome and do not form conventional particles, but are encapsidated only with a helper virus. GRV is packaged in the GRAV virions and thus depends on GRAV for transmission by _Aphis craccivora_ and some other aphid species (persistent, circulative manner). The associated satellite RNAs control the symptoms and cause the different types of rosette.

Disease management may include vector control with insecticides, removal of pathogen and vector reservoirs (volunteer crop plants, weeds), and cultural practices such as early sowing at optimal plant densities. Host resistance to one or more of the component agents is considered the most viable option in smallholder systems. Several rosette resistant crop varieties have been bred from West African land races and wild peanut relatives. However, most of them are late maturing and unsuitable for many locations. Furthermore, while a high percentage of plants of some of the currently available lines do not show visible symptoms in the field, the yield reduction in those plants may be substantial under rosette epidemics. Identification of combined resistance to GRAV, GRV and the satellite RNAs is vital to improve availability of rosette resistance.
