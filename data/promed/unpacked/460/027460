I see 2 major drawbacks with the proposed hurricane Sandy early start hypothesis [see: ProMED-mail post "Influenza (06): 2013 season early start hypothesis," archive number 20130113.1495601]:

1) The early spread of this year's [2012-2013] influenza season began in the southern-central and southeastern United States, an area of the country that was not impacted by hurricane Sandy.

2) Areas of the northeastern and north-central United States that were most affected by hurricane Sandy began reporting high levels of influenza-like illness only relatively late in the progress of this year's [2012-2013 season] flu epidemic.

You can see this phenomenon clearly by viewing the progression of this year's [2012-13] flu season from the interactive map posted on the CDC's FluView website at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html by clicking on the PLAY button in the upper left area of the webpage.

If you compare the pattern of the flu season progression with the maps of the track of hurricane Sandy posted on the NOAA Hurricane Center Website (and elsewhere), and you can see that CDC data show no evident positive correlation in the geographic distribution and timing of this year's [2012-13] intense influenza illness activity in the United States relative to the area impacted by hurricane Sandy.

It is an interesting question, indeed, but I think that one must look elsewhere for potential factors driving the relatively early onset and proliferation of this year's [2012-13] flu season in the United States.

[ProMED-mail thanks Joseph Dudley for drawing attention to the excellent graphics available at the CDC FluView website (http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html), recording the apparent initiation of the 2012/2013 influenza outbreak in the southeast and its subsequent progress northwards. While these observations do not correspond to the movement of hurricane Sandy, it still seems likely that the congregation of people in shelters provides conditions favourable for the transmission of infectious diseases, and respiratory diseases in particular. Furthermore, the northwards progression of the 2012/2013 influenza outbreak remains to be explained. - Mod.CP]
