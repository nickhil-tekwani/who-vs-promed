Bangladesh: possibility of person-to-person transmission considered
-----------------------------------------------
"Nipah," a seasonal viral disease causing encephalitis, which claimed 50
lives last winter [northern winter months of 2004], may strike again in a
virulent form, warn local and foreign experts. Last year [2003] the spread
of the disease seemed to have stopped.
A study conducted by local and foreign virologists recently revealed
that the outbreak of the virus has been limited to southwestern
districts of Bangladesh in the past 3 years, with a mortality rate of
50 to 100 percent in different areas. The virus was traced to fruit
bats. Some experts are of the opinion that the virus-prone belt
stretches along the course of the Padma [river] up to south-west India,
causing death to an unaccounted number of people every year. There is
no laboratory in Bangladesh that can detect the virus.
Extensive research has found that pregnant bats harbored the virus
and possibly transmitted it to humans. The experts did not rule out
human to human transmission of the disease. In the latest spell this
year [2004], 4 members of a mendicant family at Faridpur died, after
the mendicant himself became infected and died. A rickshaw-puller,
who carried a patient to the hospital, also became infected and died.
This gives credence to the view that the virus is passed on from
humans to humans.
The bats become pregnant from November to April, and most of the Nipah-like
infection cases were reported during that period. The study found that,
usually, a group of people were infected at a time, and that the victims
were related. Dr. AKM Shahidul Islam, an Associate Professor of Microbiology
at the Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital, who was part of the team
that conducted the survey, said date and palm juices, contaminated by urine
or droppings of Nipah-infected bats, could transmit Nipah virus to humans.
He said: "The jujube drops from a tree after it had been partly eaten up by
bats at night. While eating a jujube, the bats secrete saliva on it. When
the children collect the fruit, and eat it without washing, the virus of
bat's saliva is transmitted to them." He pointed out that most of the people
who died of this virus infection were not more than 15 years old. He advised
people not to eat fruit bitten or half-eaten by bats, or drink the raw
juices of palm and date in a Nipah-prevalent area. About 17 percent of the
bats were found to be carrying antibodies against Nipah virus in their blood
and, surprisingly, all were pregnant. Tests on other domestic and wild
animals proved negative.
Dr. Shahid said, "The latest finding is the presence of [Nipah] virus
genetic material in the beds of 2 patients in Faridpur General
Hospital. It means that the virus is capable of spilling out of the
patient's body, but it is questionable whether it is infectious or
not. Only laboratory culture of the sample could prove whether these
are full [infectious] virus or only [non-infectious material], but
the IEDCR has no facility to ascertain that," he added. Dr. Shahid
said: "Several guidelines were formulated to control the outbreak of
the disease, including guidelines for doctors regarding diagnosis and
treatment, for nurses and other health-care professionals about the
care of patients as well as personal protective measures, and for the
public and relatives of the patients about what to do in case of
infection."
Last season [northern winter 2004], the disease was 1st reported in
Goalundo, in Rajbari district, as an "unknown'" ailment between 12 and 18
Jan 2004. Then, it was reported in Faridpur, Manikganj, Tangail, and
Joypurhat. The disease begins with fever, followed by unconsciousness within
one to 2 days of feverish illness. According to an ICDDR [International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research]study, 2 previous Nipah outbreaks
were recorded before the last outbreak. The 1st recorded outbreak occurred
between 25 Apr and 26 May 2001, causing 9 deaths in Meherpur district.
Between 11 and 28 Jan 2003, another outbreak killed 8 out of 17 affected
persons in Naogaon. After the epidemic in January 2004, foreign experts from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA, the World
Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, Health Canada, and
the University of Malaya came to the country to investigate the outbreak.
