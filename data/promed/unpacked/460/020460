A construction worker in Gansu Province died soon after he hunted, cooked,
and ate an infected marmot, the provincial health authority has announced.

The authority announced on Tuesday, 15 Jun 2010, that the man developed a
high fever and swollen lymph glands under his left armpit. He was also
shivering and suffered from fatigue after he ate the animal on Saturday
morning, 13 Jun 2010. He was rushed to the People's Hospital in the Aksai
Kazakh autonomous county and died a few hours later. He was diagnosed with
bubonic plague.

The man was one of the workers building a road from Dunhuang to
Dangjinshan. He hunted a marmot for food near the construction site. A
worker with the project's administrative office confirmed the case to the
Global Times but declined to give details.

The local health authority launched emergency response measures after the
incident by sending experts to disinfect the construction site. "As of
right now, none of those who had close contact with the man shows any
abnormal symptoms," the health authority said in a statement. Health
officials have urged herdsmen, tourists, and workers to stay away from
marmots and their resting place. They also urged residents to inform
authorities if they spot any dead marmots.

[The usual mode of transmission for bubonic plague is via a flea bite.
Bubonic plague is named for the typical "bubo", a very tender _Yersinia
pestis_ infected lymph node. A secondary bacteremia may occur which can
lead to lethal side effects. If pneumonic plague develops, spread from
human-to-human can occur, which can lead to an outbreak of pneumonic plague.

Marmots such as the tarvaga, the tarbagan, or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota
sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_),
are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in
Eastern Asia. The name marmot (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot>) comes
from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ (or _mus montanus_)
"mountain mouse". - Mod.LL
