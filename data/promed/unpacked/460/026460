[The number of reported yellow fever (YF) cases has increased from 14 on 29 Sep 2015, to 21 on 30 Oct 2015, and not increased since then. These YF virus infections were reported as sylvan transmission cycle occurrences and not acquired in urban settings.

The epidemiological bulletin covers the period in 2015 up to epidemiological week 47 ending 28 Nov 2015. No details of these cases are provided other than the numbers of cases by department and region.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information including specific dates when the cases occurred, their sex and ages, as well as any occurrence of infected monkeys.

YF virus is endemic in the tropical areas of South America including the Amazon Basin of Peru, where sporadic cases occur. Individuals traveling or working in these remote, forested areas often are not vaccinated and become infected with YF virus. The risk is that, should viremic individuals travel to nearby villages where the urban vector mosquito is present and villagers have not been vaccinated, an urban transmission cycle could be initiated. There were sylvan YF cases in Peru in 2013 and 2014 (see archives below).
