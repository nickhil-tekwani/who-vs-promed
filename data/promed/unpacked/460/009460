A deadly epidemic feared to be pneumonic plague has broken out in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), WHO said on Fri, 29 Sep 2006.
There are dozens of suspect cases and up to 20 deaths in the
outbreak, which a WHO team is investigating along with health
ministry officials, WHO plague expert Eric Bertherat said. "There is
an epidemic which we are trying to confirm is the plague in the
northeast Ituri region," Bertherat told Reuters.
Preliminary indications point to pneumonic plague, the most deadly
and least common form of the disease, which can be spread by humans
without involvement of fleas, he said. "It seems it could be the
pneumonic form, which is extremely contagious with a high mortality
rate of about 50 percent ... At least several dozen cases are
reported and up to 20 fatalities," Bertherat said.
The outbreak is around Isiro, north-east of the eastern city of
Kisangani in the remote, mineral-rich Ituri region.
In early 2005, 150 cases of plague were confirmed in Zobia, north of
Kisangani, half of them fatal, according to the WHO. Many of the
miners working at the diamond mine in Zobia fled the outbreak and
spread the highly contagious disease.
Rapid diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics is essential to reduce
complications and fatality, according to the WHO.

[Primary pneumonic plague (1 percent of natural plague presentations)
arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious
aerosols, such as would be produced when there are secondary
pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.
Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.
Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters as being at greatest
risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through
air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for
prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.
