Alarm as more fall ill amid deadly outbreak
-------------------------------------------
A further 7 cases of potentially deadly legionnaires' disease are now
under investigation, after 5 cases were confirmed in Wollongong. The
5th person was identified as it was revealed that 3 air conditioning
towers in Wollongong's Central Business District (CBD) were positive
for legionella bacteria less than a week ago [2nd week of February
2005].
A 61-year-old Wollongong man, who started showing symptoms of the
disease on 4 Feb 2005, is being treated at Wollongong hospital. 4
other men -- aged 35, 57, 75 and 84 -- were infected between 30 Dec
2004 and 25 Jan 2005. 7 other patients are under investigation after
visiting their GPs or hospital emergency departments with
pneumonia-like symptoms.
The earlier victims had visited Wollongong CBD before getting the disease,
which is contracted through breathing contaminated air from air conditioning
cooling towers or bacteria in potting mix [The potting mix organism is
_Legionella longbeachae_, not the more usual _L. pneumophila_ - Mod.LL].
The highest legionella count was found in the IMB Arcade cooling
towers on Smith St., Wollongong. The council building in Burelli St.
and Investment House on Smith St. also recorded the presence of
legionella.
Doctor of infectious diseases and immunology at Sydney University,
Ray Kearney, said health authorities were dealing with a "significant
incidence well above average." He said there was a potential link
between all 12 cases and the contaminated air conditioning units. "I
can't say categorically that the air conditioning [units] with the bacteria
in them are the source, but where there's contamination of water, the
risk is very much there," he said.
South Eastern Sydney/Illawarra Health issued a statement, saying the
source of the outbreak was too difficult to pinpoint. "The only thing
we can say is that, based on our advice from council, with regard to
the cleaning of those towers that had tested as positive, there is no
evidence of any ongoing risk," a SESIHS spokeswoman said.
The Illawarra area had the world's 3rd largest outbreak of the
disease in 1987, which resulted in 13 deaths and 53 cases of
legionnaires' disease.

[The city of Wollongong -- Australia's 9th largest city -- is located
just south of Sydney, in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. It
should be noted that _Legionella sp._ can be commonly isolated in
cooling towers of commercial air conditioner units even without human
cases. In order to prove the association with human cases, human
isolates have to be shown in the laboratory to be identical to environmental
isolates. - Mod.LL]
