In Verkhnyaya Pyshma of Sverdlovsk province 6 builders were
hospitalized in the intensive care unit and one of them died. The
emergency car discovered 6 builders from Uzbekistan in almost
unconscious condition near the building site. They were cooking
macaroni and used some white crystal-like powder as a salt. The
substance is under investigation and the hypothesis is that it might
be a nitrate of natrium . [Natrium is the chemical name for sodium.
This product (sodium nitrate) is used in chemical, glass, metallurgy,
pipe and other industries, for export and for retail trade as
fertilizer. - Mods.TG/MPP]

According to the head of the investigation, all 6 builders felt
malaise right after dinner, they were hospitalized, and one died.
This case is under medical [evaluation] and the substance is also
being investigated. According to a preliminary hypothesis, the
builders used a popular anti-freeze substance used for concrete --
nitrate natrium [sodium nitrate] -- instead of salt. In May 2003 a
poisoning outbreak with 4 deaths was reported, and in 1997 there were 8 deaths.

[This is appears to be sodium nitrate. However the article implies
these builders may have mistaken it for sodium chloride, better known
as table salt.

Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been mistaken for table
salt. Clinical signs of ingestion may include gastroenteritis,
abdominal pains, dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, and
collapse. Purging and diuresis are expected. If the victim receives
small, repeated doses there may be headache and mental impairment.
Generally in the case of mistaking sodium nitrate for sodium
chloride, the dose may be larger for large meals typical of
celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being converted to the more
toxic nitrites have been reported.

Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial
action converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism
responsible for botulism poisoning. Generally sodium nitrite has
replaced sodium nitrate, except in slow-cured hams.

The following remarks are regarding nitrite and are from my fellow
moderator LL, copied from a previous ProMED posting:

Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the
spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes
botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word
botulinum comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which
was responsible for many deaths centuries ago before curing with
nitrite was used. In addition to serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite
is used to produce the characteristic flavor, texture, and pink color
of cured meats.

At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in
hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin,
which does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood.
Symptoms of methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia
(fast heart rate), weakness, and dizziness. As oxygenation of tissues
decreases to the point of becoming truly inadequate, dyspnea
(shortness of breath), acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart
rhythms), coma, convulsions, and even death may occur. - Mod.TG
