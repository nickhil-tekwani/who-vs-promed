Sri Lanka: dengue outbreak closes schools and government institutions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of Colombo's top schools, government institutions, and the national
museum have been forced to close temporarily as Sri Lanka [fights] a dengue
fever epidemic that has claimed the lives of dozens of people in the past
months. In the past 6 months more than 25 people have died of dengue, and
many of the worst affected are schoolchildren. Dengue cases in Sri Lanka
have increased 45 per cent this year compared with last year; some 3800
cases have been reported since January 2002.
Prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has spearheaded the anti-dengue
campaign and called for the closure of several institutions including one
of Sri Lanka's biggest colleges and his own childhood school, Royal
College, media reports said. Dengue awareness campaigns are being conducted
in all parts of the country. The disease appears to be spreading more in
the elitist, wealthy parts of Colombo than in the poor shanty areas. The
local media reported on Sun 23 Jun 2002 that the Colombo Municipal Council
has filed 40 court cases against institutions and individuals who have
failed to maintain proper health standards and over 350 warning notices
have been made.

Malaysia: increased dengue cases in Kuala Lumpur
------------------------------------------------
Last year, 17 dengue cases were recorded in Taman Setiawangsa in Kuala
Lumpur. This year, 77 cases have been recorded for the first 6 months.
There have been no fatalities.
With such an alarming increase in cases, there is a need to educate the
public about dengue fever and the threat posed by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. This
prompted Wangsa Maju's member of parliament, Datuk Zulhasnan Rafique, to
organise a gotong-royong clean-up in the area recently. Launched at Jalan
Setiawangsa 10, the clean-up saw residents volunteering their services.
During the gotong-royong, mosquito traps were handed out to residents. The
traps are containers that can be filled with clean water to attract
mosquitoes. When the insects lay eggs in the water, their larvae become
trapped inside. Zainol Ariffin said: "This method has been successfully
used in Salak Selatan, Taman Midah and Salak Jaya to reduce the number of
_Aedes_ mosquitoes."

El Salvador: government claims battle being won
-----------------------------------------------
SAN SALVADOR: A fumigation campaign is beginning to pay off and has put El
Salvador within sight of victory against the outbreak of dengue fever that
has killed at least 6 children and infected over 1600 others [of all ages,
presumably], officials have said. Health minister Francisco Lopez Beltran
says that the campaign to destroy the larvae of mosquitoes that transmit
the potentially fatal disease has started to produce quantifiable results
and in another 2 weeks the epidemic should be under control. He confirmed
that 1637 cases of "classic" and "hemorrhagic" dengue fever have been
confirmed, resulting in the deaths of 6 children. Around 20 more are in
hospital and several are in intensive care.
Earlier this month, the government declared a state of emergency in the 4
departments most severely affected by the epidemic (San Salvador, Cabanas,
La Libertad, and Santa Ana) and began spraying the mosquito's breeding
areas. The Pan-American Health Organization's delegate in San Salvador,
Horacio Toro, said officials were acting correctly to fight the outbreak
but noted that a permanent prevention plan was needed "or the same thing
could happen all over again in a few months' time".

Guatemala: 71 cases of classic dengue fever confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------
GUATEMALA CITY: A total of 71 cases of classic dengue fever have been
confirmed in Guatemala in 2002, Ministry of Public Health and Social
Assistance officials said on Sun 30 Jun 2002. Public Health Ministry
spokesman Jose Candido Barillas told EFE that so far this year Guatemala
had experienced 1098 suspected cases of classic dengue fever, a highly
contagious disease that causes severe headaches and pain in the eyes,
bones, and joints. Barillas explained that a door-to-door search for dengue
fever was being carried out in the south eastern provinces of Santa Rosa
and Jutiapa.
Barillas said that, due to the epidemic of hemorrhagic dengue fever -- a
much more serious illness -- affecting El Salvador and Honduras, a "yellow
alert" has been in place in the areas of Guatemala bordering these
countries and in other nearby provinces. Hemorrhagic dengue fever, as its
name suggests, causes hemorrhaging and can be fatal if not treated in time.
There have been 1637 confirmed cases of dengue fever so far this year in El
Salvador, of which 122 have been hemorrhagic. As a result, 6 children have
died. The Public Health Ministry of Honduras has recorded around 130 cases
of hemorrhagic dengue fever so far this year, while the number of classic
dengue cases exceeds 3400 nationwide. So far, no cases of hemorrhagic
dengue fever have been recorded in Guatemala, Barillas said.

Honduras declares national alert
--------------------------------
Health officials have declared a national alert against dengue fever after
tallying 789 cases of the disease in the first 5 months of the year.
Officials urged people to clean their homes to stop the breeding of
mosquitoes that carry the potentially fatal disease. An outbreak in
neighboring El Salvador has claimed 4 [now 6] lives and led the authorities
there to declare a state of emergency in 4 regions.

The weekly report from the Ceara State Health Secretariat, published on 27
Jun 2002, lists 8651 confirmed cases of dengue in 2002, including 1903 in
Fortaleza (the state capital), with 36 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(plus 9 more suspected) -- 24 of them in Fortaleza -- and 6 deaths.
Juazeiro do Norte, a township 563 km from Fortaleza, has the largest number
of cases in the interior of the state, 549.
The deaths were 1 in Iguatu, 2 in Fortaleza, and 1 each in Barbalha,
Catarina, and Crateus. The number of cases has been diminishing monthly,
and is now comparable with that of the same period last year.
