Farmers in Nyeri County are counting losses after an ongoing livestock vaccination drive led to the deaths of at least 10 animals. The farmers, the majority of whom are from Konyu Ward in Mathira Constituency, raised the alarm after their goats fell ill days after being vaccinated.

The agriculture department has been carrying out an annual month-long livestock vaccination programme, which started on [5 Nov 2019] and runs until [20 Dec 2019]. Farmers have been paying KES 30 [USD 0.30] to protect their cows against lumpy skin disease [LSD] while those with goats and sheep are paying KES 20 [USD 0.20] for the animals to be vaccinated against anthrax and black quarter.

[MN] told The Standard that his goat started exhibiting swelling of the skin and fever. "I took my goat for the vaccination as advised, but after one week, the animal fell sick. It is my only goat. My neighbour lost 4 goats while my brother lost 2 of his animals," [MN] said.

His neighbour, [JK], also expressed concern about her 3 goats. "They have been unable to feed properly and they seem to have breathing problems. The veterinary officer came by and administered some drugs but so far improvement has been slow," [JK] said.

Reports obtained by The Standard indicated that dozens of animals may have been affected. The livestock exhibit similar symptoms, which include fever, bodily weakness and paralysis, and skin lesions with small pimples.

Agriculture Executive James Wachihi denied reports that hundreds of animals had been affected, instead stating that 10 deaths had been reported while 12 animals were sick and receiving treatment. "I am aware of what has been happening in Kiamabara village. We are investigating what could have led to the deaths and illness of the vaccinated goats," Mr. Wachihi said.

Wachihi said the animals started exhibiting symptoms of sheep and goat pox diseases. "Our officers have collected samples from the dead goats for testing and also treated the sick animals." He added: "Several things may have taken place during the vaccination, including cross-contamination of the vaccines or one of the officers may have made an error. Either way, we shall get answers." [see comments below].

The executive said the county would not compensate farmers until investigations were complete. "We will hold the person responsible personally liable for the losses incurred by the farmers."

[From the symptoms described, in particular fever and skin lesions, as well as from the Agriculture Executive's response, it appears that the affected goats have been exposed to the lumpy skin disease (LSD) vaccine currently released for mass vaccinations of Kenya's cattle.

The exposure of the goats to the LSD vaccine could have taken place by the use of a wrong vial (LSD vaccine) instead of the anthrax/black quarter (_Clostridium_) vaccine, or by the use of an injector/needle that had been earlier used for cattle vaccination against LSD.

The Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Production Institute (KEVEVAPI) included the following contraindications and warnings in its guidelines for LUMPIVAX TM (a freeze-dried, live attenuated LSD viral vaccine prepared from the Neethling strain of the virus): "Avoid contact between sheep and vaccinated cattle for at least 3 weeks after vaccination" (https://kevevapi.or.ke/product/poxvax-tm/).

LSD is caused by a capripox virus. In Africa and the Middle East, several live attenuated capripoxvirus (CaPV) vaccine strains are currently used for cattle and small ruminants, including LSD virus (LSDV) Neethling strain, Kenyan sheep and goat poxvirus (KSGPV) O-240 and O-180 strains, Yugoslavian RM65 sheep pox (SPP), Romanian SPP and Gorgan goatpox (GTP) strains. Though they are all known to confer cross-immunity, these vaccines should be used only in the animal species or breeds indicated by the producers. For example: KEVEVAPI's guidelines for its "S&G VAX" ("a freeze-dried live attenuated sheep and goat pox viral vaccine prepared from the 0240 Kenya sheep and goat pox strain of the capripox virus") include the warning: "This preparation is for use in sheep and goats only" (https://kevevapi.or.ke/product/sg-vax-tm/). - Mod.AS
