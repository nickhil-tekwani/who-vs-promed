The military used commercial carriers to deliver what it thought was inert anthrax to research laboratories. The US military accidentally sent live anthrax samples to as many as 9 labs across the country and to a US military base in South Korea, the Pentagon says.

22 military personnel at the Osan Air Base in South Korea are receiving preventive treatment after being possibly exposed to the sample.

In the US, 4 civilians are receiving treatment -- although they face a "minimal risk".

A Defense Department lab in Utah "inadvertently" shipped the samples.

The personnel at the South Korean base might have come into contact with the anthrax sample during a "training event", the US military said, but so far none had shown "any signs" of exposure. However, they were given "appropriate medical precautionary measures to include examinations, antibiotics and in some instances, vaccinations". "The sample was destroyed in accordance with appropriate protocols," said Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren.

Experts in biosafety say they are astonished by the lapse and called for greater precautions.

The base at Osan, South Korea, is home to the US Air Force 51st Fighter Wing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun an investigation into the incident. "Out of an abundance of caution, [the Defense Department] has stopped the shipment of this material from its labs pending completion of the investigation," said Col Warren. Samples involved in the investigation will be securely transferred to CDC or affiliated laboratories "for further testing", CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harden said. Ms Harden said that the CDC has also sent officials to the labs "to conduct on-site investigations".

The latest incident comes nearly a year after the CDC, one of the government's foremost civilian laboratories, also mishandled anthrax, the Associated Press news agency reported.

The Pentagon said that it accidentally sent shipments of live anthrax bacteria from the Dugway Proving ground facility. It said that researchers at a laboratory set up to deal with extremely dangerous pathogens dispatched what they thought were "killed samples" of anthrax to another CDC facility. [Sic. The Dugway laboratory is not part of CDC. - Mod.MHJ] But it did not have sufficient safeguards and was not equipped to work with live anthrax, AP reported, and several CDC employees were "potentially exposed" to live anthrax. However, none became ill.

The Defense Department spokesman said that the samples in the latest incident were supposed to be dead or deactivated.

The government has confirmed one shipment actually had live spores, and the eight others might also have done so. The live spores were shipped from Utah to labs in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and Virginia, as well as the air base in South Korea.

Human error probably was not a factor in the Army's mistaken shipment of live anthrax samples to numerous U.S. government and commercial laboratories in the U.S. and in South Korea, the Army's top general said Thursday. Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, told reporters the problem may have been a failure in the technical process of killing, or inactivating, anthrax samples. The process in this case "might not have completely killed" the samples as intended before they were shipped, he said.

U.S. officials at Osan Air Base in South Korea said in a statement that the anthrax bacteria it received for training purposes "might not be an inert training sample as expected," and as a result, the suspect anthrax was destroyed by hazardous materials teams Wednesday. They said 22 people at Osan "may have been exposed" to the live anthrax and were given precautionary medical measures, including examinations, antibiotics and vaccinations. "None of the personnel have shown any signs of possible exposure," the air base said in a written statement.

Odierno said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating that aspect of what went wrong at Dugway Proving Ground, the Army installation in the state of Utah that sent the anthrax to government and commercial labs in 9 states across the U.S. and to an Army lab in South Korea.

The general said he was not aware that such a problem had surfaced previously at Dugway. "The best I can tell, it was not human error," he said, adding that normal procedures had been followed.

The Pentagon disclosed on Wednesday that at least 1 of 9 labs in the U.S. that received anthrax from Dugway got live rather than dead bacteria. It has not identified any of the U.S. laboratories by name.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is investigating what the Pentagon called an inadvertent shipment of live anthrax spores to government and commercial laboratories in as many as 9 states, as well as 1 overseas, that expected to receive dead spores.

U.S. military officials said Thursday morning no one at the 19 separate military and civilians labs that received the anthrax samples shows any signs of anthrax infection, NBC News reported. In all, 14 private labs, four military labs and Stanford University received the anthrax samples.

"At this time we do not suspect any risk to the general public," CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben said Wednesday.

In a statement on Thursday, Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin assured the community that the university is "secure and there is no threat to campus or public safety." The "single vial" was sent to the Stanford School of Medicine on 22 Jul 2014, and last opened 7 days later, according to Stanford. That vial was shipped to the CDC, which later informed the school that the live agent, _Bacilllus anthracis_, "may not have been fully deactivated before shipment." The vial had been handled by 2 people, and to date, Stanford said it has not received any reports of illness or reactions in the last 10 months.

A Pentagon spokesman, Col. Steve Warren, said the suspected live anthrax samples were shipped from Dugway Proving Ground, an Army facility in Utah, using a commercial delivery service. Warren said the government has confirmed 1 recipient, a laboratory in Maryland, received live spores. Later he said an anthrax sample from the same batch at Dugway also was sent to a U.S. military laboratory at Osan air base in South Korea; no personnel there have shown signs of exposure, he said, and the sample was destroyed.

None of the other 18 facilities have discovered live anthrax in their samples at this point, officials said Thursday. The CDC is collecting all the Anthrax samples from the 19 facilities.

"There is no known risk to the general public, and there are no suspected or confirmed cases of anthrax infection in potentially exposed lab workers," Warren said.

A U.S. official said Wednesday evening that 4 people in three commercial labs had worked with the suspect anthrax samples and the CDC has recommended the 4 be provided "post-exposure prophylaxis," or preventive treatment. The official was not authorized to discuss the details because they involved non-government lab employees, and so spoke on condition of anonymity.

The anthrax samples were shipped from Dugway to government and commercial labs in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and Virginia. The Defense Department, acting "out of an abundance of caution," has halted "the shipment of this material from its labs pending completion of the investigation," Warren said.

Harben said 1 of the laboratories contacted the CDC to request "technical consultation." It was working as part of a Pentagon effort to develop a new diagnostic test to identify biological threats, she said. "Although an inactivated agent was expected, the lab reported they were able to grow live _Bacillus anthracis_," she said, referring to the bacteria that cause anthrax disease. The CDC is working with state and federal agencies on an investigation with the labs that received samples from the Defense Department, she said. Harben said all samples involved in the investigation will be securely transferred to the CDC or other laboratories for further testing.

"A sample of Anthrax was also sent to the Joint United States Forces Korea (USFK) Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition Program at Osan Air Base," Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman said. "There is no known risk to the general public, and no personnel have shown any signs of possible exposure. The sample was destroyed in accordance with appropriate protocols."

The samples were shipped on 30 Apr 2015 from the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah to a military laboratory in Maryland. From there they were shipped via a commercial shipper to 8 companies with laboratories in 9 states: California, Texas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. According to a Defense official, a laboratory in Maryland detected that their shipment contained live samples and contacted the CDC. That triggered a response from the Defense Department and other agencies, including the FBI, to trace the shipments to ensure that they were properly secured.

According to CDC spokesman Jason McDonald, a CDC team was at Dugway investigating how the inadvertent shipment occurred. "At least 18 labs in 9 states received sample kits containing 23 marked specimens and 2 controls," said McDonald said. "1 of the controls was labeled 'antigen 1.' It was this vial that tested positive in a lab in Maryland. State health departments have done risk assessments and Maryland offered antibiotics to 4 lab workers due to possible exposure. 3 of the 4 workers decided to take the antibiotics."

The DoD routinely sends dead anthrax spores or inactivated spores to research facilities. The official said that military laboratories use commercial companies to ship samples of live anthrax to research facilities, but only with the proper bio-level safety protocols.

The samples all came from a batch of anthrax listed as AG-1. The Pentagon has confirmed that 1 of the shipments contained live samples of AG-1 and suspects that the others do as well.

The Pentagon says that live anthrax was inadvertently shipped across state lines from a military lab in Utah to 9 other states and a military base in South Korea. However, a Department of Defense spokesperson says the public is not at risk. An unnamed US official also told Reuters that anthrax samples were being shipped out from 2 military facilities for over a year, from March 2014 to April 2015. These samples were mistakenly marked inactive, the official said.

While the anthrax samples were first moved out of Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, they were later shipped from Edgewood Chemical Biological Center in Maryland to federal, private and academic facilities.

Authorities have suggested that 22 people inside the US take preventative medicine in the wake of the news, Reuters reported. It's unclear if they were exposed to any live anthrax samples.

The single sample accidentally sent to South Korea arrived at the Osan Air Base, the Pentagon stated. The sample was destroyed and, so far, no one is believed to be at risk.

Warren confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday [27 May 2015] that the anthrax had been shipped out of state, but assured "there are no risks to the public." "We are investigating the inadvertent transfer of live anthrax from a DoD lab from Dugway Proving Ground," Col. Warren said. Dugway Proving Ground is a USArmy facility in Utah.

According to the Pentagon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is assisting the military with investigating the matter.

Col. Warren told the Associated Press that the government had confirmed that a single shipment meant to contain dead, or inactivated anthrax samples for research use actually contained live specimens. According to AP, Warren said the government believes eight other shipments contained similarly live samples.

The samples in question were shipped to labs in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and Virginia, according to AP.

In 2014, the director of the CDC's bioterror laboratory resigned after a scare raised concerns that dozens of government employees had potentially been exposed to anthrax at an Atlanta facility.

[Briefly, these Dugway shipments have been going on routinely for 12 months, and the shipment to South Korea was "accidental." The viable samples were part of the April 2015 batch, and involved recipients in Maryland and South Korea. And the intended recipients were 18 institutes in 9 US states. - Mod.MHJ]
