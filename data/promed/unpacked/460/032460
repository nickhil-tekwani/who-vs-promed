A Quang Binh Province official who spent days in floodwaters in October 2020 managing relief efforts died of a bacterial infection this week. The official, the People's Committee Chairman of Bac Trach Commune in Bo Trac District, [aged] 51, caught a fever and was hospitalized, said Nguyen Van Thuy, deputy chairman of the district. He had reportedly suffered from a slight injury to his knee but carried on evacuating people and wading in floodwaters to distribute essential items to people in inundated areas.

He was first taken to a local medical center for treatment, but his condition did not improve and was transferred to the Viet am-Cuba Dong Hoi Friendship Hospital with a high fever and a swollen knee. He was then taken to the Hue Central Hospital, where he was put on a ventilator and underwent artificial blood filtration. But doctor's efforts proved in vain and he succumbed to the infection.

Doctors said he died on Wednesday [11 Nov 2020], of melioidosis, a disease caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. They suspected he might have been infected after being in direct contact with contaminated soil and water.

Melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, has symptoms like fever, pneumonia, and abscesses, and inflammation of the brain and joints. Its mortality rate can be as high as 40 per cent. The disease was first diagnosed in Viet Nam in 1925, but there is not sufficient knowledge about it yet in the country. There are around 10 000 cases worldwide every year, mostly during the rainy season, many being fatal. There is no vaccine.

Quang Binh and other central provinces were hit by a series of storms and tropical depressions in October 2020, which caused heavy rains, floods, and landslides.

[It is not clear if the individual had any underlying diseases which increase the risk of mortality.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be reduced to 40%-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and, in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in the treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
