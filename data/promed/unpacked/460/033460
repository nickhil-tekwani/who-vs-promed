Primate virus jumps species barrier to humans for 1st time in Asia
------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists have identified the 1st reported case in Asia of
primate-to-human transmission of simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus
found in macaques and other primates that so far has not been shown to
cause disease in humans.
The transmission of the virus from a monkey to a human took place at a
monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia, the researchers report in the July 2005
issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. Even though this
particular virus jumping to humans may not prove dangerous, the scientists
warn that the dense human and primate populations in Asia could lead to
other primate-borne viruses jumping the species barrier and causing human
disease.
"The issue of primate-to-human viral transmission has been studied
extensively in Africa, largely because that is where HIV originated,"
explains Dr Lisa Jones-Engel, lead author of the study and a research
scientist in the Division of International Programs at the Washington
National Primate Research Center. "But there has not been much work on the
topic in Asia, which has huge primate diversity and large human populations."
Jones-Engel and her co-authors also argue for more research on diverse
contexts of human-primate contact. The vast majority of previous viral
transmission research focused on bushmeat hunting and consumption, a
practice in which local residents hunt monkeys for food [more commonly
practised in Africa].
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS in humans, is believed to have originated
as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and jumped the species barrier to
humans when African bushmeat hunters came into contact with blood from
infected animals. Though bushmeat hunting and consumption may be a
significant factor in viral transmission in Africa, Jones-Engel says,
people in Asia have many other contexts in which they come into contact
with primates, including animal markets, primate pet ownership, urban
performing primates, and zoos. In addition, monkeys are significant symbols
in both Buddhism and Hinduism, and monkey temples -- places of religious
worship that have become refuges for populations of primates -- are common
throughout much of South and Southeast Asia. In these areas, protected
macaque populations have thrived alongside dense human settlement for
centuries.
On the island of Bali alone, there are more than 40 such temples, which are
frequented by tourists from around the world. About 700 000 international
tourists visit the island's 4 main monkey temples every year. Temple
workers and people who live near the temples also have a great deal of
contact with monkeys at the religious sites.
"In Asia, the amount of contact between humans and primates in temple
settings dwarfs the contact due to bushmeat hunting," says Jones-Engel. For
this study, the researchers tested blood samples from 82 people who work in
or around a temple in Bali, as well as samples from macaques in the area.
They found antibodies for simian foamy virus in the blood of one 47 year
old farmer who visited the temple every day. They confirmed the tests by
performing a DNA analysis of the man's blood and found that the SFV strain
he carried was the same strain found in the temple's macaques. The man
denied owning a monkey as a pet, or hunting monkeys for food. He had been
bitten once and scratched more than once by the temple's macaques.
Researchers still don't know the long-term effects of SFV on humans. There
are about 40 known cases of people being infected through laboratory or zoo
contact or through bushmeat hunting in Africa. There are no known cases of
human disease yet.
However, Jones-Engel and her fellow researchers warn that there are other
primate viruses known to be harmful that could jump the species barrier.
They don't want people to be afraid of coming in contact with macaques or
other primates, but they do urge people to be cautious and careful when
interacting with monkeys. Feeding the animals, or even carrying food into a
temple, can greatly increase the risk of a bite or scratch, which can lead
to transmission of infection. Visitors occasionally engage in other risky
behavior, such as touching animals or trying to hold baby monkeys. Limiting
such behavior can reduce the risk of bites and scratches.
"If you look at free-ranging monkeys in Singapore's nature reserves, you
see that feeding by visitors is not allowed, and it is actively
discouraged," says Gregory Engel, an attending physician at
Swedish/Providence Hospital in Seattle, Washington, a clinical instructor
of family medicine at the University of Washington, and a co-author on the
study. "Interspecies interaction there is very different, and rates of
human-monkey contact are much lower."
Limiting dangerous contact between primates and humans can have other
benefits as well, such as reducing the transmission of human infections to
monkeys. Human measles, for instance, can cause disease in monkeys and can
even kill them. Other primate species have already seen significant
population losses because of infection by human illnesses.
Also participating in the study were researchers at the University of
Toronto; Udayana University in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia; the University of
Notre Dame; the Southern Research Institute, Frederick, Maryland.; and the
Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, Texas.

transmission in Asia. Emerg Infect Dis 2005; 11(7): Jul

Summary:
"We describe the 1st reported transmission to a human of simian foamy virus
(SFV) from a free-ranging population of nonhuman primates in Asia. The
transmission of an exogenous retrovirus, SFV, from macaques (_Macaca
fascicularis_) to a human at a monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia was
investigated with molecular and serologic techniques. Antibodies to SFV
were detected by Western blotting of serum from one of 82 humans tested.
SFV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the
blood of the same person. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products confirmed
the virus's close phylogenetic relationship to SFV isolated from macaques
at the same temple. This study raises concerns that persons who work at or
live around monkey temples are at risk for infection with SFV."
Foamy virus of non-human primates has been regarded as a virus without a
disease in humans from previous studies. The main reason for this is that,
so far, no unambiguous evidence of illness has been associated with
enzootic infection of humans with SFV. SFV belongs to the genus
_Spumavirus_ in the family _Retroviridae_. The current report has
demonstrated substantial proof of transmission of SFV from a primate to a
human in Asia. Epizootiology of SFV among free ranging primates, the
natural hosts, and humans remains largely unknown. More research is
definitely needed. - Mod.RY]
