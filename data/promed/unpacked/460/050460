Background on Babesiosis - USA: nationwide survey
-------------------------------------------------
The following background data on babesiosis in the United States are
abstracted from Gideon http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon
e-book series [1,2] (primary references are available on request).

Time and Place:
Babesiosis was 1st diagnosed in the United States in 1968.
- Of 214 cases of babesiosis reported worldwide during 1975 to 1986,
200 occurred in the United States.
- Most cases are reported from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
New Jersey and Connecticut.
- Occasional cases are reported from Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey
and Georgia.
- Highest incidence is reported during the warmer months.

Infecting species:
- Babesia microti accounts for most cases, but B. equi may cause human
disease in California, and B. divergens in Missouri (implicated in a
single, fatal case).
- Infection due to Babesia duncani has been reported in Washington
State (Babesia WA1), California (Babesia CA1 and WA1) and
Missouri(Babesia MO1)
- Most infections due to these new species have occurred among
splenectomized individuals; whereas 95 percent of B. microti
infections are reported in persons with intact spleens.
- Human infection by a Babesia divergens-like strain has also been
reported in Washington State.
- There is evidence that Babesia WA1 infection is not limited to the
west coast region.

Additional Geographic Notes:
New York:
Babesiosis was 1st documented in New York State in 1975.
- 6 cases (0 fatal) were reported on Long Island during a 2-month
period (1982 publication)
- 139 patients were hospitalized for babesiosis in New York State
during 1982 to 1993 - 9 of these infections were fatal.
- 560 cases were reported in the state to 2001.
- 371 cases were reported in the Lower Hudson Valley during 2001 to
2008, including 119 in 2008.
- Infection has also been documented in humans and ticks (Ixodes
scapularis) in upstate New York.
- 3 cases were reported New York City in 2000 - possibly acquired in
Westchester County (an area not previously known to be endemic).

Massachusetts:
160 cases were reported in Nantucket, Massachusetts during 1969 to
1998.
- 1.6 percent of residents of Nantucket Island, Martha's Vineyard and
Block Island are seropositive toward Babesia divergens, and 4.5
percent toward B. microti.

Rhode Island:
Babesiosis was 1st identified (2 cases) in Rhode Island in 1994.
- 189 cases were reported in Rhode Island during 1998 to 2004,
including 48 in 2004.
- Rhode Island averaged about 2 cases per year during 1994 to 1999.
- 140 cases were reported from Block Island during 1991 to 2000. The
rate of symptomatic infection on the island is estimated at 516 per
100 000 per year.

Other:
40 cases of babesiosis were reported in New Jersey during 1993 to
2001.
- 32 cases were reported in Wisconsin during 1996 to 2005.
- The 1st case of babesiosis in Tennessee was reported in 2010.

Transfusion-related babesiosis
159 cases of transfusion-associated infection were reported during
1979 to 2009, involving 19 states : 21 during 1980 to 1997; 18 (5
fatal) during 2005 to 2007; 122 during 2000 to 2009.
- 16 cases of transfusion-related babesiosis were reported in New York
City in 2002, 25 in 2003; 16 in 2004; 18 in 2005; 38 in 2006; 25 in
2007; 39 in 2008.
- 21 cases of transfusion-related babesiosis were reported in Rhode
Island during 1999 to 2007.
- No cases of fatal babesiosis acquired through transfusion were
reported in 1997; one in 1998; 0 during 1999 to 2004; 2 in 2005; 3 in
2006; 3 in 2007.
- A case of transfusion-associated babesiosis was reported in
California in 2007.
- A case of transfusion-associated Babesia duncani infection was
reported in California in 2008.
- A case of fatal transfusion-associated babesiosis was reported in
Delaware in 2009.
- Seroprevalence in blood donors on Shelter Island (Suffolk County,
eastern Long Island) was 4.3 percent in May 1998.
- 1.4 percent of blood donors from endemic areas in Connecticut (0.3
percent from non-endemic areas) were seropositive in 1999; 1.0 percent
in 2000; 1.4 percent in 2001.
- A rare case of congenital babesiosis has been reported in New Jersey
(2009 publication).

Exported cases:
2003 (publication year) - A Czech national acquired babesiosis while
traveling in the United States.
2003 (publication year) - A Swiss national acquired B. microti
infection in the United States.
2005 - Hong Kong reported its 1st case of babesiosis - imported from
the eastern United States.
2009 - A Dutch traveler acquired concurrent babesiosis and Lyme
disease following a trip to the United States.

Reservoirs and Vectors:
The vector in the northeast is Ixodes scapularis (I. dammini), and the
usual reservoir is the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus).
- Enzootic transmission of Babesia divergens has been demonstrated
among cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) on Nantucket Island,
Massachusetts.
- Enzootic infection has been identified among rodents in Maine.
- 75 percent, 37 percent and 25 percent of white-footed mice
(Peromyscus leucopus) have antibodies to B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma
phagocytophilum and Babesia microti respectively. 13 percent have
antibodies to all 3 pathogens. (Connecticut, 2001 to 2003).

A genetically-distinct strain of B. microti is enzootic to Microtus
oeconomus and Clethrionomys rutulis in coastal Alaska.
- The transmission cycle of B. microti in Colorado consists of Ixodes
spinipalpis and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster).

Notable outbreaks:
1982 (publication year) - An outbreak (6 cases) of babesiosis was
reported on Long Island.
1988 to 1989 - An outbreak (6 cases) of babesiosis was reported in
Connecticut.
