The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed 2 leptospirosis cases
involving 2 men aged 46 and 52, bringing the year's [2007] total cases to 5.
A 46-year-old Eastern District resident came down with fever and
chills on 20 Jul 2007 and was admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole
Eastern Hospital 5 days later. He was discharged on 31 Jul 2007. He
did not have any recent travel history, and his 4 family contacts do
not have any symptoms.
A 52-year-old Tai Po man developed fever and muscle pain on 20 Jul
2007. He was admitted to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital 4 days
later and was discharged on 31 Jul 2007. The patient had traveled to
the Mainland in early July 2007, and his 2 family contacts do not
have any symptoms.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by one of the many pathogenic
serotypes of the genus _Leptospira_, a spirochete that is transmitted
to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with
urine or tissues of an infected animal or, more commonly, by indirect
contact with mud or water contaminated by urine of infected animals.
Exposure may be occupational (for example, among slaughter-house
workers, hunters, sewer workers, rescue workers, as well as evacuees
exposed to floodwater, and animal handlers) or recreational (for
example, among water sports enthusiasts in the USA and elsewhere and
fishermen; see Morgan J, et al. Clin Infect Dis 2002; 34:1593-99,
ProMED report Leptospirosis, Eco-Challenge race - Borneo: 2000
20010119.0153, and ProMED report Leptospirosis, fishermen - UK ex
France (Picardie) 20061029.3101). Person-to-person spread is not
known to occur. The disease has global distribution and is maintained
in nature by chronic kidney infection of asymptomatic carrier animals
(for example rodents and domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigs and
cattle) that intermittently or continuously excrete the organisms in
their urine.
Leptospirosis may occur sporadically or as large outbreaks, for
example, during periods of flooding. The disease is likely often
under-diagnosed because of the non-specific initial clinical
presentation and difficulties in laboratory diagnosis. The incubation
period is about one to 2 weeks after exposure. The initial symptoms
are abrupt onset of chills, fever, myalgias -- most prominently in
the calves and back -- cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
headache. Conjunctival suffusion and muscle tenderness may
characteristically occur. A 2nd phase of the disease may occur after
a short period of relative well-being that is thought to result from
an immunologic response to the infection and presents with aseptic
meningitis, myocarditis with arrhythmias, hemorrhagic pneumonia,
uveitis, nephritis and hepatitis. More than 90 percent of patients
have a self-limited illness, but some develop a more severe illness
with renal and hepatic failure (Weil's disease) that may be fatal in
5-40 percent.
During this initial phase, the organism can be recovered from blood
and cerebrospinal fluid. There may be pyuria and proteinuria, but
_Leptospira_ cannot be cultured from urine until about a week after
onset of the illness. Specimens for culture (e.g., blood and urine
without preservative) must be inoculated directly onto special media
without much delay and incubated at 30 C for several weeks because of
its slow growth. Definitive diagnosis can also be made by
demonstration of a serologic conversion (4-fold rise in antibody
titer) between acute and convalescent serum samples on microscopic
agglutination testing (MAT) run in parallel; but MAT is only
available at reference laboratories. Presumptive diagnosis can be
made by demonstration of IgM antibodies detected by an enzyme-linked
immunoassay after the 5th day of illness.
Early treatment, initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, for
example, based on clinical and epidemiologic findings and a
presumptive positive result for leptospirosis on a serological assay,
can reduce duration and severity of symptoms. Leptospirosis is
usually treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone intravenously for
severe disease and doxycycline or amoxicillin for milder disease;
penicillin therapy may be complicated by a Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction. Efficacy of antibiotic therapy when used late in the course
of the disease may be limited by the immunologic causation of the 2nd
phase of this illness.
Prevention involves wearing waterproof boots when walking on damp
soil or water in endemic areas and wearing protective equipment
(waterproof boots, goggles, and rubber gloves) when in contact with
contaminated water or mud or infected animals). Doxycycline can be
used for those with high-risk exposure. Animal vaccines are
available. For more information see
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/leptoclin.asp> and

Previously, 3 cases were reported from Hong Kong involving
participants in a hiking activity, "Team Challenge 36," held in
August 2004 that involved exposure of abraded skin to water (see
ProMED Leptospirosis, hikers - China (Hong Kong) 20040928.2684). No
details are reported concerning possible exposure to infected animals
or contaminated water for the 2 current cases or whether the 2 cases
are epidemiologically linked. - Mod.ML]
