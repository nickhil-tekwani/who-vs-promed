There is confirmation of 2 cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] in students in the Hugo Luna School in Oran, Salta [province]

These involve 2 girls who were hospitalized with symptoms of the virus [infection] and so the school was closed for a cleanup and classes were suspended.

Monica Carabajal, the principal of the primary school, confirmed to Cadena 3, "This past [Fri 3 Nov 2017] a 3rd grade girl was admitted [to hospital]. I directed that there was a fumigation and cleanup. Later, another girl from the same grade was admitted [to hospital] with the same symptoms."

The cases of the girls from the same grade are the only confirmed ones and now there are another 3 people (2 students and a teacher) with symptoms that are being studied in order to be confirmed.

The school, according to statements of the Principal, has been in "bad condition". The parents, in fact, complained about the lack of cleanliness of the school and the presence of rodents.

As if yesterday [Wed 8 Nov 2017] there have been 12 cases of hantavirus [infections] in the entire province, according to the Salta Epidemiology Coordinator, Griselda Rangione.

The hantavirus is transmitted in 3 ways: by inhalation near the feces and urine of rodents, by direct contact with live or dead infected rodents or their excreta, or by being bitten by rodents that are carriers of the virus.

[It is unfortunate that these 2 girls and possibly another 2 students and a teacher were exposed and infected while at school. It is disappointing that hygiene conditions in the school were bad enough that rodents were present there. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these Salta province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in these cases and since these infections were acquired in Oran city, they may have been caused by Oran virus infection.
