A virulent form of hepatitis that is especially lethal for pregnant women
has broken out in 2 of Iraq's most troubled districts, Iraqi Health
Ministry officials said in interviews here this week, and they warned that
a collapse of water and sewage systems in the country is probably at the
root of the illnesses.
The disease, called hepatitis E, is caused by a virus that is often spread
by sewage-contaminated drinking water. The officials said that their
limited ability to test for the virus had already been overwhelmed by the
hepatitis outbreaks, suggesting that only a fraction of the actual cases
have been diagnosed. But in Sadr City, a Baghdad slum that for months has
been convulsed by gun battles between a local militia and American troops,
as many as 155 cases have turned up.
The 2nd outbreak is in Mahmudiya, a town 56 km (35 miles) south of Baghdad
that is known as much for its kidnappings and drive-by shootings as for its
poverty, where 60 suspected cases have been seen. At least 9 pregnant women
are believed to have been infected, and one has died. There have been 5
reported deaths overall. "We are saying that the real number is greatly
more than this, because the area is greatly underreported," said Dr.
Atta-alla Mekhlif al-Salmani, head of the viral hepatitis section at the
Health Ministry's Center for Disease Control.
The World Health Organization is rushing hepatitis E testing kits, water
purification tablets, informational brochures and other materials to Iraq
to help with the outbreaks, said Dr Naeema al-Gasseer, the health agency
representative for Iraq and a UN health official, who is now based in
Amman, Jordan.
But viral hepatitis comes in numerous forms, and another ominous set of
statistics suggests that the quality of water supplies around the country
has deteriorated since the American-led invasion last year, Salmani said.
In 2003, there were 70 per cent more cases of hepatitis of all types
reported across Iraq than in the year before, he said. During the first 6
months of 2004, there were as many cases as in all of 2002.
In yet another indication of the deteriorating safety of both water and
food in Iraq, the number of reported cases of typhoid fever is up sharply
this year, said Dr Nima S Abid, the ministry's director general of public
health and primary health. Hospitals across the country are also full of
children with severe forms of diarrhea, Abid said.
The immediate reason for the outbreaks in Sadr City and Mahmudiya appear to
be easy to pin down, Abid said. The lack of infrastructure induces families
to tap into water mains with improvised hoses, he said, citing his own
visits to the communities. They then use small electric pumps to bring
water into their homes. But in these same communities, sewage either seeps
from damaged pipes into the ground or runs freely in the streets. So,
through cracks and holes in people's hoses, sewage is sucked in too,
becoming mixed with the drinking water and spreading the virus. "The
problem is that there is a leakage in the sewer system of Sadr," said an
assistant to the director general for water in the Baghdad municipality.
"Our treatment plant produces water with WHO specifications," said the
assistant, who asked to be identified only as Khalid, "and our test records
are very good." The assistant said that there had been a major water
project under way for Sadr City, but that the dangerous security situation
had made it impossible to proceed.

[The viruses responsible for hepatitis A and hepatitis E are structurally
similar, but phylogenetically distinct, enteric viruses transmitted by
similar routes. An effective vaccine is available for control of hepatitis
A virus infection, but there is no vaccine for control of hepatitis E.
Although both viruses are relatively heat resistant, boiling of drinking
water would provide a first line of defence against the spread of
infection. - Mod.CP]
