["Infection with HPR-deleted ISAV may cause infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which is a generalized and lethal condition characterized by severe anaemia, and variable hemorrhages and necrosis in several organs. The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05-0.1 percent) typically only in a few cages. Cumulative mortality may become very high for a period lasting several months if nothing is done to limit disease dissemination". http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_isav.htm. - Mod.CRD
