Malawi has been hit by a measles outbreak, which currently has affected
over 1400 people. Meanwhile the country's Ministry of Health has sounded an
alarm that it's soliciting an amount of 615 million Malawi Kwacha (about
USD 4.1 million) to vaccinate over 6 million children.

The outbreak has mostly affected the southern part of the country with its
commercial city of Blantyre registering the highest number of cases at 626.
One of the districts in the northern part of the country -- Mzimba -- is
2nd, with 365 cases. Media reports in the southern African country said
that the Ministry of Health has since declared measles outbreak a disaster.

The country's local daily The Daily Times quoted principal secretary of
health Chris Kang'ombe as saying that, according to World Health
Organization guidelines, measles vaccination is conducted after every 3
years. "We were supposed to conduct the exercise next year [2010], but this
is an outbreak so the exercise will be done this year [2009]," said Kang'ombe.

Measles is an infection of the respiratory system caused by a virus,
specifically a paramyxovirus of the genus _Morbillivirus_. Morbilliviruses,
like other paramyxoviruses, are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense
RNA viruses. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a
generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash. Measles sometimes known as
English measles [as opposed to rubella or German measles - Mod.CP] is
spread through respiration (contact with fluids from an infected person's
nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission), and is
highly contagious -- 90 per cent of people without immunity sharing a house
with an infected person will catch it.

[Malawi joins the list of African countries currently affected by large
outbreaks of measles virus infection. Control of measles virus infection by
vaccination remains a challenge throughout Africa, even in the best
organised countries.
