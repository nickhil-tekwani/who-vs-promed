Dengue-2 virus has been isolated from acute sera collected during the
current outbreak in Fiji and sent for confirmatory studies to the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research, Brisbane.
Local transmission of virus in Fiji was recognised in August when dengue-2
virus was isolated from a Fijian resident who had not travelled.

[Does this mean that at least dengue-2 virus is involved or that only
dengue-2 virus is involved in this epidemic, which is into at least its
sixth month? - Mod.CHC
