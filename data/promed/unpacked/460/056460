[1] 2019-nCoV transmission dynamics [letter]
Date: Sun 26 Jan 2020
From: David Fisman, MD MPH [edited]


I wish to offer the following observations on the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV in Hubei Province, China, over the past few weeks. I hope that the thoughts below will be helpful to others trying to organize and interpret the flood of information that has emerged about this new pathogen.

Information from a variety of sources suggests that this novel virus is a recombinant betacoronavirus of animal origin that emerged in November or December 2019, likely at the Wuhan Seafood Market. Epidemiological analysis was initiated after recognition of a market-linked pneumonia cluster in late December. Notwithstanding the name of the "Wuhan Seafood Market", the market sells large numbers of live animals, including wild animals, which are kept in close proximity to one another, perhaps facilitating viral recombination. Similar disrupted ecology contributed to the emergence of SARS.

The emergence of many cases of a novel, animal-derived pathogen in a live animal market, over a short time period was suggestive of a point source outbreak with animal-to-human spread, and I'll assume that the initial cluster of approximately 40 cases was largely a result of such transmission, with little human-to-human transmission. However, on [23 Jan 2020], the WHO released the report of its IHR Emergency Committee for nCoV; the report noted that "4th generation transmission" was occurring, and cited internal analyses placing the basic reproduction number (R0) at between 1.4 and 2.5; this report noted that 557 cases (which I'll round up to 600 cases) had been confirmed as of [22 Jan 2020] (ref.1). Several estimates of R0 appeared from independent groups around the same time; these estimates were remarkable in their consistency, ranging from 1.4 to 3.8 (refs. 2-7).

Such consistency despite limited data availability and disparate methods employed for estimation provides a degree of face validity to these estimates. I note that these estimates are likely skewed upwards by the greater recognition of larger case clusters and super-spreader events (there has been at least one 14-case cluster in a hospital), and also by the possibility that later cases are being recognized more completely than earlier cases, all of which would have the tendency of biasing R0 estimates upwards. I'll assume that the lower bound R0 (around 2) is probably about right, and also note that this is consistent with estimates from SARS coronavirus, which shares substantial genetic similarity with nCoV.

What would be the implications of a disease with R0 around 2, with 4 generations of transmission over a period of around a month? This timeline would be consistent with growth in the number of recognized cases from 40 to 600 during that time interval. If nCoV has a generation time of approximately 10 days (similar to that described for SARS), we would have expected the initial 40 cases from late December [2019] to cause 80 secondary cases in early January [2020] (120 total cases); these 80 cases would create 160 incident cases around mid-January [2020] (280 total cases), which would, in turn, create another 320 cases around [22 Jan 2020] (600 total cases).

These numbers fit very nicely to case data available as of [22 Jan 2020], but unfortunately, they are wrong. The abrupt surge in confirmed case counts (to 1423 cases as of [26 Jan 2020]) is not compatible with the growth process described above, certainly not with a SARS-compatible generation time of 6-10 days. Indeed, the authors of the MRC model (ref. 3) noted in one of their earlier reports that the volume of observed exported cases in countries outside China suggested a much larger underlying epidemic than had been reported at that time, and this epidemic may have begun a month prior to the recognition of the market-associated outbreak, consistent with the reported timing of viral emergence based on phylogenetic analyses (ref. 5). The authors of several analyses cited above have incorporated the MRC estimates of under-reporting in order to fit their models (refs. 2, 3, 5). A 2nd line of evidence suggesting undercounting of cases relates to the older age of cases (median 59 years in early reports), and the even older age of fatal cases (averaging around 75 years in the first 17 deaths) as contrasted with a median age of 37 or 38 years in China. Increased age in cases as compared to the population as a whole suggests that younger (likely milder) cases have been under-reported. As such, it would seem likely that at least part of the sudden apparent growth in case counts does not reflect changes in transmission, but rather increasing ascertainment of previously undercounted cases.

Why is R0 so important? As R0 is proportional to duration of infectivity, reducing the infective period of cases would reduce the effective reproduction number. If the effective duration of infectivity is reduced by over 50% for a pathogen with R0 around 2, the average reproduction number would be reduced to less than 1, which should control viral spread over time. It is encouraging that one of the reports cited above suggests that the mean time from symptom onset to isolation has decreased from more than 6 days to less than 1 day as control measures have been implemented (ref. 6). Social distancing measures (like suspension of public gatherings and transportation) and reduced transmission per contact (such as, through the use of personal protective items by healthcare workers) would also result in proportionate reductions in the reproduction number. Precise predictions in the face of substantial uncertainty are not appropriate, but given the large size of the epidemic as of the time of writing, some simple back-of-the-envelope math can demonstrate that large numbers of incident cases should be expected in the coming weeks, even in the face of effective control efforts. Successful control of this outbreak would be expected to take many months (again, as was the case with SARS).

While average estimates of R0 are helpful, it is also important to note that other betacoronaviruses of public health importance (SARS, MERS) have been notable for the "overdispersion" of their reproductive numbers. Without getting too technical, this means that the average R0 is quite different from the variability in the R0. We actually have a distribution of R0 with a long "tail", which is a mathematical shorthand for superspreader events, where a case infects a large number of individuals. For example, there was at least one SARS superspreader who generated 76 downstream cases. However, with an overdispersed R0 many cases are "dead ends" and will not transmit. The 3 key insights here for the contour of this epidemic are:
1. It is the average R0 that determines whether, and how, the disease can be controlled. By analogy with SARS and MERS, with which nCoV seems to share many characteristics, the spread of this virus should be controllable.

2. Superspreader events are likely (and have already occurred) and are important to outbreak control efforts: they are demoralizing and dangerous to response personnel. They often occur in hospitals during aerosol-generating procedures like intubation. These events make it feel like the battle is being lost. They should be anticipated, and it is important to emphasize that their occurrence will represent a temporary setback which is likely to be overcome.

3. While superspreader events are unwelcome, their occurrence may, in fact, be a salutary sign for the control of this outbreak. An average R0 of, say, 2, with an overdispersed R0 means that many cases are also likely to be "dead ends" epidemiologically. Inasmuch as superspreader events may be more likely to be recognized due to their dramatic nature, an outbreak driven by superspreaders may be more likely to attract the control measures needed to disrupt transmission. By contrast, a more homogeneous outbreak, where each and every case has the potential to create a downstream cascade of cases in the absence of recognition, may be much more difficult to control.

As I note above, this outbreak is in its early weeks and understanding and knowledge will doubtless change. However, analysis of the cases counts, rate of growth of the epidemic, reproduction number estimates, and estimates of likely undercounting that have emerged over the past two weeks can provide a coherent view of the likely early dynamics of this outbreak, and also suggest what the contours of the outbreak may look like if control efforts are successful.

Summary
-------
Self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. We estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to [18 Jan 2020], based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable -- with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviors. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity - including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.

Abstract
--------
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan, China. The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 Jan 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to [21 Jan 2020] to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by [21 Jan 2020] a total of 11 341 people (prediction interval, 9217-14 245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by [4 Feb 2020] (191 529 infections; prediction interval, 132 751-273 649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on [4 Feb 2020]. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.

[ProMED thanks Dr Fisman for his up-to-the-minute epidemiological analysis and thoughtful discussion of 2019-nCoV transmission dynamics studies to date. Space precludes us from reprinting all of the referenced reports, but we have included summaries of 2 of them above, and readers are advised to go to the URLs provided for complete details. It is indeed notable that estimates of R0 have been quite consistent thus far, with a median R0 of about 2.6.

With 1975 confirmed cases in China as of their midnight 25 Jan 2020, however, it appears that the R0 continues to be in this range, with no evidence thus far to indicate a drop in the reproduction number to levels less than 1.0 necessary to truncate this epidemic -- but we remain hopeful and vigilant. - Mod.LXL
