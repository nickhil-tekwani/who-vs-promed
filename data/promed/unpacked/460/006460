[Below is the abstract of the paper, Shelley EB, O'Rourke D, Grant K, et al: Infant botulism due to _C. butyricum_ type E toxin: a novel environmental association with pet terrapins. Epidemiol Infect. 2015; 143(3): 461-9. doi: 10.1017/S0950268814002672. - Mod.LL]

We describe 2 cases of infant botulism due to _Clostridium butyricum_ producing botulinum type E neurotoxin (BoNT/E) and a previously unreported environmental source. The infants presented at age 11 days with poor feeding and lethargy, hypotonia, dilated pupils, and absent reflexes. Fecal samples were positive for _C. butyricum_ BoNT/E. The infants recovered after treatment including botulism immune globulin intravenous (BIG-IV). _C. butyricum_ BoNT/E was isolated from water from tanks housing pet 'yellow-bellied' terrapins (_Trachemys scripta scripta_): in case A the terrapins were in the infant's home; in case B a relative fed the terrapin prior to holding and feeding the infant when both visited another relative. _C. butyricum_ isolates from the infants and the respective terrapin tank waters were indistinguishable by molecular typing. Review of a case of _C. butyricum_ BoNT/E botulism in the UK found that there was a pet terrapin where the infant was living. It is concluded that the _C. butyricum_-producing BoNT type E in these cases of infant botulism most likely originated from pet terrapins. These findings reinforce public health advice that reptiles, including terrapins, are not suitable pets for children aged less than 5 years old, and highlight the importance of hand washing after handling these pets.

[The episodes took place in 2010 and 2013.

An excellent editorial commentary on botulism was published in January 2014: Popoff MR: Botulinum neurotoxins: more and more diverse and fascinating toxic proteins. J Infect Dis. 2014; 209(2): 168-9; http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/209/2/168.long. Several paragraphs regarding taxonomy are extracted below (references can be found at the original URL):

"The taxonomic position of _C. botulinum_ was originally based on 1 phenotype, the production of a BoNT [botulinum neurotoxin], whereas the nontoxic variant strains were assigned to different species, such as _Clostridium sporogenes_ and _Clostridium subterminale_. Subsequently, physiological differences between _C. botulinum_ strains were identified, and the species was divided into 4 physiological groups [6]: group I, consisting of _C. botulinum_ A and proteolytic strains of _C. botulinum_ B and F; group II, consisting of _C. botulinum_ E and nonproteolytic strains of _C. botulinum_ B and F; group III, consisting of _C. botulinum_ C and D; and group IV, consisting of _C. botulinum_ G. The latter group is metabolically distinct from the other groups and has been assigned to a different species, called _Clostridium argentinense_.

Since then, neurotoxigenic strains belonging to different _Clostridium_ species, such as _C. butyricum_ and _C. baratii_, have also been characterized and are now assigned to groups V and VI, respectively. Generally, 1 strain of _C. botulinum_ produces 1 type of BoNT, but strains synthesizing a combination of BoNT types (bivalent strains Ab, Ba, Af, and Bf ) have been observed [7]....Recently, Arnon and colleagues identified a _C. botulinum_ strain that contains 3 _bont_ gene clusters consisting of BoNT subtypes A2, F4, and F5 [11]."

An interesting commentary on type E botulism related to _C. butyricum_ can be found (1) where the authors links the areas where the toxigenic organisms was described with the route of the Venetian Marco Polo but not implying that Mr Polo spread the spores along his route. They also noted that the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum, a patent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, was noted in 3 of the first 5 cases of _C. butyricum_ type E botulism and might imply that the disease was related to intestinal toxemia botulism where, like in infant botulism, there is in vivo germination of spores rather than ingestion of the already produced toxin as a parallel report from Fenicia and colleagues (2) suggested.

The type E botulinum toxin from _C. butyricum_ is serologically quite similar to the _C. botulinum_ type E toxin suggesting that wild type _C. butyricum_ suggesting that toxigenic organisms may arise by acquiring the toxic gene from a _C. botulinum_ type E strain (3). Non-toxigenic _C. butyricum_ is a component of the normal intestinal microflora and has been used in Japan as a probiotic to prevent gastrointestinal and vaginal infections (1).

The report of infant botulism with an environmental association with pet turtles (terrapins) appears to be unique but further underscores the fact that such animals are unsuitable pets especially for young children and that aggressive handwashing after turtle handling is absolutely needed. Various serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ are the classical organisms linked to pet turtles but such poikilothermic vertebrates can also harbor the spirochetes of leptospirosis (4).
