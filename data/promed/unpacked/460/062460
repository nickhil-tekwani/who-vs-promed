Situation update
----------------
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MoARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, ASF was detected [as of 7 Dec 2018] in 91 villages in 21 provinces/autonomous region/municipalities. More than 630 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

- Shaanxi Province: ASF outbreaks were reported in 2 districts in Xi'an City: on 3 Dec 2018 in Huyi District in a farm with 245 pigs [1*], and on 5 Dec 2018 in Chang'an District in a farm with 245 pigs [2*].

- Shanxi Province: ASF outbreak occurred in one farm with 91 pigs in Yaodu District, Linyi City [3*].

- Beijing Municipality: ASF outbreaks occurred in a farm with 9835 pigs in Tongzhou District [4*] and in a breeding farm with 2461 pigs in Shunyi District [5*].

- Sichuan Province: ASF outbreak occurred in one farm with 165 pigs in Hejiang County, Luzhou City [6*].

- Heilongjiang Province: ASF outbreak was reported in one wild boar farm in area under the Bei'an Administration office of the Heilongjiang Province Agricultural Reclamation Bureau with 245 wild boars, of which 77 died [7*]. This is the 1st confirmation in farmed wild boar in China.

- Jiangxi Province: ASF outbreak occurred in a farm with 159 pigs in Chaisang District, Jiujiang City [8*].

Actions taken by China [since previous weekly FAO update]
---------------------------------------------------------
On 1 Dec 2018, the intensified requirements on pig transport vehicles came into force. These include registration, inspection of vehicles, and obligation to equip GPS recorder with vehicles transporting live pigs following certain epidemiological criteria. The number of pigs per vehicle is to be fewer than 15 pigs with obligatory disinfection before and after transport, record keeping [9*].

After assessment, epidemic zones were lifted in Dawa District, Panjin City on 3 Dec 2018 [10*], and in Beizhen City, Jinzhou City on 4 Dec 2018 [11*], [both] in Liaoning Province, because there was no further [ASF] detection for 6 weeks after culling of pigs within an affected zone. As of 6 Dec 2018, [a total of] 35 epidemic zones have been lifted.
