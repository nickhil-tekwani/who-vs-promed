Update #6 - severe acute respiratory syndrome
---------------------------------------------
As of 21 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 9 individuals who
have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario
and British Columbia. These cases have either recently traveled to Hong
Kong or have had close contact with these individuals. The details of the
cases to date are as follows:
Ontario: In a single family, 3 people have been admitted to hospital with
severe pneumonia of unknown cause, 2 other members have died. In addition,
individuals (2) with close contact with this family have been admitted to
hospital. Also in Ontario, a separate, unrelated case who had traveled
recently to Hong Kong has also been admitted to hospital.
British Columbia: one person has been admitted to hospital with SARS.
At this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, but national and
international laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the
most recent developments:
Scientists at Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg
report that they have found evidence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in
specimens from 6 of the 8 cases they are studying. The metapneumovirus is
part of paramyxoviridae family. These findings are consistent with the
results previously released by scientists in Germany and Hong Kong.
The findings of the National Microbiology Laboratory are significant in
that a common thread has been found in a majority of cases in Canada. This
is a promising step in the investigation. Scientists will continue their
work to try to verify the findings and to determine if there are other
factors involved that are influencing the severity of this outbreak.
Paramyxoviruses can be responsible for mumps, measles, pneumonia and the
common cold. The metapneumovirus was only recently identified in humans. It
causes respiratory symptoms that are not usually as severe as those seen in
the current outbreak. To date no antiviral medications have been developed
specifically to treat metapneumovirus. These findings will not likely alter
the current treatment for SARS patients.
Health Canada has initiated the following activities:
We have expanded health alert card distribution at major airports in
Canada. In addition to Pearson and Vancouver, these cards are being
distributed at all airports that receive international flights from all
destinations other than the United States.
Health Canada issued revised travel advice on 19 Mar 2003. The overall risk
for travelers appears to be low at this time. However, because of recent
increases in cases of SARS in the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and Singapore and that transmission may not be
limited to the hospital setting, Health Canada advises that people planning
elective or nonessential travel to the city of Hanoi, Vietnam, Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, and Singapore may wish to postpone their
trips until further notice.
In collaboration with the provinces, territories, and local health units,
Health Canada has begun enhanced surveillance for the recognition of SARS
cases. Health Canada has also asked officials at the Pearson and Vancouver
International Airports to carefully monitor passengers arriving from Hong
Kong and Singapore to see if anyone has flu-like symptoms. Health Canada
has sent staff to Pearson and Vancouver International Airports to support
airport staff. Health professionals have been sent to each airport to help
monitor passengers arriving on direct flights from Hong Kong and Singapore
for flu-like symptoms and to assist those who appear to be ill. They have
started distributing Health Alert Notices to all passengers arriving in or
returning from Hong Kong and Singapore which will ask passengers to see a
physician if they begin to have any symptoms related to SARS. These
symptoms include a fever over 38.0 degrees Celsius AND one or more of the
following respiratory symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty
breathing.
Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public Safety Programme is providing
advice to federal employers on occupational health and safety matters.
Health professionals from Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public
Safety Programme were on site at the Pearson and Vancouver airports to
provide information sessions for federal employees. They are available, at
the employer's request, to provide sessions for federal employees at all
airports that receive international flights from all destinations other
than the United States. The Workplace Health and Safety Programme has
issued an advisory notice and has spoken to or met with representatives of
a number of federal departments to provide them with information and advice
they can use in determining what health and safety measures they deem
appropriate for their employees. It is Health Canada's position that
Government of Canada workers are not considered to be at high risk of
infection because of the limited contact with and proximity to the
individuals. Therefore, Health Canada advises that the use of masks is not
necessary. Health Canada continues to provide employer departments with the
most current information and advice available on SARS.
Health Canada will continue to do everything it can to keep Canadians
informed and will continue to work with the provinces and territories so
that medical officers are fully informed and appropriate steps are taken to
mitigate risk. For additional information on SARS, please contact Health
Canada's information line at: 1-800-454-8302. For information on previous
travel advisories to South East Asia issued by Health Canada and the World
Health Organization, please see the following links:

[The laboratory results continue to point the finger towards a member of
the paramyxovirus family. In the above release from Health Canada, they
have identified the virus as a human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a "newer"
member of the paramyxovirus family. One of the earlier descriptions of the
hMPV (van den Hoogen BG, et al. A newly discovered human pneumovirus
isolated from young children with respiratory tract disease. Nat Med 2001;
7(6): 719-24) was reported in ProMED-mail (Paramyxoviruses, new human
pathogen - Netherlands 20010603.1094). All of these results are suggesting
more and more that the paramxyovirus family may be the etiology of SARS. -
