The exotic mosquito _Aedes koreicus_ has been identified in Italy for
the 1st time, in a small town in Belluno province, northeastern Italy.
The species was previously introduced in Europe in Belgium in 2008,
where it successfully established itself (Versteirt et al. 2009.
Arrival and acclimatisation of the exotic mosquito species _Aedes
koreicus_ in Belgium, Europe. 94-96 in Coosemans et al. Mosquito
vectors of disease: spatial biodiversity, drivers of change, and risk.
Final Report. Brussels: Belgian Science Policy 2009 131 pp).

Larvae were collected in a single manhole and in small water
containers from 2 private gardens and at the cemetery during a regular
monitoring program promoted by the Veneto region and the Local Health
Unit against the Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_), which is
not present in the village. Larvae and laboratory moulted adults were
morphologically identified as _Aedes koreicus_ and then confirmed by
PCR.

Epidemiological and entomological surveys at the village and the
surrounding area are ongoing to understand whether the species is
already established and to trace back the possible route of entry.
Previous experiences of invasive species introduction in USA and
Europe (_Aedes albopictus_ and _A. japonicus_) suggest that used tires
and plants are the major route of entry.

This species is native to Korea, Japan, China and eastern Russia. Not
much information is available on its biology and activity. The species
is known to feed on humans and domestic animals, and it seems to adapt
well to urban environments.

The mosquito is a potential vector of arboviruses, and it has been
demonstrated to transmit Japanese encephalitis [virus] and
_Dirofilaria immitis_ (dog heartworm).

This finding once again highlights the importance of implementing
entomological surveillance for early detection of new invasive
species.

[ProMED thanks Francecsa Russo for this interesting report. These
firsthand reports are timely and valuable.

Detection of the presence of _Ae. koreicus_ is another example of the
movement and establishment of potential pathogen vectors around the
world and the need for constant surveillance to recognize them when
they arrive in new locales.

The published evidence for the vector status of _Ae. koreicus_ is
scant. The only reference that this moderator was able to find was a
Russian language report cited in the reference below that indicated
that Russian scientists considered this species, along with other
_Aedes_ species, to be significant vectors of Japanese encephalitis
(JE) virus in Russia. If in fact this species becomes permanently
established and spreads in Europe, one hopes that laboratory
experiments testing its vector capacity for several arthropod-borne
viruses, such as JE, West Nile, chikungunya and others, will be done
and published in the international literature, as has been done for
_Ae. japonicus_ and _Ae. albopictus_.
