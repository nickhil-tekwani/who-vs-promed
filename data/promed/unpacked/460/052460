Latest situation (update 25 Jun 2022)
-------------------------------------
Following suspicion of vesicular disease in pigs, and as a precaution to prevent the spread of disease, a 10 km [6.21 mi] Temporary Control Zone was declared around a premises near Feltwell, Kings Lynn and West Norfolk, Norfolk on 24 Jun 2022. Following further official testing swine vesicular disease has been negated and the 10 km [6.21 mi] Temporary Control Zone has been revoked.

The premises remains under restriction pending the outcome of further tests.

Details of the restrictions can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/swine-vesicular-disease#swine-vesicular-disease-cases-and-disease-control-zones-in-england.

[WOAH disease card for FMD is available at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/09/foot-and-mouth-disease-1.pdf, including the chapters Aetiology, Epidemiology, Diagnosis (clinical, including DD, and lab), and Prevention & Control. It presents the following DD [Differential Diagnosis] list of diseases which are clinically indistinguishable, in pigs, from FMD:

1. Vesicular stomatitis (VS)
2. Swine vesicular disease (SVD)
3. Vesicular exanthema of swine (VES)
4. Infection due to Senecavirus A (Seneca Valley virus)

Swine vesicular disease (SVD), a viral disease affecting only pigs, was included in the list of diseases notifiable to the WOAH because of the similarity of its lesions to those produced by FMD. Due to its mild clinical signs and the current ease of laboratory differential diagnosis, it is no longer a listed disease. WOAH's disease card for SVD is available at https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/SWINE_VESICULAR_DISEASE.pdf.

A review on VS is available at https://msdmnls.co/3OFIhuu. A review on VES is available at https://www.msdvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/vesicular-exanthema-of-swine/vesicular-exanthema-of-swine.

The outcome of the remaining tests is anticipated soon. - Mod.AS
