Cases of dengue-chikungunya [virus] co-infection are on the rise, causing concern to health planners and doctors. About 3 per cent of dengue-chikungunya cases fall under the co-infection category, with the patient suffering from both the diseases at the same time.

Incidentally, the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito transmits both the dengue and the chikunguniya virus; chances of co-infection are higher if the mosquito carries the viruses of both the diseases. A detailed analysis of dengue and chikungunya cases by the department of microbiology, Sri Venkate-swara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati has revealed that the problem of co-infection is more pronounced in areas where both viruses co-circulate.

Where co-infection strikes, doctors find it hard to diagnose the problem. Though symptoms of these diseases are common, their outcome differs. Tests for both dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] will help in finding whether a patient is suffering from one disease or both of them. Chikungunya is non-fatal, while dengue may lead to severe complications including death. The common symptoms of both the diseases include fever, joint and bone pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and fatigue [However, acute joint pain that may persist for weeks or months is more characteristic of chikungunya virus infections. - Mod.TY].

A team of researchers comprising Usha Kalawat, Krishna K. Sharma and G. Satishkumar Reddy analysed 331 samples for dengue and 170 samples for chikungunya [antibodies]. About 12 per cent of dengue samples and 20 per cent of chikungunya samples were positive. The team tested 72 samples for the presence of both dengue and chikungunya antibodies. About 3 per cent of these samples tested positive for both the diseases [virus infections].

"Areas affected by the chikungunya virus overlap with dengue fever-endemic areas and provide opportunities for mosquitoes to become infected with both the viruses," the team pointed out. They added that missing out signs of one disease is always plausible if diagnostic tests for both are not performed, and the presence of one does not rule out the other.

[It would not be surprising if individuals residing in areas where both dengue and chikungunya outbreaks are occurring were infected with both viruses as the authors of this study indicate. However, this study is based on the results of tests with commercial kits that measure IgM antibodies (see original article cited below).

Firstly, it is necessary to show that the serological reactions observed were specific for dengue and chikungunya viruses. Serological tests with ELISA kits alone, without demonstration of virus presence by isolation or RT-PCR or confirmation by other, more specific serological tests, should be interpreted with caution. Serological cross reactions among different flaviviruses such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus and others can further complicate interpretation of results. The USA CDC always confirms these types of positive serological test results with more virus-specific, 90 per cent plaque-reduction neutralization tests, which were not done in the above study.

Secondly, IgM can persist for months or even beyond a year in some individuals following an acute dengue or chikungunya virus infection. The authors presume that because IgM was detected that reacted with both dengue and chikungunya virus antigens, those individuals were simultaneously infected with both viruses. That may not necessarily have been the case in all or even most of them. It is possible that some of these individuals in the above study were, in fact, infected with both dengue and chikungunya viruses but serially, not simultaneously. The authors of the study are correct in that both viruses should be considered when the clinical picture that they mention is observed. Mixed outbreaks can and do occur.
