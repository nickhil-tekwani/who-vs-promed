2nd Aussie piggery quarantined
------------------------------
A 2nd Australian piggery was placed in quarantine due to swine flu on
Wednesday [19 Aug 2009] as the number of human deaths from the virus
reached 121.

Authorities ordered a biosecurity lockdown at the piggery in Victoria
state amid concerns the virus could mutate and return to humans in a
more deadly form.

Another piggery in New South Wales state has been quarantined since
late July [2009], although the state government said most of the
animals had recovered from the disease.

Victoria Agriculture Minister Joe Helper said tests confirmed the
presence of influenza at the piggery after its owners reported
earlier this week that the animals were not eating.

'It is important to stress that this is not a human health issue and
that national and international food authorities continue to advise
that pork and pork products are safe to eat,' he said.

Media reports said the pigs were believed to have contracted the
virus from workers at the property who were suffering the human form
of the disease.

Health experts fear swine flu in humans, which is easily spread but
has a relatively low fatality rate, could mutate in other animals and
emerge in a more virulent form.

Swine flu has hit 32 224 people in Australia, with 460 people
hospitalised, 100 of them in intensive care.

Human trials are underway for a vaccine, with mass immunisation of
the entire population scheduled to begin in October [2009].

[Based on the experience in New South Wales, these animals are likely
to recover. However the source of exposure to the pigs appears to be
ill workers.

The swine do not pose a danger to humans consuming the meat. Nor has
this flu, in its present state passed from swine to people. It has
however passed from people to the swine. The media did the swine
industry a great disservice by dubbing this flu strain "swine flu."
Its origins in swine is relatively removed from how most people
understand it. - Mod.TG]

[The 1st outbreak of influenza in Australian pigs, in NSW, which
started on 24 Jul 2009, was declared as resolved on 13 Aug 2009. At
that time, the Australian authorities provided the following
significant statement to the OIE: "Sequencing of the HA gene yielded
partial fragments, which showed 99 percent homology to the
Auckland/1/2009 reference strain of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009.
People associated with the piggery, who had shown influenza-like
illness prior to the outbreak in pigs, have been confirmed as being
infected with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009."

The said information can be regarded as supportive of the assumption
that the pigs may have been infected from human patients.

Similar evidence, based upon testing of human contacts, was not
provided by the Canadian and Argentinean authorities in their reports
on outbreaks of 'influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus' on pig farms.

The Canadian OIE notifications (1 outbreak) are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8065>.
The Argentinean notifications (2 outbreaks) are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8227>.

The notifications include maps. - Mod.AS]
