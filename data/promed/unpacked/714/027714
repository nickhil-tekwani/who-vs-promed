One of the most significant challenges [potato] producers face is the fight against pink rot. The soil-borne pathogen can wreak havoc on entire paddocks and render them unsuitable for cultivation. It causes rapid rotting of potato tubers, in-ground and in storage. It can result in significant yield losses, product downgrade, and rejection. Some paddocks experience a regular loss from 5 to 30 per cent even when recommended fungicide treatments are applied.

A new project at the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture [TIA] aims to develop recommendations to assist growers to manage pink rot. The research is to understand factors such as soil pH, acidifying fertilisers, and elemental nutrients in pink rot occurrence.

TIA's Robert Tegg said, "Pink rot is a serious problem around Australia. This [2020] season has been tough for Tasmanian growers, and it's predicted that the industry will experience severe losses." [He] said there was an urgent need to identify effective control methods to support the industry's sustainability and profitability.

[Pink (tuber) rot (PR) of potato is caused by the oomycete _Phytophthora erythroseptica_. The pathogen can infect any below-ground part of the plant. Serious yield losses have been reported mainly in unusually warm growing seasons, but wet soil is required for infection. Symptoms in tubers can develop pre- or post-harvest; they may include watery exudates, rubbery tissue, discolouration, rot, and completed tissue breakdown; cut surfaces may eventually turn pink or brown; susceptibility to bacterial tuber rots is increased. Severe infections may also lead to foliar symptoms such as wilting, yellowing, and formation of aerial tubers.

The pathogen can survive in soil for long periods. It can be spread by soil, irrigation water, mechanical means (such as agricultural machinery) and with infected tubers or other plant materials. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach. It may include cultural methods (soil moisture control), phytosanitation, and optimisation of tuber storage. Use of certified clean seed tubers is essential. Fungicide treatments (sprays, granules, tuber dips) are being used, but resistant pathogen strains are emerging for some chemical classes. Phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective against some _Phytophthora_ diseases and are being assessed for their use in PR control. Commercial crop varieties vary in their level of susceptibility to PR, but no truly resistant cultivars are currently available.
