Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle disease in the Tamworth Region, New South Wales
----------------------------------------------
Further to my previous reports on Newcastle disease in the Sydney Region of
New South Wales, I am advising you of confirmed virulent Newcastle disease
virus in a poultry farm near Tamworth, New South Wales (approximately 500
kilometres north of Sydney).
The affected farm is a pullet-rearing facility of three sheds of 6000 birds
each. Mortalities remain low (total of 60 birds in three days) to date,
with nervous signs seen in a small number of birds. There have been no
identifiable high-risk movements onto or from the affected farm in the past
month.
Laboratory Diagnosis
--------------------
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) confirmed the presence of
virulent Newcastle virus with the following tests:
* strong immunoperoxidase (IPx) staining of brain tissue
* polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with virulent sequence (RRQRRF - similar
to the virulent sequence seen with previous virulent isolates in New South
Wales)
* haemagglutination agent from harvested allantoic fluid (although embryo
not dead) confirmed as Newcastle disease virus by HI test, but this virus
has not yet been pathotyped
Actions Taken
-------------
The property has been quarantined with only feed truck movements permitted
at this stage. Trucks are required to undergo rigorous disinfection.
Surveillance activities and investigations are continuing.
I will keep you informed of developments.
Kind regards
GARDNER MURRAY
Managing Director, National Offices, and
Australian Chief Veterinary Officer
