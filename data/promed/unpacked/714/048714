["Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious and devastating animal disease affecting small ruminants. It is caused by a virus belonging to the genus _Morbillivirus_, family _Paramixoviridae_. Once newly introduced, the virus can infect up to 90% of an animal [herd], and the disease kills anywhere up to 70% of infected animals. The PPR virus does not infect humans" (http://www.fao.org/ppr/background/what-is-ppr/en/).

The following information and abstract come from an article by Pruvot et al:
Pruvot M, Fine AE, Hollinger C, et al: Outbreak of peste des petits ruminants among critically endangered Mongolian saiga and other wild ungulates, Mongolia, 2016-2017. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(1): 51-62; https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2601.181998

"In the fall of 2016, an outbreak of PPRV among domestic sheep and goats in western Mongolia was confirmed, probably originating from uncontrolled transboundary livestock movements. In total, 83 889 small ruminants from 1081 households were reportedly affected by PPR in 14 soums (districts) of 3 aimags (provinces), of which 12 976 small ruminants died (overall case-fatality risk 15.5%). After this initial outbreak, control measures included vaccination of 4 632 200 sheep and 5 800 318 goats in and around the outbreak area in October 2016. Although the vaccination campaign successfully curbed the epidemic in livestock, on 27 Dec 2016, deaths among the Mongolian saiga antelope (subspecies _Saiga tatarica mongolica_) from PPRV infection were confirmed; later, deaths from PPRV infection of Siberian ibex (_Capra sibirica_) and goitered gazelle (_Gazella subgutturosa_) were also confirmed. In the following months, thousands of critically endangered Mongolian saiga died."

Abstract
--------
"The 2016-2017 introduction of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) into livestock in Mongolia was followed by mass mortality of the critically endangered Mongolian saiga antelope and other rare wild ungulates. To assess the nature and population effects of this outbreak among wild ungulates, we collected clinical, histopathologic, epidemiologic, and ecological evidence. Molecular characterization confirmed that the causative agent was PPRV lineage IV. The spatiotemporal patterns of cases among wildlife were similar to those among livestock affected by the PPRV outbreak, suggesting spillover of virus from livestock at multiple locations and time points and subsequent spread among wild ungulates. Estimates of saiga abundance suggested a population decline of 80%, raising substantial concerns for the species' survival. Consideration of the entire ungulate community (wild and domestic) is essential for elucidating the epidemiology of PPRV in Mongolia, addressing the threats to wild ungulate conservation, and achieving global PPRV eradication."

Mongolia has a small ruminant population (goat-sheep) of 25 574 861-27 856 603 (data from FAOSTAT http://www.fao.org/ppr/current-situation/country-detail/en/?country_iso3=MNG). - Mod.CRD
