An outbreak of dangerous _Escherichia coli_ foodborne illness that closed the Matador restaurant in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood last week [week of 5 Sep 2016] appears to be linked to more illnesses in Washington and 3 other states, health officials said [on Mon 12 Sep 2016]. 5 people were sickened with a Shiga toxin-producing strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 after eating at the restaurant in August 2016. 3 people were hospitalized, including a 16 year old girl who developed a dangerous kidney injury called hemolytic uremic syndrome.

But 2 more Washington cases -- one in Skagit County, one in Snohomish County -- have been detected that have no known connection with the Matador, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Health said on Mon 12 Sep 2016 and 3 cases with the same genetic fingerprint have been detected in 3 other states, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] indicated. 1 of those people visited Seattle and ate at the Matador in Ballard.

That's a total of 10 cases of what are known as EHEC infections -- but just 6 of those cases now appear related to the restaurant. The investigation is fluid and ongoing, local health officials emphasized. It may turn out that the additional cases aren't part of the same outbreak.

Still, reports of such dispersed illnesses with a similar genetic fingerprint indicate that the problem might not lie entirely with the Matador in Ballard. The restaurant closed on Friday [9 Sep 2016] after inspectors with Public Health - Seattle & King County said they temporarily suspended the firm's food business permit to allow thorough cleaning and sanitizing.

"It's looking more like a potential source, a contaminated product," said Dr Meagan Kay, a medical epidemiologist with King County. State and federal officials have taken over the probe, she added.

The recent Matador illnesses include 4 people who ate at the restaurant on 14 Aug 2016 and one who did so on 22 Aug 2016. Another person ate there sometime between those dates. Public health officials received the 1st report of illness on 22 Aug 2016; the most recent case was reported on 6 Sep 2016. The 5 people developed symptoms of ETEC O157:H7 poisoning, including diarrhea and abdominal cramps. 4 people developed bloody diarrhea. 3 were hospitalized, including the teenage girl, who ate leftovers from the Matador. All have recovered.

[This outbreak originally associated with a single restaurant in Washington state [see: ProMED-mail. E. coli EHEC - USA (31): (WA) restaurant 20160911.4480793] has now spread to other counties and other states. That the infection was transmitted over a period of at least 23 days suggests that a product with a longer self life than fresh produce may be involved or the produce was contaminated serially. - Mod.LL
