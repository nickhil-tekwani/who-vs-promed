Health officials in Unity state say 10 people have died in a recent
increase in malaria cases. Doctors say that 80 percent of patients in
the state's hospitals suffer from the potentially fatal disease, which
is spread by mosquito bites.

Many people are ignorant of how they can protect themselves from
malaria. But civilians say the government in Unity state is failing to
address the issue.

Health clinics and private hospitals in Bentiu, the state capital,
report that the children and the elderly are the worst effected.
Doctors, such as Dr William Wang who works at Bentiu China Hospital,
describe the situation as very dangerous. Dr Wang says that 80 percent
of patients have malaria "because mosquitoes here are so many." He
says that patients are advised "to use [a] mosquito net at night in
order to keep mosquitoes outside" but many do not. He seriously urged
the civilians to bring those with malaria to the hospital straight
away as some children die before they even reached the hospital.

[A man] who was admitted to Bentiu China Hospital, told Sudan Tribune
on Friday [30 Sep 2011] that after taking medication he was recovering
from a serious case of malaria. He urged South Sudan's government to
encourage more investment in health care so that people did not have
to rely on hospitals like the Bentiu China Hospital, which is run by
the Chinese doctors and nurses.

The hospital is the best in the oil-rich state but as it is private
the "poor" are often unable to afford treatment. Bentiu hospital,
which is run by the state government lacks equipment and drugs.

Despite being oil-rich South Sudan has not developed as fast as it
could have since a 2005 peace deal brought former rebels the SPLM
[Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement] to power due to poor management,
lack of skilled workers, and corruption. Shortly before addressing the
UN General Assembly last week [week of 19 Sep 2011], South Sudan's
president Salva Kiir announced that there would be a "zero tolerance"
to corruption. South Sudan became independent in July 2011.

[South Sudan, now an independent country, is endemic for _Plasmodium
falciparum_ malaria. A study from Sudan including South Sudan (Elamin
SB et al: Efficacy of chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine mono-
and combined therapy against falciparum malaria in Sudan. East
Mediterr Health J. 2007; 13(1): 25-34;
http://www.emro.who.int/publications/emhj/1301/PDF/03.pdf) found
that 80 percent of pediatric patients in South Sudan experienced a
treatment failure on chloroquine, and 4.4 percent failed on
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Combining the 2 drugs did not improve
outcome.

Artemisinin based therapy is effective as shown in a recent study from
2010 (Elamin SB et al: Descriptive study on the efficacy of
artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated _Plasmodium
falciparum_ malaria in Sudan. Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2010; 66(3):
231-7; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187287) and the
conclusion is that the government should switch to artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) as recommended by the WHO (World Malaria
Report 2010,
http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/wmr2010-chap2.pdf).
Malaria should be prevented by introduction of impregnated bed nets.
