[The posting Mycobacterium TB complex - Germany: cattle, OIE 20190628.6543480, published 28 Jun 2019, included information about 3 outbreaks, 2 caused by _Mycobacterium caprae_ and one by _Mycobacterium bovis_. In the commentary, excerpts from a press release by the German State North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) were included, in which information on a 2nd farm, in contact with the named outbreak, was included. For the sake of clarity, the press release is posted again, this time in its entirety, identifying the 2nd _M. bovis_ outbreak in NRW and adding detail. - Mod.AS]

On 23 May 2019 an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis was confirmed on a dairy farm in Meinerzhagen-Maerkischer Kreis. The infection had been detected during routine slaughter inspection of 2 cows from the holding.

Another dairy farm in Froendenberg (Unna County) was identified as a contact during the epidemiological investigations. The farm was immediately shut down and the animals tested for tuberculosis.

The investigations confirmed the suspicion on the 2 farms and complete depopulation, i.e., the killing of all animals, was ordered on both holdings to contain the infection and to prevent spread to protect the health of consumers and other animals. In addition, the health authorities in the counties where the affected are located have been alerted and have already applied the necessary health screening and investigations to protect those who could have been infected.

Meat of infected animals has not reached the food chain. Every animal is inspected prior to slaughter and every carcass, including offal, of slaughtered cattle is examined by official veterinary staff or official assistants. If suspicion of tuberculosis is found, further testing will immediately be done and the carcasses and by-products be placed under confiscation until the end of the investigations. If a suspicion is confirmed, carcasses and by-products will be destroyed through rendering. Milk from infected or restricted animals must be destroyed as well.

In case tuberculosis is confirmed in bovine herds, the legal requirements are that 5 years of retrospective epidemiological research is to be carried out. The aim is to identify possible contact animals that could potentially have spread the pathogen or introduced the disease to the affected farms. Animals that have been sold to other federal states [in Germany] or to other European countries have been identified and the competent veterinary authorities have been informed immediately to initiate follow-up investigations.

How the pathogen was originally introduced into the farms has so far not been determined. The investigation is still ongoing. It is known that the 2 farms affected are related. Calves from the age of 3 to 5 months from Meinerzhagen have been sent to the farm in Froendenberg, raised there and then returned as in-calf heifers about 4 weeks prior to calving to the farm of origin in Meinerzhagen.

Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease, an infection that can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa. The transmission from cattle to humans can occur via milk, meat or direct contact with infected animals. Pasteurisation is a method which kills the tuberculosis bacterium.

Bovine tuberculosis is an infectious animal disease caused by tuberculosis bacteria (_Mycobacterium bovis_ and _Mycobacterium caprae_), which is notifiable; the legal background can be found in the Verordnung zum Schutz gegen die Tuberkulose des Rindes [Ordinance on the protection against cattle tuberculosis].

[According to the above press release, 2 cattle holdings in NRW, recently affected by _M. bovis_, have been depopulated. One was addressed in the OIE report (in Meinerzhagen). The other one is a dairy farm in Froendenberg, engaged in the rearing of in-calf heifers for the 1st farm. The distance between the 2 is about 43 km (about 27 mi).

The laboratory diagnosis of "cattle tuberculosis" in cattle "older than 2 years" from Maerkicher Kreis (which is the holding in Meinerzhagen) was published by TSIS (Animal Diseases Information System, administered by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture in tandem with the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute).
