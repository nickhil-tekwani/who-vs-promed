WHITE NOSE SYNDROME - CANADA (02): (ONTARIO)

White-nose Syndrome (WNS) has been confirmed in Little Brown Bats
(_Myotis lucifugus_) and Northern Long-eared Bats (_M.
septentrionalis_) at a hibernaculum about 100 km [62 miles] north of
Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.
<http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Newsroom/LatestNews/289821.html>

This is the 1st confirmed record of WNS in Canada; the nearest
affected US hibernaculum, in northern New York State, is about 50 km
[31 miles] south of the Canadian border, and about 225 km [140 miles]
from the Ontario site.

Affected bats had grossly visible fungal involvement of the muzzle
and wings. Microscopic skin lesions typical of those described in
bats affected by WNS contained fungal elements, including
asymmetrically curved conidia characteristic of _Geomyces
destructans_, which was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction at the
USGS-National Wildlife Health Center, Madison, WI. About 500 bats
were evident in the hibernaculum involved, fewer than 4 percent of
which had grossly evident fungal growth. Day-flying bats and abnormal
mortality were not noted.

During late February/March 2010, day-flying bats or hibernacula with
bats appearing typical of WNS have been observed at several other
localities in Ontario, east of Longitude 81, and as far north as
Kirkland Lake, over 550 km [342 miles] from the US border.
Laboratory investigation is underway to confirm if WNS activity is
occurring at these sites.

During 2009, 2 of 12 hibernacula investigated in Eastern Ontario
contained small numbers of _Myotis_ spp. which were WNS suspects,
based on their appearance. However, _G. destructans_ was not
recognized on histopathology, nor was it isolated, or detected by PCR
at the USGS-NWHC. Abnormal bat behavior or mortality was not evident
at affected hibernacula. No bats with signs resembling WNS were
recognized at the hibernaculum reported confirmed here.

Movement of WNS into eastern Ontario is not unexpected, given
proximity to the epicenter of US WNS activity in adjacent upstate New
York, which prompted the surveillance begun in 2009. Ontario has no
species of cave bats recognized as threatened or endangered, in
contrast to the northeastern United States.

Despite the relatively limited mortality evident to date, WNS, once
established, likely will markedly affect populations of Ontario cave
bats, as it has in the USA. Ontario provides an alternative more
northern route for westward expansion of WNS toward bat populations
in the US Upper Midwest. Whether the relative paucity of known bat
hibernacula in Southwestern Ontario will inhibit spread into lower
Michigan and western Ohio is uncertain.
