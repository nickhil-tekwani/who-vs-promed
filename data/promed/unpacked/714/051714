The African swine fever (ASF) virus has now spread widely among the vulnerable Bornean bearded pigs with at least 128 confirmed deaths.

Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Jeffrey Kitingan in a statement here today [Wed 17 Mar 2021] said the government fears for the survival of the species, especially because the population of the Bornean bearded pigs is already declining.

"I am concerned the ASF will further decrease their population at a much faster rate," he said.

Therefore, he said he has directed the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) to convene an urgent steering committee meeting with the relevant departments and agencies to coordinate efforts to control and eradicate ASF in Sabah.

The 1st meeting, chaired by DVS Director Dr Peter Lee, was held on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] and was attended by representatives from the State Attorney General Office, Sabah Wildlife Department, Sabah Forestry Department, Drainage and Irrigation Department, Community Development Leader Unit, Information Department, Local Government and Housing Ministry, and the police.

During the meeting, members were briefed on strategies that will be used to curb ASF disease from spreading to major pork production areas in Sabah.

"The committee discussed how to best solve the problem and raise awareness among the people in ASF-hit areas," he said. "This includes awareness campaign activities, determine how to contain the disease from spreading further among the wild bearded pigs, and the best way to dispose of the pig carcasses."

The Sabah Wildlife Department [SWD] has also suspended hunting licences and prohibited the selling of sinalau bakas or smoked wild boar meat.

So far, no new ASF cases have been recorded among backyard pigs, while commercial pig farms in Tawau, Sandakan, Tenom, Papar, Tuaran, and Penampang have remained ASF-free.

The DVS has carried out ASF awareness campaign in 74 villages in Pitas, the district where ASF was first discovered.

The department has also continued surveillance to detect the status of infection in ASF-free districts and collected 409 samples from abattoirs, commercial pork sales centres, and sinalau bakas vendors throughout the state.

"As a result of this sampling collecting exercise, ASF has been found in Tawau, bringing the total number of districts with confirmed ASF cases to 8. These districts are Pitas, Kota Marudu, Beluran, Telupid, Kinabatangan, Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau.

"Five districts, namely Pitas, Beluran, Kota Marudu, Lahad Datu, and Kinabatangan, have been declared ASF outbreak areas. The remaining 3 districts will be declared the same this week," he said.

Kitingan said DVS had culled a total of 110 backyard pigs, while 395 had died of the virus.

"We will ensure this disease does not reach our commercial pig farms to ensure pork supply for local consumption remains unaffected," he said.

He reminded the public that ASF only affects pigs and there is no need to be worried about the virus' effects on human health.

Sabah Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga disclosed that at least 100 Borneon bearded pigs in Sabah's forest reserves have been found dead so far, suspected from the ASF virus.

Since the discovery of 14 dead bodies in Kinabatangan between December [2020] and January [2021], the SWD has been finding at least one dead body a day.

"The Sabah Department of Veterinary Services couldn't find signs of the virus in the dead wild pigs (in Kinabatangan) at first but has now confirmed that they died from it.

"This follows the discovery of the virus in dead domestic pig(s) in Pitas (which was declared an outbreak area on 23 Feb [2021]). The virus has also spread to other areas in Sabah," Tuuga [said], adding the source of infection is still being investigated.

The director also said humans cannot catch the virus, but it can severely affect the Sabah economy and government's wildlife and forest conservation efforts.

He said hunting licences have been frozen since last year [2020].

[In the absence of a vaccine, the protection of the susceptible porcine species "wild bearded pig" (_Sus barbatus_) against ASF [African swine fever], a lethal, highly infectious virus, is -- to say the least -- complex. It will be interesting to note what actions are decided to be undertaken in Borneo to preserve the endangered animal species.

Efforts to develop vaccines against ASF are continuing in China and elsewhere (reviewed in Ref. 1).

One of the steps deserving consideration to prevent extinction of endangered species is the timely securing of frozen embryos from healthy animals. - Mod.AS]

[The Suidae are a family of the Order Cetartiodactyla, composed of 17 species classified in a minimum of 5 extant genera that originated at least 20 million years ago. The genus _Sus_ diversified into multiple species. Though many remain extant, all but one (_Sus scrofa_, the wild boar) are restricted to Island South East Asia, including _Sus barbatus_, the bearded pig (found in Borneo, Sumatra, and Malay Peninsula). The conservation status of _S. barbatus_ is classified as "vulnerable." In Borneo, their numbers have been declining due to habitat loss, and these deaths due to ASF are an additional cause for concern.

Bearded pigs inhabit tropical rainforests of all elevations and forest types, and readily persist in disturbed or logged forests. Wild boars are smaller and more sedentary than bearded pigs, and both overlap in certain areas. Being bearded pigs closely related to the sympatric wild boar and domestic pigs that carry a variety of diseases, they are thus likely also susceptible or carriers of many of these.

The outbreak of African swine fever that has been going on in Asia since 2018 threatens the 11 endemic wild pig species that live there; see https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12784. - Mod.PMB
