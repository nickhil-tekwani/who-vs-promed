The number of people bitten by dogs in Cabinda increased, reaching
405, of whom 12 died since 25 Jan of this year [2011], stated the
provincial public health and epidemic control official, Antinio Gomes
Tati. In statements to ANGOP, Antonio Tati considered the rabies
outbreak in the province alarming, judging by the daily average of dog
bite cases -- 6 per day.

Because of this, a meeting between health authorities, the Cabinda
municipal administration and veterinary services is scheduled for
Monday [20 Jun 2011] to draw up another strategy to reverse this
picture. This refers to circulating to collect stray dogs, cats and
monkeys to hold in kennels, for sacrifice of those [animals] whose
owners do not show up at the established time.

Antonio Tati stated that as for [human post-exposure treatment]
rabies vaccines, only 50 doses remain in the province, a fact that
intensifies concern of the authorities.

The Cabinda municipality is the most affected with 390 bite cases and
10 deaths, Buco Zau 11 bite cases and one death and Cacongo 4 [bite]
cases an one death, with Belize as the only municipality in the
province without registering any rabies cases.

The official indicated their concern about the fact that there have
been people who died 24 hours after having been bitten by dogs, given
that the rabies incubation period is from 45 days to 2 years on
average.

[If deaths are occurring 24 hours following dog bites, the deaths are
not due to rabies from that bite. It might be possible that these
individuals were bitten and infected several days before their deaths,
on an earlier occasion. There is no information indicating that these
cases were laboratory confirmed as rabies virus infections.
Alternatively, their deaths may have been due to something else.

The lack of rabies vaccine is a serious concern. Elimination of
un-owned stray dogs may exacerbate the outbreak, as new, stray
individual dogs move into the vacated territory and fight with
neighboring dogs. Vaccination of all dogs will be a more effective way
to halt the outbreak.

Rabies is a problem currently in other provinces in Angola. The 18
May 2011 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20100519.1655) indicated that
human cases occurred in the provinces of Kwanza Sul, (4 cases),
Benguela (2), Kwanza Norte (2), Cunene (2) and Uige (1). The above
report indicates that the problem is present in Cabinda province, an
enclave in Angola's far north, as well. One wonders what may be going
on with rabies in neighboring areas of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
