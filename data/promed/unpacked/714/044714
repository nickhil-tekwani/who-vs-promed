Croatia, H5N1, wild swans, confirmed; Lethal H5N1 virus confirmed in
Croatia bird flu case
-----------------------------------------------
Croatia said on Wednesday [26 Oct 2005] tests had confirmed the lethal H5N1
bird flu virus strain in wild swans found dead at a pond in eastern Croatia
last week [3rd week October 2005].
"Results from the laboratory in Weybridge confirmed the H5N1 virus, which
shows that our measures were justified. I once again urge poultry producers
to take this seriously and keep poultry indoors," said veterinary expert
Vladimir Savic.
He warned that the spreading of the virus among poultry would have very
serious consequences. "The situation is serious for the whole of Europe
until a strategy is found, so I cannot say for how long the poultry will
have to be kept indoors," Savic added. The lethal H5N1 strain of bird flu,
which has killed more than 60 people in Asia since 2003, has been detected
in Romania, Turkey, Russia and in an exotic wild bird imported and
quarantined in Britain.
Germany and Greece are still testing dead birds to see whether they died of
avian flu.
Croatian authorities culled 17 000 poultry around the Grudnjak fish pond
over the weekend to prevent the virus from spreading. Another 10 000
poultry were killed around another pond nearby, where 2 more wild swans
died of bird flu.
Agriculture Minister Petar Cobankovic said the government would pay some
0.8 million kuna (USD 130 800) in compensation for the culled poultry
starting from Thursday [27 Oct 2005].
Mate Brstilo, who heads the national committee for bird flu prevention,
said the authorities remained on constant alert.
"Every reported case of dead birds is being thoroughly tested. That is why
we managed to detect bird flu in wild birds as soon as it appeared, and
this prompted some other European countries to do the same," he said.
Some 800 veterinary experts and inspectors are monitoring poultry farms and
areas which host migratory birds, he added.
Ornithologist Dragan Radovic said the situation could become more dangerous
when a larger number of wild swans leave northeastern Europe and land in
Croatia in the next few weeks.
The European Commission this week [4th week October 2005] banned exports of
wild fowl, live poultry and certain poultry products from Croatia.
