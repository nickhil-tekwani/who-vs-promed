Measles outbreak: over 280 cases reported
------------------------------------------
About 281 cases of measles have been reported since the outbreak
began. Manager Philile Shabangu said this was the 1st outbreak of the
disease in the country. Shabangu said while there had been cases of
the disease in previous years, it was the 1st time the country
experienced an outbreak. However, she said no deaths had been
reported.

The Ministry of Health will embark on a national campaign to create
awareness on the disease. The campaign will be launched next week and
will run for 9 days. The campaign will not only be about creating
awareness, but they will be immunising children against the disease.
"We are going to have temporary sites nearer to the people so that
children can access treatment easily," she said. Shabangu said such
sites would include the neighbourhood care points, pre-schools and
gogo [orphan care] centres [Gogo stands for gandmother]. The sites
will be announced before the start of the campaign. Children that are
at risk are those who are 5 years and below. Immunisation for measles
is taken when the baby is 9 months old and again when she/he is 18
months old.

The outbreak was 1st reported in the Hhohho region and eventually
spread across the country and was more severe in the Lubombo region.
Measles affects infants between the ages of 9 months to 5 years old;
however, it was discovered that even the group age 6 to 14 was
affected. Nurses blamed the tendering and procurement process for the
outbreak.

[The Kingdom of Swaziland is a landlocked country in Southern Africa,
bordered to the north, south and west by South Africa, and to the
east by Mozambique. Swaziland is a small country, no more than 200 km
north to south and 130 km east to west, with a population of 1 128
814, and a population growth rate of -0.41 percent. With an HIV
[human immunodeficiency virus] prevalence of 19 percent -- the
highest in the world -- AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] is
having an unprecedented impact on Swaziland. Life expectancy has
fallen from 60 years to 31 years, the world's lowest figure, and one
in 3 children are orphaned or left vulnerable
(<http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=43303>). This outbreak of
measles virus infection is an additional unwelcome event.
