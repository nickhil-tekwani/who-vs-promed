Seattle [Washington] health officials are warning that the H3N2 strain of dog flu that has sickened at least 2000 dogs in 25 states since last spring [2015] may now have emerged in King County.

But they also say a suspected outbreak at a Kent kennel that may have affected dozens of dogs last month [December 2015] appears to be contained -- and pet owners shouldn't panic over what typically is a mild illness.

"If dogs are getting sick with respiratory illness, it should just be considered a possibility," said Beth Lipton, public-health veterinarian with Public Health - Seattle & King County.

Worries about the H3N2 canine influenza virus, 1st seen in the United States in Chicago [Illinois] last March [2015], were sparked by an unusual spate of sickness at Holiday Kennels in Kent in late December [2015].

Several dogs developed flulike symptoms, including runny noses and coughs, said operator Bret Gagliardi. He wouldn't give an estimate, but health officials reported that 80 to 90 dogs may have been affected. Some had to be given cough suppressants by visiting vets, Gagliardi said.

"I've owned the kennel 22 years, and we haven't really had a situation where it was like this," he said Tuesday [12 Jan 2016].

Kennel cough, a common ailment, was suspected until a dog that stayed at the kennel traveled to Georgia with its owners -- and visited 2 other dogs. Those dogs tested positive for H3N2 at a lab near Atlanta [Georgia]. Now, test results are pending from 2 dogs that may have been sickened at the kennel, Lipton said.

In response, Gagliardi shuttered his dog day care and boarding center for 2 weeks and conducted a thorough cleaning, he said.

Until last year [2015], H3N8 influenza virus was responsible for flu in dogs in the United States. Then, last March [2015], hundreds of dogs in the Chicago area and throughout the Midwest fell ill with a bug identified as H3N2, likely a variant of a dog flu detected in part of Asia since 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

There's no evidence, so far, that dog flu spreads to people, and there have been no human infections with the canine H3N2 virus. The bug sometimes affects cats and, perhaps, ferrets and guinea pigs.

Seattle health officials published a blog post Tuesday warning pet owners. But experts at Washington State University's [WSU] veterinary school, which has fielded dozens of calls and conducted tests for H3N2 in the past year, said they hadn't heard of possible cases.

"We have not seen an animal positive," said Charlie Powell, a WSU spokesman. "To our knowledge, this would be the 1st confirmed case in Washington."

But a spokesman for the American Veterinary Medical Association said no one would be surprised if the new dog flu had made it to the Pacific Northwest. At least 2000 cases have been reported across the country, but the figure is likely far higher, said Michael San Filippo, a spokesman.

"It spreads so easily and because it's a novel virus, there's no immunity," he noted.

Dogs can show signs of flu within 24 hours after exposure, but they're likely contagious for 3 days before they fall ill -- and weeks afterward, said Lipton, the Seattle veterinarian.

Two manufacturers -- Merck and Zoetis -- have produced vaccines that protect against H3N2, but because it hadn't been seen yet in Washington state, many veterinarians don't stock the vaccine.

Dog flu is generally mild, but, as with human flu, it can lead to serious illness, including pneumonia. Pets with underlying health conditions can be vulnerable to the bug.

Pet owners who suspect dog flu should monitor their animals and seek veterinary care if the infection gets worse, Lipton said. They should keep their pets away from other animals while they're sick.

The Kent kennel has been responsible in reporting the illnesses and then shutting down the site to prevent spread, she added. No other kennels or boarding centers have reported cases of dog flu.

Helena Veterinary Service (HVS) reported Tuesday [12 Jan 2016] that they have confirmed a case of a very rare strain of canine influenza, H3N2, in Helena [Montana].

The signs are often confused with kennel cough, or bordetella, said Lindsay Hash, practice manager with HVS.

"It is the 1st case we have ever heard of here," Hash said.

It was treated at their office earlier this week, she said, and was confirmed with a lab test sent to IDEXX diagnostic lab.

Hash recommends that dogs can be vaccinated to prevent the disease if the dog will be at a boarding facility or traveling.

"Keep animals out of the Dog Park," she advised, where it can easily spread.

"The germs for this live quite a bit longer in the environment," she said, and can travel on clothing and shoes.

H3N2 hit Chicago [Illinois] and other areas of the Midwest in 2015, causing an estimated 1000 dogs in Chicago to become ill, according to a May [2015] USA Today article. It was also reported at that time in Ohio, Alabama, California, Georgia, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, Wisconsin, Michigan, New Jersey, Iowa and Indiana.

It has been identified in 40 states and Washington, D.C., according to an American Veterinary Medical Association [AVMA] fact sheet, which states that since March 2015 more than 2000 cases had been confirmed positive.

"It's a virus and it has to run its course," said Hash.

Veterinarians can only treat the signs, which include coughing -- very similar to whooping cough in humans, gagging, sneezing, runny nose, phlegm, lethargy and low grade fever.

Cases can be mild with few symptoms or very serious and can result in pneumonia and fatality.

Although the symptoms can be treated, there is no guarantee the disease won't be fatal, depending on the dog's medical history, said Hash.

However, most dogs recover within 2 to 3 weeks, according to the AVMA fact sheet.

If your dog has signs, Hash recommends calling your vet. However, she cautions to not just take your dog to the vet office without calling ahead of time because the virus is highly contagious.

She also urges pet owners to self-quarantine their pets if they are ill.

Pet owners can get their dogs vaccinated, she said. It requires an initial shot and a booster 3 weeks later, and the cost is "relatively affordable."

[The 1st recognized outbreak of H3N8 canine influenza occurred in racing greyhounds in January 2004 at a track in Florida. From June to August of 2004, outbreaks of respiratory disease were reported at 14 tracks in 6 states (Florida, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Kansas). Between January and May of 2005, outbreaks occurred at 20 tracks in 10 states (Florida, Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, West Virginia, Kansas, Iowa, Colorado, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts [Washington and Montana may now be on an updated list]). Since then, the H3N8 canine influenza has been documented in 40 states and Washington, DC. The H3N8 strain of canine influenza virus is endemic in areas of Colorado, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania.

The 1st recognized U.S. outbreak of H3N2 canine influenza occurred in 2015, starting in Chicago and spreading to other Midwestern states. Since March 2015, outbreaks have occurred in a number of areas throughout the U.S. and more than 2000 dogs have been confirmed positive for the H3N2 virus.

Outbreaks are more commonly seen in situations where groups of susceptible dogs are in close contact, such as shelters, kennels, dog day care facilities, and grooming or boarding facilities.

Transmission
Canine influenza is spread via aerosolized respiratory secretions (via coughing, barking and sneezing) and contaminated objects (kennel surfaces, food and water bowls, collars and leashes) and people moving between infected and uninfected dogs. The virus can remain viable (alive and able to infect) on surfaces for up to 48 hours, on clothing for 24 hours, and on hands for 12 hours.

The incubation period is usually 2 to 4 days from exposure to onset of clinical signs. The highest amounts of viral shedding occur during this time; therefore, dogs are most contagious during this 2-4 day incubation period when they are not exhibiting signs of illness. Virus shedding decreases dramatically during the 1st 4 days of illness but may continue up to 7 days in most dogs and up to 10 days in some dogs with H3N8 canine influenza. Intermittent H3N2 shedding for up to 24 days can occur.

Because this is still an emerging pathogen, all dogs, regardless of breed or age, are susceptible to infection and have no naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity when 1st exposed to the virus. If the virus enters a kennel or other closed group, a high percentage of the dogs may become infected, and most of these dogs will be symptomatic. Although most dogs have a milder form of canine influenza and recover without complications, some may develop severe pneumonia. Approximately 20-25 percent of infected dogs are expected to remain asymptomatic, but can still shed the virus and spread the virus.

Pathology and Clinical Signs
The canine influenza virus infects and replicates inside the cells of the respiratory tract, from the nasal lining to the terminal airways. The inflammatory response results in rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis. The pathologic process also involves the death of the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, resulting in exposure of the underlying basement membrane. This, in turn, predisposes the respiratory tract to secondary bacterial infections that contribute to the nasal discharge and coughing.

Virtually all dogs that are exposed become infected with the virus, but approximately 80 percent develop clinical signs of disease. The approximately 20 percent of infected dogs that do not exhibit clinical signs of disease can still shed the virus and can spread the infection.

Like other mammalian influenza viruses, canine influenza virus causes an acute respiratory infection in dogs. However, unlike human influenza, CIV is not a "seasonal" flu -- infections can occur year-round. Canine influenza virus infection often resembles the illness associated with canine infectious tracheobronchitis ("kennel cough"), which is caused by one of more bacterial and viral infections (including Bordetella bronchiseptica/parainfluenza virus).

The majority of infected dogs exhibit the mild form of canine influenza. In the mild form, the most common clinical sign is a cough that persists for 10 to 21 days despite treatment with antibiotics and cough suppressants. Affected dogs may have a soft, moist cough or a dry cough similar to that induced by kennel cough. Nasal and/or ocular discharge, sneezing, lethargy and anorexia may also be observed. Many dogs develop a purulent nasal discharge and fever (104-105 deg F). The nasal discharge is usually caused by secondary bacterial infections, including Pasteurella multocida and mycoplasma species.

Some dogs are more severely affected with clinical signs of pneumonia, such as a high-grade fever (104 deg F to 106 deg F) and increased respiratory rate and effort. Thoracic radiography (chest x-rays) may reveal consolidation of lung lobes.

During the initial outbreaks in greyhound facilities, severe bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis, and hemorrhages in the lungs, mediastinum and pleural cavity were observed, as well as acute death. This syndrome has not been reported in pet dogs.

Diagnosis
Canine influenza cannot be diagnosed solely by clinical signs because the clinical signs (coughing, sneezing and nasal discharge) are similar to those associated with all of the other respiratory pathogens and cannot be differentiated from them.

Antibodies to canine influenza virus may be detected in the blood as early as 7 days after onset of clinical signs, and the virus may be identified in nasal or pharyngeal swabs during the 1st 4 days of illness. The most reliable and sensitive method for confirmation of infection is serologic testing. Paired acute serum samples (taken within the 1st 7 days of illness) and convalescent serum samples (taken 10-14 days later) are necessary for diagnosis of recent infection. If an acute sample is not available, a convalescent sample will indicate whether a dog has been exposed to the virus at some point in the past. A diagnosis of canine influenza is made based on a 4-fold increase in antibody titer from the acute to the convalescent sample. Serologic testing is available for both H3N8 and H3N2 canine influenza. For example, when requesting tests through the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center, veterinarians should request canine influenza HAI; the testing will be done automatically for both H3N8 and H3N2 viruses, and they will get a differential titer.

If a dog has been ill for less than 3 days, nasal and pharyngeal swab submission for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can be performed. Nasal swabs may yield better results than nasopharyngeal swabs. If the PCR indicates a positive result, the dog is most likely infected. Negative PCR results may be falsely negative if the swabs are not collected during the time of peak virus shedding. After 4 days of illness, PCR results are less likely to be reliable. Serology may be performed to confirm infection, especially if the PCR results are negative and the case is highly suspicious for canine influenza infection. RT-PCR tests for H3N8 influenza will not detect H3N2 influenza.
Other diagnostic options applicable to dogs that have died from pneumonia are viral culture and PCR analysis using fresh (not formalin-preserved or frozen) lung and tracheal tissues.

In-house ELISA tests designed to detect influenza types A and B in humans may also be helpful in early diagnosis of CIV.

Treatment
Veterinary expertise is required to establish the best course of treatment or treatment options. As for all viral diseases, treatment is largely supportive. Good husbandry and nutrition may assist dogs in mounting an effective immune response. Most dogs recover from canine influenza within 2-3 weeks. The presence of secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, dehydration, or other health factors (e.g., pregnancy, pre-existing pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, tracheal collapse, etc.) may warrant additional diagnostic and treatments including, but not limited to:

- Antimicrobials for known or suspected secondary bacterial infections: the selection may be based on results of culture and sensitivity testing of transtracheal aspirate; or broad-spectrum activity if aspirate and culture/sensitivity are not obtained.
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as needed to reduce fever and inflammation.
- Fluids to help correct dehydration or maintain hydration.

Treatment modifications should be made as needed, based on response to treatment, other health factors, and other factors such as compliance and animal care capabilities of the owner/caretaker.

Antiviral drugs are approved for use in humans only, and little is known about their use, efficacy and safety in dogs. Veterinarians who use approved drugs in a manner that is not in accord with approved label directions (e.g., use of an antiviral drug only approved for use in humans) must follow the federal extralabel drug use regulations of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA).

Morbidity and Mortality
The morbidity rate (the number of exposed animals that develop disease) associated with canine influenza is estimated at 80 percent. Deaths occur mainly in dogs with the severe form of disease; the mortality rate is low (less than 10 percent). Higher case fatality rates have been reported in small groups of greyhounds that developed hemorrhagic pneumonia during outbreaks.

Prevention and Control
In veterinary, boarding and shelter facilities, the canine influenza virus appears to be easily killed by disinfectants commonly used in these facilities, such as quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., benzalkonium chloride), aldehydes, potassium peroxymonosulfate, phenols and bleach (1:30) solutions. Protocols should be established for thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting cages, bowls and other surfaces between uses. The virus may persist in the environment for approximately 2 days, and be viable on hands and clothing for up to 24 hours.

Employees should wash their hands with soap and water:
- Upon arriving at the facility
- Before and after handling each dog
- After coming into contact with dogs' saliva, urine, feces, or blood
- After cleaning cages
- Before eating meals, taking breaks, or leaving the facility
- Before and after using the restroom

Isolation protocols should be rigorously applied for dogs showing clinical signs of respiratory disease. Dogs that are exhibiting clinical signs consistent with respiratory disease should be kept in the owner's car until they can be triaged and brought into an isolated receiving area that is immediately disinfected when the dog is discharged.

Sick or exposed dogs should be isolated for 2 weeks, preferably with a separate air supply. Personal protective equipment (gown and gloves at a minimum) should be worn when handling ill animals. Clothing (including shoes), equipment, surfaces and hands should be cleaned and disinfected after exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease. Dog owners whose dogs are coughing or exhibiting other signs of respiratory disease should not participate in activities or bring their dogs to facilities where other dogs can be exposed to the virus.

There are currently 2 H3N8 CIV vaccines available, the 1st of which was approved by the USDA in May 2009; both are labeled as an aid in the control of disease, and contain inactivated whole virus. It is unknown whether the H3N8 vaccines will provide any cross-protection against H3N2. In November 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture granted a conditional license to Zoetis to market the 1st commercially available H3N2 canine influenza vaccine. Later that month, Merck Animal Health also announced the availability of a H3N2 canine influenza vaccine, also conditionally licensed by USDA.

The canine H3N8 vaccine is intended as an aid in the control of disease associated with canine influenza virus infection. Although the vaccine may not prevent H3N8 infection altogether, efficacy trials have shown that it may significantly reduce the severity and duration of clinical illness, including the incidence and severity of damage to the lungs. In addition, the vaccine reduces the amount of virus shed and shortens the shedding interval; therefore, vaccinated dogs that become infected develop less severe illness and are less likely to spread the virus to other dogs. These benefits are similar to those provided by influenza vaccines used in other species, including humans.

The canine influenza vaccine is a "lifestyle" vaccine, and is not recommended for every dog. In general, the vaccine is intended for the protection of dogs at risk for exposure to the canine influenza virus, which include those that either participate in activities with many other dogs or are housed in communal facilities, particularly where the virus is prevalent. Dogs that may benefit from canine influenza vaccination include those that receive the kennel cough (Bordetella/parainfluenza) vaccine, because the risk groups are similar. Dog owners should consult with their veterinarian to determine whether their dog's lifestyle includes risks for exposure to the canine influenza virus, and if vaccination is appropriate for their dog.
