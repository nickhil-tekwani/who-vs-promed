Eight new cases of mumps have been confirmed in the Halifax area,
bringing the total number to 32.
Public health officials said Thursday [5 Apr 2007] they continue to
investigate the outbreak, which began in February [2007].
Mumps is an infectious disease easily spread through close contact
with an infected person, by sneezing, kissing, or even breathing.
Symptoms include fever, aches and pains, and swollen or tender
salivary glands.
Serious cases are rare, but they can lead to inflammation of the
brain, meningitis, arthritis, and deafness. Women infected with mumps
while pregnant are at a greater risk of miscarriage.
In Nova Scotia, children are immunized against mumps, but young
adults can still get it.
Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, a medical officer of health, told CBC News
Wednesday the outbreak started when someone infected with mumps
visited the province. She advised anyone with the illness to stay
away from people for at least 9 days after being diagnosed.
This is the 3rd outbreak of mumps to hit Nova Scotia in 2 years.
There were 13 reported cases in the spring of 2005 and 19 cases that
fall, mostly involving university-age adults.
All doctors in Nova Scotia are required by law to report cases of mumps.

[In the 1st posting on this outbreak, Mod.CP put a request for
information on the vaccination status of the cases. The newswire
above mentions that this is the 3rd outbreak of mumps in Nova Scotia
in 2 years, with most of the cases in university-aged adults. The
obvious question that comes to mind is whether this is a case of
non-immunized young adults being exposed to the mumps virus or if
this is a case of single dose immunized young adults being exposed to
the mumps virus.
As reported in a recent Eurosurveillance weekly release report (Vol.
12, Issue 3 <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2007/070322.asp#4>),
Bulgaria took a decision to revaccinate the young adult population
against mumps in response to an ongoing mumps epidemic. An analysis
of the vaccination activities in the country revealed "Vaccination
against mumps in Bulgaria started in 1972, and a routine mumps
immunisation program was launched in 1976. However, different vaccine
strains and vaccines have been used, and different immunisation
strategies implemented, including a suspension of mumps immunisation
for almost 4 years during the period 1982 to 1986....... A risk
assessment carried out following the outbreak concluded that birth
cohorts 1982 to 1992 that are at higher risk of mumps infection
should be offered supplementary mumps immunisation. As a result, the
Bulgarian Ministry of Health decided to provide supplementary doses
of MMR vaccine and to conduct immunisation campaigns targeted at
these cohorts." (see ProMED Archive: Mumps - Bulgaria: supplementary
vaccination 20070322.1007).
Again, more information on the epidemiology of the present mumps
outbreak in Nova Scotia including vaccination histories of the cases
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
