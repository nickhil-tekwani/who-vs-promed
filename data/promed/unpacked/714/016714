District 2 Public Health officials confirm they are investigating more than a half-dozen cases of _E. coli_-related illnesses in Stephens County [Georgia USA].

District 2 Public Health spokesman Dave Palmer said Friday night [17 May 2013] officials are trying to determine the source of the exposure to _Escherichia coli_ [O157] in the Stephens County area, which has resulted in hospitalizations. "We don't have a source yet," Palmer said. "We're still investigating."

Asked what steps Public Health officials are taking in the investigation, Palmer provided the following explanation. "What we do in an investigation is to try to determine the sources, we interview the folks who have it -- who are infected," Palmer said. "We try to find out what they've eaten over the past few days, when the illness started, what they've eaten, where they've eaten, all those questions like that, trying to determine one common thing that might link it together, so the investigation is still going on and the interview to try and find out where it came from."

"We have had hospitalizations from it," Palmer said. "I don't know the status of that. I do know that one of the people that was hospitalized has been released, so they all are recovering."

Generally, the illness starts about 2 to 3 days after exposure, up to 7 days. It usually starts with stomach cramps, followed by prolonged diarrhea, sometimes bloody diarrhea. Palmer urges anyone who has diarrhea for 2 or 3 days to seek medical advice. He said it is important for those who experience diarrhea to drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated.

Asked whether 7 cases is a large number at one time, Palmer said it's hard to say. It does, however, raise a red flag triggering an investigation.

"Usually when we have a cluster like that, when it's a half-dozen or so, it raises an alarm for us that hey, something may be going on here and we want to make sure we investigate it, find the source if we can, and fix whatever the problem is," Palmer said.
