Imported measles from Mongolia to Japan
---------------------------------------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) certified that Mongolia was measles free in June 2014. Here we report a measles case of a Japanese patient who returned from Mongolia.

A 36-year-old Japanese man with a 6-day history of fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and rash was diagnosed with measles on 16 Jul 2015 after returning from Mongolia. He had been working as a Japanese-language teacher in Nalaiha, a suburb of Ulan Bator, for 5 years. He returned to Japan from Mongolia via Beijing on 7 Jul 2015 for a summer holiday. He did not visit any other countries or have any infectious diseases, and had no contact with sick people during his stay in Mongolia. The patient's vaccination records were unavailable. He had a mild case of measles in his childhood, according to his mother. A physical examination revealed generalised exanthema involving the palms and soles and small white papules (Koplik spots) on the bilateral buccal mucosa and gingiva. Laboratory results revealed thrombocytopenia with slight liver and kidney dysfunction. Upon admission to our hospital, supportive care was initiated. Serologic testing revealed anti-measles IgM and IgG titers of 9.21 and 10.6 on 16 Jul 2015 (acute phase) and 11.1 and 70.6 on 30 Jul 2015 (recovery phase), respectively. To confirm the diagnosis, his blood and pharyngeal swab samples was sent to the Nara Prefecture Institute of Health. The result revealed measles virus genotype H1, which is the same genotype detected in China and Mongolia. With his current medical history and laboratory data, we suspected that he was [infected with measles virus] in Mongolia.

An official report issued by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO)* confirmed a total of 750 measles cases in Mongolia between March and June 2015, although an International SOS** was issued to travelers regarding a measles outbreak in Mongolia at the end of May 2015 because of more than 8900 suspected cases, of which at least 100 were laboratory or clinically confirmed. There is a significant difference in the number of measles cases in 2 reports. It is uncertain whether measles outbreak is ongoing in Mongolia or not, but the risk of measles among travelers planning to visit Mongolia should be assessed to recommend adequate vaccination strategies.

Measles cases in Iraq up in 2015
--------------------------------
The number of measles cases in war-torn Iraq has risen this far in 2015 compared to the previous 2 years, according to an OCHA Humanitarian Crisis Situation Report. The country, which has seen more than 3 million people displaced during the past year and a half, has seen the number of confirmed measles cases between January and July this year to be 976; this compares to 834 in 2014 and 603 in 2013. Baghdad and Babylon governorates have registered most cases. A nation-wide measles campaign is yet to take place this year.

The Department of Health along with health partners are organizing mop-up vaccinations at the localities reporting measles cases to contain the spread of disease.

According to the World Health Organisation, measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus. In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. The disease remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Approximately 145 700 people died from measles in 2013 -- mostly children under the age of 5.

University of Queensland (Brisbane) confirms 4th case of measles since mid-July [2015]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The University of Queensland [UQ] has confirmed the 4th case of measles at its St Lucia campus since mid-July [2015]. Health officials said the latest student victim had attended a lecture with a previously confirmed measles sufferer. They said the student had visited a number of locations while infectious, including:

- University of Queensland, St Lucia, between Tuesday, 11 Aug 2015, and Wednesday, 19 Aug 2015
- Indooroopilly Shopping Centre, Thursday, 13 Aug 2015
- The Royal Exchange Hotel, Saturday, 15 Aug 2015
- Taringa Day and Night Medical Centre, evening of Sunday [Saturday?], 15 Aug 2015

Metro North Public Health physician James Smith said anyone at those locations who may have come into contact with the patient should speak to their GP if not certain about their own immunity.

"Measles is a very contagious virus that is spread from person to person by tiny droplets created during coughing and sneezing. The droplets can remain suspended in the air," Dr Smith said. "Measles can be distressing for those with the infection and can cause serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). We encourage people to check if they need to be vaccinated against measles."

The 1st person to suffer measles at UQ was a student who contracted the disease on an overseas holiday. They returned to Brisbane on 15 Jul 2015, and went to a number of public locations while infectious until being diagnosed 5 days later. Two other students have since been confirmed with the virus.

Dr Smith said the Metro North Public Health Unit would set up a vaccination clinic at the St Lucia campus this week, particularly targeting students living in residential colleges. He said the initial symptoms of measles include fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough and sore and red eyes. A blotchy red rash that often starts on the face follows a few days later, then spreads. "Symptoms usually start around 10 days after infection but sometimes longer. Anyone who develops measles-like symptoms should isolate themselves from school, work and social activities and seek medical advice," Dr Smith said.

"It's very important to call the medical practice first to say you could have measles, so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others."

A 5th University of Queensland student has tested positive to measles as an outbreak continues at the St Lucia campus in Brisbane's inner west
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public health experts have set up a vaccination clinic at the campus, particularly targeting students at residential colleges.

A Queensland Health communicable diseases surveillance report shows the 1st case in the university outbreak contracted measles in Indonesia in July [2015] before returning to Brisbane.

One of the 5 students who have been diagnosed with the highly contagious virus in the past 5 weeks was infectious while attending lectures with the university's faculty of engineering. But the outbreak has not been confined to one faculty. The latest case takes the number of people diagnosed with measles in Queensland so far this year to 15, compared with 73 for the whole of 2014.

Metro North public health physician James Smith said people who had not been vaccinated against measles should speak to their general practitioner. "Measles can be distressing for those with the infection and can cause serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)," he said.

Initial symptoms include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, moist cough and sore and red eyes. This is followed a few days later by a blotchy red rash. The rash often starts on the face before spreading. "Symptoms usually start around 10 days after infection but sometimes longer," Dr Smith said. He said anyone who developed measles-like symptoms should isolate themselves from school, work and social activities and seek medical advice. "It's very important to call the medical practice first to say you could have measles, so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the disease to others," Dr Smith said.
