In recent days, many cases of the equine virus EHV-1 have been identified across Europe, leading to the cancellation of several equestrian competitions. It has since been confirmed that a case has been reported in the Grand Duchy.

The Luxembourg Ministry of Agriculture announced the discovery of the 1st case to be found in the Grand Duchy on Tue 9 Mar [2021]. The Administration of Veterinary Services has stated that the virus is not transmissible from animals to humans.

In the event of suspected disease or confirmed infection, the animal owner should contact their attending veterinarian in order to take the necessary measures to prevent other horses from becoming infected.

[Luxembourg becomes the 8th country reporting EHV-1 infections in horses related to the event in Valencia, joining Spain, Germany, Belgium, France, Sweden, Qatar, and Italy.

In the meantime, 6 additional cases (positive tests) have been identified in Haras du Ry, northern Normandy, France, in horses that had competed in show jumping in Valencia and returned to France on 3 Mar 2021 (https://equnews.com/rhinoENG/six-of-amy-grahams-horses-positive-for-ehv-1).

In ProMED post 20210309.8235555, we included the full timeline for the Valencia EHV-1 event and its international ramifications, as published by FEI (International Equestrian Federation), up to 8 Mar 2021. The following information is selected from the timeline's update of 11 Mar 2021.

"All 2053 horses that have participated in the Spanish Sunshine Tour since 9 Feb 2021 had already been blocked in the FEI Database, and athletes were advised of the necessary biosecurity measures that must be implemented prior to return to competition. Athletes were also advised not to participate in any training sessions or national competitions with their horses, nor any breeding activities.

"The CHIO Aachen Campus hosted [on Thu 11 Mar 2021] a live online forum to answer questions about the EHV-1 outbreak. The Dutch National Federation had previously hosted a similar webinar, which attracted an audience of close to 4000.

"On Tue 9 Mar 2021, "the FEI held a press conference with media that have covered the outbreak in Europe, giving an overview of the outbreak and outlining next steps, including that there will be a comprehensive and fully transparent investigation into every aspect of this outbreak and the way it has been handled and the measures that will need to be taken for a safe return to play."
