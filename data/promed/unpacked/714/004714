According to data from the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), 2655 premises, totaling 950 500 acres, are under quarantine in Texas due to fever ticks, and ranchers along the U.S.-Mexico border say the disease they carry has devastated their operations.

Fever ticks can carry a parasite that causes _Babesia bovis_ or _B. bigemina_, commonly known as cattle fever. The _Babesia_ organism attacks and destroys red blood cells, causing acute anemia, high fever, and enlargement of the spleen and liver, ultimately resulting in death for up to 90 percent of susceptible naive cattle.

TAHC says portions of 8 South Texas counties have established fever tick quarantines. The counties include, Cameron, Live Oak, Kinney, Maverick, Starr, Webb, Willacy and Zapata.

Texas rancher RG's 9000 acre ranch a mile north of the border has been quarantined 22 times in the past 15 years. RG told the Epoch Times that his ranch has been idle for the past 4 years because it has become cost-prohibitive for him to run cattle due to fever ticks. At full capacity, he could run 1000 cattle.

RG's ranch is near Rio Grande City, and with no fencing in the area, cattle and deer crossing the border from Mexico can bring ticks infecting U.S. herds.

"Right now, one of our biggest problems, even though we do have some human trafficking, is the problem with fever tick. Fever tick comes from Mexico. Mexico does nothing to control it," RG told the Epoch Times [There is no program in Mexico for controlling the ticks, and livestock has suffered greatly from the diseases transmitted by this tick. - Mod.TG]. There is no cure or vaccine for the fever tick, and his biggest hope now is for a border wall to be built, cutting access for the wildlife bringing the tick over the border.

"Texas is in the midst of an outbreak, which has been happening periodically since 1960," says Callie Ward, communications director for the TAHC. "Many cattle, equines, cervids, and nilgai antelope that cross from Mexico into Texas carry fever ticks. USDA employs mounted tick patrols (tick riders) whose job is to ride horses along the border looking for stray animals that may wander from Mexico. They apprehend and treat the animals."

[This tick is a huge economic concern for both countries. It represents suffering for the affected animals as well as a tremendous economic loss for the producers. The counties affected in Texas are large counties and represent a tremendous amount of territory.

The Texas cattle fever tick represents a great loss to Texas. The recent spread of these ticks is quite concerning because of disease spread, quarantines, and loss of animals and finances to the owner. This particular fever tick has plagued Texas for some time and was part of the history of Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine (http://vetmed.tamu.edu/about-us/history). Great strides were made against this pest. Then it rallied against the efforts to eliminate it from Texas.

It is a very expensive and time-consuming task to eradicate the carrier of this disease. In the 1940s, cattle were dipped in large vats with an arsenic-containing dip. Co-Ral is not an arsenic dip, but rather an organophosphate, which can inhibit cholinesterase. This chemical is a restricted-use pesticide, meaning special training and handling are required to use it.

A photo of cattle being run through a dip can be seen at http://www.afrivip.org/sites/default/files/Ticks_control/images/Image%209_e.jpg.
