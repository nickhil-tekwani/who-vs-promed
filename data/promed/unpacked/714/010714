New outbreaks:
[The reports provides the locations of 26 new outbreaks in the
following 6 provinces: Centre(1), Eastern (6), Centre north
(3), Tensift (1), North-west (8) and Centre-south (7). A map,
demonstrating the said outbreaks and administrative division, is
included [click on Source URL].

The total number of animals in the said 26 outbreaks and their fate
was as follows:

Goats: susceptible - 570; cases - 47; died - 18.
Apparently case fatality rate - 38.30 percent.
Sheep: susceptible - 3386; cases - 248; died - 97.
Apparently case fatality rate - 39.11 percent.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
[see commentary]
Epidemiological comments: In addition to perifocal vaccination, a
full-scale campaign of vaccination of sheep and goats began on 22 Sep
2008. Up to 29 Sep 2008, 1 100 000 heads have been vaccinated.

Control measures
Measures applied

[With the added 26 outbreaks, the total number of outbreaks in
Morocco is, as of 30 Sep 2008, 232. A map with all outbreaks since
the start (June 2008) of this major epizootic is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7212>.

The statement of the report regarding the ("Unknown or inconclusive")
origin of the outbreak is in need of clarification. An FAO source
stated in early September (see 20080909.2819): "The origin of the
outbreaks is currently unknown, but it is possible the disease was
introduced through the movement of live, infected animals. For North
African countries, the control of animal movements over borders is
difficult, especially in the southern part of the region where
herders follow a nomadic lifestyle."

There are 4 known lineages of the PPR virus: lineages 1 and 2 are West
African, lineage 3 is mainly East African, and lineage 4 is Asian
(including the Middle East). To establish a well-founded supposition
on the origin of the Moroccan epizootic, the lineage of the causative
agent should be determined. Relevant data, if available, are of
significant epidemiological importance -- and are hereby requested.

In this context it is noteworthy that the Director of Veterinary
Services at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of
Algeria, Rachid Bouguedour, gave assurances on 10 Sep 2008 that "no
cases of PPR were reported on Algerian territory." Intensive
surveillance, particularly in the western provinces (bordering
Moroccco), was -- reportedly -- undertaken. For the said information
