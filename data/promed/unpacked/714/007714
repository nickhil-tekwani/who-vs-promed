Vet dept classifies 15 pig farms as 'high risk'
-----------------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: The Veterinary Services Department has quarantined 15 farms
with 19 094 pigs nationwide to prevent a recurrence of the viral
encephalitis [caused by Nipah virus which killed more than 100 people
last year.
Department director-general Datuk Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor said the farms had
been classified as "high risk" after the first stage of testing. He said
5 of the affected farms were in Penang, 4 in Perak, 3 in Malacca, 2 in
Selangor and one in Kedah.
Dr Nordin said tests had been conducted on 796 pig farms since April and 24
414 blood samples sent for testing at the Veterinary Research Institute in
Ipoh. "Currently, we are conducting two-stage tests. All blood samples will
be tested in Ipoh and those found to be high risk will be sent for further
testing in Australia. "We have sent 392 blood samples to the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory, including those from the 15 farms and results
will be known next month," he told a press conference yesterday.
Dr Nordin said only the infected pigs would be culled if only one or 2 in
any of the affected farms are tested positive in Australia. He said all
pigs in any of the affected farms must be culled if majority of them were
tested positive (in Australia). Dr Nordin said the ban on the movement of
pigs was still on, adding that there were no new cases of viral
encephalitis [presumably Nipah virus in humans since the last outbreak.
