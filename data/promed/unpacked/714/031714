On 7 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center reported 5
shigellosis cases in Vilnius, all typed as _Shigella sonnei_, to the
National Center for Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control.
Preliminary patient data suggested that the infections were all
acquired from unpasteurized milk curds bought from 2 markets in
Vilnius. The curd sold at the 2 markets was produced in a small
commercial dairy in Alytus, in the south of the country. An
epidemiological investigation was begun on 7 Oct 2004 to identify
risk factors and the route of transmission, and control measures for
infection prevention were implemented.
Shigellosis-related morbidity in Lithuania during the past 10 years
has decreased from 143 per 100 000 population in 1995 to 23 per 100
000 in 2004. Shigellosis is the cause of around 5 percent of all
acute gastrointestinal infections in Lithuania. In 2002, 70 percent
of all isolated shigella types were _Shigella sonnei_, 79 percent in
2003 and 89 percent in 2004. Every year about 50 percent of known
shigellosis cases are reported to be due to foodborne infections, and
about 30 percent are infected through person-to-person transmission.
Between 9 and 29 shigellosis outbreaks were reported annually between
1996 and 2004 (an average of 19 outbreaks a year). 70 percent were
family clusters. Some of these outbreaks were linked to the
consumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products that did not
undergo additional thermal processing.
Case finding
------------
Between 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004, the Vilnius Public Health Center
received 41 reports about clinical and/or laboratory confirmed
shigellosis cases in Vilnius city. All these patients were directly
interviewed, and 36 cases were selected for analysis. All 36 of the
selected shigellosis cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory
confirmed as _S. sonnei_, and all were in patients living in Vilnius,
who between 23 Sep and 8 Oct had eaten unpasteurized milk curds
produced in a small dairy in Alytus and sold in 2 Vilnius markets.
The suspected curd product was thought to have been on sale from 23
Sep 2004, and production and sale were suspended on 8 Oct.
Analytical study
----------------
Direct interviews were carried out with 36 patients confirmed as _S.
sonnei_ cases, and 83 controls. 2 types of controls were selected:
the 1st group lived in the same household as patients confirmed to
have _S. sonnei_ infections and did not have any symptoms in the
month before the interview (symptoms were defined as 3 or more
episodes of diarrhea in a 24-hour period, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, or fever). The 2nd control group were patients who had been
treated in other units of the hospital and who did not have any of
the symptoms described above in the month before interview. Controls
were selected according to demographic features, age and sex,
although it was not possible to find an appropriate match for each case.
Cases and controls were interviewed with a standard questionnaire,
requesting personal information, clinical data, demographic
information and information on food consumed during the week before
onset of symptoms (for cases) or the week before the interview (for
controls). The food questions focused on purchase, preparation and
period of consumption of unpasteurized milk products. Information
about food eaten by children under 12 years was obtained from
parents. Survey results were analysed using Epi Info version 3.3.2.
Environmental investigation
---------------------------
On 8 Oct 2004, the dairy in Alytus and the 2 markets in Vilnius were
inspected by officials from local public health centres and the
national food and veterinary service, and raw milk, water, and
environmental samples were taken for culture. The environmental
investigation at the dairy examined milk and milk products, and the
transport, storage and preparation processes. Staff working at the
dairy were interviewed about any recent illness. Vilnius food and
veterinary service evaluated the condition of food in 2 Vilnius
markets, and took environmental samples to assess bacteriological
environmental contamination. Bacteriological samples were also taken
from staff working in milk curds preparation, transport, and trading.
Further results
---------------
The Vilnius Public Health Center reported 41 cases of shigellosis
between 25 Sep and 11 Oct 2004. 36 laboratory-confirmed cases of _S.
sonnei_ infection were found to be associated with the consumption of
unpasteurized milk curd that was prepared in a dairy. Samples from 8
people living or working in the dairy were laboratory-tested. _S.
sonnei_ was isolated from the dairy owner and 2 of her household
members (who did not work in food production). 4 workers who handled
unpasteurized milk curds at the 2 markets were also sampled, and the
same type of _S. sonnei_ was isolated from one of these workers. The
cultures were typed at the laboratory of the National Public Health
Investigation Center. All pathogen cultures isolated from patients,
workers, and inhabitants of the dairy, and the market worker were of
the same type and resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.
Children under 14 years made up 50 percent of the patients (18/36),
and people aged 65 years and older made up 16 percent of patients
(6/36). 23 patients (69 percent) were admitted to hospital. 80
percent of outbreak cases were in women and 20 percent were in men.
The earliest recorded date of symptom onset was 25 Sep, and the
latest was 11 Oct 2004 (Figure - To see figure, see original URL).
The incubation period was reported to be 24 hours for 50 percent of
cases, 48 hours for 21 percent, and 72 hours for 29 percent. After
evaluating maximum and minimum incubation period duration and dates
of onset, the period during which the contaminated curd was on sale
was defined as 23 Sep to 8 Oct 2004.
Variables were examined for association with illness in single
variable analysis. Only eating unpasteurized milk curd remained
significantly associated with shigellosis (odds ratio 14.78; 95
percent confidence interval 3.33-65.5; p less than 0.05) No other
food item was positively associated with the disease.
The dairy was licensed to produce unpasteurized milk products and
sold its products at 2 Vilnius markets. During the outbreak
investigation the national food and veterinary service specialists
identified many violations of hygiene and food safety regulations.
The counter at one of the markets where milk products were sold was
found to be contaminated with coliform bacteria.
Bacteriological samples were taken from all persons working in the
dairy. _S. sonnei_ isolates were obtained from dairy owner and 2
members of her household who did not handle food. No pathogenic
bacteria were detected in milk products produced in the dairy.
Control and prevention measures
----------------------------------
The local food and veterinary service in Alytus temporarily closed
the dairy as soon as the unpasteurized milk curd was suspected as a
source of infection.
The national food and veterinary service withdrew the suspect milk
curd from sale in Vilnius. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated from
samples, the owner of the dairy and her 2 household members were
admitted to hospital. After _S. sonnei_ was isolated, the infected
person who worked at one of the 2 markets in Vilnius was instructed
to stay home from work until she had fully recovered. All staff
handling food at the dairy and the markets attended compulsory
hygiene classes. The suspected risk factors were made public through
the media, and the public were recommended to cook unpasteurised milk
products thoroughly before consumption.
Discussion
-----------
The results of the epidemiological investigation concluded that the
shigellosis outbreak in Vilnius was linked to unpasteurized curd that
had been contaminated in a dairy because (1) cases of the same type
of _Shigella sonnei_ were reported only in Vilnius; (2) the milk
curds from the dairy in Alytus were on sale only in Vilnius, from 23
Sep to 8 Oct 2004; (3) all patients had bought the curd from the same
stalls at 1 of 2 markets in Vilnius; and (4) _S. sonnei_ isolates
from patients, dairy staff and market staff were of the same type and
resistant to the same antimicrobial agents.
Shigellosis outbreaks in Lithuania tend to occur within households or
nursery schools, but this outbreak demonstrated that the risk of
shigellosis spread through unpasteurized milk products still
persists. Outbreaks that occur due to the consumption of
unpasteurized milk products are reported every year in Lithuania.
Most of these outbreaks are linked to the consumption of
unpasteurized milk and milk products bought from unlicensed
village-based producers. Unpasteurized milk products are often
bought by old people in Lithuania. Generally, _Shigella sp._ are not
isolated from the milk products that cause outbreaks, and the
outbreak source is detected only by epidemiological investigation methods.
[Some] of the main outbreak control measures [are] food safety and
hygiene training for people handling milk products and
gastrointestinal infectious disease prevention training for the
public. This must involve familiarizing the public with the idea that
[infected persons] must avoid preparing food, and should stay at home
and not attend work or school until symptoms have ended.

[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of
pathogens including _Campylobacter_, _Brucella_, _E. coli_ O157 ,
_Salmonella_ (including multidrug-resistant strains), _Mycobacterium
bovis_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_ (1, 2). Persons who drink
unpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that these
products taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized
products, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions
(3). However, the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk
products have never been validated scientifically (4). The above
pathogens cause zoonoses -- infections spread to humans from animals.
Shigellosis spread by unpasteurized dairy products is not a zoonosis,
except when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk was not
found to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must have occurred
prior to pasteurization.
Individuals with symptomatic shigellosis (bacterial dysentery) are
much less likely to transmit shigellosis by contaminating
unpasteurized milk, as they can be quite ill. The posting does not
comment on symptoms in the dairy and food workers, but their
hospitalization might suggest that they were symptomatic. It is
possible that only one of the workers at the dairy caused the
contamination; or that the others, with the patients and the market
worker, were infected by the contaminated milk.
