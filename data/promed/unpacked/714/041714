An outbreak of valley fever [coccidioidomycosis, caused by inhaling spores of the fungus _Coccidioides immitis_] at 2 California prisons prompted a federal judge on Tuesday [2 Jul 2013] to order the state to relocate thousands of prisoners to other facilities.

State correctional officials have agreed to transport 2600 at risk inmates including all black and Filipino prisoners to other California prisons. Inmates with compromised immunities [such as HIV/AIDS] or of specific heritages are several times more likely to contract the illness.

During the past 3 years, 900 of the 5300 prisoners at California's Pleasant Valley State Prison have contracted the disease. At Avenal prison, just 10 miles [16 km] away, the numbers are similar. Officials report the fungus has played a role in at least 36 prison deaths over the past 6 years.

The evacuations are coming at a time California's 33 adult prisons are at 150 per cent capacity. To make space for the transports, healthy non-black or [non-] Filipino prisoners will be moved to the San Joaquin Valley. Prison officials have voiced concerns that moving prisoners based on race could increase racial tensions and gang violence.

Most people who breathe in the spores develop no symptoms at all. Others, about 40 per cent, develop flu-like symptoms including cough, congestion, fever, fatigue, body aches, and headaches that can last a month or more. Valley fever can lead to severe pneumonia, meningitis, and death.

Cases of valley fever in California have skyrocketed in the past decade, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley. Statewide, reported cases increased 71 per cent from 2001 to 2011.

In 36 years with the Los Angeles police, this sergeant faced many dangerous situations, including one routine call that ended with Uzi fire and a bullet-riddled body sprawled on the living room floor. But his most life-threatening encounter has been with coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever, for which he is being treated [in Bakersfield, California]. Coccidioidomycosis, known as "cocci," is an insidious airborne fungal disease in which microscopic spores in the soil take flight on the wind or even a mild breeze to lodge in the moist habitat of the lungs and, in the most extreme instances, spread to the bones, the skin, the eyes or, in the sergeant's case, the brain.

The infection, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has labeled "a silent epidemic," is striking more people each year, with more than 20 000 reported cases annually throughout the Southwest, especially in California and Arizona. Although most people exposed to the fungus do not fall ill, about 160 die from it each year, with thousands more facing years of disability and surgery. About 9 per cent of those infected will contract pneumonia and 1 per cent will experience serious complications beyond the lungs.

The disease is named for the San Joaquin Valley, a "cocci" hot spot, where the same soil that produces the state's agricultural bounty can turn traitorous. The "silent epidemic" became less silent last week when a federal judge ordered the state to transfer about 2600 vulnerable inmates -- including some with HIV -- out of 2 of the valley's 8 state prisons, about 90 miles [145 km] north of [the city of Bakersfield, California]. In 2011, those prisons, Avenal and Pleasant Valley, produced 535 of the 640 reported inmate "cocci" cases, and throughout the system, yearly costs for hospitalization for "cocci" exceed USD 23 million.

The transfer, affecting about a third of the 2 prisons' combined population, is to be completed in 90 days, a challenge to a prison system already contending with a federal mandate to reduce overcrowding. Advocates for prisoners have criticized state agencies for not moving the inmates sooner. "If this were a factory, a public university or a hotel -- anything except a prison -- they would shut these 2 places down," said Donald Specter, the executive director of the Prison Law Office, which provides free legal assistance to inmates.

The pending transfer has underscored the complexities and mysteries of a disease that continues to baffle physicians and scientists. In Arizona, a study from the Department of Health Services showed a 25 per cent risk of African-Americans with newly diagnosed valley fever developing complications, compared with 6 per cent of whites. "The working hypothesis has to do with genetic susceptibility, probably the interrelationships of genes involved in the immune system," said Dr John N Galgiani, a professor at the University of Arizona and the director of the Valley Fever Center for Excellence, founded in 1996. "But which ones? We're clueless."

Kern County, where Bakersfield is located, had more than 1800 reported cases last year [2012]. At Kern Medical Center, Dr Royce H Johnson and his colleagues have a roster of nearly 2000 patients. Many have life-threatening "cocci" meningitis. The disease has been known to eat away ribs and vertebrae. "It destroys lives," said Dr Johnson, whose daughter contracted a mild form. "Divorces, lost jobs, and bankruptcy are incredibly common, not to mention psychological dislocation."

Dr Benjamin Park, a medical officer with the CDC, said that the numbers of cases are "under-estimates" because some states do not require public reporting. They include Texas, where valley fever is endemic along the Rio Grande. In New Mexico, a 2010 survey of doctors and clinics by the state's public health department revealed that 69 per cent of clinicians did not consider it in patients with respiratory problems.

Numbers spike when rainfall is followed by dry spells. Many scientists believe that the uptick in infections is related to changing climate patterns. Kenneth K Komatsu, the state epidemiologist for Arizona, where 13 000 cases were reported last year [2012], said that another factor may be urban sprawl: "digging up rural areas where valley fever is growing in the soil," he said.

In Avenal, citizens have become activists, looking into possible environmental factors, including a regional landfill that accepts construction waste. Dr McCarty of Children's Hospital is seeing an increasing number of children from Avenal.

Valley fever was a familiar presence during the Dust Bowl, and in Japanese internment camps [during World War II] throughout the arid West. Yet there is still no cure, and research on a fungicide and a potential vaccine have been stalled by financing issues. One company, Nielsen Biosciences Inc., has developed a skin test to identify "cocci" but has not yet been able to make it financially viable.

Part of the difficulty is that "cocci" is "a hundred different diseases," Dr Johnson said, depending on where in the body it nests. His patients include farm workers, oil field workers, and construction workers.

[Coccidioidomycosis is due to inhalation of spores of the fungus, _Coccidioides immitis_, a soil organism, that become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. About 60 per cent of infected people are asymptomatic. The commonest clinical presentation is flu-like illness that is sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath, chest pain, arthralgias, erythema nodosum, or erythema multiforme (acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis), which develops 1-4 weeks after exposure. 95 per cent or more of patients recover without any further sequelae; less than 5 per cent of those infected have progressive pulmonary infection and less than 1 per cent of patients experience disseminated disease, especially to the joints and the central nervous system, such as the meninges.

Risk factors for more severe pulmonary disease include diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of less than USD 15 000 per year, and older age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229838). Risk factors for dissemination include Infection generally imparts immunity to reinfection. Dissemination occurs more frequently in certain ethic groups (persons of African, Filipino, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent), pregnancy, and immunodeficiency, such as that due to AIDS or by immunosuppressive drugs.

Coccidioidomycosis may be associated with certain occupations. For example, clusters of cases occur among those engaged in soil-disrupting activities, such as farming, mining, quarrying, and construction in an endemic area (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/ohb/Documents/OccCocci.pdf). Cases have also occurred among the Southern California prison population. See also a prior ProMED-mail posts Coccidioidomycosis - USA (05): (CA) builders 20130503.1688449 and Coccidioidomycosis - USA (04): (CA) prison, fatal 20130502.1685779.

Factors accounting for rising disease incidence in California and Arizona include climate change, new construction, and an influx into the endemic region of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic, such as military recruits onto training bases in Southern California. Especially problematic is the influx of those at higher risk of developing severe symptomatic illness such as elderly people who go to live in Arizona retirement communities, and prisoners from urban ghettos where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (Ampel NM: What's behind the increasing rates of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California? Curr Infect Dis Rep. 2010; 12(3): 211-6 DOI 10.1007/s11908-010-0094-3; abstract available at http://pubget.com/paper/21308532/What_s_Behind_the_Increasing_Rates_of_Coccidioidomycosis_in_Arizona_and_California). Many of the prisoners are likely to be African American men, who represent a disproportionate portion of the California prison population.

The California counties of Kern, Kings, Tulare, Fresno, Madera, and San Luis Obispo are the _Coccidioides_-endemic areas; these counties had the highest annual average incidence rates for coccidioidomycosis, and their cumulative cases represent 76 per cent of all cases reported from California for years 2001-2009 (see figure 9 at https://www.vfce.arizona.edu/resources/pdf/2011_coccidioidomycosis_epi.pdf).

Bakersfield is a city 110 miles (180 km) to the north Los Angeles near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley in Kern County, California (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California). A California county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/california.shtml.
