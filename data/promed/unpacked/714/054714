Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and
is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks
(_Ixodes_ spp.). Early manifestations of infection include fever,
headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema
migrans. Left untreated, late manifestations involving the joints,
heart, and nervous system can occur. A 'Healthy People 2010'
objective (14-8) is to reduce the annual incidence of Lyme disease to
9.7 new cases per 100 000 population in 10 reference states where the
disease is endemic (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and
Wisconsin) (1). This report summarizes surveillance data for 64 382
Lyme disease cases reported to CDC (US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention) during 2003-2005, of which 59 770 cases (93 percent)
were reported from the 10 reference states. The average annual rate
in these 10 reference states for the 3-year period (29.2 cases per
100 000 population) was approximately 3 times the 'Healthy People
2010' target. Persons living in Lyme disease -- endemic areas can
take steps to reduce their risk for infection, including daily
self-examination for ticks, selective use of acaricides and tick
repellents, use of landscaping practices that reduce tick populations
in yards and play areas, and avoidance of tick-infested areas.
For surveillance purposes, a reportable case of Lyme disease is defined as
1. physician-diagnosed erythema migrans equal to or greater than 5 cm
[about 2 in] in diameter or
2. at least one objective late manifestation (that is,
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological) with laboratory
evidence of infection with _B. burgdorferi_ in a person with possible
exposure to infected ticks (2).
This surveillance case definition was developed for national
reporting of Lyme disease; it is not intended to be used in clinical
diagnosis (2). For this report, annual Lyme disease rates in 2003,
2004, and 2005 were calculated by county, state, and age group, using
reported cases and midyear U.S. Census population estimates for each
year. To limit reporting bias, analysis of symptom data was
restricted to 6 of the 10 reference states where 90 percent or more
records included symptom information.
During 2003-2005, CDC received reports of 64 382 Lyme disease cases
from 46 states and the District of Columbia; 93 percent of cases
occurred among residents of the 10 'Healthy People 2010' reference
states (Table, Figure 1) [for figure, see original URL. - Mod.ML].
The average annual rate in these 10 reference states for the 3-year
period was 29.2 cases per 100 000 population: 29.1 in 2003, 26.8 in
2004, and 31.6 in 2005. During 2003-2005, 3 counties had annual rates
above 300 cases per 100 000 population in all 3 years: Columbia and
Dutchess counties in New York and Dukes County in Massachusetts.
Information on patient age and sex was available for 62 206 (97
percent) of reported cases. Median age of patients was 41 years, and
patient ages followed a bimodal distribution (Figure 2). Males
accounted for 54 percent of reported cases overall and 61 percent of
cases among children aged 5-14 years. Records for 31 961 (50 percent)
cases specified the race of the patient; 97 percent were identified
as white, 2 percent as black, and less than 1 percent as
Asian/Pacific Islander or American Indian/Alaska Native.
Reported date of illness onset was available for 49 157 (76 percent)
case reports during 2003-2005. Patients were most likely to have
illness onset in May (7 percent), June (25 percent), July (29
percent), or August (13 percent); fewer than 8 percent were reported
with illness onset during the period December-March. Records for 32
095 (50 percent) patients met the criteria for evaluation of
symptoms. A history of erythema migrans was reported for 70 percent
of these patients, arthritis for 30 percent, facial palsy for 8
percent, radiculopathy for 3 percent, meningitis or encephalitis for
2 percent, and heart block for less than 1 percent.

Editorial note
--------------
With approximately 20 000 new cases reported each year, Lyme disease
is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Cases
occur most commonly in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central
states and among persons aged 5-14 years and 45-54 years. Cases peak
during summer months, reflecting transmission by nymphal vector ticks
during May and June.
Since Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991, the annual
number of reported cases has more than doubled. This increase likely
is the result of several factors, including a true increase in
disease incidence and enhanced case detection resulting from
implementation of laboratory-based surveillance in several states.
The growing number of case reports and the labor required for
confirmation of laboratory-reported cases has placed considerable
burden on local and state health departments in areas where Lyme
disease is endemic. To address this surveillance burden and create
more sustainable Lyme disease surveillance systems, some states have
modified components of their systems, leading to acute reductions in
reported cases (3). However, no evidence exists to suggest a true
decrease in Lyme disease incidence in these states.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations:
1. Lyme disease surveillance is complicated by both underreporting
and overdiagnosis of cases (4,5).
2. differences in patient demographics (such as, age and sex) among
states with above-average and below-average incidence suggest
variation in diagnostic and reporting practices among states (6).
3. clinical information on symptoms is not verified independently and
often is incomplete.
The 'Healthy People 2010' target (1) was derived from a baseline of
17.4 cases per 100 000 population reported to CDC during 1992-1996
and was established in anticipation of widespread use of a Lyme
disease vaccine, licensed in 1999. However, the vaccine was withdrawn
from the market in 2002, reportedly because of poor sales (7).
Although no Lyme disease vaccine is available, persons can lower
their risk for the disease and other tickborne illnesses by avoiding
tick-infested areas when possible, using insect repellents containing
DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), and performing daily self-examination
for ticks (7). In North America, removing ticks within 24 hours of
attachment reduces the likelihood of _B. burgdorferi_ transmission
(8). Tick populations around homes and in recreational areas can be
reduced 50 to 90 percent through simple landscaping practices such as
removing brush and leaf litter or creating a buffer zone of wood
chips or gravel between forest and lawn or recreational areas. For
persons who are infected, prompt diagnosis and treatment are
important to prevent serious illness and long-term complications
(9,10). Detailed information regarding Lyme disease prevention is

[The diagnosis of Lyme diseases relies on both clinical and laboratory
findings. For surveillance purposes, the CDC defines a reportable case
of Lyme disease as
1. physician-diagnosed erythema migrans equal to or greater than 5 cm
[about 2 in] in diameter or
2. at least one objective late manifestation (that is,
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological) with laboratory
evidence of infection with _B. burgdorferi_ in a person with possible
exposure to infected ticks.
The CDC report suggests that some of the increase in annual number of
reported cases is due to a true increase in disease incidence and
better case detection resulting from implementation of
laboratory-based surveillance. However, differences in patient
demographics reported by CDC among states with above-average and
below-average incidence also suggest variable diagnostic and reporting
practices among states (CDC. Lyme Disease-United States, 2001-2002.
MMWR 2004; 53: 365-9).
Inappropriate serologic testing is frequently performed in patients
without clinical indications of Lyme disease (Nachamkin I, et al:
Utilization of tests for Lyme disease antibody at a university
hospital. Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 1996; 3: 287-9, available at
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=170332&blobtype=pdf>).
Over-reliance on serologic tests, with reported specificities that
range from about 70 to 100 percent, in patients with vague,
non-specific symptoms, can result in over-diagnosis (Schoen RT, Reid
MC: Overdiagnosis of Lyme disease. Ann Intern Med 1998; 129:752-3).
