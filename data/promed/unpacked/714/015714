Mexican Authorities Aim to Halt Bird-flu By Killing 3.8 Million Chicken
---------------------
Around 3.8 million chickens have been slaughtered as part of the effort to contain a bird-flu outbreak in the western state of Jalisco, Mexico's Senasica food safety agency said.

More than 9.3 million other birds remain under observation, the agency said. The virus was detected at 33 of the 253 Jalisco chicken farms inspected by Senasica and 82 were found to be free of bird flu, while "diagnostic processes continue" at the other 138 facilities.

Senasica said it has also begun to look at farms outside the 2 municipalities where the bird flu outbreak was detected last month [June 2012]. Avimex, Iasa and Ceva are producing 80 million doses of bird-flu vaccine that "will be available at the end of this month [July 2012]," Senasica said.

The outbreak claimed 2.5 million chickens in the 1st 3 weeks and generated [USD] 50 million in losses, a representative of the Mexican poultry sector told Efe last week.

Around 32 000 jobs could be lost if the virus is not immediately brought under control, according to Ricardo Estrada, president of the Poultry Farmers Association in Tepatitlan, Jalisco, one of the affected municipalities.

[This is a tremendous loss for the agricultural sector of Mexico. They are no doubt anxiously awaiting the vaccine. The vaccine is coming from Pakistan and China.

Looking broader than the immediate is a wise move to protect the remaining industry.
