4 Primary Students Infected by Unknown Virus in Tainan Area.
1 Dies, 1 in Grave Condition
----------------------------
Taiwanese media reports that 4 primary students with symptoms of mild
cold deteriorated within one day after seeking treatment. They are
suspected to be infected with an unknown pathogen. One has died.

Reports say that the 4 sick children 1st had mild colds, but sharply
deteriorated within one day. Among them one girl could not be saved
and another child is in grave condition. The hospital has ruled out
influenza and gastrointestinal pathogens. Acute encephalitis caused
by an unknown pathogen is suspected. The remains of the deceased have
been sent to Taiwan CDC for analysis.

The hospital stated that the patient's brain, liver, heart and
hematopoietic function were affected by the pathogen. Encephalitis
was determined to be the cause of death. But exactly what pathogen
caused this illness will not be announced for at least 2 weeks.

Vice Director of Taiwan CDC, Zhou Zhihao, said that these are isolated
cases and whether they are caused by a microorganism or pathogen
cannot be quickly determined.

9-year-old child died of suspected acute encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------------
In the Tainan region [of the country] a 9-year-old girl presented with
cough and symptoms of abdominal discomfort, influenza was suspected
and she was sent to the clinics for treatment. In the span of one
week she was comatose; at the same time, there are other children
presenting with similar symptoms that were admitted to the ICU
[intensive care unit] for treatment. According to the Taiwan CDC,
encephalitis is suspected, but confirmation of the etiologic agent is
still pending. Active surveillance in Tainan cities and counties
revealed one death and a 2nd serious case admitted to the ICU.
According to the CDC, the disease progresses rapidly, influenza virus
infection has been ruled out [by PCR according to another newswire
<http://www.udn.com/2009/1/23/NEWS/HEALTH/HEA1/4705049.shtml> -
Mod.MPP], as well as enterovirus infection. Jih-Haw Chou, the Deputy
Director of the CDC said: "the 9-year-old girl was admitted to the
hospital on 15 Jan 2009 with a complaint of abdominal discomfort, and
rapidly deteriorated."

The 9-year-old girl initially presented [at home] with a mild cough
and other respiratory discomfort symptoms; when abdominal discomfort
with vomiting began she was taken to a clinic and in less than 24
hours she was comatose, and was transferred to a large medical center
and died 2 days after admission to this larger medical center.

At present, the virus [presumed etiologic agent] has not been
identified, but patients demonstrate brain, liver, heart and
hematopoietic involvement. Specimens have been taken and results are
expected to take at least 2 weeks. According to Jih-Haw Chou: "the 2
cases were living in different regions and there is no [connection]
between them, so [we do not consider these 2 cases to be a common
cluster]".

[According to the newswire reports on these cases, there seems to be a
presumed viral illness with multiorgan involvement (respiratory
presentation, gastrointestinal with hepatic involvement, cardiac
involvement and encephalitis), with laboratory tests ruling out
influenza and enteroviral etiologies. In addition, according to the
1st newswire, there have been 4 children presenting with this clinical
picture, including one who died. In the 2nd newswire there is mention
of 1 death and another in serious condition in an intensive care unit.
Without specific details on the types of the multiorgan disfunction
(such as type of hepatic and cardiac manifestations), it is difficult
to narrow down a differential diagnosis with any degree of confidence.
That being said, according to a recent report from the Taiwan CDC,
there were 7 cases of enterovirus 71 infection diagnosed in Taiwan in
December 2008 -- an unusual occurrence for that time of year (see
Enterovirus 71 - Taiwan 20090118.0223)

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more information from
knowledgeable individuals in the region.
