An outbreak of scabies has spread through the Hospital Sant Joan de Reus, affecting, for the moment, 22 emergency service workers, including nurses, aides, and doctors. The figure was confirmed yesterday [18 Jan 2018] from the hospital center management after ensuring that all those affected had already received the corresponding treatment and were working normally.

They also highlighted that pertinent measures have been taken to avoid new cases by intensifying hygiene in the common areas of emergency personnel and of their work clothes, the main means of transmission of the disease.

The director of the hospital, Ascar Ros, said that an outbreak of scabies of the magnitude that affects Reus "is out of the ordinary" and also wanted to make it clear that there is no danger to patients.

"It is not a serious illness. In addition, at the time of receiving the treatment, the carrier stops transmitting the parasite and ceases to be contagious." Due to the incubation period of scabies, which is 3-4 weeks, it is not ruled out that new cases may appear.

The hospital management say that they have no knowledge of any infested patient.

The management of the hospital sent, on Wednesday [17 Jan 2018] afternoon, a statement to the health care staff in which they gave recommendations to health workers and explained the infection in detail. In this statement, only those affected clinically and their families had to take the treatment. Some of the recommendations and measures were cleaning material and furniture, changing uniforms daily, not sharing gowns, cleaning hands systematically, wearing gloves, and not touching the computer with gloves, among other measures.

The provincial deputy director of Public Health of Tarragona, Conrad Casas, declared yesterday [18 Jan 2018] that the appropriate protocol had been activated before the appearance of an outbreak, and that, in the coming days, it is expected to close the investigation and to determine its origin. Casas also wanted to make it clear that "we are not in an emergency situation or an epidemic." It should be noted that, in Catalonia, outbreaks of scabies with 2 or more cases must be declared compulsorily to the Public Health Agency.

The Hospital Sant Joan reported yesterday [18 Jan 2018] that the 1st case of scabies was known on 12 Jan 2018, a date that generates controversy. The workers consulted said that the focus of the infection was a patient who entered the hospital in December 2017. The doctors diagnosed the disease and treated him. But it seems that the mite was in the hospital center.

After a few weeks, some cases of scabies began to appear among the health personnel. "The Health Surveillance service of the Sant Joan de Reus Hospital did not recognize scabies," one of the workers said yesterday [18 Jan 2018].

[Scabies is rare but is found, especially, in nursing homes, as seen from the ProMED reports below. It is difficult to identify patients, and when the diagnosis become apparent, the infection has usually spread. Treatment is done with permethrin- or deltamethrin-containing ointments or, more easily, with oral ivermectin. - Mod.EP
