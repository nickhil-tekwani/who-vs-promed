Tick-borne diseases in the USA in perspective
---------------------------------------------
Although Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease are better
known to the lay public, the list of additional tick-borne diseases
has grown in recent years. The incidence of Lyme disease in the
United States is greater than 5-fold that of all other tick-borne
infections combined (see graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Tick-US.JPG>)
If we eliminate Lyme disease, we find that tularemia was the most
common disease in this group until 1965, but has since been
superseded by Rocky Mountain spotted fever -- and more recently
Ehrlichiosis -- (see graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Tick-Nolyme.JPG>.
Most significantly, although deaths due to other tick-borne diseases
have declined in recent years, the number dying from tularemia has
remained surprisingly constant for over 4 decades (see graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/tularemia-deaths.jpg>.

[Steve Berger is thanked for his input. Ticks are obligate
bloodsuckers, and are common vectors for human diseases due to a large
variety of pathogens that include gram-negative bacilli, spirochetes,
rickettsiae, protozoans, and viruses, as well as toxins. Ticks wait on
low-lying vegetation (a process called questing) for a susceptible
host on which they can attach and feed. A single tick bite can
transmit more than one pathogen. Both hard ticks (_Dermacentor_ spp.
such as wood and dog ticks, _Amblyomma_ spp. such as the Lone Star
tick, and _Ixodes_ spp. such as the black-legged deer tick) and soft
ticks (_Ornithodoros_ spp.) can be vectors. Soft ticks feast on a
blood for only short periods (less than 1 h), and disease can be
transmitted in less than 1 minute; hard ticks take days.
In North America, ticks transmit
- Lyme disease (_Ixodes_),
- human granulocytic and monocytic ehrlichiosis (_Ixodes_, _ Amblyomma_),
- babesiosis (_Ixodes_),
- relapsing fever (_Ornithodoros_),
-Rocky Mountain spotted fever (_Dermacentor_, _Amblyomma_),
- Colorado tick fever (_Dermacentor_),
- tularemia (_Dermacentor_, _Amblyomma_),
- Southern tick-associated rash illness (_Amblyomma_), and
- tick paralysis (_Dermacentor_, _Amblyomma_).
A brief glance at recent ProMED-mail posts reveals that Europe, the
Middle East and undoubtedly the rest of the world are similarly
plagued by tick-borne
diseases. - Mod.ML]
