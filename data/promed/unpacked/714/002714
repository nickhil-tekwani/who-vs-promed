PLoS Negl Trop Dis 9(4): e0003455. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003455; http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003455

Abstract
-------
Emerging _Bacillus cereus_ strains that cause anthrax-like disease have been isolated in Cameroon (CA strain) and Côte d'Ivoire (CI strain). These strains are unusual, because their genomic characterisation shows that they belong to the _B. cereus_ species, although they harbour 2 plasmids, pBCXO1 and pBCXO2, that are highly similar to the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids of _B. anthracis_ that encode the toxins and the polyglutamate capsule respectively. The virulence factors implicated in the pathogenicity of these _B. cereus_ bv _anthracis_ strains remain to be characterised. We tested their virulence by cutaneous and intranasal delivery in mice and guinea pigs; they were as virulent as wild-type _B. anthracis_. Unlike as described for pXO2-cured _B. anthracis_, the CA strain cured of the pBCXO2 plasmid was still highly virulent, showing the existence of other virulence factors. Indeed, these strains concomitantly expressed a hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule and the _B. anthracis_ polyglutamate (PDGA) capsule. The HA capsule was encoded by the hasACB operon on pBCXO1, and its expression was regulated by the global transcription regulator AtxA, which controls anthrax toxins and PDGA capsule in _B. anthracis_. Thus, the HA and PDGA capsules and toxins were co-regulated by AtxA. We explored the respective effect of the virulence factors on colonisation and dissemination of CA within its host by constructing bioluminescent mutants. Expression of the HA capsule by itself led to local multiplication and, during intranasal infection, to local dissemination to the adjacent brain tissue. Co-expression of either toxins or PDGA capsule with HA capsule enabled systemic dissemination, thus providing a clear evolutionary advantage. Protection against infection by _B. cereus_ bv _anthracis_ required the same vaccination formulation as that used against _B. anthracis_. Thus, these strains, at the frontier between _B. anthracis_ and _B. cereus_, provide insight into how the monomorphic _B. anthracis_ may have emerged.

Author summary
--------------
Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ that affects all mammals worldwide. It emerged more than 10 000 years ago from a _Bacillus cereus_ precursor. In the past decade, _B. cereus_ bacteria were isolated in the USA from anthrax-like pneumonia cases. They harbour one virulence plasmid very similar to the toxin-encoding plasmid of _B. anthracis_. Recently, an anthrax-like disease in great apes in Africa was caused by emerging _B. cereus_ strains, named _B. cereus_ biovar anthracis. These strains are atypical as they possess both plasmids coding for toxin and capsule similar to those so far found only in _B. anthracis_. These unusual pathogenic _B. cereus_ are currently neglected. We explored the virulence of these pathogens and their colonisation and dissemination capacity within the murine host. We found that these toxinogenic strains harbour 2 capsules, the classical _B. anthracis_ capsule and an additional polysaccharidic capsule. This latter capsule confers virulence alone or in combination with toxins. Both capsules are concomitantly expressed, under the control of a common global regulator and host signals. Our results show that acquisition of new genetic information by these _B. cereus_ clearly gives them a selective advantage, favouring their dissemination within infected hosts and the environment.

[The complete sequences of both the plasmids from strain _B. cereus_ biovar _anthracis_ Côte d'Ivoire (CI) are available on the Genbank link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/plasmids/157.

According to Christophe Brézillon et al, Sterne vaccine should provide protection, though it is also clear that the Côte d'Ivoire strain has additional virulence factors. Clearly, there is still much to be learnt from these West African _B. cereus_ strains and others as they emerge. As the authors state: _B. anthracis_ is thought to have evolved as a monomorphic lineage within the _B. cereus_ group, with a strict co-evolution between the chromosome and the 2 plasmids pXO1 and pXO2. The _B. cereus_ bv _anthracis_ CA and CI strains may be considered as a new lineage among the _B. cereus_ group that appeared through an ongoing co-evolution process similar to the emergence of _B. anthracis_ during the holocene. It is tempting to speculate that pBCXO1 is an ancestor of the _B. anthracis_ pXO1, which further evolved with pXO2 and the chromosomal genetic background.
