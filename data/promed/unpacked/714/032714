A fresh bird flu case was detected in Myanmar's eastern Shan state
and confirmed on Thursday [27 Dec 2007] following an unusual death of
domestic chickens in Yankham village in the state's Mongphyat
township in the last week-end, according to a statement of the
Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department Saturday [29 Dec 2007].

The unusual death of chickens started from 23 Dec 2007 and after
laboratory tests, H5N1 was detected and further confirmed on
Thursday, the statement said.

The authorities assessed that the H5N1 was spread to the area from
the same state's Kengtung township where bird flu broke out on 18
Nov, infecting a 7-year-old girl.

Preventive measures are being taken under the bird flu control
program which include setting up of restricted zones and control
zones, culling of poultry in these zones, disinfecting, banning of
the marketing of chickens in the township and enhancing of
bio-security, the statement said.

Human infection of bird flu in Myanmar was first officially reported
on 15 Dec 2007 to the public after a bird-flu-infected girl had been
discharged from a local hospital in Kengtung on 12 Dec 2007 after treatment.

H5N1 virus was detected on some chickens and ducks of local species
which died unusually at the village farm in Kengtung on 18 Nov 2007.

In its prevention and control measures, the local authorities culled
14 889 chickens, ducks, geese and Muscovy ducks within a week after
such unusual deaths were found on the fowls traded in the area.

Bird flu infects Bangladesh farm, chickens culled
-----------------------------------------------------
Nearly 2000 chickens have been culled in a village in northern
Bangladesh after the H5N1 bird flu virus was detected at a poultry
farm, officials said on Friday [28 Dec 2007].

The latest infection was detected in Dinajpur district, 420 km (260
miles) from the capital Dhaka, a senior official of Fisheries and
Livestock Ministry said.

Bird flu was first detected near the capital in March 2007 and has
since spread mainly to northern districts and forced authorities to
cull about 275 000 chickens and destroy nearly 3 million eggs.

About 4 million Bangladeshis are directly or indirectly associated
with poultry farming, but so far there have been no cases of human
infection, government and health officials say.
