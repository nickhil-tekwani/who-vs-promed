[Algeria has had intermittent outbreaks of bluetongue since the
revision of the WAHID database in 2005, a year in which outbreaks of
bluetongue were not recorded in Algeria. In 2006, there were 29
outbreaks in July and August. 2007 was again a year with no outbreaks.
In 2008, the number of outbreaks was reduced, but there were still 6
outbreaks of bluetongue in October and November 2008. In 2009, the
strain was BT-1, and the number of outbreaks totaled 19, occurring
between August and November 2009. 2010 was indeed a very bad year with
46 cases of BT-4 between August and November 2010. We are fairly far
into the bluetongue season in this part of the world, and this is our
1st report in Algeria.

Details such as the strain of bluetongue virus and also the diagnostic
test reports by herd for initial cases would be valuable information
for ProMED-mail to post. - Mod.PC]
