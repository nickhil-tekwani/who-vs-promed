Equine influenza, Argentina
---------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 5 Apr 2018 from Dr Ricardo Alfredo Maresca, Director Nacional de Sanidad Animal , Sanidad Animal, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASA), Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 20 Mar 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 20 Mar 2018
Reason for notification: unexpected change in the distribution or increase in morbidity or mortality of a listed disease
Summary description: On March 20th, an outbreak was detected in the hippodrome of the city of Mendoza (province of Mendoza), with a morbidity rate close to 70 percent. Later on, similar outbreaks were registered in the hippodromes of San Isidro, La Plata (Buenos Aires), Palermo (Buenos Aires) and Trelew (Chubut). An outbreak was also registered in Barreal (San Juan).
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Equine influenza virus
Serotype: Not typed
This event pertains to the whole country.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Legal movement of animals, contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering
Epidemiological comments: According to the investigation carried out after the 1st case was registered in Mendoza, a link was identified with the cases that occurred at the beginning of March 2018 in the locality neighboring El Barreal, in the province of San Juan. The contact of equines (mules and horses) with animals from Chile is frequent there during the moves to summer pastures that happen in areas of the Andes Mountains. The temporary association with the ongoing event in this country since January 2018 could suggest an epidemiological relation between both.

Disease Impact
Increased / Province / Specie / Change
Morbidity / Buenos Aires / Equidae / 1 equal or more than 3
Morbidity / Chubut / Equidae / 1 equal or more than 3
Morbidity / San Juan / Equidae / 1 equal or more than 2
Morbidity / Mendoza / Equidae / 1 equal or more than 4

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Directorate of laboratories and technical controls (SENASA) (National laboratory) / Equidae / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)/ 23 Mar 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the Argentine epidemiological comment: "The contact of equines (mules and horses) with animals from Chile is frequent there during the moves to summer pastures that happen in areas of the Andes Mountains. The temporary association with the ongoing event in this country since January 2018 could suggest an epidemiological relation between both".

In January 2018, Chile reported Equine Influenza subtype H3N8 to the OIE. The reason for reporting that event was due to an unexpected change in the distribution or increase in morbidity or mortality of a listed disease. According to the Chile's last follow-up report dated 21 Mar 2018 "To this day, there is a confirmation of the disease for 12 regions out of the 15 of the country for the equine population and for 2 regions for the donkey population (Atacama and Valparaiso). The domestic and feral donkeys in contact with infected equines have shown the clinical signs of the disease, including mortality in some cases." See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=26227

"Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi2) of influenza A virus within the genus Influenzavirus A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s. Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts.

"Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations. In recent years, infection has been introduced into Australia and re-introduced into South Africa and Japan; to date New Zealand and Iceland are reported to be free of equine influenza virus.

"While normally confined to equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of) 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs."
