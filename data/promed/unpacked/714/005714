BTV serotype 8 - further to the submission by Rudy Meiswinkel
-------------------------------------------------------------
Several recent publications have clearly documented the occurrence of
vertical transmission of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 8 amongst
naturally infected ruminants in northern Europe, and associated
developmental (teratogenic) defects of cattle infected in early
gestation. The propensity of the strain of BTV serotype 8 currently
circulating in Europe to cross the ruminant placenta starkly
contrasts with the vast majority of other field strains of BTV,
including the 5 serotypes that already circulate elsewhere in Europe.

Indeed, transplacental transmission of BTV in ruminants is a
characteristic of certain laboratory strains of the virus modified by
growth in cell culture or in embryonated eggs (such as certain
modified live vaccine strains). Although several investigators have
recently proposed congenital infection of ruminants as a means of
"over-wintering" of BTV, convincing evidence still is lacking.

Importantly, the seasonality of BTV serotype 8 in northern Europe
appears to be similar to that in other temperate areas where
congenital BTV infections either are undocumented or extremely rare
(such as much of North America). Furthermore, BTV largely
"disappears" for perhaps 6 months of each year in temperate regions
(approximately December to July in the Northern Hemisphere) [a very
similar pattern is prevailing in the Middle East, e.g., Israel. -
Mod.AS] which also is difficult to reconcile with a strict
requirement for vertical infection of ruminants given that fetuses
infected in early gestation are born with abnormalities incompatible
with life, and studies to date have shown only transient post-natal
infection of animals infected in late gestation.

In summary, although the striking incidence of vertical transmission
of BTV-8 in northern Europe's ruminants is highly significant as it
raises many questions about the origin of the virus, its potential
route of introduction, and its potential for spread in bovine
products (including to carnivores), however essential features of its
life cycle including inter-seasonality of infection are yet to be
proven different from those of the myriad other strains of BTV that
occur throughout much of the world -- and these strains have
persisted throughout history despite the fact that they appear to
rarely, if ever, cross the ruminant placenta.

[The above comments, from a prominent authority on bluetongue, are a
valuable and much appreciated contribution to the ongoing discussion
on the unusual epidemiology and pathogenicity of BTV-8 in Europe.

Prof MacLachlan's remark on "transplacental transmission of BTV in
ruminants being a characteristic of certain laboratory strains of the
virus modified by growth in cell culture or in embryonated eggs (such
as certain modified live vaccine strains), and in contrast with the
vast majority of other field strains of BTV, including the 5
serotypes that already circulate elsewhere in Europe", deserve
particular attention.

It is worthwhile mentioning that in addition to the 5 serotypes known
to have circulated in south Europe, namely BTV 1,2,4,9 and 16, a 6th
serotype was suspected to have circulated in a south-European
country, namely serotype 8 in Bulgaria. According to information from
the Community Reference Laboratory for BTV at IAH Pirbright, 5 serum
samples (2 calves, 2 goats, and one sheep) from the Bourgas province
(SE Bulgaria, near the Black Sea), received on 27 Oct 2006 from the
Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI), Sofia, Bulgaria, were
confirmed as positive for BTV-specific antibodies by cELISA. A 2nd
consignment, including serum samples from 4 sentinel calves in the
same region, was received on 6 Nov 2006; BTV-specific neutralizing
antibodies for BTV-8 were detected in 3 of the 4 serum samples
(confirmed in repeated assays); no significant neutralisation was
detected against the other BTV serotypes and no virus could be
isolated from any of the received samples. Additional samples were
requested. For the full report see posting 20061124.3347.

According to a recent (Apr 2008) paper, the presence of BTV serotype
8 in the Bulgarian animals "cannot yet be confirmed" (ref 1).

Interestingly, Bulgaria carried out vaccinations following its 1st
outbreak of bluetongue, which occurred in 1999 in the Province of
Bourgas. According to Bulgaria's report to the OIE, 6853 sheep were
vaccinated during 1999; vaccination was carried out in 2000 as well,
involving 56 293 sheep. It will be interesting to note if the
vaccine used could have been the (at the said time, the only
available) South-African (Onderstepoort) live attenuated Bluetongue
Vaccine. If this was the case, the attenuated BTV-8 strain
(Camp/8438, origin RSA, 1937) could have been introduced, since the
South African live attenuated BTV-9 is included in a pentavalent
vaccine, with serotypes 3, 8, 10 and 11.

Are final conclusions on the suspected 2006 BTV-8 event in Bulgaria
obtainable? - Mod.AS]
