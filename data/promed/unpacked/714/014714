Locally acquired dengue fever - Hong Kong
----------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) and the Food & Environmental
Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (7 Oct 2003) urged members
of the public to take vigorous preventive measures against
mosquito breeding following the confirmation of the first local case
of dengue fever this year [2003].
Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Consultant
(Community Medicine) of DH's Disease Prevention and Control
Division, Dr Thomas Tsang, said the case involved a 26-year-old
man who had onset of disease on 27 Sep 2003. Clinical symptoms
included fever, headache, muscle pain, and skin rash.
The patient consulted a private doctor on 30 Sep 2003 and was
admitted to Yan Chai Hospital on 2 Oct 2003. Blood test taken at
Yan Chai Hospital was subsequently confirmed positive for dengue
fever by DH's Public Health Laboratory Center. The patient is now
convalescing at home.
"As the patient had not traveled outside Hong Kong during the
incubation period which lasts from 3 to 14 days, this has been
classified as a confirmed local case. The patient's family and
workplace contacts who have been traced by DH are found to be
asymptomatic. However, as a precautionary measure, we have put
them under close medical surveillance," Dr Tsang said.
As part of the preventive measures, staff of DH and FEHD visited
the patient's residence in Yuen Kong Village, Yuen Long, as well as
his workplace at Kwai Chung Container Terminal today for
epidemiological survey and comprehensive mosquito control action.
The DH has set up a special hotline 2961 8966 for case finding,
health advice\, and counseling. Persons who had stayed or visited
Yuen Kong Village in Yuen Long and Kwai Chung Container
Terminal on or after 15 Aug 2003 and who developed dengue fever
symptoms within 14 days afterwards after the visit are advised to
call the special hotline. Dengue fever symptoms may include fever,
headache, muscle pain, and skin rashes. The hotline is manned by
health nurses and it starts operation this afternoon until 9 pm today.
It will be manned from 9am to 5 pm from tomorrow onward until
further notice.
Anti-mosquito messages in multiple languages, including Japanese,
Filipino, Indonesian, Thai, Sri Lankan, Nepali, and Pakistani were
uploaded onto the FEHD's website <http://www.fehd.gov.hk> to
ensure that minority groups were taken care of in the dengue
prevention programme.
Information on dengue fever is available at DH website
<http://www.dh.gov.hk/> and information on mosquito control at
FEHD website <http://www.fehd.gov.hk/>. Members of the public
can also call the hotline of DH's Central Health Education Unit
2833 0111 to obtain health advice on the disease.
A total of 42 confirmed cases of dengue fever has been reported in
Hong Kong so far in 2003. Of these, 41 were imported cases and
one [is this] local case.

[Dengue vector mosquitoes have been caught flying out of
containers opened in North Australia coming from dengue-endemic
East Timor, and found in the USA in a container from China (see
ProMED post "Mosquito transport in goods shipments,"
20021008.5502. So the case's employment at the Container
Terminal may have resulted in his infection by an imported,
container-borne mosquito -- although a report from another source
submitted by Dan Silver states that the case reported being bitten
at home. - Mod.JW]

Dengue fever affects 12 000 in Costa Rica
---------------------------------------------------
The number of people affected by the dengue fever in Costa Rica
rose to 12 000, and 38 of the victims were hit by the hemorrhagic
type, the Health Ministry reported on Saturday.
The northern Costa Rican region of Chorotega is the most
affected, with a total of 4338 cases, followed by the region of
Central Pacific, where 3648 people have suffered from the
disease, the report said.
The epidemic continued to rage along the Caribbean coast of the
country in the past few weeks, and 2353 cases have been reported
there by Friday. "All this shows us that the problem does not end,
so we must not lower our guard," said Public Health Minister Maria
del Rocio Saenz. "Let's be clear and reiterate that this is not over
yet, as there remain 3 hard weeks ahead with more heavy rain and
the subsequent development of mosquitoes," said the minister.
The dengue virus returned to Costa Rica in 1993. Cases reported
in 1994 and 1997 were 13 929 and 14 421, respectively.

Salvadorean Health Minister Herbert Betancourt issued a
nationwide alert on Friday in response to a new outbreak of classic
and hemorrhagic dengue.
Since January [2003], 1365 cases of the classic variety of the
disease have been reported in El Salvador and 75 of the potentially
deadly DHF, which has already taken the lives of 4 people,
Betancourt said. In 2002, El Salvador experienced a dengue fever
epidemic that killed 10 people after infecting a [reported] total of
4780.

of the patients -- children between the ages of 3 and 11 -- have
been admitted, told reporters that "the epidemic is spreading."
Cruz said that so far 5 people have died of hemorrhagic dengue
fever. The latest, on Thursday, was the wife of the former head of
the Permanent Commission for Contingencies (COPECO). Cruz
said all the patients are from communities near San Pedro Sula.
Health authorities say more than 2300 cases of classic dengue
fever have been reported so far in 2003, a 70 percent drop from
2002.

Acting City Mayor Nilo G. Abellera has expressed alarm over the
increasing number of dengue cases in Davao city. Abellera cited
reports from the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU),
which monitored 1986 dengue fever cases in the region. The
number reflects an increase of 52 percent in cases compared to
the same period last year [2002]. "This is very alarming, the public
should be aware, not only of the disease but also of the many ways
it can be avoided by practicing cleanliness in our surroundings," he
said.
Talomo district recorded 341 dengue cases followed by Buhangin,
314; Poblacion, 195; Toril, 169; Agdao, 130; Bunawan, 106;
Calinan, 34; Baguio, 7 ; & Paquibato with 5 dengue cases
recorded by DOH XI.
In Cebu, the Department of Health in Region 7 recorded some 327
new cases of dengue fever, as it expressed alarm over the
clustering of new cases in the municipalities across Cebu province.
Records of the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit
(RESU) showed that municipalities that had fewer than 3 dengue
cases in the past months had 10 to 13 cases in September [2003].
Municipalities that have more than 10 or more new cases in
September alone include Bogo, Carcar, Daanbantayan, Minglanilla,
and Naga.
The 327 new cases from 1 Sep -1 Oct 2003 bring to 2120 the total
number of dengue cases so far in 2003, 32 of which have resulted
in deaths. RESU recorded a total of 171 cases between 13 Jul and
10 Aug this year [2003]. For September [2003] alone, 4 deaths
were recorded in Cebu Province. Cebu City also recorded a total
of 11 deaths so far this year [2003].
The number in the municipalities has been increasing and had
already exceeded the 1805 total number of cases recorded in
2002. With the increasing trend in the number of cases in the past
months, [Anofficial] warned that a worse scenario could be
expected in the last quarter of 2003. He said, though, that even if
dengue cases continue to increase, the figures are still within the
expected range and have not yet reached the number recorded in
1998, where the whole province experienced an outbreak of the
disease.
Cebu City recorded the highest number of cases for the month of
September [2003] with a total of 94 cases, Mandaue City ranked
second with 37, followed by Talisay City with 31 & Toledo City
with 14 cases.
Municipalities that have been identified to have a clustering of
cases last month are Barili (3 new cases), Bogo (13), Carmen (4),
Catmon (4), Consolacion (3), Daanbantayan (10), Liloan (5),
Minglanilla (10), Naga (10), San Fernando (4), and Tuburan (4).

Municipal Councillors today expressed concern over the increasing
dengue cases in the Capital and called upon the authorities to
intensify their anti-dengue campaign. Though nearly 400 dengue
cases have been reported from across the city [up from 130 on 24
Sep 2003 -- see ref. (38) below], no confirmed dengue deaths
have occurred, the Municipal Commissioner, Rakesh Mehta, said
at the MCD House meeting here. Of the total number of reported
cases, more than 80 are [imported] from neighbouring States, he
said.
[But] the [opposition] BJP Councillor from Shalimar Bagh, Ram
Kishan Singhal, claimed "In Maharaja Agrasen hospital alone,
there are at least 50 dengue patients admitted. Recently a 28-year-
old man died in Chandni Chowk due to dengue."

With the death of a 10-year-old girl on Wednesday night, dengue
fever claimed its 6th victim in the last [2 weeks]. The young resident
of Savli breathed her last at the KG Patel Children's Hospital in
Vadodara, which has so far reported 32 cases of dengue.
In the wake of the high mortality and increase in number of dengue
cases in the district, the hospital has now [requested that] the
health department at Gandhinagar take stock of the situation. Out of
the 6 deaths reported so far, the youngest victim is a 6-month-old
child, a resident of Salatwada. The other deceased have been
identified as a 5-year-old from Navayard, a 4-year-old and a
5-year-old from Karjan, and a 2-year-old from Subhanpura.
The doctors in the city have been referring the cases to KG Patel
Children's Hospital, as it has 2 ICUs with a capacity to
accommodate 24 patients at a time. "So far, 32 cases have been
admitted, out of which 17 have been discharged and the remaining
are recovering. We have 10 resident doctors and 8 consulting
experts, who are monitoring the patients at our ICU," says medical
superintendent of KG Patel Children's Hospital, Dr Nirupa Munshi.
"Elimination of the breeding sites of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito
is the only feasible solution as of now," says Munshi. "It is perhaps
the second time since 1998 that Vadodara has been affected with
dengue. Though the disease is common in coastal areas like Surat,
Vadodara never had it in such great proportions," asserts Munshi.
The high mortality rate has also put the doctors on high alert, even
as patients are pouring in from Godhra, Savli, and Karjan, apart
from city areas in Vadodara.
Says Dr Hitesh Desai, one of the consultants, "The condition of
most patients seems to deteriorate on the 4th and 5th day after
admission, as they suffer massive uncontrolled bleeding from their
nose and mouth. It is a highly unpredictable disease as there is no
definite cure. Only symptomatic treatment [can] help."
