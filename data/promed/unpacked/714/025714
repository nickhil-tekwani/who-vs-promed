Plague-infested fleas are affecting prairie dog colonies throughout the Commerce City region and prompted the closure of multiple heavily trafficked areas nearby. The Tri-County Health Department released a statement regarding the plague on Thursday [1 Aug 2019], saying the disease is common and can be dealt with using insecticide to kill the fleas (http://www.tchd.org/271/Animal-Related-Zoonotic-Diseases).

While there are no reported cases of the plague detected in humans in Commerce City, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, Commerce City open space areas, and unpaved parking areas at Dick's Sporting Goods Park have all voluntarily closed in order to protect people and pets (https://www.fws.gov/refuge/rocky_mountain_arsenal/).

Signs have been posted and insecticide is being used to mitigate the problem.

While the plague does not usually cause dogs [and cats] to fall ill, they can transport the fleas. Common symptoms of the plague in humans include fever, swollen and tender lymph nodes, chills, and extreme exhaustion. If you believe you may have the plague, contact your doctor.

[Domestic pets, and especially cats, can bring infected fleas into the house. This is not uncommon. So make sure your animals are routinely treated for fleas to keep down the risk. Even better, keep your cats indoors.

Plague may infect humans through several routes: (1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously); (2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or (3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing, take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 4-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention.
