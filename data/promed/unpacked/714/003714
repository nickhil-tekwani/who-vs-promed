[During 2015, Russia reported 3 outbreaks of sheep and goat pox in Dagestan. See event summary and updated map at http://tinyurl.com/nbn9mhw. The last follow-up report was submitted on 24 Sep 2015. However, there is still no information provided in any of the follow-up reports, which answers or addresses any of the questions asked in the ProMED-mail request for information posting 20150807.3563227.

Dagestan is located in the North Caucasus Mountains. It is the southernmost part of Russia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan).

These current outbreaks are located in Primorsky krai (Primorye Region), in the eastern part of the country. This province borders China and North Korea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorsky_Krai). China reported in its latest 6-monthly report (January-June 2015) 107 outbreaks of sheep and goat pox. See report at, http://tinyurl.com/p5yaolj.

Since 'modified stamping out' is, reportedly, the policy applied (30 out of the 35 clinical cases kept alive), and in view of the fact that vaccination is not applied -- these 30 animals (but preferably the entire 2 affected flocks), should remain under quarantine for an extended period. Recovered sheep may remain infective for a long period (up to 6 months) due to infective material (dermis crusts) remaining in their wool. - Mod.AS]
