[The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. According to the media report (https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/bulgaria-reports-bird-flu-outbreak-industrial-farm-2021-12-03/), Bulgarian veterinary authorities will cull more than 80 000 chickens in the southern village of Tsalapitsa after a bird flu outbreak was confirmed at an industrial farm there, the food safety agency said on Friday [3 Dec 2021]. The agency said it had also found the highly contagious disease at a backyard farm in the same village and at a backyard farm in the nearby village of Varvara and would cull about 100 chickens there. We believe the outbreaks detected in Tsalapitsa correspond to the outbreak identified in the OIE report as ID ob_93350 (laying hen commercial farm) and ID ob_93343 (backyard). This is because the village of Tsalapitsa (Plovdiv district) is part of Rodopi municipality. - Mod.CRD]

[The latest ECDC's communicable disease threat report (CDTR), week 46, 14 -20 Nov 2021 available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Communicable-disease-threats-report-week%2046-2021.pdf, mentioned that: "Following the autumn bird migration, an increasing number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) have been reported from many countries across the EU/EEA, with large outbreaks in the poultry sector in Italy and in wild birds and poultry in Germany. Sweden declared the risk as very high and raised its threat level to 2. In the United Kingdom, an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone was declared across Great Britain on 3 Nov 2021. To date, no human cases have been reported in the EU/EEA. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry and wild birds have recently been reported for the first time in Japan and South Korea.

According to WHO, between January 2003 and 4 Nov 2021, 863 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus were reported globally, from 18 countries. Of these, 456 were fatal (CFR: 53%). The most recent case was reported from India in July 2021. No human infections with the currently circulating A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b have been reported to date.

A new publication (C. Adlhoch et al., 2021 at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1198743X21006327) outlines the latest situation and aims to raise awareness among clinicians to test for avian influenza in cases with previous exposure to possibly infected birds". - Mod.CRD
