There seems to be some confusion regarding UK Pet Quarantine Procedures as
regards tapeworms in dogs. There is justified concern for the possibility
of introduction of _Echinococcus_ spp, especially _E. multilocularis_ which
is enzootic in many countries of Western Europe, including France, Germany,
Switzerland and Belgium. There was a mention of a vaccine for _Echinococcus
granulosus_ with the implication it might be applied for use in dogs. But
the vaccine developed by scientists in Australia and New Zealand is for use
in protecting intermediate hosts (sheep and cattle, etc.). There are no
effective vaccines for echinococcus in dogs (yet!).
Simple stool exams are not particularly sensitive nor specific for
diagnosis of echinococcosis in dogs because the eggs are identical to those
of other taeniidae cestodes. Coproantigen assays are now available and
might be applied for screening dogs but are not highly sensitive. Perhaps
the most practical means of limiting the possibility of entry would be to
treat "at risk" dogs and cats with praziquantel which is highly effective
for eliminating echinococcosis from definitive hosts.

There are many other parasitic infections which dogs have been documented
to transmit to humans I suspect it is not only zoonotic diseases that are
being considered, but those that could affect the dog, cat and other
domestic animal populations s of the UK, that are being considered.,
Examples could include ehrlichiosis, heartworm, leishmaniasis.These may
also affect human beings.
