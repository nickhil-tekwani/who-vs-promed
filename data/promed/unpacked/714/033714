Eight new cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) have
been diagnosed in the Eastern Cape, the province's health department said
on Wed 28 Feb 2007.
It said this brought to 41 the number of patients identified with the
disease in the province since November 2006. During this period the disease
had claimed at least 5 lives. The new cases were discovered in patients
already admitted to Port Elizabeth's Jose Pearson TB hospital for
multidrug-resistant TB.
"The situation is under control as the infectious disease is not spreading
at an alarming rate in the province," the department said in a statement.
It said it was on full alert, and had established isolation wards at Jose
Pearson, Fort Grey TB Hospital in East London, and Nelson Mandela Academic
Hospital in Mthatha.
XDR TB first emerged in South Africa in the Tugela Ferry region of
KwaZulu-Natal in 2005. The strain has killed more than 50 people in
KwaZulu-Natal and more than 300 cases have been confirmed countrywide.

[The 5 deaths have already been reported. Many of the initial deaths
occurred before the isolate was grown and sensitivities obtained. Although
not stated, it is possible that since there were no new deaths, initial
anti-tuberculous therapy has been adjusted in response to the XDR strains.
XDR TB is now defined an isolate resistant to INH (isoniazid) and rifampin
(also referred to as rifamycin) that was also resistant to a
fluoroquinolone and to one or more of the following 3 injectable
anti-tuberculosis drugs: capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin.
