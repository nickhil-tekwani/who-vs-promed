South Korea reported the country's 1st 2 deaths from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on Tuesday [2 Jun 2015], saying a suspected patient was confirmed to have the virus after death and another confirmed patient also died.

The health ministry also reported 6 new cases of the viral disease, bringing the total to 25. The new cases included the country's 1st tertiary infections as 2 people were found to have contracted the virus from a secondarily infected patient.

[According to another media report, the 2 deaths involved a 58-year-old woman who had had contact with South Korea's 1st patient who died of acute respiratory failure on Monday [1 Jun 2015], and a 71-year-old man who had been on respiratory support with a history of kidney ailments also died on Monday [1 Jun 2015] (http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/01/us-health-mers-southkorea-idUSKBN0OH1P120150601). These are cases No: 6 and 25 in the Korean MOH line listing presented in section [2] below.

An additional 6 [MERS] patients have been confirmed, bringing the total number of Korean cases to 25 including 2 deaths.

Of the 6 newly confirmed cases:
- 4 patients are secondary cases associated with spread in the 2nd hospital [hospital B] where the index case was admitted, involving medical patients or family members, all of whom had contact with the 1st patient (the index case). Two patients are from D hospital; both had contact with the 2nd patient diagnosed.

Of these 4 patients referred to above as secondary cases, all were at the hospital between 15 and 17 May 2015, either hospitalized or visiting a family member who was hospitalized in the same ward as the index case.

The other 2 patients were in the hospital from 28-30 May 2015 in the same ward as one of the secondary cases. [Hence, these 2 cases are referred to as tertiary cases.]

[According to the Korean MOH, as of the early morning on 2 Jun 2015 in Korea, there have now been a total of 25 cases including 2 deaths of MERS-CoV infection in Koreans. The Korean MOH line listing provided above is very helpful in clarifying the various transmissions that have occurred. It should be noted that the line listing includes the case that was confirmed by the China MOH and is presently admitted to a hospital in Guangdong. Of the 25 cases, one is the index case; 22 cases are secondary cases having been exposed to MERS-CoV during the index case(s) hospitalization in hospital B, and 2 cases are tertiary cases having been exposed to a secondary case in hospital D. The obviously disturbing fact is that there is now an apparent 3rd generation of cases: Cases nos. 23 and 24 in the above line listing were listed as having their exposures to MERS-CoV hospitals on 28-30 May 2015. It is important to note that they were both in the same ward as patient 16, who was not diagnosed as MERS-CoV infected until 31 May 2015, after their exposure.

A key question is whether this outbreak is related to a superspreader hospitalized in an environment without respiratory precautions, and a 2nd generation of case(s) that also were hospitalized without adequate respiratory precautions, or has there been a change in the virus leading to more easy transmission in the healthcare and community environment. Presumably, there will be genetic studies on the virus(es) involved in this current outbreak. Have patients been treated with nebulizer treatments, or intubated while in the open ward and placed on respirators? Given the apparent transparency of the Korean MOH in terms of reporting, these are all questions with answers that will be shared with the public health community when information becomes available. - Mod.MPP

[3] South Korea, total 18 cases - media report 1 Jun 2015
Date: 1 Jun 2015

South Korea struggled to contain an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on Monday [1 Jun 2015] as health authorities announced 3 more cases, bringing the number of infections to 18 in just over 10 days.

Authorities are considering a ban on overseas travel for the nearly 700 people isolated for possible infection after a 44-year-old man broke a voluntary house quarantine last week and flew to Hong Kong and then travelled to mainland China.

The man subsequently tested positive for MERS, China's 1st confirmed case, setting off alarm bells as health officials traced his footsteps and tested dozens of people who had been in close contact with him.

South Korea's Health Ministry confirmed 3 more cases on Monday [1 Jun 2015], but declined to identify the location of any of the cases.

All 18 cases have been linked to a 68-year-old man -- who returned from Bahrain via Qatar on [20 May 2015] -- who were either patients or visitors to the hospital where he was being treated.

1st identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered China's deadly 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). There is no cure or vaccine.

The World Health Organization (WHO) put the total number of cases globally at 1150 with at least 427 related deaths.

It said last week there had been no sustained human-to-human spread and that it was not recommending screening of passengers or that travel or trade restrictions be imposed on South Korea.

In South Korea, one elderly patient who had a history of a kidney ailment was in a serious condition, with weak vital signs requiring him to be on cardiac and respiratory support, the head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, Kim Woo-joo, told a briefing.

"I've been asking myself whether there may be a genetic factor, if anything makes (Koreans) more vulnerable, but so far, there's no evidence," said Kim, who is advising the Health Ministry on the outbreak.

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control put South Korea's 18 cases the 4th highest number of confirmed cases, after Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Public health authorities faced more criticism on Monday [1 Jun 2015] for failing to contain the spread of the virus after the initial case whose symptoms were 1st overlooked. "We must find the reason for the high rate of transmission unlike in the cases of other countries," President Park Geun-hye told a meeting on Monday.

[As of today, 1 Jun 2015 there have been a total of 1016 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 447 deaths (reported case fatality rate 44.0 percent) reported from Saudi Arabia since 2012. The outbreak in Hufoof is ongoing as cases continue to occur - there have now been 20 cases reported from Hufoof since 20 Apr 2015. One wonders what is facilitating the nosocomial spread in an area that has already had nosocomial transmission in the past. More information on the epidemiology of this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea 1 Jun 2015
-----------------------------------
On 31 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 2 additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- The case is a 35-year-old male who developed symptoms of cough, sputum and fever on 6 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on 13 May [2015]. The patient has been on tuberculosis medication since his son was diagnosed with the bacterial disease in April [2015]. Between [15 and 17 May 2015], he shared the same ward with the 1st case during his hospitalization from 15 to 17 May [2015]. On 20 May [2015], after his discharge, the patient visited 2 different hospitals due to fever and was put on antibiotics. As symptoms persisted despite antibiotic therapy, he was admitted to a hospital again on 27 May [2015] and confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on 29 May [2015].

2- The case is a 35-year-old male whose mother shared the same ward with the 1st case. From 15 to 21 May [2015], the patient visited his mother every day at the hospital. He developed symptoms and visited an emergency room on 24 May [2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital between 25 and 27 May [2015] and confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on 30 May [2015].

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1154 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 431 related deaths.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 71-year-old, non-national male from Hofuf city developed symptoms on 21 May [2015] while admitted to hospital since 10 May [2015] due to an unrelated medical condition. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 24 May [2015]. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.

2- A 68-year-old female from Hofuf city was admitted to a cardiac centre on 13 May [2015] complaining of chest pain and fever.
