Melioidosis in Mauritius
-------------------------
Melioidosis is an infectious disease of humans and animals caused by
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (1). Most documented cases occur in
Southeast Asia and northern Australia (2). In recent years,
melioidosis has increasingly been recognized in the Indian
subcontinent (3). Only a few cases have been reported in South
America (4) and Africa (5). In the islands of the southwest Indian
Ocean, although no human cases have been reported, _B. pseudomallei_
has been isolated from pigs in Madagascar as far back as 1936 (6) and
from the soil in Madagascar and La Reunion (7). We report the 1st
case of human melioidosis in the southwest Indian Ocean island of
Mauritius, where _B. pseudomallei_ has not been isolated previously.
A 40-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital on 29 Jan 2004
with fever, generalized weakness, diarrhea, and vomiting. Her
temperature on admission was 39.2 C. Results of physical examination
were unremarkable. She was started on intravenous ciprofloxacin, but
her fever persisted, and she became increasingly confused. 2 days
after admission, therapy was changed to cefotaxime and metronidazole.
A blood culture was collected the next day. The following day, she
had cellulitis of the right leg. She remained feverish and
intermittently drowsy and confused. She died 9 days after being
admitted.
Her old hospital records became available shortly after her death,
and we noted that she had been diagnosed with systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) in 1994. When she last attended the outpatient
department 3 months before her hospital admission, she was prescribed
50 mg azathioprine and 5 mg prednisolone daily. She was a housewife
and lived in Cite La Cure, a poor suburb of the capital city
Port-Louis. She had never traveled abroad. According to her mother,
her home becomes very muddy after heavy rainfall, and her feet were
often in mud while performing her household duties.
After 5 days of incubation, an oxidase positive Gram negative
bacillus was isolated from blood cultures. It produced colonies that
appeared dry and rugose on the plates after 48 h and was identified
as _B. pseudomallei_ by using API 20NE (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile,
France) with the profile 1156577. Antimicrobial susceptibility
testing by disc diffusion showed the organism to be resistant to
colistin, ampicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin and
susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, tetracycline, cefotaxime,
ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and meropenem. A large zone
of inhibition was seen around the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole disc,
within which a thin film of growth was observed.
This case represents the 1st time _B. pseudomallei_ was isolated in
Mauritius. The patient must have been infected in Mauritius, because
she never traveled abroad. We are not aware of any study looking for
the organism in soil in this country. Veterinary cases do not appear
to have been reported previously in Mauritius (V.B. Groodoyal, pers.
comm.). Whether human cases of melioidosis have been missed in the
past is not known, and cases may be missed currently. Recognizing the
disease depends on awareness on the part of clinicians and on the
ability of microbiology laboratories to identify the causative
organism (1, 8).
Before 1998, oxidase-positive gram-negative bacilli other than _P.
aeruginosa_ were not identified to species level in laboratories in
Mauritius. Since then, at our laboratory, which receives specimens
for bacteriologic investigations from all government healthcare
institutions, such organisms are routinely identified by API 20NE
when isolated in pure culture from blood, but only occasionally when
isolated from nonsterile sites such as sputum and pus swabs. Thus,
nonsepticemic cases of melioidosis in Mauritius could easily have
been missed. Diagnosis also depends on appropriate specimens being
sent to the laboratory. Some clinicians routinely request blood
cultures from patients with high fever before starting antimicrobial
drugs, although in practice, the specimen is often collected by
nursing staff after the 1st dose has already been administered. Other
clinicians only request blood cultures if fever persists after a few
days of empiric antimicrobial therapy. In the case reported here,
prior administration of cefotaxime may have delayed _B. pseudomallei_
culture from blood until 5 days of incubation, when the median time
to obtain a positive blood culture result is typically 48 hours (1).
An association between rainfall and melioidosis has long been
recognized; most cases in Thailand (9) and northern Australia (10)
occur during the wet season. The increased number of cases noted
during the rainy season may be caused by the movement of _B.
pseudomallei_ from deeper layers toward the surface when dry topsoil
is moistened by rainfall (2).
In Mauritius, the rainy season is December to March. In January 2004,
196 mm rainfall was recorded in Port-Louis, which is 37 percent
higher than the 1971-2000 mean rainfall for the region during this
month. January 2004 was the 6th wettest January of the past 30 years
in Port-Louis. Similarly, above-average rainfall was recorded
throughout the island in 2004.

[The case of melioidosis expands the documented range of _B.
pseudomallei_ infection. Since melioidosis is a category B biowarfare
agent, documenting its natural range is important. The flooding
caused by the recent tsunami involved areas of endemicity for
melioidosis, and it should be watched for in these areas. - Mod.LL]
