Bird Flu Crisis - Mainland source ruled out
Virologists have initially ruled out the mainland as the origin of the bird
flu virus, pointing the finger at dirty chicken farms and markets in Hong
Kong. The 13-member World Health Organisation delegation, on a 10-day
mainland visit to discuss the H5N1 crisis with authorities, also said
Guangzhou's influenza surveillance programme appeared satisfactory.
"We learned about the Chinese surveillance system at the briefing [with
mainland officials and from what has been said, we think the system is all
right," spokesman Dr. Daniel Lavanchy said yesterday. "But we shall go to
see how it actually works," he said, adding the team would meet frontline
doctors at hospitals and clinics in Guangzhou today.
Dr. Lavanchy said preliminary findings showed no indication that the
mainland was the source of the virus, despite reports of suspicious sudden
deaths of chickens last year. "Apparently there has not been a case of bird
flu in China. But there are several cases in Hong Kong," he said. Barbara
Reynolds, one of the Centres for Disease Control scientists in Hong Kong
working on the virus, was surprised by Dr. Lavanchy's remarks. "We have
nothing to base that on yet," she said, adding she was unaware of a report
suggesting the source was in Hong Kong.
CDPC Note: It's hard to rule anything out after the first day of formal
meetings! Show me the data! How many virus isolation tests have been
carried out to rule out the absence of H5N1 in southern China?
