The French wire service reported today that authorities destroyed a herd of
216 cattle this past weekend when one new case was discovered in a milk cow
born in the Haute-Saone region (SW of Paris) in Sep 1993. This is the 34th
case of BSE detected in France since the beginning of 1998.
[The report did not say that the herd destroyed was located in the
Haute-Saone region, only that the diseased cow had been born there -DP

France declared today 16th of March a new BSE case : the 3d in 1998 (6 had
been identified in 1997). In total, France declared 34 cases of BSE since
1990.
This case has occurred in the "department" (nearly equivalent of county) of
Haute-Loire, in the Center of France, but this animal (a diary cow) was born
(in September, 1993) and has spent most of her life (until October 96) in
the same farm of Haute-Saone (in the East of France). « Considering the
incubation time of BSE, the animal cannot have been contaminated in the farm
» of Haute-Loire, the MAF said today.
The whole herd of the farm in Haute-Saone (216 diary cows) has been
slaughtered and incinerated on the 14 and 15th of March.
You will have calculated that this case is a BAB case.
