Foot and mouth disease in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China:
-------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Hong Kong reported

from the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department
(AFCD), Hong Kong:

they were all performed on old lesions with minimal epidermal tissue submitted.
C. Causal agent: virus not typed.
Source of agent / origin of infection: source not determined, but all 3
outbreaks were geographically quite close.

[While there is always some degree of concern about an outbreak of FMD,
this disease occurs regularly in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of
China. In each of the last 6 years, OIE has received reports of FMD in
swine from Hong Kong. In 2001, cattle were also affected. Of course, the
serotype will be informative in terms of the origin of this outbreak and
the value of vaccination as a control measure. FMD definitely occurs
regularly in mainland China; I saw it first-hand as far back as 1984. - Mod.PC]
