Nine citizens (including 2 teenagers) from Yasnogorsk, Tula region, have
become ill with typhoid fever. The outbreak [is the first in the region
[since the beginning of the 1960's, although 1-2 cases of "foreign"
typhoid fever (mainly from the middle of Asia and Caucasus) have been
registered annually. The complicated clinical picture has hampered [efforts
of physicians to identify the disease immediately.
The diagnosis has been [tentatively confirmed by laboratory analysis.
Preventive epidemic measures are [being conducted in the region.
Supposedly, [poor quality drinking water was a source of the infection.
Now the water is hyper-chlorinated. According to the regional sanitary
service, about 400 adults and children [have been observed to be in
contact with infected people. Some of them have been hospitalized. The
diagnosis will be [further confirmed by laboratory analysis [to rule out
paratyphoid fever.
