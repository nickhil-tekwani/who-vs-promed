WHO statement on the 7th Meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding MERS-CoV
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 7th meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) regarding the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was conducted with members and advisors of the Emergency Committee through electronic correspondence from [26 Sep 2014 through 30 Sep 2014].

The WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of epidemiological and scientific developments, including a description of recently reported cases and transmission patterns. Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia provided an update on and assessment of MERS-CoV, including progress towards implementation of the Emergency Committee's temporary recommendations.

The Committee noted that: (i) there have been significant efforts made to strengthen infection prevention and control measures, with an epidemiological situation that has not changed since the 6th meeting of the IHR EC; (ii) the number of cases has fallen since the April [2014] upswing, and cases continues to appear sporadically with no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in communities; (iii) although transmission in health care settings is still occurring in small clusters, transmission seems generally contained; (iv) activities conducted to reduce the international spread of MERS-CoV seem to be effective; and (v) the current data suggest that MERS-CoV transmission could be seasonal, with an upsurge expected next spring [2015].

The Committee reiterated that its previous advice remains relevant and that significant efforts should be made to:
- continue to strengthen infection prevention control (IPC) practices, build capacity of heath-care workers and provide protective equipment in vulnerable countries, especially African countries;
- improve awareness about MERS-CoV among pilgrims going for Hajj, and conduct surveillance for MERS-CoV among pilgrims during and after Hajj;
- harmonise laboratory testing algorithms;
- reinforce epidemiological surveillance in camels in the Middle East and in Africa, as well as surveillance in humans and address critical gaps in knowledge of human and animal transmission.

The Committee unanimously concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not yet been met.

Based on the Committee's advice, and information currently available, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment. She thanked the Committee for its work.

The WHO Secretariat will continue to provide regular updates to the Committee Members and Advisors. The Emergency Committee will be reconvened in 3 months, or earlier if circumstances require.

[As written in the WHO report above on the findings of the 7th IHR Emergency Committee meeting concerning MERS-CoV, given the apparent lower level of transmission of the virus, the committee did not find the situation constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as yet. It is interesting that there is a comment observing seasonality with increases in cases in the spring, and an expectation of an upsurge in the spring (2015).

That being said, today (1 Oct 2014) there was another new laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported in Jubail, in a 65-year-old Saudi male with a history of exposure to camels. In addition, there was another fatality reported in a 43-year-old male from Taif, who had been reported as a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 12 Sep 2014, at which time he was reported to be admitted to the ICU. With the addition of these 2 reported events, since June 2012 Saudi Arabia has reported 755 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection including 320 deaths (case fatality rate - CFR: 42.4 percent).

According to the ECDC epidemiologic update posted today (1 Oct 2014), as of 30 Sep 2014 there have been a global total of 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported including 352 deaths (CFR 39.7 percent) (see http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1074 for the full report with tables and maps showing international distribution).

According to a media report by CIDRAP today (1 Oct 2014), the case reported by Austria yesterday (30 Sep 2014) was in a woman from Medina, one of the holy sites visited by pilgrims (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/10/who-panel-mers-still-not-international-emergency). No further information on this woman was available (age, possible risk exposures).
