Orange County (OC) Mosquito and Vector Control District has found an infestation of tropical mosquitoes at a Garden Grove home, where residents reported being bitten during the day by a black-and-white striped species at a time of year when it usually goes into hibernation, a spokesman said [Mon 1 Feb 2016].

"It's a tropical mosquito -- it shouldn't be able to handle cold nighttime temperatures. But here it is in the middle of winter," spokesman Jared Dever said. "It's a telltale sign that these mosquitoes will proliferate in Southern California if we don't do our part to eliminate their breeding sources."

The announcement came as the World Health Organization declared an international emergency related to the Zika virus, spread by _Aedes aegypti_, a black-and-white striped mosquito.

By mid-November [2015] the species had spread to parts of 8 OC cities. Tropical mosquitoes can spread the virus that is growing "explosively" through the Americas and possibly causing brain damage in babies. No Zika cases have been reported in the county.

The WHO declaration on [Mon 1 Feb 2016] that Zika and its suspected link to clusters of the birth defect microcephaly should resonate with Orange County residents, Dever said.

"Each resident must take personal responsibility for the elimination of standing water on their property," Dever said. "The more mosquitoes they eliminate, the less of a concern these diseases become for Orange County."

Zika, and the other diseases [viruses] transmitted by tropical mosquitoes -- including dengue and chikungunya -- isn't spread person to person. To spread the virus, a mosquito, typically the _Ae. aegypti_, first has to bite someone who is infected, then bite someone else. Most people who are infected don't have symptoms and those who do rarely require hospitalization.

But public health officials say there is strong evidence that pregnant women who are infected by Zika [virus] are passing the virus on to their unborn babies through the placenta.

The mosquitoes are aggressive daytime biters that breed indoors and outdoors in containers, including watering cans, saucers, pots, and even bottle caps. Its eggs are as small as flecks of dirt and can survive in dry conditions for a year or longer and will hatch when hit with a small amount of water.

On [Fri 29 Jan 2016], vector control collected from the Garden Grove property about a half-dozen containers filled with pupae and larvae.

As temperatures drop into the 50s, 40s, and 30s, the non-native mosquitoes continue biting and breeding. It wouldn't be uncommon for the hardy eggs to survive even in freezing temperatures, but it is surprising that they are hatching and developing at a normal pace in cold temperatures, said Bill Walton, a professor of entomology at UC [University of California] Riverside. "They're probably here to stay and they're probably going to become more widespread," he said.

Throughout the winter, vector control officials have visited homes in the infestation areas to collect samples and educate residents about how to eradicate breeding sources.

The new infestation is about a half-mile [1 km] from any other known infestation area. That means residents were either exchanging plants or containers or that infestation is "dense enough that they have hopscotched away from where we originally found them," Dever said.

[_Aedes aegypti_ continues to spread in Orange County in Southern California. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ continued to be found in new localities in Southern California in 2015, and some of these California localities are places where both species have been reported in earlier ProMED-mail posts.

Although the risk of imported dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses sparking a local outbreak is low, it is not zero. In recent years, there has been local dengue virus transmission in Florida involving _Ae. aegypti_ and in Long Island, New York, transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_. These small outbreaks have been initiated by the arrival of viremic individuals from endemic countries.

The fact that the vector mosquito populations in California are low so far, certainly significantly reduces the risk of an outbreak with ongoing transmission being initiated there. The aggressive and well-organized surveillance and control measures being carried out in California will likely keep those vector populations at a low level, but, as the above article indicates, cooperation by citizens at the local level is important for elimination of mosquito breeding sites.
