7-15 Nov 2015 is Valley Fever [coccidioidomycosis] Awareness Week in Arizona, as declared by state Governor Douglas Ducey, and health officials in Arizona are stepping up investigations into an increase in valley fever cases in recent months.

Director for the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) Cara M. Christ, M.D. said in her blog today [10 Nov 2015]: "Although the upcoming 2014 Annual Valley Fever Report shows a decrease in reported cases in Arizona over the past few years, reports of valley fever have been increasing in the last few months. Epidemiologists, our disease detectives, at the Arizona Department of Health Services are looking into why we are seeing this increase and are continuing to work with county health departments and the Valley Fever Center for Excellence at the University of Arizona to monitor the disease and provide education to healthcare providers and the public."

[_Coccidioides immitis_] is the fungus that causes valley fever. [Coccidioidomycosis] is one of the most commonly reported infectious diseases in Arizona and accounts for 65 percent of all reported cases in the U.S. Since 2009, Arizona has reported more than 10 000 coccidioidomycosis cases each year, with the exception of 2013.

Continued surveillance for valley fever by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) has demonstrated that valley fever is one of the most commonly reported infectious diseases in Arizona, and 96 percent of cases reported in Arizona reside in Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal Counties. People are infected with the fungus _C. immitis_ by inhaling fungal spores that become airborne after disturbance of contaminated soil by humans or natural events like a dust storm.

Approximately 60 percent of people infected with _Coccidioides_ are asymptomatic and have self-limited respiratory tract infections. If symptoms do appear, they will appear 1-3 weeks after exposure. The symptoms, if present, are usually non-specific, flu-like symptoms: fever, cough, headache, rash and muscle aches. Most make a full recovery within a month, more or less. However, in a small number of people (approximately one percent), the fungal infection can cause serious infection disseminating to visceral organs, the central nervous system, bone, skin or lymph nodes. Disseminated _Coccidioides_ infections occur more frequently in dark-skinned races (persons of African or Filipino descent). In addition, pregnant woman and the immunocompromised are more predisposed to disseminated infections.

According to the CDC, in many cases, treatment for coccidioidomycosis is not necessary, as symptoms can resolve on their own. Many healthcare providers still prefer to prescribe antifungal medications, such as fluconazole, to prevent a more severe infection from developing. It is especially important for people at risk for severe disease, such as people infected with HIV or those with weakened immune systems, to receive treatment as quickly as possible. It is extremely important for people with severe infections to be treated with antifungal medications because advanced coccidioidomycosis can be fatal if not treated. There are no over the counter medications to treat coccidioidomycosis.

The CDC says it is very difficult to avoid exposure to _Coccidioides_, but people who live in endemic regions should try to avoid dusty environments if possible. People who are at risk for severe disease can take the following measures to avoid exposure. Wear an N95 mask if you must be in or near a dusty environment, such as a construction zone. Avoid activities that involve close contact to dust, including yard work, gardening, and digging. Use air quality improvement measures indoors such as HEPA filters. Take prophylactic anti-fungal medication if deemed necessary by your healthcare provider. Clean skin injuries well with soap and water, especially if they have been exposed to soil or dust.

[Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the southwestern United States (the central San Joaquin valley of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and the western half of Texas, with the highest number of cases occurring in Arizona and California), parts of northern Mexico, in some Central American countries, and desert regions of South America (Argentina, Paraguay, and Venezuela). It is caused by the dimorphic fungi _Coccidioides immitis_ and _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow as mycelia in the top 2-8 inches [5 to 20 cm] of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. The airborne spores can be inhaled and produce an acute infection in humans, as well as other animals. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection.

Coccidioidomycosis is not transmitted from person to person. Risk of infection is highest in dry summer months. A 2nd period of risk usually occurs in the late fall, terminating with winter rains. Dust exposure is critical for acquiring an infection. Indeed, an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis followed exposure to a dust cloud that was blown downwind from the January 1994 6.7 magnitude Northridge California earthquake and its after shocks (CDC. Coccidioidomycosis following the Northridge earthquake -- California, 1994. JAMA. Jun 8 1994; 271(22): 1735).

Because the incubation period for this infection usually ranges from 1-4 weeks, persons who may have become infected while visiting areas where coccidioidomycosis is endemic may not become ill until after they return home, and the diagnosis may not be considered by clinicians in areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (See prior ProMED-mail posts on coccidioidomycosis in travelers: Coccidioidomycosis - Taiwan ex USA 20090610.2140 and Coccidioidomycosis - Europe ex USA (Calif.): Alert 20011214.3026).

Reasons for increases in reported coccidioidomycosis are not fully understood but may include climatic change (drought and increasing temperatures in the southwestern United States (http://www.demos.org/publication/economic-and-environmental-impacts-climate-change-arizona), dust storms, soil disturbance caused by increased construction activity, growing numbers of persons who are immunocompromised or have other risk factors for severe disease, and immigration of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm).
