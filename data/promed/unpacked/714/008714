The New South Wales (NSW), Australia, Department of Primary Industries (DPI) is urging owners to remain vigilant, following confirmation of Hendra virus infection in an unvaccinated horse near Murwillumbah. Christine Middlemiss, the NSW chief veterinary officer, said Local Land Services has placed the property near Murwillumbah under movement restrictions.

"This is the 2nd confirmed case of Hendra in NSW this year [2017], following a Hendra virus infection in an unvaccinated horse near Lismore last month [July 2017]," Middlemiss said. "Samples from the horse were sent by a private veterinarian for laboratory analysis at DPI's Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute (EMAI) and initial test results detected the Hendra virus today [Wed 2 Aug 2017].

"The 14 year old gelding was initially noticed by the owner to be lethargic and not eating properly," she continued. "The horse was sampled 4 days later when it deteriorated, becoming unsteady on its feet and unwilling to move. On examination the horse also had decreased gut sounds, a temperature, and poor circulatory function."

Hendra virus has been known to yield numerous clinical signs in horses including lethargy, respiratory distress, frothy nasal discharge, elevated body temperature (above 40°C, or 104°F), and elevated heart rate; however, authorities caution that hendra infection does not have specific signs.

The virus is transmitted to horses from flying foxes, a type of fruit bat that frequents Australia, but the exact method of transmission remains unclear. The zoonotic disease is transmissible to humans and has killed 4 people since it was first discovered, including an equine veterinarian who contracted the virus after treating an affected foal in 2009.

Middlemiss said this is not the 1st Hendra case to be confirmed in this area. "All known Hendra virus cases have occurred in Queensland or northern NSW, but cases could occur wherever there are flying foxes or in horses that had recent contact with flying foxes prior to movement," she said.

Horse owners are encouraged to discuss a Hendra virus vaccination strategy with their veterinarian. "Vaccination remains the most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses, but good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures should always be practiced," Middlemiss said. "Horses should also be kept away from flowering and fruiting trees that are attractive to bats," she added. "Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above." If your horse is unwell, keep people and other animals away from the horse and call your private veterinarian immediately.

[This is a zoonotic disease and has caused worry in family members of other infected premises, and in veterinarians. There are rules regarding the personal protective equipment (PPE) that veterinarians must wear. The gear can be frightening to a horse and can further put the veterinarian at risk.

Lack of vaccination continues to be a problem for horses and for all humans in contact with the animals.

The vaccine may appear as an added cost to the owner, but it is a huge measure of insurance of safety for all involved. - Mod.TG
