On a farm of 422 sheep in the territory of Melfi in Basilicata Region, Southern Italy, between 22 and 26 Aug 2012, 2 sheep died. Apparently they did not show any symptoms and death came suddenly. The animals were transported to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Puglia and Basilicata for necropsy and diagnostic tests.

On 28 Aug 2012, the owner of a sheep breeding farm located approximately 3 km from the breeding affected by the disease was admitted into the hospital at Potenza. At the time of hospitalization, the patient was febrile; his vital signs were normal; and during the physical examination it was noted that he had 5 scabbed ulcers distributed on his right arm. These were painless, and had a slight edema and surrounding vesicles.

During the interview the breeder said there were no dead animals in his flock and therefore had had no contact with dead animals. However, about 3 days before he had been bitten by gadflies in the points of the arm where he developed the cutaneous lesions. This incident occurred while the farmer was watching his sheep grazing in the same pasture where anthrax later killed 2 sheep

The bacterial cultures from the human scabs remained negative. This finding could be explained by the fact that, at the time the samples were taken, the patient was already under amoxicillin treatment at a high dose.

The bacterial cultures on sheep blood on TSM blood agar produced grey-white non-haemolytic colonies. PCR analysis, using specific primers from chromosome and the 2 pathogenic plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, performed on the DNA extracted from suspect colonies and from human scabs was positive for _B. anthracis_.

Now we are working on MLVA with 15 VNTRs to confirm that the animal and human cases are correlated; i.e., genomically identical.

[Our heartfelt thanks to Antonio for providing these interesting details. Livestock anthrax is enzootic in Basilicata which has had some extensive epidemics in recent years.

Human infections via biting flies do occur though they are not frequent. The interesting aspect of the human case preceding the sheep deaths raises the question whether the shepherd was infected from the flies feeding on the 2 sheep incubating disease or was it from a common bacteraemic source outside the flock. Only time and foot work will determine the answer to that question.

Carcasses are usually buried in Basilicata and Antonio has frequently demonstrated that viable spores can be recovered from such grave sites. If such a site had developed forage a grazing sheep could well have come infected grazing it.
