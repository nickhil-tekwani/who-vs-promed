Walnut trees threatened at Hidoussa
-----------------------------------
Farmers in the region of Hidoussa [north eastern Algeria, Batna
province] are asking for help to save what is left of their walnut
trees which are being ravaged by a mysterious illness. "About 2 or 3
years ago we started to see that our trees were no longer as
profitable as before. The leaves fall early giving the tree no chance
to bear fruit," explains one farmer. The affected area spans tens of
hectares.

Small scale farmers are being forced to remove their walnut trees and
replace them with other crops. "They cannot afford losses over several
consecutive seasons, but those like me, who have more land, keep their
trees. Mine were planted in 1973, others have trees that are over 100
years old," said the farmer. Hidoussa has long been famous for its
walnuts. They were sold and there was unlimited supply. The problem
seriously affects the income of smallholder farmers.

"We contacted the authorities and a technical team was sent and took
samples. All we heard afterwards was that the trees need to be treated
regularly with specific products. But the problem is that the walnut
trees are very high, exceeding 20 metres [65 ft] in some cases," said
another local. The state must intervene with significant resources to
save the walnut trees, which are of such economic and cultural
importance to the region.

[There are several cultivated walnut (_Juglans_) species, but _J.
regia_ (European, English, French, or Persian walnut) is likely to be
the species referred to above. A similar range of diseases affects the
different species of walnut. Pathogens reported so far include a range
of fungi, several bacteria and nematodes, and one virus (_Cherry leaf
roll virus_). Premature leaf fall, as reported above, can be caused by
a number of the pathogens. It is not clear what 'specific products'
where recommended to treat the trees and whether they are even
effective if applied correctly. Reliable diagnosis is essential to
address the problems in Hidoussa.
