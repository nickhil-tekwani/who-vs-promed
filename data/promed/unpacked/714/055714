A Health Surveillance team of the Office of Regional Health of
Tangara da Serra is investigating 2 suspected cases of hantavirus
[infection] recorded in recent days in the municipality, where one of
them died. Although the patients are from farms in the region, and
were attended to in Tangara Serra, there is still no confirmation of
the exact location where they possibly could have contracted the
disease [pathogen].

The coordinator of the Regional Office of Health of Tangara da Serra,
Edna Girotto, explained that with the dry season, the concern [for
hantavirus infections] increases due to the fact it is in this season
that cases of the disease become manifest with more intensity, and
the risk of infection is much greater. Despite all preventive work
and orientation done in other municipalities, according to Edna, people
have not yet become aware of the importance of keeping the areas clean
where they live, avoiding the presence of the rodent [reservoir] host.

As the coordinating [unit], the Regional Health Pole [unit], has
offered training for other municipalities such as Barra do Bugres,
Campo Novo do Parecis, [and] Sapezal Sendo, which already have a
health surveillance team. Now smaller municipalities, such as New
Olympia, and Port St. Alphonsus Estrela, have a regional team that
helps in preventive work and orientation.

[The suspected hantaviruses in these cases is not given in this
report. The ProMED-mail report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008
(ProMED archive no. 20080223.07412) indicated that hantaviruses
circulating in Mato Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which has the
_Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos which had
previously been found in Para state, but without a known host there.
Field research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys
moojeni_ was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus. A brief
description of other hantaviruses that occur in Brazil and their
rodent hosts are given in ProMED archive no. 20080702.2020.

ProMED would appreciate receiving further information about the
confirmation of the etiological agent(s) involved in these 2 cases.
