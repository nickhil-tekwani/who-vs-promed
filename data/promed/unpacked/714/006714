The Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) reports that the conjunctivitis outbreak that began earlier in [May 2014] continues unabated with a total of 248 cases reported by health care providers.

The week ending [24 May 2014] saw the greatest number of conjunctivitis cases reported to date for 2014 with 110 reported. All ages are being affected with the youngest patient being less than 1 month and the oldest being 82 years of age. Both sexes are affected but males outnumber females slightly by 114 to 107 cases.

Conjunctivitis causes inflammation (swelling) of the conjunctiva -- the thin layer that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. Conjunctivitis is often called "pink eye" or "red eye" because it can cause the white of the eye to take on a pink or red color. The most common causes of conjunctivitis are viruses, bacteria, and allergens. Other causes include: chemicals, fungi, air pollution, and foreign objects, such as contact lenses.

What can be done to prevent the spread of conjunctivitis?
- Wash your hands often with soap and warm water or an alcohol based hand rub, especially after handling contaminated items, such as linens and eyeglasses;
- avoid touching or rubbing your eyes;
- wash any discharge from around the eyes several times a day. Wash hands first;
- use a clean washcloth or fresh cotton ball/tissue to cleanse the eye area;
- wash your hands with soap and warm water when done;
- wash hands before and after applying eye drops or ointment;
- do not use the same eye drop dispenser/bottle for infected and non-infected eyes (even for the same person);
- wash linens in hot water and detergent;
- avoid sharing articles like towels, blankets, and pillowcases;
- clean eyeglasses;
- do not share face make-up and make-up brushes, contact lenses and containers, or eyeglasses.
- do not use swimming pools when infected.

Contact your doctor if you notice any signs or symptoms you think might be pink eye. These may include redness, itchiness, excessive tearing, or a gritty feeling in one or both eyes. A discharge in one or both eyes that forms a crust during the night may prevent your or eyes from opening in the morning if you have conjunctivitis.

To avoid re-infection:
- Throw away and replace any eye or face makeup you used while infected;
- replace contact lens solutions that you used while your eyes were infected;
- throw away disposable contact lenses and cases that were used while your eyes were infected;
- clean extended wear lenses as directed;
- clean eyeglasses and cases that were used while infected.

REMEMBER, good personal hygiene -- especially frequent hand washing and avoiding rubbing your eyes -- are the most important steps you can take to minimize the spread of conjunctivitis.

[Conjunctivitis is commonly referred to as "red" or "pink" eye, a sign of inflammation that is usually accompanied by a discharge of varying viscosity. Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water). Outbreaks of conjunctivitis are commonly due to viruses, adenoviruses being a common cause (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf).

A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A mucopurulent or purulent discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggests a more serious disease process such as keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea. However, the news report above does not give us a clinical description of the outbreak cases.

Conjunctivitis due to adenoviruses may be accompanied by upper respiratory tract infection, common cold, or sore throat and is spread through hand-to-eye contact or by contact with objects, such as ophthalmologic equipment, that are contaminated with infectious tears, eye discharge, or respiratory discharges. There may be prolonged shedding of adenovirus; a person can be contagious a few days before developing symptoms to approximately 14 days after symptom onset; and adenovirus may be resistant to many common disinfectants and can remain viable for long periods in the environment (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf). Treatment of adenoviral conjunctivitis is supportive.

Guam is a US territory and the largest and southernmost island of the Mariana Islands. The rest of the Mariana archipelago is the US Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The Chamorro are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands. Guamanians are United States citizens and have a non-voting delegate to the US House of Representatives (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam).
