The number of hepatitis A cases linked to frozen berries sold at a warehouse grocery store has doubled in less than a week. "The 61 cases are spread over 7 states," said Dr Rebecca Sunenshine with Maricopa County Public Health. "We have 9 cases total in Arizona, 7 of which are in Maricopa County."

Costco pulled Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend frozen berry mix from shelves after the news of the outbreak. Sunenshine said anyone who consumed the berries within 14 days can get a vaccine to prevent illness, if it's been longer the vaccine will be ineffective. "For those folks, you need to watch for symptoms of hepatitis A and if there are any concerns, see your healthcare provider," she said.

Hepatitis A is a viral disease that affects the liver. It develops 2 to 6 weeks after exposure. Disease symptoms include: fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin. Maricopa County Public Health is offering free hepatitis A vaccines.

[2] Pomegranate seeds ex Turkey

The hepatitis A outbreak linked to contaminated frozen berries is now affecting 7 states. It affected 60 percent of women ages 2 to 71. The 1st 5 states to report the incidence of the outbreak are Nevada, Colorado, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. Now, Utah and Hawaii are the latest addition to the list, according to the officials of CDC. The HAV [hepatitis A virus] contaminated frozen berries came from the pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey. The FDA inspected the facilities of Townsend Farms in Fairview, Oregon and found that the pomegranate seeds mixed with other frozen fruits are associated with the outbreak.

Costco already recalled for the entire frozen berries' product out of their shelves and called the purchasers by phone to notify them about the hepatitis A outbreak. The FDA reports that between 4 and 30 May 2013, 1157 bags of organic Antioxidant Blend were sold in Nevada, and 333 000 bags nationwide between January and May 2013. Aside from pomegranate seeds from Turkey, the FDA is also investigating the production, as well as other sources of the berry mix supply from Argentina, the US, and Chile.

The CDC, FDA, and HHSA [Health and Human Services Agency] are warning the public not to consume these berry mixes and report any symptoms of infection to the authorities. The CDC also reported at the end of April [2013] was the start of the outbreak. The same genetic makeup of HAV was identified in the European outbreak tied to the frozen blend mix this year [2013], and the last year's outbreak in British Colombia tied to a frozen fruit blend with pomegranate seeds imported from Egypt.

[It seems that the hepatitis A virus contamination of this product can been attributed to the inclusion of pomegranate seeds in the frozen berries product. Genotyping of the viruses responsible for this outbreak, and the earlier outbreaks in Canada and Europe has revealed that the same virus strain was responsible for the outbreaks of disease in the 3 different locations. It is not known, however, if pomegranate seeds were present in the frozen berries product marketed in Europe.

Hepatitis A virus infection is a highly contagious disease. The virus can spread through contaminated water and food from someone who is already infected. While the symptoms are the same, it can attack the liver in different ways. Hepatitis A appears as an acute or newly occurring infection but it does not become chronic. Mild cases of hepatitis A do not require treatment and people who were infected can recover without any permanent liver damage. WHO reports that hepatitis A is one of the most common causes of food borne infection affecting 1.4 million people every year. The incubation period is 14 to 28 days and may show symptoms such as mild to severe fever, loss of appetite, jaundice, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and nausea. Hepatitis A virus can survive outside the body for months. It is relatively resistant to gamma irradiation, heat inactivation, chemical germicides, and in certain conditions survives in dried feces, sea water, and live oysters. Hepatitis A virus can retain its infectivity for several days on vegetables and fruits, which are often consumed raw. It can survive indefinitely in frozen fruit. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A virus infection, but vaccination with hepatitis A virus vaccine can prevent infection if administered within 2 weeks of exposure, according to CDC. - Mod.CP]
