A 21-year-old student at the University of Canterbury has died after contracting meningococcal disease. Canterbury District Health medical officer of health, Dr Cheryl Brunton, confirmed today [27 Aug 2021] that the student died this week.

She reassured everyone connected to the student and the university that "the chance of anyone catching it is low." Students who are close contacts are on antibiotics, have been notified and are in good health. "I express my sincerest condolences to the person's family and ask that their request for privacy is respected as they come to terms with the passing of their family member," Brunton said.

"Unlike COVID-19 or measles, which are highly contagious, meningococcal disease is hard to catch. The bacteria pass from one person to another through secretions from the nose or throat, during close or prolonged contact. Members of the same household as a person who has the disease are at the highest risk of getting it. The community and public health team has identified those close contacts of the person who require antibiotics, to prevent them developing meningococcal disease."

"Our team is working closely with the University of Canterbury, which the person attended, to provide information to students and staff," Brunton said. "Being in the same room as someone with meningococcal disease does not mean you will catch it."

University of Canterbury executive director for people, culture and campus, Paul O'Flaherty added: "We offer our deepest condolences to the student's family, friends and loved ones. His family has requested privacy. The University of Canterbury's pastoral care team is supporting the student's flatmates, friends and whanau [Maori, extended family] at this time. With the consent of his family, we have advised the wider university community of staff and students, including information about meningococcal disease."

Meningococcal disease is a fast-moving illness. "It's a bacterial infection that can cause 2 very serious illnesses: meningitis (an infection of the membranes that cover the brain) and septicaemia (blood poisoning). It can affect anyone, but it's more common in children under the age of 5, teenagers, and young adults," Brunton said. "Up to 15% of people carry the bacteria that cause meningococcal disease in their nose and throat without being sick. In some people, for reasons we don't fully understand, these bacteria sometimes go on to cause disease, spreading through the bloodstream (causing blood poisoning) or to the brain (causing meningitis). The bacteria are spread in secretions from the nose or throat by coughing, sneezing and kissing.

[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, X, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. "In New Zealand from 2015 to 2017, [sero]groups B and C were the most frequent causes of meningococcal disease. However, this has changed since 2018 with an increase in disease caused by groups W or Y. Over 2018-2019, just under half of cases were caused by meningococcal group B, and just under half by groups C, W or Y. Meningococcal group A rarely causes disease in New Zealand" (https://www.immune.org.nz/diseases/meningococcal-disease).

There are 2 funded meningococcal vaccines available in New Zealand: a vaccine that covers only serogroup B meningococci (Bexsero) and a tetravalent conjugated vaccine that covers serogroups A, C, W and Y, but not B.

The meningococcal ACWY vaccine (Menactra) is fully funded in New Zealand for:
- Children, teenagers and adults with weakened immune systems who are at risk of meningococcal disease or who are a close contact of someone with meningococcal disease; and
- Individuals aged 13 to 25 years in a close-living situation who are within the next 3 months or are in their 1st year of living in boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, military barracks or prisons (https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/medicines/m/meningococcal-vaccine/).

The meningococcal B vaccine is also fully funded in New Zealand for:
- Children, teenagers and adults with weakened immune systems who are at risk of meningococcal disease, having had meningococcal disease of any serogroup, or are a close contact of someone with meningococcal disease, but not for those in a close-living situation (https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/medicines/m/meningococcal-vaccine/).

The news report above does not tell us about the serogroup of the meningococcus causing the University of Canterbury student's infection or the meningococcal immunization status of this student.

The University of Canterbury is located in the city of Christchurch, the seat of the Canterbury region and the South Island's largest city and the country's second-largest urban area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury,_New_Zealand#Education). University of Canterbury students are housed in 5 fully catered halls of residence exclusively for 1st-year undergraduate students, and 5 other self-catered student accommodation houses that are home to both undergraduate and postgraduate students (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Canterbury#Student_accommodation). - Mod.ML
