[1] US: hospital cases rise (2020)
Date: Mon 28 Jun 2021

An estimated 5319 more US COVID-19 patients were hospitalized each day after states began allowing nonessential businesses to reopen in spring 2020, but a rise in the death rate lagged by more than a month, a study late last week in JAMA Health Forum finds. [Gupta S, Georgiou A, Sen S, Simon K, Karaca-Mandic P. US Trends in COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization and Mortality Rates Before and After Reopening Economies. JAMA Health Forum. 2021;2(6):e211262. doi:10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.1262]

The study, led by a Purdue University researcher, used University of Minnesota COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project data on daily per-capita coronavirus-related hospitalizations in 47 states from [16 Apr to 31 Jul 2020]. The investigators also used data on daily state deaths collected by the New York Times and an interrupted time series design to estimate trends in daily hospitalizations and deaths before and after state reopenings.

Hospitalizations began rising after 12 days
-------------------------------------------
On average, the numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths per 100 000 people were 17.69 and 0.395, respectively, on the day restrictions were eased in each state. Afterward, about 1.61 people more per 100 000 were hospitalized, suggesting that another 5319 people were admitted each day after that point, the authors said.

While the death trend after reopening was significant and positive, the change from before to after the easing of restrictions was not significant, at 0.04 people per 100 000. Before business closure mandates were lifted, the daily COVID-19-related death rate was 0.395 per 100 000 people, it rose by 0.10 12 days later, becoming statistically significant after 35 days, at which point the death rate increased by 0.96 per 100 000 people.

Increases in deaths often lag increases in cases by 1 to 3 weeks, but data on the lag between a rise in hospitalizations and a higher death rate are more elusive. "Our findings that hospitalization and mortality trends were positive after reopenings supports the findings from studies showing reopenings were substantially associated with higher morbility, emphasizing the health outcomes associated with reopenings," the study authors wrote.

Phased vs immediate reopenings
------------------------------
All 47 states, which closed nonessential businesses and banned large gatherings in March and April [2020], had reopened by [1 Jun 2020]. But they did so in a variety of ways, including immediately reopening all businesses (16 states) and phased reopenings (31 states).

Compared with states that lifted restrictions immediately, states that reopened gradually had both higher rates of hospitalizations on the day they lifted restrictions (20.93 vs 9.95 per 100 000) and a stronger trend toward hospitalizations after reopening (1.40 vs -0.66; difference, 2.06). The researchers said their data could not reveal the reason for the discrepancy.

Stay-at-home orders were still in effect at the time of business reopenings in 37 states, while 10 states had already lifted those orders. A total of 35 states didn't require wearing face coverings in public, and 12 states required masks before or at the same time as state reopenings.

States with stay-at-home orders in place at reopening had higher rates of hospitalization than those with expired orders (18.9 vs 13.5 per 100 000), although the authors noted that the confidence intervals were large, which reflect greater uncertainty. Likewise, the relative rise in hospitalizations after reopening was also higher in states with stay-at-home mandates (1.49 vs - 0.01; difference, 1.50). Changes in hospitalization rates were not significantly different between states with and without mask mandates at reopening.

"Because a major risk of COVID-19 was exceeding the capacity of the health care infrastructure, a better understanding of the projections of COVID-19-related health care use is valuable, especially for the future waves of the pandemic," the researchers said.

"Our findings provide quantifiable evidence to hospital systems, health care professionals, and policy makers to help project and remain aware of needs for ensuring adequate hospital capacity and care as states continue to further open or close activities."

[2] Long lasting immunity
Date: Mon 28 Jun 2021
Source: New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/health/coronavirus-vaccines-immunity.html


Immune cells are still organizing to fight the coronavirus months after inoculation, scientists reported. The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna set off a persistent immune reaction in the body that may protect against the coronavirus for years, scientists reported on [Mon 28 Jun 2021] .

The findings add to growing evidence that most people immunized with the mRNA vaccines may not need boosters, so long as the virus and its variants do not evolve much beyond their current forms -- which is not guaranteed. People who recovered from COVID-19 before being vaccinated may not need boosters even if the virus does make a significant transformation.

"It's a good sign for how durable our immunity is from this vaccine," said Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who led the study, which was published in the journal Nature [see below].

The study did not consider the coronavirus vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson, but Dr. Ellebedy said he expected the immune response to be less durable than that produced by mRNA vaccines.

Dr. Ellebedy and his colleagues reported last month [May 2021] that in people who survived COVID-19, immune cells that recognize the virus lie quiescent in the bone marrow for at least 8 months after infection. A study by another team indicated that so-called memory B cells continue to mature and strengthen for at least a year after infection.

Based on those findings, researchers suggested that immunity might last for years, possibly a lifetime, in people who were infected with the coronavirus and later vaccinated. But it was unclear whether vaccination alone might have a similarly long-lasting effect.

Dr. Ellebedy's team sought to address that question by looking at the source of memory cells: the lymph nodes, where immune cells train to recognize and fight the virus.

After an infection or a vaccination, a specialized structure called the germinal center forms in lymph nodes. This structure is an elite school of sorts for B cells -- a boot camp where they become increasingly sophisticated and learn to recognize a diverse set of viral genetic sequences. The broader the range and the longer these cells have to practice, the more likely they are to be able to thwart variants of the virus that may emerge.

"Everyone always focuses on the virus evolving -- this is showing that the B cells are doing the same thing," said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. "And it's going to be protective against ongoing evolution of the virus, which is really encouraging."

After infection with the coronavirus, the germinal center forms in the lungs. But after vaccination, the cells' education takes place in lymph nodes in the armpits, within reach of researchers. Dr. Ellebedy and his colleagues recruited 41 people -- including 8 with a history of infection with the virus -- who were immunized with 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. From 14 of these people, the team extracted samples from the lymph nodes at 3, 4, 5, 7 and 15 weeks after the 1st dose.

That painstaking work makes this a "heroic study," said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale. "This kind of careful time-course analysis in humans is very difficult to do."

Dr. Ellebedy's team found that 15 weeks after the 1st dose of vaccine, the germinal center was still highly active in all 14 of the participants, and that the number of memory cells that recognized the coronavirus had not declined. "The fact that the reactions continued for almost 4 months after vaccination -- that's a very, very good sign," Dr. Ellebedy said. Germinal centers typically peak 1 to 2 weeks after immunization, and then wane.

"Usually by 4 to 6 weeks, there's not much left," said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona. But germinal centers stimulated by the mRNA vaccines are "still going, months into it, and not a lot of decline in most people."

Dr. Bhattacharya noted that most of what scientists know about the persistence of germinal centers is based on animal research. The new study is the first to show what happens in people after vaccination.

The results suggest that a vast majority of vaccinated people will be protected over the long term -- at least, against the existing coronavirus variants. But older adults, people with weak immune systems and those who take drugs that suppress immunity may need boosters; people who survived COVID-19 and were later immunized may never need them at all.

Exactly how long the protection from mRNA vaccines will last is hard to predict. In the absence of variants that sidestep immunity, in theory immunity could last a lifetime, experts said. But the virus is clearly evolving.

"Anything that would actually require a booster would be variant-based, not based on waning of immunity," Dr. Bhattacharya said. "I just don't see that happening."

People who were infected with the coronavirus and then immunized see a major boost in their antibody levels, most likely because their memory B cells -- which produce antibodies -- had many months to evolve before vaccination.

The good news: A booster vaccine will probably have the same effect as prior infection in immunized people, Dr. Ellebedy said. "If you give them another chance to engage, they will have a massive response," he said, referring to memory B cells.

In terms of bolstering the immune system, vaccination is "probably better" than recovering from the actual infection, he said. Other studies have suggested that the repertoire of memory B cells produced after vaccination is more diverse than that generated by infection, suggesting that the vaccines will protect better against variants than natural immunity alone.

Dr. Ellebedy said the results also suggested that these signs of persistent immune reaction might be caused by mRNA vaccines alone, as opposed to those made by more traditional means, like Johnson & Johnson's. But that is an unfair comparison, because the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given as a single dose, Dr. Iwasaki said: "If the J & J had a booster, maybe it will induce this same kind of response."

Abstract
"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are approx. 95% effective in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (1-5). The dynamics of antibody secreting plasmablasts (PBs) and germinal centre (GC) B cells induced by these vaccines in humans remain unclear. We examined antigen-specific B cell responses in peripheral blood (n=41) and draining lymph nodes (LNs) in 14 individuals who received 2 doses of BNT162b2, an mRNA-based vaccine encoding full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene (1). Circulating IgG- and IgA-secreting PBs targeting the S protein peaked one week after the 2nd immunization then declined, becoming undetectable 3weeks later. These PB responses preceded maximal levels of serum anti-S binding and neutralizing antibodies to an early circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as emerging variants, especially in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, who produced the most robust serologic responses.

"By examining fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of draining axillary LNs, we identified GC B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled after primary immunization. Remarkably, high frequencies of S-binding GC B cells and PBs were sustained in these draining LNs for at least 12 weeks after the booster immunization. S-binding GC B cell-derived monoclonal antibodies predominantly targeted the receptor binding domain of the S protein, with fewer clones binding to the N-terminal domain or to epitopes shared with the S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. The latter cross-reactive B cell clones had higher levels of somatic hypermutation compared to those that only recognized SARS-CoV-2 S protein, suggesting a memory B cell origin. Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity."

The results of the study are very exciting, but limitations on interpretation are the small sample size and the lack of tests against the Delta variant. The virus will keep evolving, and how broad the protection will be will need to be tested. The authors state that the vaccine leads to a greater repertoire of memory B cells than infection does, so that is promising. - Mod.LK]

Recommendations about COVID-19 risks related to holding the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games

An independent expert panel for COVID-19 response in Japan:
Hideaki Anan, Yuki Furuse, Hideki Hasegawa et al.

Note
This recommendation was originally released in Japanese on [18 Jun 2021].
This recommendation has been partly submitted to the Japan Medical Association Journal.

Summary
-------
1. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues through the duration of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo (hereinafter, the Games), it is necessary to avoid increases in the number of infected patients in communities and the resulting overwhelming of healthcare capacity until widespread vaccination can suppress the number of patients with severe symptoms. Even if vaccination efforts progress, it is possible that the number of patients with severe symptoms will increase again between [July and August 2021]. Additionally, the potential impact of new variants must be considered.

2. Compared with ordinary sporting events, the Games are in a league of their own in terms of scale and public attention. Additionally, the Games coincide with summer vacation and the nationwide Obon festival period. These conditions create risks for increased virus transmission and the overwhelming of healthcare systems resulting from the increased movement of people and social contact around the country triggered by the Games.

3. Depending on how spectators are admitted to the venues, there is also a risk of disseminating contradictory messaging to people around the country watching the Games at home. Organizers should consider this carefully when making decisions on the number of spectators who will be allowed at the venues.

4. We believe that the ideal option is to have no spectators in the venues at all, as the risk of transmission would be the lowest compared with other options. If spectators are to be allowed, the following three points should be considered:
a. Apply a stricter standard on the number of spectators allowed than what is currently set for large-scale events;
b. Limit spectators to area residents so as to minimize the flow of people and contact across prefectural lines. Additionally, the spectators should be limited to those who can adhere to prevention measures, including during travel to and from the venues;
c. If signs of increasing numbers of infections or strain upon healthcare capacities are detected, immediately and without hesitation switch to no spectators in the venues. Do not miss the opportunity to act before the situation worsens.

5. We would like for the Organizers to collaborate with government agencies to cancel supporting events and watch parties where crowds of unspecified numbers of people may gather, and to request that restaurants and bars refrain from hosting similar events with large crowds. Additionally, we request that the Organizers lead Japan in advocating for adapting available technology in new ways to enjoy sporting events that allow safely sharing the inspiration of sports around the globe.

6. The government should prepare to take necessary measures (such as declaring a state of emergency) if signs of an increase in COVID-19 infections or strain on healthcare capacities is detected, even if this occurs during the Games, without hesitation or missing the opportunity to act before the situation worsens.

7. The Organizers and the government must immediately share with the public and maintain public understanding of how the risks that have been communicated to them are being recognized, how such risks are going to be reduced, and what situations will result in more drastic measures.

[1] Introduction
----------------
- We are a voluntary independent group of experts who have been advising the government of Japan and prefectures regarding the COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020.

- We are neither in a position nor have the authority to make decisions on whether the Games should be cancelled or how the Games should be held.

- With that stated, moving forward with the Games could possibly put more stress on the country's healthcare system in addition to the existing risks of increased transmission and strained healthcare systems. As such, we believe that it is our duty to evaluate the risks associated with the Games and state our opinions; therefore, we have compiled these recommendations.

- These recommendations have 2 purposes: The first is to advise how to avoid an increase in COVID-19 transmission and overwhelming of healthcare systems during the Games and after [20 Jun 2021], when the state of emergency will be lifted in many areas, until such time as vaccination efforts result in the suppression in the number of patients with severe symptoms. The 2nd is to evaluate the direct and indirect risks associated with the Games so that Organizers and other stakeholders can make appropriate decisions. ...-more
