The incidence of Lyme disease [borreliosis] has increased in Russia.
The most affected area is Moscow city. However, the specialists
consider that most cases of tick bites in Muscovites occur outside the
city's border and there is no need for tick control chemicals in the
Moscow city parks.

Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human
Welfare] reports that the numbers of tick-borne encephalitis and
borreliosis cases are significantly higher this year [2010]. The
incidence of both diseases was up in 2009 by 32.4 percent and 26
percent, [respectively] compared with 2008 data. This underlines the
continuous worsening of the situation over the recent years. The area
of borreliosis spread is larger than that of tick-borne encephalitis.
Out of 732 tick-borne borreliosis cases in 2009 only 10 [1.4 percent]
were acquired within the Moscow city territory; 56 percent of cases
were acquired from Moscow oblast region, 40 percent of cases were
acquired from other regions of Russia, and 2.7 percent of cases came
from foreign countries.

[Rospotrebnadzor reports that the 4-month incidence of tick-borne
borreliosis was 0.11 per 100 000 population versus 0.08 for a similar
period in 2009. There were 158 Lyme disease cases this year (2010),
including 109 cases from January to April. Most cases occurred in
Moscow city (30), followed by Ulyanovsk oblast (17 cases), Lypetsk and
Kaliningrad oblasts (14 each), Moscow oblast (11), and the Republic of
Mordovia (8). - Corr.BA]

[One could suppose that the large number of cases diagnosed in Moscow
city is the result of a very large population with better diagnostic
facilities. - Mod.JW]

[Lyme disease is endemic for 72 federal administrative divisions of Russia
(out of 83). The area of Lyme disease spread is much wider than tickborne
encephalitis. The most prevalent vectors are taiga* ticks (_Ixodes
persulcatus_) and forest ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_). The taiga ticks have
more epidemiological significance and occur from the Leningrad and Novgorod
regions in the west to Southern Sakhalin in the east. The natural infection
rate in ticks ranges from 3 to 90 per cent. Most infections occur in
working age people and in schoolchildren during forest trips and garden
work. - Mod.NP
*Taiga = subarctic, evergreen coniferous forest]
