Five new cases of mad cow disease(Bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, BSE) have been discovered in Switzerland since
mid-October 1999, bringing the total number of such cases to 41
this year, according to the Federal Veterinary Office Friday.
The office said 4 of the cows were born after the ban on
contaminated animal feed was introduced in 1990.
Earlier this year, the government introduced rigorous testing of the
cattle.
In the past 10 years, a total of 323 cases were found in
Switzerland.

[What this article does not tell us is the age of the 4 animals born
after the feed ban was put into effect. Did the dams of these
animals receive contaminated feed? Perhaps someone in a
position of authority could tell us how old the animals were, as well
how these animals could have acquired it. - Mod.TG
