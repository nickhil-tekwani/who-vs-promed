Pseudomonas outbreak linked to bronchoscope defect
--------------------------------------------------
Defective bronchoscopes appear to be responsible for a large outbreak of
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infection that occurred at Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore, MD, USA between 2001 and 2002, according to new study
findings. The duration of this outbreak may have been shortened with more
effective recall methods, the authors note. As it turns out, a recall
letter on the bronchoscopes was sent to health facilities in November 2001.
However, because the letter was not sent to individual physicians, many
continued to use the scopes. At Johns Hopkins, the scopes were not removed
from service until February 2002.
The recall letter was issued in response to findings from researchers at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The investigators found that
47 per cent of the bronchoscopic specimens taken at a community hospital
between 1 Jul and 31 Oct 2001 tested positive for _P. aeruginosa_. All of
the positive specimens came from 1 of 3 bronchoscopes produced by Olympus
America.
The Johns Hopkins study and the study that prompted the recall are reported
in the 16 Jan 2003 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J
Med 2003; 348: 214-20.
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/348/3/214>). In the study
that prompted the recall, Dr William Schaffner and colleagues assessed the
incidence of bronchoscopy-related _P. aeruginosa_ and _Serratia marcescens_
isolation at a small community hospital. Nearly half of the bronchoscopy
specimens tested positive for _P. aeruginosa_. Moreover, nearly a third of
the _P. aeruginosa_- positive specimens also yielded _S. marcescens_. All
of the positive specimens came from bronchoscopes with biopsy port caps
that appeared to be too loose. In the Johns Hopkins study, 414 patients
underwent bronchoscopy during the outbreak period and 39 developed a
respiratory or bloodstream infection, lead author Dr Arjun Srinivasan and
colleagues note. In more than half of these cases, _P. aeruginosa_ was
thought to be the causative organism. The authors believe that a
contaminated bronchoscope may have played a role in the deaths of 3 patients.
Prior to the outbreak, the rate of _P. aeruginosa_ isolation from
bronchoalveolar lavage specimens was 10.4 per cent. During the outbreak,
this rate rose dramatically to 31 per cent. More than 25 different sites in
and around the endoscopy suites were tested for _P. aeruginosa_
colonization and yielded negative results. When the bronchoscopes
themselves were tested, however, 3 of the 10 scopes tested positive for _P.
aeruginosa_.
After use of the defective bronchoscopes was discontinued in February 2002,
_P. aeruginosa_ isolation rates subsequently returned to pre-outbreak
levels. Taken together, the findings suggest that more needs to be done to
ensure the safety of medical devices, the researchers note. "The regulation
of devices used for medical procedures should be as rigorous as the
regulation of drugs prescribed by doctors," Dr Srinivasan said in a Johns
Hopkins statement.
