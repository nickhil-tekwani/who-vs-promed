All signs point to the potato salad, or more likely one of the raw ingredients that go into it, as being the cause of the _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak that sickened some 60 people on the Fond du Lac Reservation in July 2014. According to word from Doug Schultz, spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health, on Wed 6 Aug 2014, the investigation has revealed that the illness came from 3 separate events, the Elders' Picnic, a private wedding, and a 3-day conference. All were held on the reservation between the dates of 11-16 Jul 2014, and all were catered by the same entity.

"After interviewing a good percentage of the people involved," said Schultz, "there are clear indications that the potato salad was the likely vehicle for the illness," which he added came from the O157 strain of _E. coli_.

The investigation unveiled, however, that potato salad was only served at 2 of the 3 events, which leads investigators to suspect a raw products that goes into the salad, such as celery or onions. "We haven't yet been able to definitely prove just what that was," said Schultz. "At first, we thought it was the celery, but we were unable to find any pathogens on the celery we tested." He added that doesn't mean celery wasn't necessarily the culprit, however, because all of the contaminated celery may have already been consumed by the time the testing took place.

Schultz said the last case on the reservation was reported on 20 Jul 2014, which leads him to believe the outbreak is probably over with by now. He confirmed there were no deaths associated with the outbreak. Though the name of the caterer involved has not been released, Schultz said an investigation revealed the catering operation to be "very well done."

"There were no red flags," he said, "no signs of any cross contamination. If we find any contamination occurred in the field, however, we have an issue." Schultz said it's possible that the investigation may not yield any further information at this point, but he said the Department is still looking into the raw products involved in the potato salad.

"It's possible we may still find that smoking gun," he admitted.
