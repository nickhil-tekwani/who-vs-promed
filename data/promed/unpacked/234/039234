Widespread flu cases a 'continuing trend' in Alabama
---------------------------------------------
The Alabama Department of Public Health [ADPH] has reported seeing an increase in the amount of flu cases being sent to the state lab to be identified and confirmed. "It's a continuing trend," said Cory Kirkland, assistant administrator with the ADPH. "We have widespread influenza-like illnesses across the state, right now. I expect we'll see even more." While people presenting with symptoms are already being treated, information is confirmed by the state lab and then forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control so accurate predictions can be made when it comes to how much of the flu vaccine will be needed next year.

Kirkland said Alabama has not had so many flu cases this early in the season since 2003-2004. "It's not too late to get a flu vaccination. The people who are really at risk are the elderly, anyone over 65, people who have pulmonary or lung conditions, people who have diabetes and pregnant women," said Dr. Robert Gilliam, medical director at South Alabama Rural Health Associates. "Anyone over 6 months of age, the CDC recommends they get vaccinated."

And there's more that Pike County residents can do to protect themselves. "Careful, careful hygiene is important," Gilliam said. "Wash your hands. I don't recommend drinking out of a public fountain." It's also a good idea to use hand sanitizer, Gilliam said, noting that hands must be wet with the sanitizer for 15 seconds for the product to be effective. "Practice social distancing," Kirkland said. "Make sure you are not drinking and eating after someone."

Widespread cases of influenza reported
---------------------------------
The state Department of Health is urging all residents to get a flu shot, as the number of influenza cases has begun to increase at both the local and national levels. The state reporting that influenza activity has been upgraded from sporadic to more widespread in Rhode Island, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported significant increases in flu activity throughout the country in the last 2 weeks.

A flu vaccine is generally recommended for people ages 6 months and older. Symptoms of influenza can include fever, cough, head and body aches, fatigue and runny nose. Some people also have vomiting and diarrhoea.

Onondaga County reported flu cases passes 2009 swine flu record
---------------------------------------
The flu is spreading throughout Onondaga County at the fastest and most prevalent rate since the 2009 swine flu. The number of lab-confirmed cases in Onondaga County rose to 210 last week, up from 95 cases the week before, reported The Post-Standard. But many people who have the flu do not seek treatment, so this number could be substantially higher. In 2009, the number of reported cases in Onondaga County exceeded 350 in a single week, reported The Post-Standard. This year's flu season [2012] started earlier than usual and the virus is spreading quickly. The number of flu cases in Onondaga County has doubled every week since October, reported The Post-Standard.

There has been a significant increase in flu activity in the United States in the past 2 weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared 2-8 Dec 2012 National Influenza Vaccination Week and is urging people to get vaccinated against the flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

Some flu viruses can live up to 2 hours on surfaces such as desks, phones and doorknobs, a nurse practitioner said. She added that it is important to wash hands frequently using warm water and soap. If possible, one should avoid touching one's face because the eyes, nose and mouth are entry ports for flu viruses.

It is also important for students to limit alcohol intake during finals week because alcohol is dehydrating, making one even more prone to catching the flu, she said. Students who think they may have the flu should call Health Services and make an appointment. "We have dealt with flu for many years and deal with as many flu cases as may present (themselves) during a usual flu season."

http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/Flu-Outbreak-Hasnt-Reached-Barren-River-Area-182278751.html?ref=751


Nationally the CDC is seeing outbreaks of the flu popping up throughout the south
----------------------------------
"The level of activity that we are seeing right now, we normally don't see until the end of December. So, it seems to have arrived a little bit early this year," says Tom Skinner, Public Information Officer for the CDC. Locally, Monroe County has experienced its own flu outbreak, and even had to close down the schools for the remainder of the week. Fortunately, that outbreak has not reached the Barren River Area yet. "We are not in an outbreak situation. We have typical flu activity going on that we see every year," says Crissy Rowland with the Barren River District Health Department.

The health department says the H3N2 strain is the only known type of flu in Kentucky. "It's a type of flu that is currently in the vaccine this year so if you have received a shot you are currently protected from that," Rowland says.

Doctor's offices and clinics in the area have seen several cases of the flu this week. "Most of our patients that we see here are having high fevers, a lot of the vomiting that's going on, and the waiting room is usually very packed," says Angela Jessie, nurse practitioner for All About You Urgent Care. Jessie says the early flu season may mean more cases going into the new year. "Last flu season [2011] we did not see a lot of flu cases at all. The flu season last year was very light, but I think the flu season will make up for that and then some," Jessie says. Our area may not be in an outbreak situation, but that doesn't mean the wide-spreading virus won't infect us this season. "We want everyone to get a flu shot because you protect yourself, you protect the community," Rowland says. Rowland says getting your flu shot may prevent a major outbreak.

Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, and Mississippi are currently experiencing the nation's biggest flu outbreaks.

[These sporadic reports, although not accompanied by any specific diagnostic detail, seem to confirm the the winter influenza epidemic has begun in many parts of North America. In contrast elsewhere in the northern hemisphere the onset of the winter influenza season is still awaited.

The Euroflu Weekly Electronic Bulletin for week 48/2012 that (http://www.euroflu.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi) reports that: "Influenza activity in the WHO European Region remains at a pre-season level, with countries reporting sporadic detections of influenza viruses predominantly in western Europe. Influenza B was detected in more than half of the cases testing positive for influenza this week. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remains stable, with one case related to influenza A reported this week."

Likewise the ECDC Weekly influenza surveillance overview for 7 Dec 2012 (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/influenza-weekly-surveillance-overview-07-dec-2012.pdf) states that: "In week 48/2012, all 28 countries reporting experienced low-intensity activity of influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection. Of 520 sentinel specimens tested across 21 countries, 46 (8.8 percent) were positive for influenza virus.

This is an increase compared with week 47/2012 when 3.1 percent of specimens were positive. Of the influenza virus detections in sentinel specimens since week 40/2012, 46 percent were type A and 54 percent were type B viruses. Of the A viruses subtyped, 2/3 were A(H3) and 1/3 were A(H1). The number of respiratory syncytial virus detections continued to increase in week 48. No hospitalised laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported in week 48. The proportion of sentinel specimens positive for influenza virus has increased since the early weeks of the season, but there is still little epidemiological evidence of sustained influenza virus transmission in EU/EEA countries." - Mod.CP
