_Bactericera cockerelli_ (Hemiptera: Triozidae -- EPPO A1 List), vector of zebra chip disease, was first reported in several provinces of Ecuador in March 2019 (EPPO RS 2019/92) but at that time '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum' (Solanaceae haplotypes included in the EPPO A1 List) had not been detected.

In June 2019, symptoms such as yellowing and upward rolling in leaves and browning of vascular tissues and streaks at the medullary area in tubers were observed in potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) fields located in the Pichincha province. High population levels of _B. cockerelli_ were associated with the occurrence of these symptoms. '_Ca._ L. solanacearum' haplotype A was detected in two potato samples taken from symptomatic potato plants as well as from specimens of _B. cockerelli_ using conventional PCR. The identity of the pathogen was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During August to December 2019, symptoms resembling those of '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) were observed in commercial fields of tamarillo (_Solanum betaceum_) and cape gooseberry (_Physalis peruviana_) in Pichincha and Imbabura provinces of Ecuador. Symptoms in tamarillo were pink coloration of new leaves (less than 10% incidence) and shoot proliferation (ca. 30% incidence), similar to those described in New Zealand [see link below], and wilting in young plants (ca. 40% incidence), a symptom previously undescribed. Symptoms in cape gooseberry were purpling (ca. 20% incidence) and yellowing leaves (ca. 50% incidence). No symptoms were described in cape gooseberry previously. High population densities of _B. cockerelli_ were observed in both crops.

Diseased and asymptomatic tamarillo and cape gooseberry were tested for presence of Lso. 6 composite diseased samples (10 plants per sample each; 3 tamarillo and 1 cape gooseberry from Pichincha, 2 tamarillo from Imbabura) were taken from different symptomatic trees. For each crop in both provinces one composite asymptomatic sample (5 plants per sample) was tested. Conventional PCR was done [and] amplicons of the expected size for Lso (1.1 kb) were observed from all diseased samples. No amplification was observed for asymptomatic samples.

Six positive amplicons were sequenced. The 16S rRNA gene showed 100% nucleotide identity to the corresponding sequence of Lso strains from potato in Ecuador. Phylogeny revealed that all sequences in this study were grouped with the clade belonging to Lso. This is the 1st report of Lso haplotype A association with wilting in tamarillo, and yellowing and purpling leaves in cape gooseberry. These findings will support governmental plans to minimise the impact of the disease.

[_Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso) was found to be associated with zebra chip (ZC) of potato, as well as a yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum in New Zealand. Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops and some crops in the family Apiaceae. Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _B. trigonica_) in Apiaceae.

The current Lso species is divided into haplotypes: A and B affecting Solanaceae; C, D, and E affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from North America and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes have been reported from Europe (ProMED-mail posts 20120713.1199961, 20151009.3702151, 20161130.4666613), northern Africa (ProMED-mail post 20141121.2978030) and the Middle East (ProMED-mail post 20170130.4803773). Potato haplotypes A & B are still considered absent from the European/Mediterranean region. However, haplotype E was recently also detected in potatoes in Spain [ProMED-mail post 20170802.5222241], representing the 1st report of a haplotype being able to infect both Apiaceae and Solanaceae.

Additional haplotypes, hosts and vector species are being reported (ProMED-mail post 20190226.6336285) from different regions, further adding to the complexity of the epidemiology and biology of this pathogen. Item [2] above may add to the information on these aspects by reporting symptoms in tamarillo and physalis, after these species had previously been reported as asymptomatic or with different symptoms (see link below). More research is needed on Lso, its global distribution and any potential biosecurity implications.

Only a few members of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter have been characterised so far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). However, contrary to Lso, greening has a narrow host range limited to citrus crops, due to the host specificity of its psyllid vectors.
