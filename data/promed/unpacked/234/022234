Jizzakh [province] doctors have been making house calls in the province telling parents not to let their children outside, while other medical personnel have been seen shooting the infected animals.

Mass rabies infections have been observed in at least 2 Jizzakh districts -- Bakhmalsky and Gallyaarsky.

Local residents told an Uznews.net correspondent that the 1st cases of dogs attacking humans occurred in the village of Saroj in the Gallyaarsky district. The phenomenon then spread to the Bakhmalsky region where a 13-year old girl has been attacked.

Local doctors are confirming that rabies has spread among many animals in the region, including cows and sheep.

The local medical services are currently trying to capture and eliminate stray dogs and cats as well as livestock [a photo shows sheep] with signs of rabies.

The news has spread to the province's center, the city of Jizzakh, where some residents have also been warned not to let their children outside.

[Uzbekistan's province of Jizzakh (Jizzax) is situated north-east of Samarkand; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UZ-Jizzax.PNG and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2338521,36017.

Rabies is known to be endemic in Uzbekistan, but updated information on the incidence of the disease is lacking. Though OIE members are obliged to submit 6-monthly and annual reports on their animal disease (including rabies) situation, no reports have been submitted by Uzbekistan since mid-2008. According to the last 6-monthly report (available at http://tinyurl.com/oa3eovz), covering the period January-June 2008, rabies was present in dogs, cattle and "fauna" (wildlife), no quantitative information provided. The number of dogs vaccinated during the said 6 months was given as 350 700.

During previous years, the situation was reportedly similar, dog vaccinations given as 891 212 (2007), 688 985 (2006) and 598 640 (2005). According to the reports, vaccination was also applied in fauna. We would welcome confirmation of wildlife (oral?) vaccination in Uzbekistan, details, and additional information on the rabies situation there, in animals and humans, since July 2008.

CDC Health Information for Travelers to Uzbekistan includes the following updated text:

"Rabies can be found in dogs, bats, and other mammals in Uzbekistan, so CDC recommends rabies vaccine for the following groups:
- Travelers involved in outdoor and other activities (such as camping, hiking, biking, adventure travel, and caving) that put them at risk for animal bites.
- People who will be working with or around animals (such as veterinarians, wildlife professionals, and researchers).
- People who are taking long trips or moving to Uzbekistan.
- Children, because they tend to play with animals, might not report bites, and are more likely to have animal bites on their head and neck." - Mod.AS]
