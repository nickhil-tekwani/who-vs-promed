Whirling disease detected in Clark's Fork River
------------------------------------------------
The parasite that causes whirling disease has been detected in trout in the
Clark's Fork River east of Yellowstone National Park for the first time.
Trout from Bennett Creek, which empties into the river below a fish
hatchery near Clark, and the Clark's Fork itself tested positive for the
disease when sampled in October, Game and Fish Department biologist Jason
Burkhart said.
The disease was not present in the hatchery, which is fed by springs, but
authorities said it was difficult to predict what long-term effects the
disease could have on it.
Whirling disease attacks the cartilage of young fish, particularly in the
head and spine. Infected fish develop a black tail and deformed spine and
sometimes swim in endless circles.
Rainbow trout are the most vulnerable to the parasite, but all trout
species seem to have some level of susceptibility, according to Game and
Fish officials.
Older fish can also contract the disease, but are not as susceptible
because their skeletons have hardened, Burkhart said.
Biologists first detected the disease in Germany in 1893. It showed up in
Pennsylvania in 1958, and since then has migrated west and is now present
in 22 states. Trout populations in some parts of Colorado, Idaho and
Montana have fallen sharply because of whirling disease, with some
drainages more drastically affected than others. Montana's Madison River,
for example, once held 2000 rainbow trout per mile. That number plunged to
200 per mile after whirling disease appeared.
Once the disease is detected in a drainage, it is there to stay, Burkhart
said. "We have to manage around it," he said.
Authorities said people can help prevent the spread of whirling disease by
washing mud from boats, trailers, waders and float tubes before leaving a
river or lake. Anglers are also urged not to move water, mud, fish, or fish
parts from one river basin to another, and not to throw fish heads,
skeletons, or entrails into any body of water.
The disease was detected on the South Fork in 1996. The National Elk Refuge
near Jackson, a state fish hatchery in Dubois, and the Popo Agie River on
the Wind River Indian Reservation have also carried the disease.
