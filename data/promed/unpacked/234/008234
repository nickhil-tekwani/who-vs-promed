A 2nd wild bird found dead in Hong Kong has tested positive for avian
influenza, the government in the southern Chinese territory announced.
Preliminary tests showed the magpie robin, found on Thursday in the mainly
rural New Territories, was carrying the H5 strain of the virus, a
government statement said, quoting an agriculture department spokesman.
Additional tests were being conducted to determine whether the wild bird
was carrying the deadly H5N1 strain, which has killed some 80 people since
2003, mostly in Southeast Asia and China, the spokesman added.
Last week, a dead magpie robin found in the New Territories -- which border
mainland China -- tested positive for the H5N1 strain.
The government said it would inspect 10 poultry farms within a 5-kilometer
(3-mile) radius of where the dead bird was found and step up surveillance
of wild birds in the region.
The spokesman said that if the 2nd magpie robin were confirmed to have died
of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, it "might be an indication that the virus
exists in the natural environment".
6 members of the family who own the house near where the bird was found
were found not to have any symptoms of the disease, but were placed under
medical watch, the government said.
Avian influenza first mutated into a form lethal to humans in Hong Kong in
1997, killing 6 people and prompting the culling of more than 2 million
poultry.
Since the 1997 outbreak, the former British colony has been largely
successful in keeping the virus out despite the outbreaks across the border
in China and the death of 3 wild birds in 2004.
The Hong Kong authorities have undertaken vigilant monitoring of live
poultry imports and border controls, and banned all imports of poultry from
regions hit by bird flu in China and elsewhere in Asia.
2 bird flu drills were conducted during 2005 and a hefty fine was imposed
on people feeding pigeons or ducks to reduce human contact with wild birds.

Has the H5N1 bird flu virus crossed Asia on the wings of migrating wild
birds? Yes, say governments and UN agencies. Prove it, say many bird
conservationists, who fear we are about to see an irresponsible and
unjustified cull. "People have just accepted that migrant birds are
carrying disease," charges Richard Thomas of Bird Life International in
Cambridge, UK.
What is beyond dispute is that in May 2005, thousands of wild geese died of
H5N1 at Qinghai Lake in China. A smaller outbreak in migrant geese and
swans followed in Mongolia. Then in late July the disease cropped up in
poultry near Novosibirsk in Siberia, before moving west to 5 more regions
in Russia and to Kazakhstan by August 2005, Romania and Turkey in October,
and Ukraine in December.
Conservationists point out that these outbreaks are clustered along major
long-distance transport routes. They say this shows that commercial
poultry, not migrating wild birds, are the vectors of the infection.
Virologists, however, tell a different story.
Aside from a single test on a grebe in Novosibirsk, no one has yet found a
smoking gun: healthy migrant birds carrying H5N1. But we do know that H5N1
can be carried and spread by healthy domestic ducks, and therefore probably
by wild ducks -- experiments are under way to find out. Moreover there is
circumstantial evidence that the outbreaks are consistent with migration
pathways.
Ward Hagemeijer of the conservation group Wetlands International concludes
that the best explanation for the outbreak of H5N1 in Mongolia is that it
was carried by infected migrating birds heading north from Qinghai. The
further outbreaks can be explained by birds flying from Qinghai to north
Siberian nesting grounds, where they mingled with, and perhaps infected,
ducks from wintering grounds across the breadth of Asia and Europe,
including the Black Sea coast and south Siberia. Birds that failed to mate,
says Hagemeijer, then headed south in July -- just in time for the
outbreaks in south Siberia and Kazakhstan. The Black Sea outbreaks followed
the main migration in autumn.
Genetic studies support this idea. Every outbreak in east Asia tested since
2004 was caused by a strain of H5N1 known as the "Z genotype". But birds in
Qinghai, and in outbreaks to the west, were infected by a slightly
different strain, a hybrid of the Z genotype with its immediate ancestor.
The virus in both wild and domestic birds across Russia was closely related
to the Qinghai virus, while swans in Romania died from a virus most closely
related to the one in the grebe in Novosibirsk.
If the disease was being transmitted through poultry carried out of China,
then at least some of the western outbreaks should be the Z genotype that
has dominated outbreaks in China. But not one bird in west Asia or Europe
has been found with this strain. "We haven't sequenced everything,"
cautions Juan Lubroth of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome,
Italy. "But the pattern does suggest that wild birds are introducing the
virus to new areas."
That doesn't mean the answer lies in the wholesale slaughter of wild birds
-- which is conservationists' worst fear. The real problem for people is
not the wild birds, but infected poultry. It has been obvious, everywhere
the virus has been, that poor management of domestic flocks is what
transmits the infection throughout a region once it has arrived. And people
have overwhelmingly caught the virus from their backyard chickens, not from
passing wild ducks.
"What can we do about the wild birds? Nothing," says Lubroth -- shooting
them just scatters them, and anything they may be carrying. "What can we do
about poultry? A lot."

[Readers are referred to 2 drafted scientific papers from the D.I.
Ivanovsky Institute of Virology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The
papers have been opened for discussion at:
<http://www.pathobiologics.org/ivphc/pi102004.html>.
The papers include details on "indication of influenza A/H5N1 virus by
RT-PCR of cloaca/trachea samples" from 5 species of wild birds "without
clinical features", collected near the center of the epizootic in the
Novosibirsk region (July 2005).
The birds were: Mallard (_Anas platyrhynchos_), 6/12 positives; Pochard
(_Aythya ferina_), 12/33 positives; Great crested grebe (_Podiceps
cristatus_), 1/2 positive; Coot (_Fulica atra_), 0/5 and Common tern
(_Sterna hirundo_), 0/2. Out of a total of 54 non-clinical wild birds, 19
(35.2 percent) were positive.
The papers also report the isolation of the A/H5N1 strain
A/Grebe/Novosibirsk/29/05 from a Great crested grebe "without clinical
features", collected near the center of the epizootic in the Novosibirsk
region (July 2005). - Mod.AS]
