A prairie dog die-off in the Anthem area initially suspected to be
caused by plague has been blamed on tularemia.

County health officials began investigating the die-off on 5 Oct
2010, and cordoned off an area south and west of Uptown Avenue in the
Arista development to limit access of people and their pets. The
affected area is south of the 1stBank Center.

On Wednesday [27 Oct 2010], a rabbit in the area was confirmed to
have tularemia.

Tularemia is a bacterial disease found in animals, especially
rodents, rabbits and hares. It is spread by bites from infected
fleas, ticks or insects, handling infected animal carcasses, eating
or drinking contaminated food or water, or breathing in the bacteria.

Symptoms of tularemia include sudden fever, chills, headaches,
diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough and progressive
weakness. People also can develop pneumonia with chest pain, cough
and difficulty breathing if it is not treated.

Health officials recommend individuals immediately see a physician if
they become ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes. They
also recommend taking pets to see a veterinarian if they come down
with a high fever or become lethargic.

As it continues to monitor the area, the Broomfield Public Health and
Environment Division is advising residents, pet owners, area workers
and visitors to avoid handling and coming into contact with animals
that could potentially be infected, such as wild rodents, squirrels
and rabbits.

Other safety tips include:

Keep pets, especially cats and dogs, indoors to limit exposure to
ticks. If outdoors with your pets, keep them out of heavily wooded areas.

Avoid areas inhabited by wild rodents. If you enter such areas, wear
insect repellent containing DEET.

Keep pets on a leash at all times to prevent them from running loose
in fields where they might come in contact with rodents, rabbits and hares.

Never touch sick or dead animals with your bare hands. If an animal
must be moved, use a long-handled shovel to place it in a garbage
bag, and place the bag in an outdoor garbage can.

Avoid drinking unpurified water from streams or lakes and prevent
pets from doing the same.

[Tularemia is named for the early work done in Tulare County,
California, now one of the largest dairy producing counties in the
United States but also home to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Some of
the early work distinguishing tularemia from plague was 1st performed
in Tulare County. A brief history can be found on the Texas
Department of State Health Services at
<http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/preparedness/bt_public_history_tularemia.shtm>.
I have included a short history below:

There is evidence that tularemia in humans may have occurred as early
as the 19th century in the US, Norway, Russia and Japan, but probably
was not recognized as an infectious process. In the early 20th
century, a Japanese physician named Hachiro Ohara described a disease
affecting those who hunted or ate rabbit. The Japanese called it
Yato-Byo, meaning rabbit fever, which appeared to be endemic to the
Abakuma Mountains. He recorded that during certain seasons, dead
rabbits were seen in great numbers, and human infection resulted from
contact with dead or diseased rabbits. He then took some blood from
an affected rabbit and rubbed it on his wife's skin. Within days,
according to Ohara's report, a large ulcer appeared, and she
experienced clinical symptoms similar to those of people exposed in
nature. Decades later, Ohara recognized that there were clinical
differences between the Yato-Byo observed in Japan and the tularemia
observed in the United States.

In 1910, a Utah physician, RA Pearse, described deer-fly fever. In
1911, George W. McCoy and Charles W. Chapin, from the US Public
Health Service, began examining thousands of rats and ground
squirrels in order to detect foci of suspected plague infections in
San Francisco. Early in the investigation, McCoy noted that they had
"encountered an infection with lesions which are readily mistaken for
those of plague. ... It is barely possible that we unknowingly have
dealt with more than one disease entity, as no etiological agent has
been discovered." A year later, they isolated the causative organism
of this plague-like disease from California ground squirrels and
named it _Bacterium tularense_ after Tulare County where the work was
performed. In addition, McCoy and Chapin developed agglutination and
complement fixation tests to aid in the diagnosis. The 1st
bacteriologically confirmed case of human tularemia was reported in
Cincinnati in 1914.

Dr. Edward Francis, also from the US Public Health Service,
established the cause of deer-fly fever as _Bacterium tularense_ in
1928. Because of his extensive contributions to the knowledge of the
bacterium and the disease, the organism was later renamed
_Francisella tularensis_.

Tularemia, occurs naturally all over the United States and other
parts of the world but is particularly common in the Western and
Central United States, in places like California, Arizona, New Mexico
and Colorado, where this report comes from. The disease is also
prominent in Japan, the former Soviet Union and other places in the
Northern Hemisphere. There are approximately 200 cases per year in
the United States, almost all of them occurring in rural locations.
There are multiple ways to get tularemia as well, including through
food and water, handling contaminated carcasses, bites of ticks,
fleas and other insect vectors, inhalation and laboratory exposure.
There was a case in Massachusetts of a man running over an infected
rabbit while mowing his grass and getting exposure, presumably from
inhalation of carcass contaminants. Tularemia is also a recognized
bioterrorism agent. See moderator comments from Tularemia, wildlife -
