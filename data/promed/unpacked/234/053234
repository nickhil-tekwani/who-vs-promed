The number of people sickened by a bacterial disease connected with a San Jose restaurant continues to grow and has expanded to 5 counties, including Merced County, Santa Clara County public health officials announced Mon 26 Oct 2015.

Shigellosis, an intestinal diarrhoeal disease, has been confirmed in 72 of 182 ill people linked with Mariscos San Juan 3 restaurant at 205 N. Fourth St., public health officials said.

The total breaks down to 144 cases in Santa Clara County and 38 across the other 4 counties, public health officials said. Of the 72 people with the infection, 55 are in Santa Clara County, while the remaining 17 are in Santa Cruz, Alameda, Marin and Merced counties, according to public health officials.

Eight adults and a child in Alameda County have been confirmed with the infection, Alameda County public health spokeswoman Sherri Willis said.

In Santa Cruz County, 3 people have been found with shigellosis, one being through a secondary source, and 2 others are suspected to have the illness, county public health spokeswoman Jessica Randolph said.

San Mateo County Health System officials have reported 3 confirmed cases. Numbers from Merced County were not immediately available.

The restaurant was closed on 18 Oct 2015 after a majority of the sick people ate there one or 2 days earlier. Inspectors from the Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health continue to investigate the outbreak. Two other branches of the restaurant on Willow Street and Senter Road remain open.

Someone with shigella can spread the disease by making direct contact or preparing food or drink that is consumed, public health officials said. To prevent the spread of the disease, people are advised to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, public health officials said.

[From the US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Bad Bug Book http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

"Shigellosis accounts for less than 10 percent of the reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in this country. _Shigella_ rarely occurs in animals; principally, it is a disease of humans except for other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. The organism is frequently found in water polluted with human feces. The infective dose is as few as 10 cells depending on age and condition of host. The _Shigella_ spp. are highly infectious agents that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.

Associated foods include salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry. Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route. Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers are the most common causes of contamination."

Clearly, unlike foodborne infections in humans due to _Salmonella_ (except for typhoid fever), _E. coli_ O157, and _Campylobacter_, shigellosis is associated with food contaminated by human, not animal, feces. - Mod.LL
