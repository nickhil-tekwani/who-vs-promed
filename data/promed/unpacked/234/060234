Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever - WHO Update 21
--------------------------------------------------
As of Sun 5 Jun 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported
423 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 357 were
fatal. The vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige Province,
where 412 cases and 346 deaths have been reported.
The number of new cases being reported in Uige municipality has
declined considerably, with only one new confirmed case detected in
the past week. This case was a recognized contact who was under
follow-up. For comparison, during the peak of the outbreak, which
occurred in late March and April 2005, 30 to 40 new cases were being
reported weekly.
Alerts to potential cases continue to be received and investigated,
indicating that vigilance remains high.

[The previous WHO report (No. 20) updated to 26 May 2005, cited 399
cases and 335 deaths, of which 388 / 324 had occurred in Uige
province. This indicates an increase of 24 cases and 22 deaths, all
in Uige province, during the past 12 days. The detection of only one
new case during the past 7 days certainly encourages the belief that
the outbreak is now in decline. - Mod.CP]
