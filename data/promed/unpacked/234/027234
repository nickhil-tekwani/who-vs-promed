From 23 Sep to 1 Oct 2013, Peruvian veterinary authorities reported 5 outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF).

[Classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild swine. It is caused by a virus of the genus _Pestivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_, which is closely related to the viruses that cause bovine viral diarrhoea in cattle and border disease in sheep. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV).

CSF is found in Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa. North America, Australia, and New Zealand are currently free of the disease. Humans are not affected by this virus. Swine are the only species known to be susceptible (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/CSF-EN.pdf).

In May 2013, CSF was added to the list of diseases for which the OIE has put in place a specific procedure for official recognition of disease status. No country or zone has yet officially been recognized by the OIE as being free from the disease. According to Resolution No. 30 adopted by the Assembly at the 81st General Session in May 2013, applications for the recognition of CSF status will start to be evaluated during the next annual cycle from May 2014 to May 2015.

A Member Country wishing to be officially recognized as disease-free by the OIE should submit the questionnaire laid out in Chapter 1.6 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Terrestrial Code) and comply with all requirements specified in the Terrestrial Code for CSF (http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/classical-swine-fever/).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to classical swine fever are spelled out in Chapter 15.2 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.15.2.htm.

In the Andean sub-region, which comprises 5 countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), livestock production is significantly important to the economy, with porcine production not far behind cattle production. Porcine production, while significant, is primarily limited to small farmers and backyard production. Nevertheless Andean sub-region countries have agreed to participate in the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Continental Plan to Eradicate CSF. The Plan's goal is to eradicate CSF by 2020 (http://www.rlc.fao.org/es/proyectos/control-ppc-paises-andinos, in Spanish).

Quantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database indicates that during 2012, 227 outbreaks occurred in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (15), Cuba (81), Ecuador (82), Guatemala (9), and Peru (40). During 2012, the outbreaks in Peru were located in the regions of Cajamarca (2), Ica (3), Junin (1), Lambayeque (11), Lima (12), Piura (6), San Martin (1) and Tumbes (4). This information and additional data on these outbreaks can also be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

The disease is also present in Haiti, but no quantitative data is available. During 2013, Colombia reported the reoccurrence of the disease to the OIE (ProMED-mail archive number 20130827.1906445). - Mod.CRD
