During the first 13 weeks of 2004, 11 639 cases of classic dengue fever
were reported in Venezuela, with a peak of 1211 cases during
epidemiological week 3 (18-25 Jan 2004). 677 cases were reported during
epidemiological week 12, and 579 cases during epidemiological week 13.
During the first 13 weeks of 2004, there were 738 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever, with 3 deaths.
***There was a correction in the original report for week 7; the Ministry of
Health reported previously 869 cases, the new figure is 882.
[These figures show an increase of 1256 total cases (including 25 DHF
cases, no deaths) over week 11 in the previous report on ProMED - see ref.

This report is for the first 14 epidemiologic weeks -- the period 4 Jan
through 10 Apr 2004.
--------------------------------------------------
As stated on the El Salvador Ministry of Health Dengue Report, the dengue
incidence rate is increasing, compared to the last 2 years. For the first
14 weeks of 2004, with 655 cases reported (including 23 DHF), incidence is
9.9 per 100 000 population; the rates for epidemiological weeks 1-14 in
2002 and 2003 were 8.0 and 5.5 per 100 000 population, respectively.
There has been 1 death reported in 2004 (compared with 4 during 2003 and 2
in 2002). The reported rates of DHF per 100 000 population for comparable
time periods are: 0.7 (2002), 0.4 (2003), and 0.3 (2004).
Provinces reporting high accumulated incidence of dengue cases include San
Salvador (340 cases), La Libertad (92), Sonsonate (60), San Vicente (42)
and La Paz (37).

So far in 2004, 632 persons have been affected by classic dengue fever,
double the number reported on the same date in 2003. According to the
ministry's report, the disease has not been confirmed in all cases, and
currently it is confirmed in 2 out of 10 people who have reported to
hospitals and health units with symptoms of the disease.
Julio Armero, head of epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, indicated
that 23 percent of the patients to whom diagnostic tests are performed have
positive results for classic dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever.

From: Bertrand Gachot <gachot@igr.fr>

In Dengue/DHF update (08) (archive # 20040313.0698), ProMED reported that a
vector control campaign was ongoing in Seychelles, in order to control a
recent bout of dengue fever, & requested any information about the
situation in this Indian-ocean nation.
On 7 Apr 2004 I saw as an outpatient a 52-year-old tourist who was
returning from Seychelles. He had visited successively Mahe (5 days),
Praslin (3 days) and La Digue islands. While in this last island, on the
10th day of his travel, he had developed high fever, chills, severe
headache and muscle pain. The disease lasted 6 days, with a moderate
scarlatiniform skin rash appearing on the day of defervescence [end of
fever]. According to the patient, several cases of presumed or confirmed
dengue fever had recently occurred in La Digue island at the time he became
ill.
When I saw him he was rather well, except for persistent weakness and a
slight rash on the trunk. Remarkable laboratory analyses were mild
neutropenia and evidence of hepatitis (serum AST and ALT 137 and 320 IU/L,
respectively). Platelet count was normal. The diagnosis of dengue was
subsequently confirmed by the presence of specific IgM antibodies (ELISA).
This case report strongly suggests that an epidemic of dengue is actually
ongoing in Seychelles. The importance of this outbreak remains to be
determined.

Indonesia's dengue death toll now at 634, disease far from over: ministry
---------------------------------------------------
A widespread dengue fever outbreak has killed 634 people in Indonesia so
far this year [2004] and is still far from over, the health ministry said.
It said Tuesday the number of infections, at 54 176, was greater than for
the whole of last year [2003], when Indonesia recorded almost 53 000
infections and 792 deaths.
"The dengue fever outbreak is still far from over," said Rita Kusriastuti,
coordinator of an anti-dengue team. "The rainy season is not yet over and
is only expected to end sometime in May." However, Kusriastuti said the
outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease, which has hit most parts of the
world's largest archipelago, had peaked and the number of new infections
was declining. She said the figure for deaths was 1.2 percent of those
infected, lower than 2003's 1.5 percent.
Indonesians "should not be complacent after passing the peak of the
outbreak but should remain continuously vigilant and active in preventing
the spread of the disease", she told AFP. Kusriastuti said the government
was trying to bring the fatality rate below one percent, but it could not
reduce the rate of infection -- 25 for every 100 000 people -- without the
help of the community in keeping surroundings free from stagnant water, in
which mosquitoes breed.
