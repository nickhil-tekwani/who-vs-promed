More than 200 lions and lion cubs died in the state [Gujarat] in the last 2 years [2017-18], the state government said in the assembly on [Fri 22 Feb 2019]. However, the government claimed that a majority of deaths were due to natural causes. Forest minister Ganpatsinh Vasava said in a written reply to a question by Congress MLA [member of legislative assembly] from Talala, Bhaga Barad, that 43 adult Asiatic lions died in the state in 2017, and 67 in 2018.

According to the minister, out of 43 lions in 2017, 31 died due to natural reasons, while 12 died of unnatural causes. For 2018, 58 lions died because of natural reasons, and 9 on account of unnatural causes.

Surprisingly, in response to a question by MLA Pratap Dudhat, the minister said that 34 lions had died in Gir sanctuary due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus, babesia, streptococcus bacteria, and Gram negative bacteria in the year as of [29 Jan 2019]. The discrepancy in numbers would suggest that the majority of the lion deaths as a result of these diseases have been classified as because of natural reasons, and not due to unnatural causes. Vasava's reply said that 94 lion cubs had died in the state in 2017 and 2018. Of them, 6 deaths were because of unnatural reasons, while 88 had died due to natural reasons. In the same 2-year period, more than 250 leopards and 75 leopard cubs also died in the state. While 118 leopards and 30 cubs were reported dead in 2017, the number was 138 and 45 respectively for 2018. The government said 76 leopards and 10 leopard cubs had died due to unnatural reasons, while the death of 180 leopards and 65 cubs was because of natural causes.

"Parapet walls are being constructed around open wells in revenue areas in Gir sanctuary. Chain link fencing has been undertaken on both sides of Surendranagar-Pipavav railway track in Amreli district," the minister said in reply to a question about steps taken to prevent deaths of the wildcats. There are as many as 3159 open wells in a 5-km [3-mi] radius of Gir sanctuary area, the state government said in the assembly. However, forest minister said that no lions or other protected animals had died or suffered injuries on account of falling in an open well without a parapet wall in Gir sanctuary area in the last 2 years.

[The pathogen flow at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface is a major conservation concern, especially where feral dogs are abundant. Documentation of outbreaks in wild carnivores due to exposure to cat and dog pathogens abound throughout the world. Control of feral dogs and vaccination of owned ones would reduce the sources of the virus.

It is important to consider that canine distemper is not the only pathogen that domestic carnivores can transmit to big cats, and thus conservation efforts should take into account all infectious agents that are potentially flowing at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface in the region.

It is not clear what deaths are considered "natural" and "unnatural". Establishing the cause of death of each lion would take carrying out full necropsies and laboratory tests. - Mod.PMB
