[Other reports in this string, but not given above, start on 2 Dec 2012 and end on 17 Dec 2012. One report indicates that 20 people have been affected by the febrile disease, but an earlier report above indicates that there are 52. Some of the earlier reports mention "flu", but most do not.

The etiology of these cases apparently has not been determined. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more details, and especially laboratory results, as they become available.
