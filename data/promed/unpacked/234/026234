Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has spread in 30 villages under 10 blocks of East Champaran district during the last fortnight. According to the official sources, at least 8 children of the district have died of the mystery disease, and 24 children are undergoing treatment at SKMCH and Kejriwal hospital at Muzaffarpur.

Though panic prevails in the villages, the health department has yet to start fogging and awareness campaigns as preventive measures. East Champaran civil surgeon Dr Mira Verma said a separate ward for AES patients has been marked in the sadar hospital at Motihari, and the doctors, paramedics and ASHA workers have been directed to launch campaigns to make villagers aware about AES, which breaks out with the rise in heat and humidity. The civil surgeon told TOI as per the State Health Society's directive that 2 ambulances and 10 doctors have been sent to the Muzaffarpur hospitals to cope with the alarming situation.

East Champaran district malaria officer Dr Ravi Shankar Verma said fogging would be started in a day or 2 in the affected villages. The fogging machines, borrowed from the Motihari Nagar Parishad, have conked out, and mechanics have been called from Patna to set them right, he said, and added that a sanitation drive has been launched in the affected areas.

[ProMED-mail subscribers who are interested in the current situation with AES in Bihar state are urged to review the comments of Dr Jacob John concerning this situation (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140613.2536936).

Insecticide fogging indicates that the local health authorities suspect a mosquito-borne pathogen, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). However, Dr John pointed out that the outbreaks in the Muzaffarpur district in Bihar state, annually recurrent, are quite different from many other outbreaks of JEV in various parts of India, including some parts of Bihar. JEV has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes. Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains, the outbreak stops. The clinical and laboratory parameters of these cases in Bihar are not like encephalitis, rather are typical of encephalopathy. The details of the physiopathology of these cases require further study.
