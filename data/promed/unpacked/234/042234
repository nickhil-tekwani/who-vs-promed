The Maine CDC is investigating an outbreak of gastrointestinal illnesses at an Ellsworth campground. Individuals at 32 campsites at Patten Pond Camping Resort have gotten sick. The Maine CDC has not confirmed the source of the illness but says campground officials found _E. coli_ bacteria in the drinking water system.

A boil water order was issued Tuesday [17 Aug 2021] until the water tests negative for the bacterium. The campground owner is contacting everyone who's stayed there since 8 Aug 2021. In the meantime, campers have been supplied with bottled water.

[The cause (or causes) of the unspecified number of cases of gastroenteritis is not specified. Finding _E. coli_ in the drinking water does not necessarily mean that _E. coli_ itself is the culprit but rather that the "coliforms" reflect contamination of the water with sewage. In addition to enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and a number of other pathotypes such as enterotoxic and enteropathogenic _E. coli_, other bacteria, viruses and protozoa could be involved. - Mod.LL
