Leishmaniasis in Kenya: comment
-------------------------------
The US Navy Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) worked on visceral
leishmaniasis in the Sudan in the 60's. We found the infection level
in sandflies so high that it was inconceivable any one living in the
area could escape being repeatedly bitten by infected sandflies. In
fact, several of the researchers developed small skin lesions, which
were demonstrated to contain _Leishmania donovani_.

Because of the political situation, the work was not continued. It
seems likely, though, that infection with _L. donovani_ in the
sub-Sahara is wide spread, but manifests as visceral leishmaniasis
only as a consequence of malnutrition.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ellicott McConnell for his comment. The outbreak
in the North Eastern province of Kenya has been ongoing since 2000,
including in Wajir district, previously regarded as non-endemic for
visceral leishmaniasis (VL) (see Tonui WK: Situational analysis of
leishmaniasis research in Kenya. Afr J Health Sci. 2006; 13(1-2):
7-21; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17348738?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum>.)

The latest reports clearly show that VL is not under control. The
situation has been described in a study from 2003 (Marlet MV et al:
Emergence or re-emergence of visceral leishmaniasis in areas of
Somalia, north-eastern Kenya, and south-eastern Ethiopia in 2000-01.
Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2003; 97: 515-8, abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15307414>), which states,
"Unusual rainfall patterns, malnutrition, and migration of a
_Leishmania_-infected population seeking food and security may have
contributed to this outbreak."

ProMED-mail would be happy to post a comment from Kenyan authorities
or the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) on the situation. - Mod.EP]
