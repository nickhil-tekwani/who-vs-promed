This week [3-9 Mar 2014], a total of 44 suspected measles cases were reported from 23 districts. The top 10 districts included (Hoima, Buikwe, Ntungamo, Wakiso, Luweero, Masaka, Mubende, Kyenjojo, Mbarara, Kampala), which reported 2-5 cases each.

Measles outbreaks have been confirmed in Adjumani, Arua, Hoima, Kibaale and Ntungamo. The cases in Ntungamo have been reported from Nyakyera, Itojo, and Kahunga sub counties from where a total of 6 cases were confirmed to have measles following tests conducted in the measles laboratory at UVRI on 11 Mar 2014.

The outbreaks in Ajumani and Arua have been reported in camps hosting refugees from South Sudan, while the cases in Hoima originated from Kyangwali sub county IDP camp and then spread to the neighboring sub counties. Measles vaccinations have been undertaken in the affected refugee populations targeting children less than 5 years of age, while accelerated routine immunization has been implemented in the other affected areas.

At the close of 2013, a total of 101 (90.18 percent) districts had investigated at least one suspected measles case. Consequently, the annualized rate for suspected measles cases investigated was 3.22/100 000 (national target 2/100 000). Also, 8 percent of investigated suspected measles cases had tested measles IgM positive [measles cases have been confirmed from 27 districts]. The current trends are generally far below the cases reported for the corresponding period of 2012 and 2013.

The Middlesex-London Health Unit [in Ontario, Canada] is dealing with a 2nd suspected case of measles.

Officials released a list late Wednesday [19 Mar 2014] of London [Canada] businesses visited by the person believed to be carrying the virus. The health unit issued a similar alert Saturday [15 Mar 2014] after confirming a single case of measles.

Ottawa Public Health is investigating a 2nd possible measles case, and Fraser Health is warning of a measles outbreak. Anyone with symptoms, including irritated eyes, a rash, and small white, grey, or blue spots in the mouth should call the health unit or a doctor as soon as possible, officials say.

Measles is spread through the air and is highly contagious, the health unit says. But people who have received 2 doses of the measles vaccine or who have been previously infected or who were born before 1970 are generally safe.

Locations and times of possible exposure are:
- McDonald's (959 Hamilton Rd.): Sat 15 Mar 2014, 2:15 to 6:00 p.m.
- Walmart (White Oaks Mall): Sat 15 Mar 2014, from 7:30 p.m. to after closing

Patient zero in the Fraser Valley measles outbreak is believed to be a member of a family that took a trip to the Netherlands in January 2014. The BC Centre for Disease Control has traced the outbreak to Holland, a country that has experienced several outbreaks this year [2014], according to the Dutch health ministry, although it's not the only country where unvaccinated Canadians are at risk of infection.

"With the exception of the Americas, there's really measles everywhere," a CDC spokesperson told reporters, adding that Europe in particular has seen many outbreaks in the past few years. Nonetheless, 2 cases of measles last August [2013] in the Fraser Valley were also linked to the Netherlands.

The outbreak began to pick up speed in early March 2014, as the number of people infected jumped from 2 students at a religious school in Chilliwack to dozens of suspected cases among fellow students. A pastor for the Reformed community at the centre of the outbreak told a Vancouver Sun reporter many in his congregation of 1200 are unvaccinated, preferring to leave the matter in "God's hands."

The infectious period for measles is 21 days. Experts say those who are not vaccinated and showing symptoms of the virus, which include fever, cough, running nose, inflamed eyes, and, later, a rash, should isolate themselves at home for 21 days until the infectious period has passed.

Fraser Health Chief Medical Health Officer Paul Van Buynder said staff are "disappointed" that people who are showing symptoms have not been isolating themselves. As a result, the virus continues to spread.

A vaccination rate of 95 per cent is necessary in order for community (or "herd") immunity to work. In the eastern Fraser Valley region, vaccination rates are about 60 to 70 per cent. Herd immunity protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as babies and kids with low immunity from cancer treatments, by disrupting the chain of infection (i.e. if everyone you come into contact with is vaccinated, it's very unlikely you'll contract the disease). Experts say measles and several other diseases that are avoidable are making a comeback due to "anti-vaxxers," who refuse to vaccinate their kids.

The number of measles cases as of Friday [21 Mar 2014] is over 100, according to a Fraser Health spokesperson. Most of the cases are in the eastern Fraser Valley, while all link back to the original outbreak. The most recent cases include a worker at a retail outlet and a public school student.

Measles alerts were sent to staff who worked at the Chilliwack Lions Club Music and Dance Festival and to students living on campus at the University of the Fraser Valley. An earlier case involved a BCIT student.

Seven adults and 3 children have been infected with measles, 5 of them after exposure to another measles patient. Seven required hospitalization.

Ten Orange County residents have contracted measles so far this year [2014], with 7 of the patients requiring hospitalization, public health officials said Wednesday [19 Mar 2014].

Three more infections have been confirmed since Friday [14 Mar 2014], correlating with an increase across California.

"It's important to recognize these events as the reason we get our kids vaccinated and the reason we vaccinate ourselves," said Dr. Matt Zahn, the county's medical director for epidemiology.

A measles outbreak in New York City has grown to 20 cases after one more adult patient has been confirmed to have the contagious virus, the Health Department said Tuesday [18 Mar 2014]. The latest case puts the total at 9 children and 11 adults.

The outbreak began in upper Manhattan and the Bronx; one case was identified in Brooklyn last week. The Health Department did not say on Tuesday [18 Mar 2014] where the latest case had been identified.

The initial cases were in Inwood and Washington Heights in Manhattan, and in High Bridge, Morrisania, and the Central Bronx, health officials say. Authorities are working to identify the source of the outbreak and are urging vaccinations for those who haven't had them. The 1st case was reported in February 2014.

Four of the affected children were too young to have been vaccinated; 3 who had been vaccinated were 13 to 15 months old, and 2 others had not been vaccinated by parental choice, the Health Department said. The affected adults range in age from 22 to 63 years.

Measles is a viral infection characterized by a generalized rash and high fever accompanied by cough, red eyes, and runny nose lasting 5 to 6 days. The illness typically begins with a rash on the face and then moves down the body and may include the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. As many as one in 3 people with measles develop complications, which can be serious and may include pneumonia, miscarriage, brain inflammation, hospitalization, and death. Infants, people who have a weakened immune system, and non-immune pregnant women are at highest risk of severe illness and complications.

A rare outbreak of measles in New York City may have been spread by the failure of medical workers to recognize the disease quickly enough and to quarantine patients so they would not infect others, a city epidemiologist said this week.

Dr. Jay Varma, the health department's deputy commissioner for disease control, said the department's investigators were looking at whether some of the 20 confirmed cases, which are concentrated in northern Manhattan, might have resulted from exposure in medical facilities. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can be spread through airborne respiratory droplets even 2 hours after an infected person has left the room.

"We know a number of people were exposed and possibly got their infection either at a doctor's office or at an emergency room where they went and it took more time than it should have for them to be put in an isolation area where they couldn't possibly infect anyone else," Dr. Varma said.

The 1st known case of the disease was detected in early February 2014.

Dr. Varma declined to identify any medical facilities, saying that such exposure in a hospital was not unusual and that "we are not trying to shame any one institution." But he said this route of exposure could make it harder to contain and to track the outbreak, because it was not concentrated in any one social or cultural circle as contagious diseases often are.

A health department spokeswoman said that no cases had been traced to a hospital, but on 12 Mar 2014, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center sent an email to its staff saying several pediatric and adult patients with measles had sought treatment there, "resulting in nearly 600 patients being potentially exposed to measles." The email went on to say: "Many of our clinical staff have never seen a case of measles."

It attached graphic photographs of children with bright red measles rashes covering their bodies and detailed instructions about how to diagnose measles. The attachment said that any patients suspected of having measles should immediately be given a mask and taken with family members to an isolation room.

It said security guards had been posted at doors to look for patients with symptoms of measles and to direct them to put on masks.

Dr. Yoko Furuya, medical director of infection prevention and control at New York-Presbyterian, said on Monday [17 Mar 2014] that the hospital system had treated 10 measles cases. She said some patients might have been exposed to others for a few minutes.

Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for New York-Presbyterian, said that "to the best of our knowledge, none of the patients who were seen in our emergency room got measles here in our emergency room." She said that the hospital was reaching out to all 600 people potentially exposed "out of an abundance of caution."

In early March 2014, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx hospitalized a 15-month-old child with measles who had missed being vaccinated because of illness, said Dr. Nathan Litman, its chief of pediatric infectious diseases. Dr. Litman said the child, who has recovered, was exposed in Washington Heights.

The 1st symptom of measles is fever followed by a cough; runny nose; red, watery eyes; and a rash. People can be contagious before the rash appears and are advised to stay away from other people for 21 days after being exposed. Measles can lead to ear infection, diarrhea, pneumonia, miscarriage, brain inflammation, and even death.

Since the outbreak was detected, 9 children and 11 adults have been infected: 16 Manhattan residents, 3 Bronx residents, and one Brooklyn resident.

Dr. Varma said the 1st 2 cases were in adults who had traveled outside New York and who did not know each other but were probably infected at the same airport in the United States. He declined to identify the airport. Both had activities that brought them to northern Manhattan, and that included health care facilities, he said, declining to provide more details.

Only 3 of the 11 had records proving they had been vaccinated, though others believed they had been. In rare instances, a vaccinated person can become infected later in life.

Of the 9 children, 7 were too young to be vaccinated or within the window of 12 to 15 months old when the vaccination is recommended. The other 2 were from families in which the parents refused to allow the vaccination.

Because of federally financed childhood vaccination programs, measles has been considered effectively eliminated in the United States since 2000. However, there are periodic outbreaks, usually among unvaccinated people who have traveled to foreign countries, where measles is still common. Some parents refuse to have their children vaccinated for religious reasons and others because of a belief that vaccines can cause autism, though no link has ever been proved.

On 14 Mar 2014, the Los Angeles County health department confirmed 10 measles cases in the county, 8 of them linked to international travel.

Last year [2013], there were 58 cases among Orthodox Jews in Borough Park and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, beginning with an intentionally unvaccinated 17-year-old who had returned from London.

[Unfortunately, transmission of measles in healthcare settings is quite common. Measles virus is airborne, remains infectious for a period of hours even after an infectious patient is no longer present, and often goes unrecognized by healthcare providers who have become increasingly unfamiliar with the disease. This results in hazards, particularly for those at increased risk of measles due to factors such as being immunocompromised and pregnancy.

The health department has sent its teams to the mountainous villages of the Gadoon Amazai belt to tackle a measles outbreak after reports that the disease claimed the life of a girl there.

According to reports, the measles-hit areas include Sokeelye, Sandwa, and Talaye. When contacted, people of these villages said that their children had been vaccinated regularly against various diseases, including measles, but despite that, several of them had been affected by the disease.

"We don't know about the treatment. The health officials should come and educate people on preventive measures," said Salam Pur of Sandwa village.

Zahir Shah of the same village told this correspondent by phone that an 8-year-old girl had died due to measles on Wednesday [19 Mar 2014]. However, district head of EPI Dr Yaqub said that the girl had recovered from measles and that she died due to extensive vomiting.

Answering a question, Mr Zahir said that some health officials visited the area, gave medicines to the children, and advised people to adopt precautionary measures. He said that there were about 70 measles-hit children only in Sandawa village and that more teams of doctors should be sent to the area on a emergency basis.

However, the EPI head brushed aside such assertions and said that health department teams had vaccinated 250 children and recorded that 23 of them were suffering from measles. He said that people of the area were reluctant to bring out their children for vaccination and that they were tight-lipped about the disease of their children. He also suggested that health officials should set up camps there to provide treatment to the affected children and create awareness among people about preventive measures.

This correspondent repeatedly tried to contact district health officer Dr Ihsan Akbar, but his mobile phone number was off due to unknown reasons.

Meanwhile, MPA Shiraz Khan said that he would meet with the DHO and ask him to send more medical teams to the area to treat the children.
