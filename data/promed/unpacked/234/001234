Egypt: Women bear the brunt of bird flu
---------------------------------------------
Judging from the gender ratio of infections in Egypt, women are
[more] at risk of avian influenza contagion than men, said Hamdi
Abdel Wahed, a media official at the Health Ministry. All of the 8
deaths that have occurred in Egypt as a result of avian flu have been
among women. "The reason for this is that women in the countryside
are traditionally in charge of looking after domestically kept birds,
which are the most likely to be infected with bird flu," Abdel Wahed said.
The latest victim died on Sun 24 Dec 2006 in Gharbiyya province, 90
km north of Cairo, bringing the number of bird flu deaths in the
country among humans to 8. She was admitted to hospital on 17 Dec
2006, and although she initially denied having had contact with
birds, tests confirmed she was infected with the potentially lethal
virus, Abdel Wahed said. "But the illness was already at an advanced
stage by the time she was taken to hospital. She had high fever,
shortness of breath, and eventually died of a heart attack despite
having been administered appropriate treatment," he added.
The latest victim became the 8th female fatality. "To start with, she
was frightened of admitting that she had been rearing ducks at home,"
said Abdel Wahed. "This indicates she knew of the risk, but did not
appreciate the extent of the danger." The authorities have carried
out extensive awareness campaigns ever since bird flu was 1st
detected in Egypt in February 2006. Asked whether any campaigns
targeting women specifically were in the offing, however, Abdel Wahed
said, "There ought to be, but I am not aware of any such campaign per se."
H5N1 was 1st detected among humans in Egypt in March 2006, and a
month earlier among birds. The majority of infections and all of the
deaths have been among people who reared birds domestically as
opposed to on farms. In response to the risk of infection from
rearing birds at home, the government banned domestic poultry rearing
in urban centers. However, the country's health authorities did not
impose similar restrictions in rural areas where domestic breeding is
more widespread and economically vital.

[The greater proneness of women to fatal infection in rural areas of
Egypt is probably due to their greater exposure to infection, since
they are responsible both for the rearing of poultry and the
preparation of food.

Egypt: 15-year-old girl is the 9th fatal case of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A 15-year-old Egyptian girl died of bird flu on Monday [25 Dec 2006],
the Egyptian Health Ministry said in a statement. The girl was
admitted to a hospital on 20 Dec 2006 after being diagnosed with the
disease, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted an
Egyptian Health Ministry statement as saying.
Her death brings the number of total human deaths from H5N1 in Egypt
to 9, and the number of remaining human cases to 17 since the virus
1st surfaced in Egyptian poultry in February [2006].
An Egyptian woman died of bird flu on Sunday (see part [1] above),
hours after tests confirmed she and 2 other members of her extended
family had been suffering from the highly pathogenic virus, a World
Health Organization (WHO) official said.
A regional WHO official said the 15-year-old was from that family.
"She is from the same family, yes, she was given Tamiflu but this
didn't work out," said WHO regional adviser for communicable diseases
surveillance Hassan el-Bushra.
A 26-year-old man from the family has also been hospitalized with bird flu.
Bushra said the family raised ducks in their home, and the brother
and sister had slaughtered the flock after a number of ducks had
become sick and died.
