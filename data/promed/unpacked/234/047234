In Response to "West Nile virus; effectiveness of spraying (06)
--------------------------------------------------------------
While there is room for improvement, I would hardly call our programs
ineffective or claim they did not make a difference.
Yes, we had West Nile virus (WNV) activity. I don't think anyone thought
that could be prevented. Even intense interventions such as statewide
airspray might not have halted activity in such a widespread area, but I
don't think anyone thought that was what we had to do. I think at one point
we did have a shot at halting WNV activity in one of our focus areas, but
various factors kept us from getting a really outstanding airspray in at
the right time.
Still, despite widespread WNV, there were far fewer human cases than last
year. Does anyone think that happened by accident? Education and
avoidance undoubtedly played a big role, but I think all components of the
integrated programs we put in place had their part. Bottom line: human
disease was limited, and that was the goal.
As we get to know the biology of this disease better, we will be able to do
a still better job. We may not have stopped WNV in this county, but no
people were sick. I'm very happy with that, and I think we deserve at
least some credit for it. Now we'll prepare for whatever next year may
bring, which will undoubtedly be different from this year.
I heartily agree that source control in general is labor-intensive, and
will be increasingly important if _Aedes japonicus_ turns out to be a major
player. I don't think mosquito programs alone, however, can provide that
level of community sanitation. Given the number of species with possible
roles in WNV transmission, it seems to me we're coming full circle to a
realization that we need solid, integrated programs that have a broad range
of capabilities.
