Morocco has been recognized as free of African horse sickness [AHS] in accordance with the Health Code for Terrestrial Animals of the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] during the 83rd General Session of the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE, held in Paris from 24 to 29 May 2015.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Marine Fisheries, obtaining this "freedom status" is the result of efforts by national veterinary services, for many years, through the establishment of an appropriate control strategy for the eradication of this disease.

"This status will allow a more fluid exchange, without health constraints, of Moroccan horses with our partners, and the participation in major international equestrian events," said the ministry. "It is also an opportunity for Moroccan professionals to expand trade in horses and explore other destinations," added the same source.

This recognition is based on the report provided by the National Health Security Office of foodstuffs (ONSSA) to the OIE and has undergone a thorough evaluation by specialized experts of the organization.

AHS is an infectious disease caused by a virus and affects equines, including horses. The disease is transmitted by insects of the _Culicoides_ type. The presence of this disease in a country, in addition to serious economic consequences for the horse industry, constitutes an obstacle to international equine trade, which justifies the protection measures taken by countries to combat this disease.

[African horse sickness [AHS] is a serious equine disease caused by an _Orbivirus_ and is transmitted by an arthropod vector, _Culicoides_. It originates from southern Africa, but the infection is also enzootic in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. A brief description of AHS is available on the OIE website at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/AFRICAN_HORSE_SICKNESS.pdf.

AHS has occasionally spread outside its usual enzootic areas and caused deadly disease outbreaks and significant economic losses: in Egypt and Palestine (1943-1944); the Middle East and Southeast Asia (1959-1960) by causing the death of 300 000 equines (Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Lebanon, Cyprus); and 2 times in the Maghreb.

The 1st incursion of the disease in the latter region dates back to 1965-1966. AHS appeared in Morocco and then spread to Algeria, Tunisia and crossed the Straits of Gibraltar in 1966. The outbreak caused by virus serotype 9, was quickly brought under control thanks to the adopted control measures. Morocco experienced a new AHS epizootic, associated with serotype 4, which hit Spain in 1987 when it was introduced in a zoo in the Madrid region through an infected zebra from Namibia, then extended to Portugal and Morocco in 1989.

The last outbreak of African horse sickness in Morocco resulted in a multitude of clinical outbreaks for 3 consecutive years before waning under the pressure of a vigorous vaccination campaign. Subsequently, numerous attempts to obtain the OIE status of AHS free country had been unsuccessful, and it was not until 2015 that this status was officially recognized.

Morocco maintains economic exchanges in equines and equine meat, in particular with the European Union, and this new status will enable the country to strengthen these exchanges while allowing Moroccan horses to participate in equestrian activities held abroad. - Mod.AB
