[1] Case update
Date: Thu 29 May 2014
Source: a reliable source in Sierra Leone [edited]


ProMED-mail has learned that since 23 May 2014 there have been 14 cases in Kailahun [district, Eastern Province of Sierra Leone] confirmed by molecular test methods, 2 of them fatal. Investigation of the index case has revealed that in April 2014 she attended the funeral of a traditional healer who had been treating patients coming from Guinea. A major challenge is that community members are really ignorant of the risk and do not want to send an apparently healthy contact person to the hospital. There are more than 20 major sites of active surveillance and investigation for Ebola fever preparedness and response around the borders of Sierra Leone with Guinea and Liberia.

The World Health Organization (WHO)'s country representative, Jacob Mufunda, has confirmed the arrival [in Sierra Leone] of 12 experts from the WHO inter-country team on Ebola to assist the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in the fight against the disease.

The representative told Xinhua that WHO has provided the country with 5144 personal protective equipment and distributed them to health facilities. What's more, additional gear has been sent to the Kailahun and Kenema districts. He reiterated WHO's commitment to boost health promotion as well as human resource development.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Miatta Kargbo left the capital, Freetown, for Koindu [the outbreak centre] to sensitize the township and the environs. She confirmed 7 positive cases [14 in the report above] as of the early hours of Wednesday [28 May 2014] and encouraged all health staff at the front line to intensify efforts. Madam Kargbo said the ministry and the government would continue to be vigilant in addressing the situation, and called on all Sierra Leoneans to take the necessary precautionary measures and report to the nearest health facilities when signs and symptoms are noticed.

[There is clearly a problem in trying to convince uneducated rural people, who believe that disease is caused by spirits, that they may be carrying an invisible virus that will make them ill in a few days time, and that they can pass it to their relatives and friends unless they stay in quarantine.

The WHO team includes logistics, data manipulation, and other auxiliary staff.
