Sri Lanka's Ministry of Health has issued a warning that there may be a threat of avian (bird) flu after a large number of fowl had died of an apparent infection at a farm in Bingiriya, Kurunegala, in the North Western Province.

The Ministry has alerted that one of the dead birds had the symptoms of avian flu.

The Additional Director General of the Department of Animal Production and Health Dr ADN Chandrasiri has confirmed that the fowl deaths were due to avian influenza caused by a strain less lethal than the potentially deadly H5N1 strain, News First reported.

Following a meeting with the officials of Livestock and Animal Production Department yesterday [31 Jan 2012], the Additional Secretary to the Health Ministry Dr Palitha Mahipala has said that the Ministry has already taken steps to raise awareness among staffs of hospitals in Kurunegala, Bingiriya, and Chilaw about the avian flu.

The virus that infects the birds can mutate to infect humans and people handling poultry are at increased risk of contracting the disease.

[Confirmation or otherwise, and more details on the causative agent, are requested.

According to Sri Lanka's periodical (semi-annual and annual) reports to the OIE (last available report, duly covering the 1st half of 2011) HPAI has never been recorded in that country.
