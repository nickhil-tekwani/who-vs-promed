The Davis Event Center at WNC Ag Center [Western North Carolina Agricultural Center] has been taken out of rental as a precaution after state health officials said they think the recent outbreak of Legionnaires' may be linked to the building.

While no one's 100% certain, state health experts suspect the Legionnaires' disease outbreak may be linked to a single building at the WNC Ag Center.

In a conference call with the media, state health officials said 124 cases have been outlined [with] 3 conclusions. People who were diagnosed were:

- More likely to have been in the Davis Event Center,
- More likely to have walked by hot tub displays at the building, and
- Likely to have attended the latter half of the Mountain State Fair.

Officials also stated that a positive sample of _Legionella_ bacteria was found in a women's restroom at the Davis Center. The sample was taken before last week's Asheville Quilt Show but was not discovered to be positive until after the show, which drew thousands of people. Experts did not believe that sample posed a threat to the public.

Because of the latest information, Ag Center General Manager Matt Buchanan canceled this weekend's Asheville Gun and Knife Show as precautions are taken at the Davis Event Center to ensure the building is safe. "We're just doing this as a proactive measure," Buchanan said. "So, the only building we have taken out of rental is the Davis Event Center." Gun show promoter Mike Kent said he understands the abundance of caution. "I think with society in general being so lawsuit happy nowadays, all it would take for them to know that there had been an issue there and for us to go ahead with an event and somebody gets sick," Kent said.

The focus now is minimizing water aerosolization at the grounds, which is largely how the _Legionella_ bacteria [are] contracted. The showers at the Davis Center have been turned off and blocked with caution tape. Also, the sinks are off until new filters can be installed. "Every recommendation they've given us, we're going beyond that," Buchanan said.

The precautions only impact Davis Center events, so the NC Championship State Walking Horse Show at the grounds is still on as planned this weekend. The Autumn Rails Train Show hasn't been derailed either. Thursday [3 Oct 2019], vendors set up vehicles of nostalgia at the Expo building located near the Davis Center. "They assured us that the health department has said that nothing was an issue in this building or most of the other buildings on the property, so we were good to go," organizer Chuck Place said.

Meanwhile, Ag Center officials have taken measures to make sure the Davis Center is on track to host more events soon. "We're just trying to be overly and aggressively proactive," Buchanan said.

[As of Thu 3 Oct 2019, there are 128 confirmed cases of legionellosis associated with the Mountain State Fair that was held in western North Carolina between 6 and 15 Sep 2019 at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center (WNC Ag Center) in Fletcher, a town in Henderson County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher,_North_Carolina). The fair draws about 190 000 people each year (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Mountain_State_Fair).

Of the cases 94% have Legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the infection, and 6% have Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of the infection. The source of the outbreak has not as yet been identified. However, hot tub displays in one of the buildings (Davis Event Center) has been linked to the outbreak, and _Legionella_ was found in a women's restroom in this building. A site map of the WNC Ag Center that shows the location of the Davis Event Center building can be found at https://www.wncagcenter.org/p/mountainstatefair/competitions/map.

Although 95 of the 128 (74%) cases reside in 4 adjacent counties (Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, and Transylvania) near the WNC AG Center, the infection now involves cases in a total of 18 of the 100 North Carolina counties plus counties in the neighboring state of South Carolina. A map showing the location of the North Carolina counties can be found at https://geology.com/county-map/north-carolina.shtml.

The species of _Legionella_ detected in patients or in the environmental isolate is not specified; however, the usual pathogen in the US is _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Genotyping clinical and environmental isolates will help identify clusters of cases with a common source and identify the source responsible for infection in these clusters. - Mod.ML
