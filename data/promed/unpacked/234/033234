The Metropolitan Health official, Rosa Oyarce, has expressed concern about a case of cholera imported from Cuba after leading a sampling of the wastewater plant at the Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Pudahuel [Santiago Metropolitan Region].

"There is a high risk of cholera coming to our country from people on vacation," she said, "so the health authority has strengthened controls since yesterday (8 Aug 2013), when the Public Health Institute reported that tests performed on a Chilean citizen who visited Cuba were positive." The patient, 53, has been released and is in good condition according Oyarce.

Oyarce added that "we must not forget that we had 2 deaths in outbreaks of cholera that occurred in Chile in 1998." No cases of cholera had been reported in Chile since 3 cases were reported in 2011.

The Venezuelan Society of Public Health reported that there are the 2 people infected with cholera in the country. In its statement the medical society indicated that the 2 people are a couple who had traveled in Cuba and returned to the country this week. They add that the disease has been confirmed by laboratory and that patients are hospitalized in a private clinic in the capital.

"Unofficially, we know that on 7 Aug 2013, 2 cases of cholera imported from Cuba were identified. They were laboratory confirmed and both are hospitalized in private clinics in eastern Caracas. The couple returned from Havana, Cuba, and symptoms began with acute, copious diarrhea requiring hospitalization on 6 Aug 2013. Cultures were reported positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ the next day.

In 1991, cholera spread to Latin America, which had been free of cholera for more than a century. The disease spread rapidly, causing nearly 400 000 reported cases and over 4000 deaths in 16 countries of the Americas in 1991. By the end of 1993, nearly a million cases were reported and almost 9000 people died. In those 3 years, the epidemic affected all the countries of Latin America except Uruguay and the Caribbean. The organism was initially introduced into Peru and genetic analysis suggested that the source was Africa (Lam C, Octavia S, Reeves P, Wang L, Lan R. Evolution of seventh cholera pandemic and origin of 1991 epidemic, Latin America. Emerg Infect Dis. 2010; 16(7): 1130-2; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3321917/). The epidemic in Latin America lasted until the end of the decade. The inadequate public health/sanitary infrastructure in Latin America fed the flames of this epidemic as it did more recently in Haiti. Protection of a safe potable water supply is needed to prevent a repeat in Latin America.

It is not stated where in Cuba the Chilean patient had traveled but the temporal clustering with the Venezuelan couple suggests the possibility that the 3 may have traveled together. - Mod.LL]
