The Llano County Sheriff's Office and Texas Department of State
Health Services Laboratory confirmed 2 animals that recently died
near the city of Llano were infected with rabies.

Authorities said Thursday [6 May 2010] that both a black cat, which
died Monday [3 May 2010] on Rio Llano Drive West, and a raccoon,
which was killed by a rancher's dog on Sunday [?9 May 2010] on CR
201B, were infected with rabies.

Rio Llano Drive West is located in the Rio Llano subdivision just
west of the city of Llano on SH 29, and CR 201B is located a few
miles east of the city on SH 29.

There has been one other rabies case so far this year [2010]
involving a skunk in Babyhead in March.

Janie Crumpler, animal control officer for the Llano County Sheriff's
Office, said the 2 recent cases put the county ahead of the total
number of rabies cases for all of last year [2009].

For more information, contact either the Llano County Animal Control
at 325.247.5767 or the Texas Department of State Health Services
Zoonosis Control Program at 254.778.6744.

[2] New York: raccoon, human and canine exposure
Date: Tue 11 May 2010

<http://www.wivb.com/dpp/health/Two-raccoons-rabid-in-Chautauqua-County>


The Chautauqua [New York] County Department of Health recently
submitted 2 raccoon specimens from opposite ends of the County to the
NYS Wadsworth Laboratory in Albany for rabies testing. The Health
Department received notification on 11 May 2010 that the animals have
been confirmed as positive for rabies.

On 7 May 2010, an unprovoked raccoon bit a 19-year old male in
Falconer and then fled. It is believed that the same raccoon then
attacked a dog outside a residence and another man by biting through
his pant leg. The man was able to kill the raccoon by strangulation.
Fortunately, neither men nor the dog were seriously injured but
because the 2 men had direct contact with the rabies virus through
saliva of the raccoon, Robert Berke, MD, county medical director,
authorized post-exposure rabies prophylaxis to prevent the
development of rabies. The dog had a current rabies vaccination and
therefore, only required a booster.

On 5 May 2010, a raccoon attacked a dog in the Town of Sheridan.
Unfortunately, the dog's rabies vaccination was outdated and after
re-vaccination, the dog will need to be quarantined for a 6 month
period for observation. Fortunately, no human contact was made with
the raccoon's saliva.

Because rabies almost always leads to death without treatment,
exposure must be avoided. Post-exposure prophylaxis is also
expensive, costing about USD 2500. "These raccoons displayed obvious
"furious" rabid behavior by attacking in such a manner. Often times
we also see where animals have "dumb" rabies and act sleepy and
sickly. No matter how heart-wrenching it is to see an animal in need,
KEEP AWAY! It's just not worth the risk for you or your loved ones to
be exposed to rabies," said Christine Schuyler, Chautauqua County
Public Health director. "The most effective way to protect yourself
is to learn about rabies and how to reduce the risk of exposure to
yourself and your pets."

To help protect your family and your pets from rabies:
- Do not approach or handle any unknown wild or domestic animal.
Contact the health department for a list of licensed wildlife
rehabilitators for assistance with wildlife.
- Keep bats out of homes and other living spaces by sealing small
openings and keeping unscreened doors and windows closed.
- If people or pets may have had contact with a potentially rabid
animal, such as a raccoon, bat, skunk, fox, or stray cat or dog,
secure the animal if possible utilizing a barrier to prevent any
contact and contact DEC [Department of Environmental Conservation]
wildlife officials or the Health Department for further guidance.
- Wash any animal bites and scratches immediately with soap and water
and contact your health care provider immediately. Call the Health
Department to evaluate your risk of rabies, including whether rabies
post-exposure treatment is recommended.
- Keep your pet's rabies vaccination up-to-date.
- Do not feed wild or stray animals and discourage them from seeking
food near your home.
- Keep garbage cans tightly covered and avoid storing any food,
including pet food, outside.
- Teach children to never approach any unfamiliar animal, even if the
animal appears friendly, and to tell an adult immediately if they are
bitten or scratched.

Rabies is a disease of warm-blooded animals caused by a virus.
Raccoons, bats, skunks, and foxes are the common disease carriers.
The virus is transmitted to humans and animals through saliva. It can
enter the body from a bite, scratch, scrape, or open cut. Two forms
of rabies exist. An animal has "furious" rabies when it tries to
attack and bite. When animals have "dumb" rabies, they are listless
and sleepy and have varying degrees of paralysis. Wildlife infected
with rabies act differently than expected. For example, animals
usually seen out at night will be seen during the daylight hours.

New York State law requires that all dogs, cats, and domesticated
ferrets over the age of 4 months be vaccinated against rabies. For
further information about rabies and the many free upcoming rabies
clinics, please contact the Chautauqua County Department of Health at
1-866-604-6789.

[The NY report did a good job of covering the 2 different types of rabies.

However, neither of these reports reminded people that with rabies in
the area it is very important to vaccinate the pets as a prevention
against the disease as well as a measure of protection for yourself. - Mod.TG]
