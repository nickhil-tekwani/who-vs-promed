Canada Finds First Case of "Mad Deer" Disease in Wild
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Wildlife officials have confirmed the first
case of a mad-cow like disease in a wild deer in western Canada, prompting
concerns the brain-wasting illness could wreak the same damage already
under way in game farms. "Unfortunately, from our perspective, we were
hoping it wouldn't be found in the wild but it has been confirmed now that
one was positive,'' said Kevin Omoth, a senior analyst in the fish and
wildlife branch with Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management.
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) was first detected in an elk on a game farm
in Saskatchewan in 1996. Since 1997, an extensive monitoring program has
discovered dozens of confirmed cases in elk on 19 game farms. About 3000
animals have been destroyed in an attempt to stop the disease from
spreading, Omoth said. CWD has been a major blow to Canada's elk ranching
industry, about half of which is in Saskatchewan. The animals are raised
for their meat and their antler velvet, which is used in homeopathic
remedies and aphrodisiacs, especially in Asia. Korea banned imports of elk
antler velvet from Canada last December because of concerns about CWD.
This latest case was found in a wild mule deer shot by a hunter last autumn
in southwestern Saskatchewan, near the border of Alberta. Its head was sent
to a laboratory for study as part of a government collection program that
is testing 1400 deer brains. Officials at the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency near Ottawa, confirmed the presence of CWD.
Food safety experts promise to monitor events closely, but say CWD is not
likely harmful to humans or other domestic livestock because of what they
refer to as a species barrier. "All the current science indicates that it
can't be transmitted from deer or elk to either humans or cattle or horses
and pigs. That puts us at ease,'' Omoth told Reuters. However, an advisory
panel in the United States which was reviewing the Food and Drug
Administration's efforts to keep mad cow disease out of the food chain,
said in January that potential harm to humans from CWD should not be ruled
out. The concern stems from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a deadly
human version of BSE that has killed more than 80 people in Britain after
they ate BSE-tainted beef.
CWD was first found in the United States in 1967 and is present in both
wild and domestic deer and elk in six states. The infected ranch elk in
Saskatchewan came from the United States. Canada banned U.S. elk and deer
imports in 1990. The Saskatchewan government is stepping up efforts to
control CWD, including reducing wild deer and elk populations with expanded
hunting and urging hunters to send in deer heads promptly for testing. "Our
goal is to get an accurate determination of the prevalence of this disease,
and then contain it and work towards eradication,'' Saskatchewan
Environment Minister Buckley Belanger said in a statement. Hunters are
being told to wear rubber gloves when dressing an animal and to avoid
handling brain and spinal chord material. "It's advisable, if an animal is
identified as positive, that a person not eat it. It's the same as eating
anything that was sick, it's just not a good idea,'' said Omoth.
