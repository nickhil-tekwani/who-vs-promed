In Gifu city and Kakamigahara city, a wild boar infected with [classical] swine fever [CSF] was confirmed. Another new wild boar was found in Seki city.

On the morning of 19 Oct 2018, a male wild boar was found on a mountain in the Seki city Kurachi-minami when Gifu prefecture inspected it, and infection with [classical] swine fever was confirmed.

In Gifu prefecture, 33 head of infected wild boar have been found in Gifu city and Kakamigahara city so far; however, this is the 1st CSF case confirmed in Seki city.

It appears that the infected wild boar was found moving on the mountain in a place 90 m [meters?] away from the city boundary with Kakamigahara city.

Prefectural and local authorities are setting up traps for the capture of wild boars mainly around the city border. The prefectural officials say that "expansion of infection is halted at the water's edge."

[The following background to the event is based upon Japan's immediate notification, dated 9 Sep 2018:
On 3 Sep 2018, fattening pigs were found dead and reported to Gifu Central Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC) by a veterinarian. On 8 Sep 2018, the samples derived from pigs of the reported farm tested positive for Pestivirus by RT-PCR. But the result of pestivirus specific FAT was negative. On the same day, the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) carried out CSFV-specific RT-PCR and FAT to samples transported from Gifu City, and the result were positive and negative, respectively. On 9 Sep 2018, sequencing analysis of the virus RNA was completed, and the NIAH confirmed that this is a case of classical swine fever [CSF]. Movement and shipment restrictions were imposed on the hog farms within a radius of 3 km [1.86 mi] and 3-10 km [1.86-6.2 mi] of the affected farm, respectively. Stamping-out was carried out on the affected farm.

Since then, only wild boars have been found CSF-affected, all in and around the single affected (and consequently culled) farm.

The OIE summary of the event provides the following epidemiological statistics as of 9 Oct 2018:
Total outbreaks: 18 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 610 / 29* / 29 / 581 / 0
Wild boar / not available / 19 / 12 / 7 / 0

[*one breeding sow, 26 fattening pigs and 2 suckling pigs].
