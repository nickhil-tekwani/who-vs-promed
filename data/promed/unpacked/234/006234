The mayor of Libourne opened an environmental survey after the death of a triathlete with leptospirosis the week of 14 May 2018. He regularly swam at Lac des Dagueys, but for the moment, there is no evidence that he contracted the disease while swimming.

The mayor of Libourne said on Mon 28 May 2018 that she is taking precautions around Lake Dagueys, following the death of a triathlete from leptospirosis the week of 14 May 2018. The 44-year-old was training regularly.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease transmitted primarily by rodent urine and may be present in fresh water, the Institut Pasteur reports. A vaccine is offered in France only to highly exposed workers (sewer workers, garbage collectors).

The Regional Health Agency and the health watch cell were alerted to determine the presence of other cases. An environmental survey was initiated with inspections around the lake for rodent presence and herd proximity. Samples of the water of the Dagueys were made and sent to the Institut Pasteur; the results will be known within 10 days.

However, the town hall indicates that "the origin of the contamination is uncertain. No link can currently be established with swimming in Lake Dagueys," The sportsman belonging to the club of Libourne trained there regularly.

"Any body of water can contain leptospirosis," said Elisabeth Dugos, president of the triathlon club in Libourne, who calls on people not to be "alarmist." She recalls that the athlete was able to contract bacterial disease out of the water: "It is enough for rats to urinate on a wooden board." She said the triathletes continue to swim at Dagueys Lake.

The members of the club are being invited to an information and awareness meeting this Friday on leptospirosis among other diseases.

[Dagueys Lake is an artificial lake located north of the city of Libourne in Gironde department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of southwest France (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libourne). The lake is used as a recreational area for rowing, sailing, and swimming, as well as for triathlon events (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_des_Dagueys). A map showing the location of Libourne can be found at https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libourne#/media/File:Gironde_map_routes_villes.png.

Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this organism.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also, leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

A Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travellers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short term travellers with a potential for high risk exposure may be helped" http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/userfiles/ccoch/file/Water%20safety/CD007342.pdf. - Mod.ML
