Re: Influenza (24): Australia, 2-fold increase
--------------------------------
The title of this posting and the Guardian account refer, respectively, to a "2-fold increase" and "doubling" of influenza in Australia in 2014 compared to 2013. The reality is more complex, and we are nowhere near a count twice that of 2013.

Data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/source/cda-index.cfm) show that as of 13 Aug 2014, there had been 21 905 cases of laboratory confirmed influenza notified in Australia this year [2014]. A significant increase in monthly notifications did occur in July 2014. In all of 2013, there were 28 327 cases, and the spike last year [2013] was slightly later, in August 2013. Syndromic surveillance also showed a fairly typical level of winter influenza-like illness (http://www.flutracking.neTo:t/Info/Reports).

Australian Influenza Surveillance Report and Activity Updates are available here: http://www.health.gov.au/flureport, and a thoughtful and clear account of influenza is available here: http://theconversation.com/worried-about-the-flu-season-heres-the-story-behind-the-figures-30405.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr Mark Veitch's correction and amplification of the inaccurate Guardian newspaper report describing a 2-fold increase in influenza cases so far in comparison to the previous year (posted as: Influenza (22): Australia, 2-fold increase 20140812.2683584).

Interested readers are recommended to access the appropriate documents listed by Dr. Veitch and also the most recent WHO global update; see: Influenza (23): WHO global update 20140813.2686933. - Mod.CP
