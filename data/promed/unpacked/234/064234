Since the beginning of 2022, 8 people infected with brucellosis have been identified in Kostanay region, a Kazinform correspondent reports.

"Cases of people with brucellosis are registered every year. Over the past 8 months of 2022, 8 people fell ill in the region. To date, this is 7 cases more than the same period in 2021. In most cases, infection of people occurs when caring for cattle with brucellosis and as a result of eating products that have not undergone heat treatment," the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control of the Kostanay region reports on its Instagram page.

The department notes that sick animals are especially dangerous for people during the period of mass lambing and calving. "In addition, infection occurs when animals are slaughtered, meat is cut, and dairy and meat products of sick animals are consumed. The 1st signs of the disease in humans appear 15-30 days after infection: headache, fever up to 39 deg C [102 deg F], sweating and joint pain. The microbe enters the human body through the mucous membranes and skin. Therefore, when helping animals, [like during] lambing, [one] must use overalls (robe, apron, boots) and gloves. It is necessary to wash hands more often with soap and treat with disinfectant solutions," summed up the department.

[Brucellosis is considered hyperendemic in Kazakhstan. A similar situation prevails in several other regional republics of the former Soviet Union (Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan). _Brucella melitensis_, of which small ruminants (sheep, goats) are the reservoir, is the main pathogen circulating in these countries, with a steadily increasing rate of spillover to cattle, though the typical pathogen in cattle is _B. abortus_. Most strains recovered from human patients in Kazakhstan have, traditionally, been identified as _B. melitensis_. - Mod.LL
