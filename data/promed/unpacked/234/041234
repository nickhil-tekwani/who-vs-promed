A day after sounding alert for measles in the city [Indore, Madhya Pradesh State], a team of District Health Department visited Niranjanpur area, on Wednesday [14 May 2014] and found at least 15 patients affected by chickenpox. As per information, the officials received information about measles attack in Niranjanpur area and taking the matter seriously, a team led by Dr Praveen Jadiya reached the area but found the patients were affected by chickenpox, not measles.

The team distributed dosage to the patients and also made them aware of precautions they should take to avoid the disease. "Led by Dr Jadiya, the team inspected the spot but didn't find any patient with measles symptoms, but found 15 patients affected by chickenpox. The disease was in final stage and only a few patients had serious problem," District Vaccination Officer Dr S Porwal said.

He further said that the team would also visit other nearby areas for providing help and making people aware about the disease.

National Joint Secretary of Indian Association of Paediatrics and senior paediatrician Dr VP Goswami said that chickenpox is a common but contagious disease. "It may also affect eyes and skin and also cause multi-organ disorder if not treated [in a] timely [manner]. It is very important to keep the patient isolated," Dr Goswami said. He further said that the disease is caused due to herpesvirus, and the vaccination to prevent it is not in the reach of common people. From May to July is the main time of this disease.

[The following are ProMED-mail Moderator CP's comments in ProMED-mail post Chickenpox - India (02): (Chennai) 20120415.1102085:

"Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a herpes virus. It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox nor received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters. VZV also causes shingles. A person with shingles can spread the virus to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. In these cases, the exposed person might develop chickenpox.

"Chickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. In many countries there is a policy of universal vaccination of all children by the age of 14 to 15 months. However, in India, although chickenpox vaccine is available in private practice, it does not yet form part of the National Immunisation Schedule.

"In February of this year [2012] an increase in cases of chickenpox virus infection was reported also in the in city of Mumbai on the opposite coast of India, similarly attributed to the onset of summer [see: Chickenpox- India: (Mumbai) 20120225.1052634]. Ultraviolet (UV) rays should help prevent the spread of chickenpox, therefore people in milder climates should be more at risk of catching the disease. However the peak incidence of chickenpox in India and Sri Lanka appears to be during the hot, dry, sunny season. This anomaly has been explained because UV rays are actually much lower in the dry season compared with the monsoon period. In the dry season, the pollution in the atmosphere reflects the UV rays back into space. Whereas in the monsoon season, the rains wash away the pollution, and UV irradiation is increased. (For further discussion see: Science Daily 15 Dec 2011 http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111215094921.htm)."

Indore, with a population of 3 876 697 in 2014, is the largest city in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, 190 km (118 miles) west of the state capital of Bhopal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indore). The typical monsoon season goes from mid-June to mid-September and winters (November-March) are said to be usually dry.
