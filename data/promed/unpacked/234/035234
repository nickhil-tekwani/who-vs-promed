As the scare over dioxin poisoning of Belgian meat widened, France reported
a new case of mad cow disease, bringing to 11 the number of cattle found
with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) this year.
The farm ministry said the animal concerned and the rest of its 100-strong
herd in the Mayenne region had been destroyed.
The case is the 60th to be discovered in France -- which has a total cattle
herd of 21 million -- since health authorities began tracking the disease
in 1990.
The ministry said the number of fresh cases should die down after 2001 as
the disease's incubation period is 5 years and all cases could be traced
back to events which took place before late 1996, when tough controls were
slapped on animal feed.
In the second half of 1996 France banned the use of animal nervous tissue,
ground bone and certain organs in feed for pigs, poultry and cattle.
