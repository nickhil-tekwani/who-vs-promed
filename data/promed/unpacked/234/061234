The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of the Czech Republic recently informed of the 1st report of grapevine flavescence dorée (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. The phytoplasma was detected in southern Moravia, close to the border with Austria.

One grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) plant in a conventional vineyard showed suspicious symptoms. It was the only symptomatic plant in the vineyard and tested positive for both grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma and Phytoplasma solani (EPPO A2 List; see comment below). The main vector of flavescence dorée, _Scaphoideus titanus_, is known to occur in the area.

The FD pathogen was also found in 2 _Clematis vitalba_ plants growing at the margins of 2 conventional vineyards. Five plants of _V. vinifera_ in those vineyards showed symptoms such as bleaching and/or distorted leaves, but all tested negative for grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma.

[Flavescence dorée (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was first reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the US, the home of its primary vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group. The only known natural hosts were _Vitis vinifera_ and hybrids, as well as some wild _Vitis_ species as asymptomatic infections, but recently also _Clematis_ species have been reported as alternative hosts (see link below).

FD symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop. Yield is severely reduced; some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material, and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).

In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed. The vector was reported to have overcome the Alps in the mid 1990s. The 1st report of FD north of the Alps was from Germany in 2014 and was suspected to have been due to a quarantine incursion from infected Italian rootstocks (ProMED post 20141217.3038025). Since then, FD has been reported also from other countries north of the Alps (e.g., ProMED post 20190107.6246980). The _S. titanus_ vector has been reported in additional areas. The spread of FD in central Europe is considered another example of "warm climate diseases" moving into cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED post 20141024.2895414).

Bois noir disease of grapevine, also mentioned above, is caused by a phytoplasma belonging to the stolbur taxonomic group (16SrXII-A; type member_Ca._ P. solani 16SrXII; e.g., see ProMED post 20200909.7763574). That disease has been known to occur in the area of the present Czech Republic since the 1940s.

"Eradication" of pathogens or diseases, particularly once they are established in the field (as has been claimed at various times for FD in some European countries; see also update links below), has hardly ever been successful in the past and should never be relied on as a tool for disease management. Furthermore, proof of absence of a pathogen is principally and practically impossible, because it would require that each and every known or potential host, symptomatic or not, as well as all known and potential vectors or pathogen reservoirs are tested with a method that has a 100% rate of reliability.
