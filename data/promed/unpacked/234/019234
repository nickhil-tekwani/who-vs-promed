On Monday, as the European Union (EU) considered whether to ban sales of
chicken meat and eggs produced in Belgium over health fears, a number of
European countries began to introduce their own restrictions.
Belgium banned sales of chicken and eggs within its borders on Friday after
stocks from some farms were found to contain high levels of dioxin, a
highly toxic chemical linked to cancer. The contamination has been linked
to oils used in chicken feed.
RUSSIA imposed a temporary ban on all Belgian poultry meat imports, said
Vyatcheslav Avilov, head of the veterinary department at the Agriculture
Ministry. The Department was trying to find out the whereabouts of Belgian
meat already cleared by customs.
FRANCE's Agriculture Ministry said on Friday that it was freezing retail
sales of all food products containing chicken or eggs from Belgium. France
imports about 40,600 tons of chicken and 31,200 tons of products containing
eggs from Belgium every year. It is examining whether possibly contaminated
raw material for animal feed manufacture were sold to a French company.
GERMANY's Health Ministry warned on Sunday Belgian chickens and eggs should
no longer be eaten and stocks should be withdrawn from shops. The final
decision lies with the 16 individual states. Agriculture Minister
Karl-Heinz Funke said 2 farms might have imported contaminated feed in
January. Health Minister Andrea Fischer said: ``It is regrettable that the
Belgian authorities informed me so late of what had happened.''
ITALY's health authorities have stepped up checks on poultry and eggs from
Belgium, but there is no ban. The country is keenly aware of dioxin after
an explosion in 1976 at an agricultural chemical factory in the town of
Seveso in northern Italy caused more than 300 grams of dioxin to be released.
FINLAND's Agriculture Ministry said that no Belgian chicken or eggs were
imported into Finland because of salmonella controls. Finland would support
an EU ban.
THE NETHERLANDS government advised people not to eat Belgian chickens and
eggs. It would not issue a ban unless and until the EU does so, a
government spokesman said.
SLOVENIA's Agriculture Ministry says it had so far not issued any warning
regarding Belgium chickens or eggs.
POLAND on Monday suspended imports of Belgian chickens, meat and eggs, the
Veterinary Inspectorate said.
