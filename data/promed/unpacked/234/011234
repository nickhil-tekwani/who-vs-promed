2 more Chicago schools test positive for high lead levels
---------------------------------------------------------
Two more Chicago Public Schools (CPS) are found to have lead in the water. CPS says that a fountain at Manierre Elementary in Old Town was contaminated. It's been turned off.

The district has checked the water at 2000 water fountains and sinks -- 71 have shown signs of contamination.

[It appears that lead in water is a large problem in many areas, especially schools. In most of these reports we find that a water fountain has been turned off, or a lavatory has been turned off. The question remains as to whether these sources are positive because of lead in the apparatus (water fountain/lavatory) or in the pipes bringing the water to that apparatus (water fountain/lavatory). The other question remains as to whether ALL water fountains/lavatories are being tested in each school? If the source is the pipes then it means either portions of the piping were put in at different times of different materials, the piping with the apparatus is what is faulty, or the source has not truly been found.
