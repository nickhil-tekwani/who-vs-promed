Authorities are investigating an ongoing outbreak of scombrotoxin fish poisoning traced to yellowfin tuna. They have blocked all incoming shipments of the fish from a Vietnamese company that has refused to initiate a recall. Public health officials have confirmed at least 47 people from unspecified states as outbreak patients. The most recent illness began 15 Oct 2019, according to an outbreak investigation notice posted today by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The 1st known patient became ill on 8 Aug 2019.

Scombrotoxin fish poisoning occurs when fish begins to spoil and histamine levels in it increase. Histamine cannot be destroyed by freezing or cooking. The FDA reported that all yellowfin tuna from Truong Phu Xanh Co. Ltd. of Vietnam with 2019 production dates is implicated and should be thrown away.

Stores, restaurants, and other foodservice operators are expected to pull the tuna, but the FDA wants consumers to shoulder some responsibility, too. The agency's notice tells consumers to ask whether yellowfin tuna -- also called ahi tuna -- being sold is from the specific company named by the FDA.

FDA officials have not used the agency's power to force the Vietnamese company to recall the tuna, even though the firm has been determined to have supplied the fish. "FDA asked for the supplier of yellowfin tuna associated with most of the illnesses, Truong Phu Xanh Co. Ltd. of Vietnam, to initiate a voluntary recall of all of its imported yellowfin tuna with production dates from January 2019 to the present. At this time, the firm has not recalled any product," the FDA reported today [15 Nov 2019]. "Because scombrotoxin fish poisoning causes temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences, this incident did not meet the threshold for the use of FDA's mandatory recall authority."

Although the Vietnamese supplier has not issued a recall, some companies in the United States have posted recalls for the implicated tuna, the FDA reported. The agency, working with officials in unnamed states, gathered information from victims and entities in the supply chain that led to those 3rd-party recalls.

The FDA notice says some of the tuna could still be on the market. "Tuna from this supplier could have been sold thawed or frozen, and could have been sold as ground tuna meat, poke cubes, steaks, or loins; this product could still be within its shelf life," the notice states. Because of the outbreak investigation and findings to date, the FDA placed Truong Phu Xanh Co. Ltd. of Vietnam on "Import Alert," which means the firm's yellowfin tuna can be detained at U.S. borders and ports of entry without physical examination.

A concurrent investigation of cases of scombroid fish poisoning by the Seattle-King County Public Health Department is not related to the FDA's investigation of Truong Phu Xanh Co. Ltd., according to federal officials.

Standard tests used during enforcement activities and other kinds of foodborne illness investigations are not effective for situations of suspected scombrotoxin fish poisoning, according to the FDA's outbreak notice. The samples collected thus far by federal and state investigators cannot be linked to samples from patients by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Pathogens such as specific strains of _Salmonella_ or _E. coli_ are generally pinpointed with WGS or PFGE processes, but the spoilage factor in the scombroid scenario makes that impossible.

"Scombrotoxin fish poisoning occurs when fish begin to spoil, resulting in increased histamine levels," FDA's notice says. "Multiple samples have been collected and analyzed, with positive results for decomposition or high histamine levels in products imported from Truong Phu Xanh Co. Ltd."

Symptoms of scombroid poisoning can become evident within minutes to 2 hours following consumption of contaminated fish, according to the FDA. Initial signs can mimic an allergic response and include facial flushing, sweating, burning-peppery taste sensations about the mouth and throat, dizziness, nausea, and headache. Symptoms can intensify to facial rash, hives, swelling, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Severe reactions to the poison can include blurred vision, respiratory stress, and swelling of the tongue.

Abstract
-------
"Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (such as, tuna, mackerel, bonito) are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term, "scombroid fish poisoning," to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled, are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses, especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 h. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid, histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on ensuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk."

Abstract
--------
"Scombroid poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning, is an allergy-like form of food poisoning that continues to be a major problem in seafood safety. The exact role of histamine in scombroid poisoning is not straightforward. Deviations from the expected dose-response have led to the advancement of various possible mechanisms of toxicity, none of them proven. Histamine action levels are used in regulation until more is known about the mechanism of scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning and histamine are correlated but complicated. Victims of scombroid poisoning respond well to antihistamines, and chemical analyses of fish implicated in scombroid poisoning generally reveal elevated levels of histamine. Scombroid poisoning is unique among the seafood toxins since it results from product mishandling rather than contamination from other trophic levels. Inadequate cooling following harvest promotes bacterial histamine production and can result in outbreaks of scombroid poisoning. Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning. Laboratory methods and screening methods for detecting histamine are available in abundance but need to be compared and validated to harmonize testing. Successful field testing, including dockside or on-board testing needed to augment HACCP efforts, will have to integrate rapid and simplified detection methods with simplified and rapid sampling and extraction. Otherwise, time-consuming sample preparation reduces the impact of gains in detection speed on the overall analysis time." - Mod.LL
