BSE - FRANCE: CORRECTION (02)

Subject: Correction

I am awfuly sorry but I made a typed mistake in the message about French
cases of BSE.
All the data about cases in the departments are correct.
In the cases per year, for 1996 it is 12 cases and not 15. The total
calculation of 27 cases is correct. As refered, the OIE web sites gives
those figures right.
Sorry for this.
