Mon 29 Aug 2011: no new EHV-1 cases
The affected premises remains under quarantine and temperatures are
being monitored twice daily. CDFA staff conducted an onsite
investigation and confirmed implementation of biosecurity practices.
CDFA will continue to monitor the situation. The premises may be
released from quarantine as early as 21 days from the onset of
clinical signs for the last confirmed EHV-1 positive case.

Wed 24 Aug 2011: 2 additional EHV-1 cases confirmed
2 additional horses on the affected premises have been confirmed
positive by nasal swab for the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1. The
only clinical sign displayed by these 2 horses was a fever. The
affected premises is under quarantine and the 13 other horses
currently on the property are being monitored. Current epidemiologic
investigation findings indicate minimal risk of disease spread from
this closed premises.

[It is to be hoped that these horses will recover. As the premises is
closed, with a quarantine in place, there seems little risk of
exposure to other horses, aside perhaps, from those on the premises. -
