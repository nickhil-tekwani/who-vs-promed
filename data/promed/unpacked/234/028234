Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Jordan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Between [7 and 10 Aug 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 5 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 2 deaths.

Details of the cases:

1- A 78-year-old male from Amman city developed symptoms on [26 Aug 2015] and, on [1 Sep 2015], was admitted to hospital. This hospital, which the patient frequently visited due to chronic conditions, has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. He passed away on [4 Sep 2015] and tested positive for MERS-CoV on [5 Sep 2015]. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the MERS-CoV cases in the hospital or with shared health care workers is ongoing. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

2- A 53-year-old male from Amman city developed symptoms on [27 Aug 2015] and, on [5 Sep 2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities and was a heavy smoker, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [8 Sep 2015]. He passed away on [7 Sep 2015]. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

3- A 7-year-old female from Amman city tested positive for MERS-CoV while asymptomatic on [10 Sep 2015]. Currently, she is still asymptomatic and under observation in a negative pressure isolation room in a hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed case (see above -- case no. 2). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

4- A 10-month-old female from Amman city developed symptoms on [9 Sep 2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital on [10 Sep 2015] and, on the same day, tested positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient, who has no comorbidities, is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed case (see above -- case no. 2). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

5- A 65-year-old female from Amman city developed symptoms on [3 Sep 2015] and, on [9 Sep 2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [10 Sep 2015]. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient visited a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see DON published on [1 Sep 2015] -- case no. 3) at the hospital that has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point of Jordan also notified WHO of the death of 1 MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [1 Sep 2015] (case no. 3).

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1569 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 554 related deaths.

[According to a 10 Sep 2015 report available on the WHO EMRO (Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office) website, there have been a total of 11 cases of laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reported in Jordan between 26 Aug 2015 and 9 Sep 2015. Of these 11 cases, 5 have died (see http://www.emro.who.int/jor/jordan-news/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-merscov-in-jordan.html for original report). In the above WHO confirmation list, cases no. 1 and 2 were covered in an earlier ProMED-mail post (MERS-CoV (129): Saudi Arabia, Jordan, WHO 20150911.3635718). Case no. 3 above is an asymptomatic contact, case no. 4 a pediatric contact and case no. 5 another contact of an earlier reported case. Hence, it appears as there have been a total of 11 cases in this current nosocomial outbreak, with the index case being an importation from Saudi Arabia (see MERS-CoV (118): Saudi Arabia, Jordan ex Saudi Arabia ex Abroad, WHO, RFI 20150827.3605963 for details). As a reminder, there was another imported case from Saudi Arabia at the end of 2014/early 2015 that did not result in secondary spread in Jordan (see MERS-CoV (03): Saudi Arabia, new cases, new fatality, Jordan, WHO 20150107.3077259 and MERS-CoV (68): Jordan, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20141229.3057913).
