SUSPECT HENDRA VIRUS INFECTION IN NEW SOUTH WALES
The New South Wales (NSW) Department of Primary Industries has
advised that a suspect case of infection with Hendra virus (HeV) has
been reported in a horse on the Far North Coast of NSW.
All previous cases of infection with HeV in horses have occurred in
the neighbouring state of Queensland. If confirmed, this will be the
first case in a horse in NSW. The case occurred approximately 30 km
from the Queensland border.
The affected horse showed neurological and respiratory signs
consistent with HeV infection. It was euthanased on Tuesday 31 Oct
2006, and samples were taken for HeV exclusion testing. One companion
horse in the same paddock is apparently healthy.
Tests to confirm HeV infection are underway at the National Reference
Laboratory, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong.
Therefore, this case is not yet considered to be officially
confirmed. However, the veterinary profession has been advised to
apply the necessary precaution when examining sick horses or carrying
out post-mortem investigations.
The horse paddock contains trees that were roosts for flying foxes
(fruit bats in the genus _Pteropus_).
There have been 6 previous incidents involving HeV in Australia, and
none has spread from the initial focus. The 1994 outbreak was
confined to stables near Brisbane (Queensland), while the 1995 death
of 2 horses from one farm near Mackay (Queensland) was an isolated
incident. In 1999, 2004 and June 2006 (all in Queensland), single
horses were affected in each case.
HeV is not highly contagious: horses are thought to be infected by
eating material heavily contaminated with the virus (e.g. via bat
urine or birth products). Signs in horses typically include breathing
difficulties, high fever, and blood-tinged foamy discharge from nose and mouth.
Preliminary advice concerning this matter has been provided to the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

[ProMED is very grateful to Dr Eva-Maria Bernoth, Australian Deputy
Chief Veterinary Officer, for this report.
HeV appeared in dramatic fashion during ProMED's 1st year of
operation in 1994, when a leading Australian horse trainer died a
week after being stricken with symptoms similar to a disease that
killed 14 racehorses in Queensland. -- see last ProMED ref. in list
below. The cause turned out to be a new, bat-borne paramyxovirus. - Mod.JW]
[Sporadic cases of HeV infection are not surprising. The virus is
probably endemic in Australian _Pteropus_ fruit bats, so occasional
to rare equine cases can be expected to occur within the range of
these bats . - Mod. TY]
