EHRLICHIOSIS, CANINE (2)
========================

Although I don't recall any discussion of E. equi in dogs in the original
PROMED Mail note concerning a mystery disease in Hawaii, in fact an E.
equi-like agent is well known to cause disease in dogs and several
isolations have been recently made. In the northeast and upper midwest
US, an E. equi-like agent (that has a 16S rRNA gene sequence identical
to that of the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis) has been
identified in both dogs and horses. E. equi is implicated as a cause of
granulocytic ehrlichiosis of horses and dogs in California, and large
numbers of dogs in the midwest US also have antibodies reactive with E.
equi. This observation is not limited to the US; dogs and horses in
Sweden are known to have been infected by an E. equi-like granulocytic
ehrlichia that, again, has a 16S rRNA gene identical to the human
granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent.
Thus, E. equi and the related agent of HGE must be considered zoonotic
agents capable of at minimum human, canine, and equine disease.
Interestingly, the agent seems to be present in geographic locations
where appropriate Ixodes species tick vectors (such as I. scapularis, I.
pacificus, and I. ricinus) are known to exist. Whether this infection is
present in man or animals in Hawaii should be relatively easy to discern
by serologic methods.
