[The OIE WAHID reference contains a map of the location, although a
slightly more detailed map map of Germany showing the 3 provinces
where avian flu cases have been reported is available at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/germany.jpg>.
It would still be very useful to know what was so unusual about the
case of the goose in Thuringia in the 1st report, that it required
the slaughter of all birds within the 3-km (2-mi) surveillance zone.
None of the 25 individual swans or coots summarized in the 2nd report
seemed to have needed similar control and follow up tactics. - Mod.PC]
