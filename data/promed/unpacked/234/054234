The bird flu crisis escalated today [15 Nov 2007] as vets said the
virus may have spread to a 2nd farm a few kilometers from the initial
outbreak. Turkeys at Grove Farm near Botesdale in Suffolk were being
slaughtered on suspicion of having the disease.

The site is within a 3 km (2 mi) protection zone established around
Redgrave Park Farm where the deadly H5N1 virus was 1st discovered on
Sunday [11 Nov 2007].

A precautionary cull had already been ordered at Grove Farm because
it is owned by the same firm as Redgrave Park Farm but when animal
health officials turned up they found a number of birds deed.

The 2 farms and 3 others also run by Redgrave Poultry are all staffed
by the same 5 workers and vets believe they or their vehicles could
have transferred the virus.

In all nearly 30 000 turkeys are being gassed at the 5 farms.

Vets have yet to establish how the virus arrived in Suffolk. It is
the same strain that caused outbreaks in Germany and Bohemia this
summer [2007] and one theory is that it was brought by migrating
birds, which settled on an ornamental lake near Redgrave Park Farm.

A Redgrave Poultry spokesman denied suggestions that the disease
could have come from imported ducklings from the Netherlands. Young
ducks, turkeys and geese at all 5 farms, and all their feed, were
sourced from the UK, he said. The Dutch farm ministry said only one
consignment of ducklings had gone recently to the UK and the delivery
was 50 km (31 mi) away from where the outbreak occurred.

Another line of inquiry is that Gressingham Foods, of which Redgrave
Poultry is a subsidiary, also imports specialist meats like Barbary
duck and poussin [spring chicken or Cornish game hen], which are
processed at a plant less than a kilometre (0.6 mi) from the scene of
the outbreak.

The possible spread of the disease to another farm was a bitter blow
to the GBP 3.4 billion (approx. USD 7 billion) poultry industry and
there were warnings that supply shortages could mean consumers have
to pay more than GBP 100 (USD 206) for an organic Christmas turkey.

A total of 1200 poultry producers, with 25 million birds -- including
2 million turkeys -- lie inside a restricted zone imposed on the
whole of Suffolk and most of Norfolk and are barred from moving their
flocks outside it.

Within 10 km (6 mi) of the outbreak, there are 89 producers who have
had to isolate 4 million birds. The restrictions on them will only be
lifted 30 days after the outbreak is declared over, meaning the birds
may not make it to stores in time for Christmas.

Investigators are looking at disinfectant procedures on the 5
Redgrave Poultry farms and also trying to establish if people or
vehicles from there travelled to other parts of the UK. "If there is
evidence of a movement elsewhere in the country we will have to take
precautions," a source said.

Jeremy Blackburn, a spokesman for the British Poultry Council, urged
the public to back British turkey. "At the moment we haven't seen a
noticeable drop in sales," he said.

The other 3 farms involved are Stone House Farm in West Harling,
Norfolk, Bridge Farm in Pulham, Norfolk, and Hill Meadow in
Knettishall, Suffolk.

Imported day-old ducklings from the Netherlands are now being
investigated as a possible route for the H5N1 avian flu virus
arriving in Britain.

The Times has learnt that Gressingham Foods received regular supplies
of ducklings delivered by a Dutch exporter. The focus of inquiries is
on the vehicle and driver, whether there are any links with previous
outbreaks of the virus in mainland Europe, and whether there was any
opportunity for the disease to be spread through the Gressingham
company via vehicles, equipment, or staff.

The strain of virus in Suffolk is almost identical to one that
infected ducks on a farm outside Munich in southern Germany in
September [2007]. The same virus was also found in outbreaks in the
Czech Republic in August [2007]. Ducks have shown no symptoms of
disease in Suffolk but some can act as carriers without showing
symptoms. Blood samples are being taken to see if they could have
transmitted the virus to turkeys.

Imports of speciality poultry meats by Gressingham Foods are also
part of the official inquiry. This meat is frequently processed or
packed at the company's plant less than 750 yards (0.7 km) from
Redgrave Park Farm, near Diss, which is at the centre of the alert.
Gressingham regularly imports guinea fowl, poussin, Barbary duck
breasts and legs, and smoked duck breasts.

An audit trail is being conducted to see whether any imported meat
came from European farms near recent outbreaks of bird flu.

The virus can live in poultry faeces, which can be transferred by
vehicles, drivers, farm staff, bird crates, packaging, feathers, or
live birds. It can travel on footwear and on tyres. The virus in
faeces can survive for several weeks, depending on conditions such as
temperature and humidity.

A cull of 5000 turkeys, 1200 ducks, and 500 geese is still under way
at Redgrave Park Farm and a further 22 000 turkeys on 4 other farms
in the area are to be slaughtered as "dangerous contacts."

The 4 new premises are Stone House Farm in West Harling and Bridge
Farm, Pulham, both in Norfolk, and Grove Farm, in Botesdale, and Hill
Meadow, in Knettishall, both in Suffolk. No disease has been
identified in these birds but there is concern about possible spread
of the virus by 5 poultry workers who operated between these 5
premises, all run by Gressingham.

In East Anglia, 25 million turkeys are farmed. Many are for export
but more than 3 million are destined for the GBP 400 million [USD
823.4 million] domestic Christmas market. Many are breeding birds.

An air exclusion order has been made above the infected farms to
prevent broadcast companies hiring helicopters to film the scene.

Fred Landeg, the acting chief veterinary officer, was concerned that
helicopters would disturb the birds, delaying the cull, and could
also spread the disease.

Britain's emergency stockpile of flu drugs must be doubled or even
tripled to give the country the best chance of containing a pandemic,
the Government's own scientific advisory panel has recommended.

The supply of 14.6 million doses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu,
enough for a quarter of the population, is too small to ensure that
the maximum number of lives would be saved, an official report has
concluded.

Poultry on a 2nd Suffolk farm are being culled on suspicion they have
bird flu, Defra has said.

The turkeys at Grove Farm in Botesdale were due to be culled after
Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) said
they had "dangerous contact" with the initial case of the virus.

But when officials arrived to start the cull they discovered a number
of birds already dead, meaning it is now a "slaughter on suspicion."

The premises are within the protection zone around the 1st affected
farm. A 3 km (2 mi) protection zone and a 10 km (6 mi) surveillance
zone, where movement of birds is restricted and poultry must be
isolated from wild birds, is in place around Redgrave Park farm. This
is where the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus was confirmed on Tuesday
[13 Nov 2007].

The other 3 lie within the wider restricted zone, covering much of
Suffolk and Norfolk.

Culls are taking place there as a precaution after officials said
there was a danger the birds had been exposed to the virus by the
movement of people from the initial outbreak.

They are Stone House Farm in West Harling, Bridge Farm in Pulham,
both in Norfolk, and Hill Meadow in Knettishall, Suffolk.

A total of 22 000 free-range turkeys will be killed at these farms in
addition to the 6500 turkeys, ducks, and geese culled at the
free-range rearing unit at Redgrave Park farm.

Geoffrey Buchanan, operations director of Gressingham Foods'
subsidiary Redgrave Poultry, which operates all the sites affected,
said the same staff work at the different farms.

He said: "There is a direct link between Redgrave Park farm and these
4 other farms as they share the same farming staff. Each farm is too
small for a dedicated staff, so a small team of people runs this
cluster of farms."

[The BBC article includes a map.

Results of the epidemiological investigations into the source of
infection are anticipated. At present, 2 scenarios seem to be
considered: introduction by means of imported materials/animals (see
2nd newswire above), or contact of the free-range domestic birds
(turkeys/geese/ducks) with infected wild birds, most likely migratory
water birds. - Mod.AS]
