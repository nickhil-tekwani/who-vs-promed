In the municipalities of Palmeira, Anita Garibaldi and Bocaina do Sul, in Serra de Santa Catarina [SC], monkey deaths have been confirmed by the Central Laboratory (LACEN) as yellow fever. The last confirmation came this Tuesday [2 Feb 2021], in Palmeira.

According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, the monkey was found dead in the Sao Sebastiao do Canoas locality on 19 Jan 2021, but the results of the tests were only released now. The test showed that the animal was infected by the sylvatic type disease -- that is, it is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes infected with the virus.

The secretariat also awaits results relating to 3 other monkeys that were found dead in the municipality, in the locality of Mato Escuro. This is the 1st time in the last 4 years that Palmeira, with just over 6600 inhabitants, has confirmed yellow fever cases.

This year [2021] so far, there are 4 confirmations of monkey deaths from the disease in Santa Catarina. In addition to the Serra, another confirmed case was in the Planalto Norte, in Mafra.

In 2020, 134 monkeys died due to yellow fever in SC. There were 2 fatal human cases [does not specify when. - Mod.TY]. The animal [monkey] does not transmit the disease [directly to people], it just indicates that the virus is circulating in that region.

The only way to prevent yellow fever [in humans], which is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is by having the vaccine. Doses are available at vaccination stations across the state for those between 6 months and 60 years of age. In Palmeira -- a municipality that had a confirmed [monkey] case -- a D-day vaccination campaign against yellow fever is scheduled for 13 Feb 2021.

[Yellow fever [YF] virus in Santa Catarina state continues to be active. The human cases last year (2020) were due to YF virus spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. The dead monkeys indicate that the virus has been circulating in the state for over a year. It is important that YF-vaccination coverage in the human population reach the 95% goal set by the Ministry of Health. Vaccination is the only way to avoid these sylvan cases, since elimination of the forest YF virus transmission cycle is not feasible. Without prevention of these human sylvan cases, there is the risk that YF virus could be introduced by them into the urban cycle of virus transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and spread quickly.

The species of affected monkeys is not indicated in the above report. Some species of monkeys in Brazil are endangered, and losses due to yellow fever are of concern for their conservation. Finding monkeys dead of yellow fever (YF) is not surprising at this time of year. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern based on historical analyses of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. The December-May period is under way. Efforts to reach 95% vaccination coverage in the state are prudent, given the evidence that active yellow fever virus transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY
