The Voronezh regional authorities for public health have held a
meeting to discuss the epidemiological situation. The discussion
concerned the extent of a campaign to tackle poisoning cases with wild
mushrooms. There were 7 outbreaks of poisoning in the oblast this year
[2011] involving 19 people (3 were children). One child died because
of mushroom poisoning. The most typical case is poisoning with
mushrooms looking like edible ones, which are gathered from the nearby
forests of settlements.

to be a trained mycologist or to collect them with a trained one, as a
mistake can be deadly. - Mod.TG]
