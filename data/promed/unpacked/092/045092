West Nile virus scare scuttles Central Park concert
---------------------------------------------------
Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus have been found in Manhattan and
Staten Island, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Monday, forcing the
postponement of a Central Park concert. At a hastily-called news
conference, the mayor said spraying in the two boroughs would begin Monday
night. Because of that, the city has postponed a free concert in Central
Park by the New York philharmonic. The annual event typically is attended
by thousands of people.
The city has so far received no reports of people affected by the virus,
Giuliani said, and is stepping up its efforts to control the mosquitoes that
can transmit it to humans. Some of the mosquitoes were found in the Central
Park area, officials said. The mayor, accompanied by Health Commissioner
Neil Cohen, urged people to use precautions if they needed to go into
Central Park Monday night, but stressed that the park would not be closed at
any time. The concert was canceled, they said, because the risk of infecting
a person would have risen dramatically had the expected crowd of 30,000 been
allowed to attend the event. Cohen noted that many of those who historically
attended were senior citizens, who are especially vulnerable to the
virus.The performance has been rescheduled for Tuesday night, which is the
scheduled rain date.
An outbreak last year killed at least seven people in the New York area and
sickened more than 60. A congressional report on the event, prepared by the
Democratic staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, calls for
stronger federal involvement to prevent such outbreaks in the future. It
criticizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for not
recognizing the virus sooner. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the
ranking minority member on the committee, said the situation had to be taken
seriously.

West Nile Virus Confirmed In Three Pools Of Mosquitoes:
One In Central Park, And Two In Staten Island
-------------------------------------------------------
Central Park has been added to the areas in Douglaston and Staten Island
(announced Friday), which will receive ground-based spraying tonight from
10pm to 5am, weather permitting. New York city residents are urged to
eliminate areas of standing water around their homes, and to take
precautions against mosquitoes.
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that
the New York State Department of Health has confirmed evidence of West Nile
virus (WNV) in three pools of mosquitoes trapped recently in New York City.
The mosquitoes were collected last week in the southern section of Central
Park, in Wolfe's Pond Park in Staten Island, and in Fresh Kills, Staten
Island. Central Park will be closed tonight starting at 10:00pm for
ground-based spraying for adult mosquitoes. The New York Philharmonic
performance scheduled for Central Park this evening has been canceled.
Dr. Cohen said, "Protecting the public health is our number one priority,
and we are continuing our exhaustive efforts to identify any signs of West
Nile virus in New York City as early as possible. I urge all New Yorkers to
help mosquito-proof New York City, particularly within their neighborhoods,
by removing sources of standing water around their homes where mosquitoes
may breed, and reporting areas of standing water to the Health Department. I
also want to remind New Yorkers to take precautions to limit exposure to
mosquitoes by wearing protective clothing, such as long pants, long-sleeved
shirts, and socks, if outside during evening, nighttime, and dawn hours when
mosquitoes are most active and likely to bite, and by considering the use of
insect repellant containing 10% or less of DEET for children and no more
than 30% DEET for adults, according to manufacturer's directions.
"Tonight, weather permitting, we are adding Central Park to the targeted
ground-based spraying schedule we announced previously. The two areas in
Staten Island in which mosquito pools tested positive are already included
in the areas we have scheduled to spray tonight. In addition, there will be
ground-based spraying for adult mosquitoes on Wednesday, July 26, 2000, in
Manhattan between 23rd Street and 110th Street, from river to river. These
pesticide applications will reduce the number of mosquitoes and will reduce
the potential for human illnesses," Dr. Cohen said. Ground-based spraying
schedules and details for tonight and tomorrow are detailed at the end of
this press release.
New York City residents can learn more about the areas to be sprayed from
WCBS Radio (880 AM) at 6:56 am and 6:56 pm each day, through other media, by
calling the West Nile Virus information line at 1-877-WNV-4NYC, by checking
the Health Department Web site at nyc.gov/health, and by calling community
boards and elected officials. For these spraying efforts, the City will use
Anvil, a pyrethroid-based pesticide effective for controlling mosquitoes.
Both Anvil and Scourge are available to the City for mosquito control and
are registered for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). The
active ingredient in Anvil is Sumithrin, and the active ingredient in
Scourge is Resmethrin. Sumithrin and Resmethrin are synthetic pesticides
similar to a natural pesticide produced by Chrysanthemum flowers. Sumithrin
quickly breaks down in sunlight and water, and Resmethrin decomposes quickly
in sunlight or when exposed to air. Spraying in New York City is conducted
in accordance with EPA and DEC guidelines. Health risks associated with the
use of pyrethroids in this manner are negligible. While Anvil and Scourge
are each relatively non-toxic to humans, dogs, cats, and other mammals, the
New York City Department of Health recommends that all individuals take the
following precautions to avoid direct exposure to pesticides: Whenever
possible, people and pets should stay indoors during spraying with windows
closed and air conditioners turned off. If you have to remain outdoors,
avoid eye contact with the spray. If you get pesticide spray directly in
your eyes, immediately rinse them with water or eye drops. Wash skin and
clothing exposed to pesticides with soap and water. Some individuals are
sensitive to pesticides. Persons with asthma or other respiratory conditions
are especially encouraged to stay inside during spraying since there is a
possibility that spraying could worsen those conditions.
Anyone experiencing adverse reactions to pesticides should call their doctor
or the NYC Poison Control Center at (212) POISONS or (212) 764-7667. Dr.
Cohen reminded New Yorkers to continue throughout the mosquito season to
help their neighbors and the City prevent mosquitoes by eliminating areas of
standing water around their homes throughout the mosquito season: Make sure
roof gutters drain properly. Dispose of tin cans, plastic containers,
ceramic pots, or similar water-holding containers. Remove all discarded
tires from property. Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas and
hot tubs. If not in use, keep empty and covered. Drain water from pool
covers. Turn over plastic wading pools and wheelbarrows when not in use.
Eliminate any standing water that collects on property. Change water in bird
baths once a week. Remind or help neighbors to eliminate breeding sites on
their properties. Report standing water to the Health Department through the
West Nile virus information line (1-877-WNV-4NYC) or the City's Web site
(nyc.gov/health). In addition, Dr. Cohen advised New Yorkers to take
precautions against mosquitoes, including: If outside during evening,
nighttime, and dawn hours when mosquitoes are most active and likely to
bite, children and adults should wear protective clothing such as long
pants, long-sleeved shirts, and socks. consider the use of an insect
repellant containing 10% or less DEET for children and no more than 30% DEET
for adults. USE DEET ACCORDING TO MANUFACTURER'S DIRECTIONS. Make sure that
doors and windows have tight-fitting screens. Repair or replace screens that
have tears or holes. To quickly detect the presence of West Nile virus in
New York City, the Department of Health (NYCDOH) conducts a number of
surveillance programs, including placing approximately 120 mosquito traps at
more than 70 sites throughout the City; monitoring 14 sentinel chicken
flocks placed in each borough; picking up and testing dead birds reported to
the Health Department by New York City residents; and working closely with
the medical community to identify potential cases in people. In addition,
the NYCDOH continues to conduct extensive larviciding activities in catch
basins and other areas of standing water Citywide to reduce mosquito breeding.
For information on West Nile virus, the spraying activities to take place
this week, or to report dead birds and areas of standing water where
mosquitoes may breed, New Yorkers may call the DOH's West Nile virus
automated information line, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at
1-877-WNV-4NYC (1-877-968-4692). (New Yorkers who use TTY/TDD can call
212-788-4947 weekdays from 9:00a.m. to 5:00p.m.). Extensive information is
also included on the City's Web site at nyc.gov/health.

[ProMED-mail intends to reduce the number of postings on West Nile virus to
avoid the increasing duplication of information and increasing reader
fatigue. Until such time as the epidemiological situation clarifies,
postings will be abbreviated to communicate only new information. The
numbers of affected birds and virus-infected mosquitoes are increasing
slowly, but they are still comparatively small. There have been no confirmed
human cases of West Nile virus infection. The outbreak is not progressing
rapidly and administrative and civic responses appear to be adequate and
timely. Indeed there are signs that the outbreak is being over-sold;
"Overkill" is setting in. For example, Dr. Gerald Ginsberg, an East Side
physician who takes a three-mile walk through the park every day, was quoted
in the New York Times (Byline Eric Lipton) as saying: "It's not a huge scare
You know what would have been more frightening to me? If they had found
deer and deer ticks with Lyme disease in Central Park." The heavy reliance
on and the increasing extent of spraying is evoking increasing protest from
some environmental groups who say the mayor is overreacting. Kimberly Flynn,
a researcher for the New York Environmental Law and Justice Project, was
also quoted as saying: "The city is taking an irresponsible course of
action". While Parks Department workers handed out pamphlets yesterday
reading, "Public Health Alert", Central Park patrons expressed a mixture of
support and skepticism about the city's pesticide campaign. Some said they
were glad that the city was moving to try to eliminate the threat. But [a
31-year-old jogger, said that although he understood the need for
officials to be cautious, he wondered whether the authorities might be
overreacting. "I've never been bitten by a mosquito here,' he said. "I've
never even seen one in New York City." - Mod.CP
