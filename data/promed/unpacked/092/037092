Regional update: pandemic (H1N1) 2009
-------------------------------------
The information contained within this update is obtained from data provided
by Ministries of Health of Member States and National Influenza Centers
through reports sent to Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) or updates
on their web pages.

Evolution of the pandemic
-------------------------
North America
-------------
Widespread influenza activity and increased trends in acute respiratory
disease continued this week.

In Canada, the national influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate
increased again relative to the last week and remained above average for
the 4th consecutive week. There was a sharp increase in the number of
influenza outbreaks and these continued to be reported mostly in school
settings. The proportion of tests positive for influenza sharply increased
this week to 29.0 per cent from 16.9 per cent (EW 41 [11-17 Oct 2009]).

In the United States, ILI consultations continued to increase, remaining
above the national baseline for the 9th consecutive week.
Laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization rates remained high,
especially in persons 5 to 49 years of age. The proportion of deaths
attributed to pneumonia and influenza remained above the epidemic threshold
for the 3rd consecutive week. All subnational regions continued to report
outpatient ILI activity above their regional baseline, but some regions in
the south and west reported some small decreases over the past week. A
total of 22 influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week,
of which 19 were associated with the pandemic virus. Of these pediatric
deaths, the majority were in children 5-17 years of age.

Caribbean
---------
These countries continue to report variable trends in acute respiratory
disease. Intensity of acute respiratory disease was reported as both high
and low/moderate, while impact of acute respiratory disease on health care
services was reported as both low and moderate.

This week, Barbados reported 8 cases of co-infection with pandemic
influenza and dengue-3, diagnosed by RT-PCR. In this region, for countries
providing these data, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)
hospitalization rate have been increasing over the past 3 weeks, reaching
the highest rate this year [2009] in EW 41.

Central America
---------------
This week, trends of acute respiratory disease remained unchanged or were
decreasing. Intensity of acute respiratory disease remained low/moderate
and impact of acute respiratory disease on health care services was low.
This week, Nicaragua reported 8 cases of co-infection with influenza and
dengue diagnosed by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.

South America
-------------
Andean:
These countries continued to report widespread influenza activity. The
majority of the countries reported decreasing trends in acute respiratory
disease. Colombia, however, has been reporting increasing trends for 7
consecutive weeks. Overall, intensity of acute respiratory disease remained
low/moderate as did impact of acute respiratory disease on health care
services. Venezuela reported an outbreak of acute respiratory infection in
the indigenous Yanomami community of Mawaka parish in the municipality of
Alto Orinoco in Amazonas State. Thus far, 2 samples were positive for
pandemic (H1N1) 2009.

Southern cone:
Although there were no significant changes in acute respiratory disease
activity as compared to last week, Argentina reported high levels of ILI
activity in the provinces of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe. Brazil continued to
experience a decreasing trend of acute respiratory disease, with
low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory disease, and low impact on
health care services.

Weekly summary
--------------
- the trends of acute respiratory disease in North America continue to
increase; there were 22 influenza-associated pediatric deaths reported in
the United States this week, twice as many as last week
- Caribbean countries reported variable trends in acute respiratory disease
this week
- Central America continues to report overall decreasing trends in acute
respiratory disease
- most of South America had stable or decreasing trends of acute
respiratory disease, with the exception of Colombia, which reported an
increasing trend for the 7th consecutive week
- Barbados and Nicaragua reported the detection of cases of co-infection
with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and dengue
- Venezuela reported an outbreak of acute respiratory infection in the
indigenous Yanomami community
- a median of 100 per cent of subtyped influenza A viruses were pandemic
(H1N1) 2009
- 224 new confirmed deaths in 10 countries were reported; in total there
have been 4399 cumulative confirmed deaths

Descriptions of hospitalizations and deaths among confirmed cases of
pandemic (H1N1) 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A table containing case counts reported to PAHO is included in Annex 2
[available at
<http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=3543&Itemid=>].

About half of confirmed hospitalized cases were among women. Children
continue to be the age group with highest hospitalization rates. Underlying
comorbidities were present in 50-60 per cent of hospitalized cases, while
approximately 25 per cent of confirmed cases in childbearing age women were
pregnant.

With regard to deceased cases, some countries reported observed differences
in sex distribution (Canada, Dominican Republic), but overall, most deaths
were among adults. The percentage of cases with underlying comorbidities
varied among countries, ranging from 41.0 to 76.1 per cent.

Viral circulation
-----------------
For the purpose of this analysis, only countries, which reported data on
influenza A subtypes, were considered. We excluded from the calculations of
the percentages, results from samples of influenza A that were not subtyped
or were unsubtypable.

Among the selected countries, there is a continued predominant circulation
of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.

Viral resistance
----------------
To date, CDC has tested 240 influenza pandemic isolates from 18 countries
of the region, all of which were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. In
the United States, however, a total of 14 isolates have been identified
which are resistant to oseltamivir.

As of 30 Oct 2009, a total of 185 067 confirmed cases have been notified in
all 35 countries in the Americas Region. A total of 4399 deaths have been
reported among the confirmed cases in 26 countries of the Region.

In addition to the figures displayed in Annex 2, the following overseas
territories have confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009:
American territories: American Samoa (8); Guam (1); Puerto Rico (20) and US
Virgin Islands (49).
United Kingdom Overseas Territories: Bermuda (1); Cayman Islands (104, 1
death); British Virgin Islands (12); Turks and Caicos Islands (36).
French Overseas Communities: Martinique (44, 1 death); Guadeloupe (27);
Guyane (29, 1 death); Saint Martin (30); Saint Bartholomew (2)
Netherlands Antilles: Aruba (13); Bonaire (31); Curacao (53)*; St Eustatius
(1); and St Maarten (24).
(* 3 cases were reported on a cruise-ship.)

The distribution of cases and deaths at the 1st sub-national level can be
found in the interactive map available through the following link
