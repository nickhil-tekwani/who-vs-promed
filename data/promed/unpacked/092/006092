Foot-And-Mouth Haunts Caprivi
-----------------------------
Farmers in the Caprivi region are in a desperate situation as the
threat of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] sweeps through many parts of the region.

The Directorate of Veterinary Services in the Caprivi region on Wed
[5 Dec 2007] announced the discovery of new cases of the disease at
Malindi, some 40 km [24.8 miles] east of Katima Mulilo. [See map at

The State Veterinarian of the Directorate of Veterinary Services at
Katima Mulilo, Frank Chitate, confirmed yesterday [6 Dec 2007] that a
few cattle in the area displayed symptoms of the disease. Samples
taken from the cattle have been sent to Botswana for scientific
verification. Other cases were diagnosed earlier in eastern Caprivi
at Nankuntwe and Muzii areas, before the discovery of the latest
cases at Malindi.

According to Chitate, out of a cattle population of close to 45 000
in the affected areas, a total of 32 000 head of cattle have been
vaccinated so far. The vaccination campaign is expected to run until
13 Dec 2007. Chitate said that laboratory reports on the 1st samples
sent to the Botswana Vaccine Institute for evaluation confirmed the
diagnosis that Caprivi is affected by the SAT 2, (Southern African
Territory number 2) type of FMD. Other types of foot-and-mouth
disease associated with Southern Africa are SAT 1 and SAT 3. So far
the vaccination campaign has used a Trivalent Vaccine that caters for
all 3 types.

Chitate warned farmers to stop the movement of all cattle to other
areas in the region. He was however generally happy with the level
of cooperation received from community members since the start of
the vaccination campaign.

"We hear that some farmers are busy transporting cattle from the
eastern plains areas of the region to higher ground. We are busy
investigating these few cases, and if anyone is caught, we will
recommend immediate prosecution," Chitate warned.

He confirmed that FMD is a highly contagious livestock disease,
meaning unrestricted cattle movement would serve as a catalyst to
spread the disease. Investigations are underway to establish the
origins of the current outbreak of the disease.

So far, Chitate said, no signs of the disease have been found in
areas such as Kasika -- known as a prominent grazing zone for
Buffaloes commuting between the area and the Chobe National Park in
Botswana. He suspects that since the disease was diagnosed in areas
along the Zambezi River, it could have spread from Zambia through
cattle smuggling. Previous outbreaks of the disease have been
reported in the Zambian areas of Sesheke, Mwandi and Kasaya along the
Zambezi River.

Meanwhile, Government officials have put in place border patrols and
roadblocks to try and curb the movement of meat and cattle. Police at
Katima Mulilo apprehended a cattle herder who apparently mistakenly
drove 19 cattle from Zambia into Namibia for grazing next to the
Wenela border post over the weekend. The cattle were returned to the
owner after Veterinary Service at Katima Mulilo pronounced them free
of the disease.

All cloven-hoofed animals and animal fodder such as grass; hay,
straw, reeds, Lucerne, and also manure and firewood are prohibited
from passing through roadblocks until the region is declared free of
the disease. Meatco has also stopped all slaughtering, since
according to import regulations, an infected area should be closed
for at least 6 months from the date it is declared free from diseases.

[This outbreak is regarded as "suspected" until laboratory
confirmation, preferably with the identity of the serotype involved,
becomes available.

The last outbreak of FMD in Namibia was recorded in August 2000, when
bovines were found infected by serotype SAT 1 in the same area of the
current case, namely the Caprivi (Katima Mulilo). Effective
preventive measures, including a border fencing system, have been
helpful in maintaining the country's freedom from FMD since 2000 in
spite of the presence of the disease in Zambia, and its penetration
into Botswana in 2006; map at
