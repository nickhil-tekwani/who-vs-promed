Federal officials have identified at least one brand of cheese of interest in their investigation of an outbreak of _Listeria_ infections. The FDA is warning that consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve El Abuelito brand queso fresco cheese.

The Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has been working on the outbreak investigation with agencies in several states. This evening [Wed 17 Feb 2021], the FDA announced that the Connecticut Department of Public Health collected product samples of El Abuelito-brand Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses from a store where an outbreak patient bought cheeses.

"Sample analysis showed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in samples of El Abuelito Queso Fresco sold in 10-ounce packages, marked as Lot A027 with an expiration date of 26 Feb 2021," according to the FDA's outbreak update. "Samples are currently undergoing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to determine if the _Listeria monocytogenes_ found in these samples is a match to the outbreak strain. At this time, there is not enough evidence to determine if this outbreak is linked to El Abuelito Queso Fresco.

"FDA and state partners are working with the firm to recall the affected lot and to determine if additional products should be recalled. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available."

Although the FDA is stopping short of saying there is a concrete link to the El Abuelito cheese, it is warning consumers to not eat it. The agency also warns that other soft, Hispanic-style cheese may be implicated in the multi-state outbreak.

"Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve El Abuelito Queso Fresco cheese until more information is known," FDA warns. "If you are at higher risk for severe _Listeria_ illness -- if you are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system due to certain medical conditions or treatments -- do not eat any Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses, including El Abuelito-brand queso fresco cheese, until we identify which cheeses are making people sick in this outbreak."

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported in Connecticut, Maryland, New York, and Virginia.

All 7 patients have required hospitalization. Six of the 7 ill people are Hispanic. Of the 4 people interviewed, 3 reported eating at least one type of Hispanic-style fresh and soft cheeses, and each of the 3 reported eating queso fresco.

[A particular brand of queso fresco cheese is suspected as a source for the multistate outbreak of listeriosis involving 4 cases in Maryland, and one case each in New York, Connecticut, and Virginia (ProMED post Listeriosis - USA: queso fresco cheese, archive number 20210214.8190625). Linkage of this cheese to the outbreak awaits whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis to determine if the _Listeria monocytogenes_ found in the cheese samples matches the WGS of the outbreak strain isolated from the patients.

Queso fresco ("fresh cheese"), Hispanic-style soft, unaged white cheese, is made by curdling milk; it can be made with either pasteurized or unpasteurized (raw) milk. It is considered safe when made with pasteurized milk, but multiple types of soft cheeses have been implicated in listeriosis outbreaks, with most outbreaks linked to Latin-style soft cheese (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004860/).

Cheeses made from unpasteurized milk can be sold within US states that permit sale of raw dairy products. However, the US FDA prohibits interstate commerce of fresh, unaged (uncured) cheeses made from unpasteurized milk. FDA regulations do permit interstate distribution of raw milk cheeses, if aged (cured) for more than 60 days at a temperature of not less than 35 deg F [1.7 deg C], because aging/ripening of cheese for at least 60 days is thought to reduce bacterial contamination (http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/02/publishers-platform-60-day-rule-the-facts/#.WMWFxLGZPjA). However, aging raw milk cheese for 60 days may not totally ensure safety when _L. monocytogenes_ is introduced as a post-processing contaminant (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18724749).

In the US, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases of listeriosis based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole-genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html).

When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the _Listeria_ case report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_, in addition to soft cheeses, include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food-monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as the common source. - Mod.ML
