According to Josef Radosta, president of the hunters association in Bukova Veseli, upper Moravia, a rabbit disease has been identified in hunted hares which were seen to be malnourished. Mortality has been observed as well. The sick animals "lose shyness". The infection is transmitted between animals mainly by ticks and mosquitoes.

The disease can also infect humans, who become infected when butchering the infected animal or by inhaling dust particles. "Tularemia is an acute or chronic bacterial diseases of rabbits and rodents, but also other animals. In the acute form of the disease animals are torpid and have chronic elevated temperatures. The chronic form of tularemia is characterized by emaciation and swollen lymph nodes. And again, the loss of alertness and agility," explained veterinarian Martina Sukupova.

Chairman of the district of hunting club in Hodonin Radovan Mancik said that tularemia was not widespread across the board. "There is incidence of the disease in Veselsky but I have no knowledge about that in the Hodonin district. Investigation of this disease is no longer obligatory for several years," said the chairman of the association.

[According to the 2014 annual report of the Czech Republic to the OIE regarding zoonotic diseases, 49 human cases of tularemia were recorded during 2014; no mortalities.

The bacterium _Francisella tularensis_ causes the vectorborne zoonotic disease tularemia, and may infect a wide range of hosts including invertebrates, mammals and birds. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, or through arthropod vectors. Tularemia has a broad geographical distribution, and there is evidence suggesting that local emergence or re-emergence of this disease in Europe. This review was developed to provide an update on the geographical distribution of _F. tularensis_ in humans, wildlife, domestic animals and vector species, to identify potential public health hazards, and to characterize the epidemiology of tularemia in Europe. According to a recent review article on Tularemia in Europe (see ref), 18 343 human cases of tularemia were reported to the WHO-CISID or ECDC databases between 1992 and 2012. Sweden reported 25 per cent of all reported cases, Finland 22 per cent, Turkey 13 per cent and the Czech Republic and Hungary around 9 per cent each.
