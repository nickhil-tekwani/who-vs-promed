Avocado root-rot in the Colombian Caribbean
-------------------------------------------
In the Colombian avocado production area of Montes de Maria [shared between departments Bolivar and Sucre], the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) started a phytosanitary operation to put the spread of avocado root-rot under control -- an illness caused by the pseudo fungus _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ which has caused severe damages to growers in this region.

L. Alfredo Velasquez, ICA, informed that workshops have been organised in 20 demonstration plots distributed around the area, which will provide growers with information on protocols and fumigation procedures.

"Avocado root-rot has caused drastic drops in production volumes and growers have seen their quality of life affected by it," explained L. Humberto Lacouture, ICA. This is why ICA will inspect the advances made towards the control of this disease which has destroyed approximately 50 per cent of the region's avocado trees.

[The fungus-like organism _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ (Pc) has a wide host range, but different host genera may show different levels of sensitivity. While symptoms vary between hosts, on trees and shrubs (including crops like avocado, macadamia, olive and some pine species) it mainly causes root rots and stem cankers which destroy the host's access to water and nutrients. Symptoms usually include yellowing of foliage followed by dieback, and sudden death of the host may occur when additional water stress is imposed by a dry season.

The pathogen is soil borne. It is spread with soil and plant material, by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species, for example for avocado root rot and jarrah dieback in Australia.

The genus includes some of the most destructive crop pathogens (for example, _P. infestans_, causing potato late blight). _P. kernoviae_ and _P. ramorum_ are considered serious pathogens of native trees and shrubs in Europe and North America. _P. cinnamomi_ has caused immeasurable damage to eucalypts and other native vegetation after its introduction to Australia. Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases of trees in Australia and North America have been largely unsuccessful.
