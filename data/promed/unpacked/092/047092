The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission has observed an unusually high number of cases of hemorrhagic disease in white-tailed deer in Wilkes and Surry counties this summer and is asking the public to report sightings of sick or diseased animals.

It is unusual to have reports of deer dying from hemorrhagic disease in June and July, the commission said. Most hemorrhagic disease cases occur during August and September.

Closely related viruses -- epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) virus and bluetongue virus -- cause 2 different hemorrhagic diseases, and both are spread by biting flies, called midges.

The commission is asking people to report any sightings of the disease, which has no human health implications but is one of the most significant infectious diseases of white-tailed deer in North Carolina.

Hemorrhagic disease should not be confused with Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), which is a distinctly different disease that occurs in members of the deer family. Extensive monitoring since 1999 has detected no evidence of CWD in North Carolina and strict regulations are in place to reduce the probability of introducing this disease.

Clinical signs of hemorrhagic disease in deer vary widely. Some diseased animals exhibit no signs. Some may appear bloated, very thin and weak. Others suffering from the disease for longer duration may lose weight drastically.

They also may have foot, mouth and internal lesions. High fever associated with the disease can make deer thirsty, so dead and dying deer are often found near water. Hunters may observe cracked or sloughing hooves on harvested deer, which is another classic sign of the disease.

Outbreaks of this deer disease are seen almost every year somewhere within the state and across the Southeast. The last major outbreak in North Carolina was in 2007. In years with severe hemorrhagic disease outbreaks, deer mortality reached 30 percent of the local herd in some areas. However, in most instances mortality is much lower.

Because the disease cannot spread to humans, hunters should not worry about dressing deer or eating venison. Deer that recover from an episode of hemorrhagic disease develop immunity to future outbreaks.

To report sightings of symptomatic deer, or dead and dying deer, contact the Division of Wildlife Management at <wrccomments@ncwildlife.org>.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the Southeast of USA, but they are also frequently documented further North. The disease is transmitted by biting midges and its occurrence is seasonal, from late summer to early fall. The die-offs cease with the 1st frosts. The EHD virus does not pose a risk for human or livestock health.

High density deer herds may have higher mortality rates; however, the relationship of deer density to the severity of hemorrhagic disease is not clear-cut, as the virus is not spread by direct contact and depends on the dynamics of the arthropod vector. For more information on the disease see comments on ProMED-mail post 20110918.2842.
