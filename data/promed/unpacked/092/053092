[The following is posted in response to the moderator's comments in
the previous post in this series, regarding strychnine not being a
bait for just rabid dogs. - Mod.TG]

These baits are intended to depopulate stray (not only rabid) dogs and
cats, and usually all dog and cat owners have been warned before the
district livestock services people install the baits.

They usually use strychnine to poison stray cats and dogs, but I've
heard an officer who complained about the "low quality" strychnine
they have in stock.

[It is nice to know that the neighborhoods have been warned so there
can be an effort to keep pets from eating the baits. While it is
understandable that stray populations need to be controlled,
strychnine is nevertheless not a recommended method of euthanasia.

Also, I am unclear what "low quality" strychnine means? Has the
product been 'cut' with some other agent? - Mod.TG]
