Brazil confirmed 353 cases of yellow fever with 98 deaths in the period 1 Jul 2017-6 Feb 2018. During the same period last year [2017] there were 509 confirmed cases and 159 deaths.

The Ministry of Health updated on [Wed 7 Feb 2018] the information provided by the state health departments on the situation of yellow fever in the country. During the monitoring period (from 1 Jul 2017 to 6 Feb 2018), 353 cases of yellow fever were confirmed in the country, of whom 98 died. In all, 1286 cases of suspected yellow fever were reported, of which 510 were discarded and 423 remained under investigation in this period.

Last year, from July 2016 to 6 Feb 2017, there were 509 cases of confirmed yellow fever and 159 confirmed deaths. Since last year [2017], reports of yellow fever have followed a seasonal pattern of the disease, which happens mostly in the summer. Thus, the period for the analysis is from 1 Jul to 30 Jun of each year.

Transmission
------------
The Ministry of Health reports that there is no confirmed record of urban yellow fever in the country. The case of yellow fever in São Bernardo do Campo (SP) is being investigated by a team from the State Secretariat of Health of São Paulo (SES/SP), which includes patient history and mosquito capture to identify the form of transmission in the region. It should be noted that the patient lives in the urban area and possibly works in the rural area. Any statement before the completion of the work is premature. It is important to indicate that São Bernardo do Campo (SP) is one of the 77 cities of the 3 states of the country (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Bahia) included in the yellow fever vaccine fractionation campaign.

The Ministry of Health clarifies that all cases of yellow fever recorded in Brazil since 1942 are of forest [sylvan] origin, including current ones, that is, the disease was transmitted by vectors that exist in forest environments (mosquitoes of the genus _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_). In addition, what characterizes the forest transmission, in addition to the species of the mosquito involved, is that the mosquitoes transmit the virus and also become infected from a wild host, in this case monkeys.

The probability of urban transmission in Brazil is very low for a number of factors: all investigations of yellow fever cases conducted to date indicate exposure to forest areas; in all places where human cases occurred, there have also been cases in monkeys; all entomological surveillance actions, with urban and wild vector catches, did not find presence of the virus in mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_; there is already a nationally established _Aedes aegypti_ control program for other arboviruses (dengue, Zika, chikungunya) that is able to maintain infestation levels below what studies consider necessary to sustain an urban transmission of yellow fever. In addition, there is good vaccine coverage in the areas of vaccine recommendation and a very sensitive surveillance to detect early circulation of the virus in new areas to implement vaccination in a timely manner.

Campaign
--------
The yellow fever vaccine fractionation campaign began on [25 Jan 2018] in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The vaccination campaign in the state of Bahia begins on [19 Feb 2018].

To assist states and municipalities in carrying out the campaign, the Ministry of Health will send states B Real 54 million [USD 16.5 million]. Of this total, B Real 15.8 million [USD 4.8 million] have already been transferred to São Paulo; B Real 30 million [USD 9.2 million] to Rio de Janeiro, and the ordinance will authorize the transfer of B Real 8.2 million [USD 2.5 million] to Bahia.

The adoption of vaccine fractionation is a preventive measure recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) when there is an increase in epizootic and cases of sylvan yellow fever occurring intensively, with risk of disease spread in cities with a high population index. The fractionated dose has shown the same protection as the standard dose. Ongoing studies have already shown protection for at least 8 years and further research will continue to assess protection after this period.

In 2017 to date, the Ministry of Health sent to the Federation Units the approximately 58.9 million doses of the vaccine. A total of 49.8 million doses were sent to the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and Bahia in order to intensify vaccination strategies, with 19.7 million (SP), 10.7 million (MG), 12 million (RJ), 3.7 million (ES), and 3.7 million (BA).

[The report contains a table of cases reported, discarded, under investigation, confirmed, and deaths for the period 1 Jul 2017 to 6 Feb 2018. The confirmed cases are all in the Federal District and the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais. There are reported scattered cases in 23 other states. This is not surprising since this area is endemic for YF virus and a few cases occur sporadically. - Mod.TY

Concern about yellow fever has increased again in Rio Novo do Sul, in the south of Espírito Santo [state], after 8 monkeys were found dead [which species? - Mod.RNA] in the terrain of a house. A sample of one animal was tested and was positive for the disease.

"It is important, not only for the people in Rio Novo but for all the other people in neighboring municipalities, to be on alert because the people are being advised. Should the virus begin to circulate here, it could be the beginning of circulation in other municipalities as well," said the Secretary of Health, Juliana Roveta.

The "D Day" of the vaccination campaign took place this [Sat 3 Feb 2018] and there were even cars on the street alerting the residents. During the morning, more than 100 people were vaccinated. However, 25 percent of the local population still has not been vaccinated, which corresponds to nearly 3000 people.

"We went over the city with a fine-toothed comb and we detected the places where there are people who were not vaccinated. What are we doing? Going to the people's house to vaccinate the defaulters," said the Secretary of Health.

In 2018 there is still no yellow fever registered in humans in the state. To continue thus, it is important that everyone be vaccinated.

"Until then, I was only aware of what was happening on the São Paulo side. It got closer to us so we now run behind it to make sure it does not hurt us, because it's a [bad] business that can kill," said salesman [PD].

[The continuation of circulation of yellow fever virus in the sylvan (forest) transmission in these areas brings with it the risk of spill-over into the human population and urban transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vectors that are present in these localities. The vaccination campaign is urgent and necessary to prevent that from happening. - Mod.RNA]

Brazil's Health Ministry has confirmed more than 350 cases of yellow fever as infections pick up steam in the state at the center of the last outbreak.

The current outbreak is developing more slowly than the previous one. The ministry said [Wed 7 Feb 2018] that 353 people have been infected so far, of which 98 have died. During the same period in the 2016-2017 outbreak, 509 cases were recorded, including 159 deaths.

Over the past week, the number of cases confirmed in Minas Gerais state more than doubled from 77 to 157. São Paulo state has recorded the most cases, with 161.

Large swaths of Brazil have long been at risk for yellow fever, but it saw an unusually large outbreak last year [2017], including in places not previously considered at risk.

The ABC region [industrial region in Greater São Paulo] has confirmed on this [Mon 5 Feb 2018] its 1st locally acquired case of yellow fever, that is to say a patient infected locally and not while traveling. The individual is a 35-year-old man who lives in São Bernardo do Campo, in the Jardim Palermo neighborhood, a region in the south of the city, and works in Jardim Represa at the intersection of Rodoanel and Rodovia dos Imigrantes. This region is outside of the area [considered] of risk for the disease.

The case was confirmed to UOL by the Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo [University of São Paulo Faculty of Medicine Clinics Hospital], where the man is hospitalized in the intensive care unit, as stated by the Secretariat of Health of the City government of São Bernardo do Campo. According to this municipal agency, there are 2 other positive cases of the infection in residents of the city that are still under investigation.

The infected man from ABC was admitted to the UPA [local health center] of the Baeta Neves neighborhood last [Thu 1 Feb 2018], and was later transferred to the Hospital das Clínicas, where he is still hospitalized in the intensive care unit. According to the city government, he had not been vaccinated.

Still, according to the municipal government, this is the 2nd confirmed yellow fever case in the city. In the 1st, the villager had traveled to Mairiporã, a city of Greater São Paulo that is considered one of the risk areas.

The municipality of São Bernardo reports a "low adherence" in the vaccination campaign against yellow fever that takes place in the 34 basic health units of the municipality. For now, only 24 percent of the stipulated target [population] has been reached.

[The ABC region is comprised of 3 cities south of São Paulo city, but within the greater São Paulo area. The 3 cities are Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo, and São Caetano do Sul. Later, the region became known as the ABCD, with the addition of the city of Diadema. Today the region is formally, and less memorably, known as the ABCDMRR, with the addition of Mauá, Ribeirão Pires, and Rio Grande da Serra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Region).

It is not clear if this 2nd case is the result of spill-over of the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle of or urban _Aedes aegypti_ transmission, which would be a serious event. The previous cases that occurred in Mairiporã were reported to have been sylvan spillover events. - Mod.TY]

A 38-year-old man died of yellow fever in Angra dos Reis, on the Costa Verde of the state [Rio de Janeiro] on the morning of [Sat 3 Feb 2018]. This information was issued by the Municipal Secretariat of Health of the city.

The man lived in Praia do Provetá, on Ilha Grande, and was hospitalized [when? - Mod.RNA] in the Japuiba General Hospital in Angra. According to this office, the victim was recently in the Praia da Longa, and also on Ilha Grande, where the death of a monkey [which species? - Mod.RNA] was confirmed as yellow fever (when? - Mod.RNA]. It is suspected that this is where the man contracted the disease [were other places visited discarded such as other localities not on the island? - Mod.RNA]

This is the 1st confirmed yellow fever case [laboratory diagnosis when? - Mod.RNA] in humans in Angra dos Reis, which is located in Sul Fluminense [region of Rio de Janeiro], where 10 deaths have been caused by the disease. There have been 5 victims in Valença, 2 in Rio das Pedras, 1 in Miguel Pereira, and 1 in Paraíba do Sul. In the entire state yellow fever has killed 18 people this year [2018].

The man's death comes at the height of the summer vacation season when the Ilha Grande is much sought after by tourists. The city of Angra expressly recommends to all who have not yet been vaccinated against yellow fever that they do not visit Ilha Grande and its forests and waterfalls. And reports indicate that the Health Surveillance of the municipality has been on alert, working together with the state government, sending the monkeys found dead in for testing. "From 2017 until January 2018, all the monkeys tested were negative for yellow fever, but on the afternoon of [2 Feb 2018], Noel Nutels Central Laboratory (Lacen-RJ) confirmed the death of a monkey due to yellow fever in Ilha Grande [when? - Mod.RNA], a situation that proves the circulation of the virus in our municipality," the Secretariat said in a statement.

[On 2 Feb 2018], the city government added that the same laboratory stated that the patient who lived on Ilha Grande and who died in the Japuiba hospital, had a confirmed diagnosis of yellow fever [confirmed by which tests? - Mod.RNA]

[Also on 2 Feb 2018], the State Secretary of Health, Luiz Antônio Teixeira Júnior, visited the Ilha Grande to accompany the campaign to vaccinate the population and discuss with local authorities ways to combat the mosquito [to combat which mosquito in the wild? - Mod.RNA] and prevent the spread of disease. He already had a scheduled a visit to Cantagalo, where a death was also recorded, and included Angra dos Reis in the script when he learned of the new death of the man. [By 2 Feb 2018], the Secretariat had confirmed 17 yellow fever deaths statewide. In addition to the cases in the south of the state, there were also recorded cases in Teresópolis (3 deaths), Nova Friburgo (2), Sumidouro (1), and Carmo (1). It was also reported that the number of people infected by the disease increased from 27 to 41.

Up to now, the city with the most cases of the disease is Valença, with 14 confirmed cases. In Além, in addition, 4 new cases were diagnosed in monkeys in the state. The animals were in the cities of Barra Mansa, Valença, and Miguel Pereira, in addition to Angra dos Reis.

[The cases, both in humans and non-human primates in question that are reported as confirmed as yellow fever merit a minute and very careful epidemiological and laboratory investigation.

This is yellow fever occurring in the Brazilian coast, in an area with a great circulation of people. Moreover, the probable place of infection of this case is an island. If, in fact, there is the circulation of virus on Ilha Grande, how would have the introduction occurred? Translocation of infected mosquitoes, primates and/or humans? Transmission by _Haemagogus_, _Sabethes_, or other species of mosquito? This is at least intriguing.

Clinical information is absent; the epidemiological facts are scarce. There is no mention of which species of non-human primates were infected. So, even more important is the laboratory; what techniques and laboratory criteria of investigation and confirmation, respectively, were used.

Additional information is always welcome, and necessary.

Concerning Ilha Grande (Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro):
Ilha Grande is the largest island in the state of Rio de Janeiro and the 5th largest ocean island in Brazil. It has an area of 193 sq km [(75 sq mi), with rugged and mountainous relief, whose highest elevations are Pico da Pedra D'Água (1031 m/3383 f) and Pico do Papagaio (982 m/3222 f), the latter being the most famous due to its picturesque formation. The coasts of the island are cut by numerous peninsulas and coves, forming several beaches. The vegetation is lush, formed by Atlantic forest, mangrove, and restinga (a spit and a distinct type of coastal tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest). The population of the island was approximately 5000 inhabitants in 2014.

There are 4 environmental conservation units on the Island: Ilha Grande State Park, Aventureiro Sustainable Development Reserve, Praia do Sul State Biological Reserve (access is only allowed to researchers and people authorized by the State Environmental Institute (Inea), and the Tamoios Environmental Protection Area (APA), all of which aim to guarantee the protection of the flora and fauna of the great reserve of Atlantic forest existing on the island and of marine life in its surroundings (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilha_Grande_(Angra_dos_Reis). - Mod.RNA

The surprising thing about this yellow fever (YF) outbreak is its relatively wide distribution in eastern Brazil, with all cases reportedly due to sylvan-spillover to people and substantial, widespread epizootics in non-human primates. Fortunately, so far no instance of urban _Aedes aegypti_ YF virus transmission have been reported. Given the incomplete YF vaccine coverage of this population, urban transmission could be rapid and extremely difficult to control should that occur. The proactive vaccination campaigns in the areas of risk are important. - Mod.TY]
