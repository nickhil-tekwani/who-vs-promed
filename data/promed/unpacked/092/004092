According to Frank Moore, Linn County public health director. 4 cases of acute Q fever have been identified in Linn and Benton counties since May [2014]. In Linn County, the infection appears to be in the Harrisburg area. In each county, one case is confirmed and the other is presumptive, Moore said. "They are 45 miles [72.4 km] apart, so they aren't related," Moore said. "We have to emphasize that the general public is not at risk, but people should be diligent about washing their hands, just like we advise during flu season."

Moore said that usually there are only 3 to 5 cases statewide in a year. "Therefore, these cases represent an unusually high number in a short period of time for this geographic area," he said. "We are requesting the public's help identifying and reporting additional cases." Moore said Q fever is found in cattle, sheep, and goats and it is spread through milk, urine, and feces. The number of organisms is unusually high during birthing in the amniotic fluids and placentas of animals, especially sheep. Especially at risk are farmers, ranchers, livestock shearers, stockyard workers, animal transporters, and laboratory workers as well as veterinary staffers.

Infection of humans usually occurs due to inhalation of organisms attached to barnyard dust or dried fluids. The incubation period is from 14 to 22 days. Symptoms include: high fever; severe headache; general malaise, myalgia, chills or sweats, non-productive cough; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; abdominal pain, chest pain. According to the Centers for Disease Control, if untreated, the fever can last from 9 to 14 days and from 30 to 50 per cent of patients develop pneumonia. Although most people recover from acute Q fever, there have been instances in which the condition has led to inflammation of the heart tissue or hepatitis. It can cause pre-term delivery or miscarriages in pregnant women.

Health officials encourage anyone who works with livestock to appropriately dispose of animal placentas, birth products, fetal membranes, especially of sheep and goats. They should restrict access to barns and laboratories used in housing potentially infected animals. The public should use only pasteurized milk and milk products. Take extra caution when washing laboratory clothing. Quarantine imported animals. Ensure that holding facilities for sheep be located away from populated areas.

Moore said that in Oregon, Q fever is a condition that should be reported to local health departments. Call Linn County Public Health at 541-967-3888 ext 2488 or Benton County Public Health at 541-766-6654 or 541-766-6255.

[We are told in the news report above that one confirmed and one presumptive case of acute Q fever have been identified in Linn County and one confirmed and one presumptive case in nearby Benton County since May 2014, but we are not told the patents' occupations, travel histories, if they have consumed raw milk or dairy products, have tick exposures, or other factors that would put them at risk of acquiring Q fever.

_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying and heat, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness with hepatitis or pneumonia usually develop within 2-3 weeks after exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever recover, others may experience serious chronic illness within a few months or several years after acute infection, with complications that include endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), infected aneurysms or vascular prostheses, and chronic hepatitis.

Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases can also occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Q fever has rarely followed blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, and suspected sexual transmission via infected sperm (http://www.gezondheidsraad.nl/sites/default/files/201115EQfever.pdf).

Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km [3 mi] high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2).

The acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response. During an acute infection, an antibody response to _C. burnetii_ phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than the response to the phase I antigen, whereas chronic infection is associated with a rising phase I immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer.

CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has recently issued recommendations for the recognition, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and management of Q fever (CDC. Diagnosis and Management of Q Fever -- United States, 2013: Recommendations from CDC and the Q Fever Working Group. Morb Mortal Wkly Rep (MMWR). Recommendations and Reports. 29 Mar 2013/62(RR03); 1-23. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm).

The state of Oregon can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2636921,239. Linn and Benton Counties are adjacent counties located in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific north western US state of Oregon. Principal industries include lumber and wood products and agriculture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Oregon). - Mod.ML]
