Ministry of Health in the River Nile State, declared a state of maximum alert after the Federal Ministry of Health announced the presence of Rift Valley fever [RVF] in the region.

The state of alert was aimed to controlling Rift Valley fever (RVF), following its emergence in some localities in Berber, north of Bawqa, Ftouar, Joule, and Sulaimaniya, and in the Artoli region of the East Bank.

A delegation from the Federal Ministry of Health arrived in the Nile yesterday [12 Oct 2019], headed by Director of Emergency Management Dr Babiker Al-Maqbool to find out the situation and provide technical assistance to contain the disease under the guidance of the Federal Minister of Health Dr Akram Ali Al-Tom.

The Minister of Health in charge of the state, Dr Abdel Moneim Bellah, held an enlightened enlargement meeting in Atbara in the presence of a large number of medical cadres.

The disease is transmitted from animals to humans through mosquitoes and infects people in contact with animals, as well as eating uneven [sic] meat and milk.

The Federal Minister of Health said on [Sat 12 Oct 2019] that: "unknown fevers that have spread to the north of Berber in the northern Nile state are the Rift Valley fever."

About a month ago in the state of the River Nile, unknown fevers have spread to the population and caused death and miscarriage of livestock.

[An earlier [12 Oct 2019] report in the same newspaper, informed the following:
"Hatem Fadl, an official in the epidemiology and emergency department at the Federal Ministry of Health, said that 4 cases of Rift Valley fever were diagnosed among 17 samples taken last week, [which] were sent to the Central Laboratory in Khartoum. Hatem pointed out that the Federal Minister of Health commissioned a team to investigate the injuries, [which] arrived in the villages of Artoli, Al-Bawqa, and Fatwwar [Fri 11 Oct 2019], before the disease was officially announced today [12 Oct 2019]. He pointed out that RVF is common between humans and animals, so the Ministry of Health pledged to provide basic aid in cooperation with local authorities and resistance committees in these villages to combat the disease.

Similar fevers have recently spread in the Red Sea state in the Arbaat region, and was visited by Federal Health Minister Akram al-Tom."

The report above seems to present (national) laboratory confirmation of RVF currently affecting humans in Sudan's River Nile's state.

An earlier suspected RVF outbreak in Sudan's adjacent Red Sea State (see archive 20180410.5735975), has been confirmed; it was officially reported to the OIE on 13 Oct 2019 in an immediate notification (https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32098). The report addresses an outbreak in a village in the [Arbaat] dam area, Alghunub Wa Alolaib, Red Sea State, affecting 950 susceptible goats, among which 21 "cases", 4 deaths, no culling or slaughter applied. The given date of start of the outbreak is 25 Sep 2019. The report includes the following epidemiological comments:
"There were few abortions in goat herds observed after heavy flooding in September 2019. There are no cattle or sheep populations in the area.
It is a dry area within the series of the Red Sea Hills. Surveillance, biosecurity measures, and increased awareness is ongoing."

Official confirmation of the outbreaks in the Red Sea State is anticipated.

The 1st outbreak of RVF in Sudan was reported in 1973 among sheep and cattle in the White Nile State. In 1977, camels from Sudan were one of the suggested sources of RVF virus introduced, for the 1st time, into Egypt. Throughout the years, this virus was reported several times from humans and animals in Sudan. In 2010, a seroepidemiologic survey revealed a high prevalence of RVFV IgG among febrile patients admitted to New Halfa Hospital in Kassala State (ref. 1).
