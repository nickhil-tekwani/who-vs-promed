Because some infected horses show no clinical signs of disease, but still shed the virus, exposed or potentially exposed animals' temperatures should be monitored twice daily for 14 to 21 days and any abnormalities discussed with a veterinarian.

The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) has been notified of 2 confirmed cases of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), a neurologic disease caused by equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

The horses from Durham Region were referred to the University of Guelph's Ontario Veterinary College with neurologic signs and are receiving treatment. Three other horses on the farm have tested positive for the mutated (neuropathogenic) strain of EHV-1 on nasal swabs but are not demonstrating neurologic signs at this time. The farm owner has voluntarily placed the premises under quarantine to reduce the risk of viral spread.

These are the 1st cases of EHM diagnosed in Ontario this year; however, cases of EHM have been diagnosed in California, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Michigan since the beginning of the year. In 2015, there were 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of EHM in Ontario.

Equine herpesvirus-1 infection can cause respiratory disease, abortion, neonatal foal death, and/or neurologic disease in horses. It is not a federally reportable disease, but is immediately notifiable by laboratories under the reporting regulation of the provincial Animal Health Act. Attending veterinarians suspicious of EHM should contact OMAFRA as soon as possible.

Because some infected horses show no clinical signs of disease, but still shed the virus, exposed or potentially exposed animals' temperatures should be monitored twice daily for 14 to 21 days and any abnormalities discussed with a veterinarian. Neurologic signs, if they develop, can include loss of balance, hind-limb weakness, recumbency (inability to rise), difficulty urinating, decreased tail tone, and depression. It is important that a veterinarian assess suspect cases of EHM since it can be difficult to distinguish this from other serious neurologic diseases, such as rabies.

Equine herpesvirus-1 is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse, by sharing contaminated equipment (such as bits, buckets, towels, etc.) or by the clothing, hands or equipment of people who recently had contact with an infectious horse. This highlights the need for routine biosecurity measures (including hand hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices) to be in place at all times to prevent a disease outbreak. Special attention should be given to cleaning and disinfecting trailers.

Current EHV-1 vaccines can reduce viral shedding but are not licensed to protect against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread. The best method of disease control is disease prevention.

The final horses remaining in the testing protocols for the Equine Herpes Virus (EHV-1) outbreak at Fair Grounds have returned 2 negative tests and have been released back into the general horse population on the backstretch.

Since the 1st case of EHV-1 was reported [Mon 26 Dec 2016] any horse testing positive was promptly isolated under the protocols set forth by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry and then required after 14 days to return 2 negative tests, not less than 72 hours apart, before being permitted back into the general horse population.

"The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF), USDA Veterinary Services and the Louisiana Racing Commission responded to an EHV-1 outbreak at the New Orleans Fair Grounds Race Track on [Mon 26 Dec 2016]," said State Veterinarian Brent Robbins, D.V.M. "On [Tue 14 Feb 2017], the last horse in isolation tested negative and was released after a prescribed observation period. We at the LDAF extend our appreciation to all agencies involved as well as horse owners, trainers and officials at the New Orleans Fair Grounds for their cooperation and understanding in dealing with this outbreak."

As of [Wed 15 Feb 2017] no horses remain in the EHV-1 testing protocols at Fair Grounds and all quarantine restrictions have been lifted by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry.

[Current EHV-1 vaccines can reduce viral shedding but are not licensed to protect against the neurologic form of the disease. It is surely difficult but it seems someone should be working on a vaccine for the neurological form of this disease. Using the current vaccine does not necessarily guarantee your animal may not get the neurological form of the disease. However, strict disinfecting of trailers, water buckets, grooming tools, halters, lead lines, etc may be helpful in preventing this disease. Additionally disinfecting feed pans/bins may be especially important if they are supplied by the facility where the horse is being taken for a race or show, or any type of travel.

We need to celebrate the positive outcomes of any disease. This disease hit the Louisiana race track particularly hard and threatened to wipe out their entire racing season. It's great to hear they have a clean bill of health. - Mod.TG
