-----------------------------------
Information received on 16 Feb 2011 from Mr Leif Denneberg, CVO,
Director and Head of Department, Department for Animal Production and
Health, Swedish Board of Agriculture, Jonkoping, Sweden

Summary
-------
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 20 Dec 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 11 Feb 2011
Report date: 16 Feb 2011
Date submitted to OIE: 16 Feb 2011
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2004
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: _Echinococcus multilocularis_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Lannerod, Lannerod, Uddevalla, Vastra Gotalands lan
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Dec 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals
Species: Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Wild species: - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected Population: The affected animal was a wild fox (_Vulpes
vulpes_) shot during hunting in December 2010.
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species: Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent
case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Wild species: ** / ** / 0.00 percent / **

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection
Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments
This is the 1st occurrence of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ in Sweden.
Previous findings were related to _E. granulosus_. 300 foxes have been
analyzed within a routine surveillance during 2010. 54 of them came
from the County of Vastra Gotaland. Only one fox was found positive. A
plan with a more extensive surveillance will be set up. For human
health reasons treatment with praziquantel or epsiprantel is
recommended for dogs and cats at risk of exposure in the area where
the fox was found. In addition to the test noted below a SCT
(sedimentation and counting technique) test has been performed with
positive result.

Control measures
Measures applied
* Control of wildlife reservoirs
* Screening
* No vaccination
* No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied
* No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Institute (National laboratory)
Tests and results
Species: Test / Test date / Result
Wild species: real-time PCR / 11 Feb 2011 / Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st occurrence of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ in
Sweden; previous findings were related to _E. granulosus_. From a
routine surveillance of 300 foxes in Sweden, one fox out of 54
surveyed from Vastra Gotaland county was found positive with _E.
multilocularis_. Previous reports of _E. multilocularis_ in this
region was from the Svalbard islands of Norway in 2000, but no
incidents had been reported from the mainland of Norway or Sweden.

_Echinococcus multilocularis_ is a tapeworm that causes alveolar
echinococcosis in humans, also known as hydatidosis or hydatid
disease. The adult cestode resides in the small intestine of the
definitive hosts (mainly foxes, and to a lesser extent dogs, cats,
coyotes and wolves). The eggs are then passed into feces and ingested
by small rodents which act as an intermediate host. The eggs will then
hatch and penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the liver. In
humans, the cestode will remain indefinitely in the proliferative
stage, resulting in the invasion of surrounding liver tissues. But in
foxes, dogs and cats, the infection will be asymptomatic.

A diagram of the life cycle of echinococcosis can be found at:
<http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/html/Echinococcosis.htm>

Once infected, humans take 10 to 20 years to develop symptoms, but
there is no effective treatment for the disease other than surgery to
remove the infected area or organ. Infection can be fatal if its
discovery is delayed.

Pet owners can accidentally become infected with _E. multilocularis_
from petting their pets and accidentally transferring eggs from hand
to mouth. The recommended course of action is to regularly give the
antihelminth medication praziquantel or epsiprantel to pet dogs and
cats in areas of risk to exposure. This would seem to be the safest
and most cost effective prevention method for echinococcosis.

The dwarf fox tape worm, _Echinococcus multilocularis_, the
aetiological agent of human alveolar echinococcosis, has been detected
in Sweden for the first time. The parasite was detected in a juvenile
vixen (_Vulpes vulpes_) during routine surveillance initiated in 2000.
During 2010 a total of 300 foxes were shot and investigated for EM,
either by the Sedimentation and counting technique (SCT) or egg
flotation and PCR; 1 fox was positive. The positive fox was shot in
December 2010 in the southwestern part of Sweden (Vastra Gotaland) and
was examined in February 2011. A total of 54 foxes originating from
this area were examined.

Between 2000 and 2009 a total of 2962 foxes and 49 raccoon dogs
(_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) have been examined for EM and all were
negative. Most foxes (n=2675) were examined with Coproantigen ELISA
and SCT and the raccoon dogs and the remaining foxes were examined
with SCT alone.

Intensified surveillance will be initiated to clarify the geographical
distribution of the parasite. - Mod.EP

Referring to the OIE map in the source URL, it can be seen that the
positive fox was found in a part of Sweden close to Denmark, which is
endemic for _E. multilocularis_. The 2 countries have been linked
across the Sound by a bridge-tunnel since 2002. It is probable that
an infected rodent, or even fox, made the crossing as a stowaway on a
cargo truck. - Mod.JW.
