On [Fri 18 Jan 2019], the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of 2 cases of equine herpes viral abortion caused by equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) at a farm in Haldimand County.

The 2 mares aborted during their 9th and 10th month of pregnancy, respectively. One week prior to the abortions, 2 horses on the same farm suddenly developed neurological signs consistent with the neurological form of EHV-1 infection, also known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). These horses were euthanized, and no further diagnostic testing was performed. The farm owner has voluntarily placed the premises under quarantine to reduce the risk of disease transmission.

In Ontario, EHV-1 infection is immediately notifiable by laboratories to OMAFRA under the Animal Health Act. Attending veterinarians concerned about cases of equine herpesvirus-1 infection may contact an OMAFRA veterinarian through the Agricultural Information Contact Centre at 1-877-424-1300.

The official OMAFRA release is available at https://standardbredcanada.ca/files/EHV-Advisory-v1-2019-01-21.pdf.

On [Sat 12 Jan 2019] the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that a horse from Elkhart County, Indiana, tested positive for equine herpsesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

The Indiana State Board of Animal Health reported the affected horse became ill on 5 Jan 2019, was treated on 6 Jan 2019, and was euthanized later that day, the EDCC said.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

We seem to know a lot about this disease and yet have nothing but supportive care to help these animals and no vaccine for prevention. It is really a sad situation that, in this day and age of great science, we are unable to develop a specific antidote or vaccine against this disease. - Mod.TG
