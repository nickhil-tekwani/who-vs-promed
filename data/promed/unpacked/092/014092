[As can be seen on the map at the source URL above, Najran is located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia, near the border with Yemen. It is bordered to the north by Riyadh province, to the west by Asir province and to the east by the Eastern Province (Al Sharqia on the map).

Since the beginning of September 2014, there have been a total of 4 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection: a 60-year-old male healthcare worker in Jubail (8 Sep 2014), a 43-year-old male in Taif, a 38-year-old female in Riyadh (12 Sep 2014), and now this 76-year-old male in Najran (15 Sep 2014). Exposure history is presumed to be nosocomial for the healthcare worker in Jubail but is unclear for the 3 other cases.

The case reported today (15 Sep 2014) did not have a history of exposure to animals, suggesting that the MERS-CoV may well be circulating "under the radarscope" in Saudi Arabia, perhaps in the form of either asymptomatic infections or mild upper respiratory infections not felt to be serious enough on the part of the affected individuals to seek medical attention and have laboratory specimens taken to rule out MERS-CoV infection.

According to the most recent global tally update from the ECDC 21 Aug 2014 risk assessment document, as of 20 Aug 2014, there had been a total of 855 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 333 deaths reported worldwide. Since 20 Aug 2014, there have been an additional 7 laboratory confirmed cases and 2 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia, bringing the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 862 including 335 deaths.
