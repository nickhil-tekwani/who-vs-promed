Since the beginning of the epidemic [of hepatitis A] in the
Nizhniy Novgorod region the total number of people affected
has risen to 1729, a figure which includes 360 children.
20 people, including one child, have been hospitalised in
the past 24 hours, according to the Regional Center for
Civil Defense and Extreme Situations. During the same period
8 people have been discharged from hospitals in the region.
According to the Regnum News Agency by Mon 10 Oct 2005 a
total of 560 people suffering from hepatitis A had been
admitted to hospitals in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod
itself.(<http://www.regnum.ru/news/525610.html>)
A malfunction of equipment controlling the public water
supply is regarded as the most likely cause of the outbreak.

[Since the previous report of 3 Oct 2005 there have been an
additional 291 cases of hepatitis A in the Nizhniy Novgorod
region. This is a reduction on the 404 cases hospitalised in
the preceding period from 29 Sep to 3 Oct, suggesting that
containment measures in the region may now be starting to
take effect. - Mod.CP]
