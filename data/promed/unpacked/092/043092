HK closes park after birds die
-----------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Authorities here closed waterfowl ponds in a park after 4 birds
were found dead yesterday, a day after officials sought to quell fears over
a new outbreak of deadly bird flu.
A spokesman for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said it would
close the ponds in Kowloon Park temporarily as a precaution after 4 ducks
and a swan were found dead during regular inspections.
The dead birds were passed to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department for diagnostic testing. Preliminary indications were that the
birds carried the H5 avian virus.
Secretary for health, welfare and food, Yeoh Eng-kiong, said on Fri, 20 Dec
2002, that there was no cause for alarm after 24 dead chickens were found
at 4 public markets in the territory.
"We expect to see sporadic cases, so this is nothing very surprising
because in winter, this is the season where the risk is the greatest," Yeoh
said.
6 people died when avian flu hit Hong Kong in 1997.
A strain of the same H5 virus was discovered in dead poultry at a market in
Lantau Island on Wednesday.
The chickens' deaths come two weeks after 31 dead waterfowl were found in a
park in the centre of Shatin racecourse.
As a result, all 60 birds in the park were slaughtered and the park was
closed until 9 Jan 2003.
The most recent outbreak of bird flu occurred in Feb 2002. Although it did
not result in any human deaths, 860 000 chickens and other poultry were
culled to stop the disease spreading.
