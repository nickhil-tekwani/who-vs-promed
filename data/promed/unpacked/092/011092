A 12-year-old boy died this morning [Tuesday, June 23, 2015] from rabies in Nasrallah in the province of Kairouan.

The middle-school teen was bitten by a dog 3 months ago. The past few days, the boy suffered from a high fever, unbearable pain and changes in behavior, his mother said to Jawhara FM. Following the tragic death, the staff of the regional hospital of Ibn El Jazzar and the members of the family were vaccinated against rabies as a preventive measure.

It should be noted that lately, the province of Kairouan has had several people infected by rabies.

People fell victim to canine rabies in the 1st quarter of the year 2015 in Kinshasa, where 6 people died because of [bites from] rabid dogs.

The president of the Association of Veterinary Doctors of Congo (AMEVECO), Dr. Amedee Luyuba Awazi, reported on Thu 25 Jun 2015, that 203 cases of bites including 6 cases of deaths due to canine rabies were recorded from January to March 2015 in Kinshasa. The president of AMEVECO, who met with the press, indicated that 17 percent of cases of bites were recorded in urban areas compared to 83 percent in rural areas, explaining that this situation is due to the lack of information and appropriate care.

He explained that rabies was a global and deadly disease that is transmitted from a rabid animal to humans through bites, scratches or an open wound by a sick animal. Dogs, cats, monkeys and other wild animals carry rabies. Dr. Amede Luyuba Awazi pointed out that this disease affects more children under the age of 15 who are often in contact with stray rabid animals, before explaining that the disease is neglected in the country, according to the statistics.

For that reason, with AMEVECO, he launched an awareness campaign in collaboration with the services for human and animal health. In addition he recommended that the population not neglect this disease, because there are effective and safe vaccines after bites occur in order to protect the victim against the virus. He noted that according to WHO, 55 000 cases of deaths from rabies are recorded in the world every year. To counter this alarming situation, WHO recommends vaccination of wild animals, monitoring them and reporting suspicious cases.

A 4-year-old girl who was bitten by a stray dog in the Hassa district of southern province of Hatay died of rabies on Sun 28 Jun 2015.

According to reports, a stray dog bit the girl on her arm 36 days ago in the Kanlioren neighborhood. The parents of the girl did not take their daughter to a doctor, thinking that she was wounded after falling down somewhere. The parents took the girl to a hospital in the following days after seeing foaming in her mouth. The girl was diagnosed with rabies and she was transferred to Hacettepe University Hospital, where she dies on Sunday.

In a separate case, a dog was also recently tested positive for rabies in the Iskenderun district of Hatay. The district was declared as a region at risk for rabies. Warning signs have been posted in the district, and are expected to remain for at least 6 months.

[Tunis:
A new case of rabies due to lack of awareness or to negligence was therefore reported in Tunisia, this time in Kairouan. The short press release gives no information on the likely source of contamination of the adolescent or if measures to fight the canine reservoir of the disease were implemented.

The province of Kairouan is located in the center of Tunisia, 150 kilometers south-west of the capital Tunis. It has 11 delegations, including that of Nasrallah http://www.geomondiale.fr/noms_geographiques/name.php?uni=-1026275&fid=6143&c=tunisia. Several cases of human contamination by the rabies virus were reported in the same province. - Mod.AB

DR Congo:
The disturbing figures of cases of animal bites and clinical human rabies, announced by the president of the Association of veterinary practitioners of Congo (AMEVECO) are probably an underestimation because in this country, as in most 3rd-world countries, many cases of bites, and even of deaths from rabies are not detected and cases are not always reported, especially in rural areas.

This neglected zoonosis is a plague that could however be eradicated by strengthening public awareness of the danger it represents and by controlling stray dogs. Vaccinated dogs should get a tag and animals without a tag should be caught and vaccinated right away.

Turkey:
We have no postings for rabies in Turkey, but OIE reported 1 human case (who died) in 2010; no human cases in 2011; 1 case (died) in 2012; 1 case (died) in 2013; and 4 cases (all died) in 2014. - Mod MHJ]
