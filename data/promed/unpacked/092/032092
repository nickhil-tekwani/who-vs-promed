Posing a serious threat to the endangered species, another goral (_Naemorhedus goral_) died of suspected goat pox at Shyaro, a village in Jang-thingbu Tehsil in Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh, recently.

However, this time the infected Himalayan goral was alive when a team of veterinarians from Tawang led by Dr. Thupten Tashi, Senior Veterinary Officer of Tawang had gone to the remote village of Arunachal Pradesh, close to Indo-China border, after receiving information of a goral showing goat pox-like symptoms. The team of veterinarians administered treatment of goat pox to the sick Himalayan goral, but unfortunately it passed away.

Dr. Tashi while talking to Northeast Now from Tawang said that the symptoms were very similar to goat pox inflicting this endangered species which is designated as 'threatened' under the wildlife schedule.

Earlier in the month of April [2018], the Tawang Forest Division staff had collected 2 carcasses of dead gorals from Mukto, another nearby village in the region, one was a sub-adult female and the other was a half decayed adult male.

When a team of expert veterinarians led by Dr. Jahan Ahmed from the Department of Anatomy and Histology in the College of Veterinary Science of Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Khanapara; Dr. Sorang Tadap; Dr. Thupten Tashi, and the DFO Dr. A Qayum from Mukto arrived at the place, the team found that the only goat remaining in the entire village also had skin infections.

This time also the Himalayan goral had similar clinical signs as the 2 earlier carcasses.

Dr.Tashi said that although efforts were made to save the endangered animal, it had succumbed to the disease suspected to be goat-pox, a marauding virus infection (virus family _Poxviridae_; genus _Capripoxvirus_) that can infect the entire endemic goral population .

Meanwhile, environmentalists fear that gorals -- this rare wildlife species that resembles both the goat and the antelope families -- may become extinct. They are categorized under Near Threatened species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (2008).

The population is declining rapidly. Gorals are found in the Himalayan ranges across Bhutan, Northern India, Nepal and Pakistan. The species lives in the hilly and high ranges near the cliffs in rocky terrain.

[The Himalayan goral (_Naemorhedus goral_) is a mammal in the sub-family Caprinae, family Bovidae. Serows are herbivores, feeding on grasses, shoots and leaves. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List because the population is thought to be declining significantly due to habitat loss and hunting for meat.

Capripox virus causes sheep pox, or lumpy skin disease in cattle, a malignant cutaneous disease. Capripox virus infections in sheep, goats and cattle (all in the Bovidae family) cause major economic losses. - Mod.PMB
