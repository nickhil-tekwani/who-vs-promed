New foci of _Aedes aegypti_ have been found in the townships of Arroyo
Naranjo, Diez de Octubre, San Miguel del Padron, and Old Havana in the Cuban
capital, according to a trustworthy source. Garbage has not been collected
from these areas for more than 6 days because of a lack of fuel for the
trucks.
An employee of the Ministry of Public Health who did not wish to be
identified was quoted as saying there are 784 cases of dengue in the
country, including the hemorrhagic type, but this could not be confirmed
from official sources.

[ProMED has posted similar reports in the past, including official denials
and statements that all cases of dengue in Cuba were imported (see refs.
below). However, it has also been noted that Cuba has been in the habit of
not reporting dengue epidemics to PAHO until the epidemic is over. In light
of the recent report of Cuban medical workers returning sick with dengue
from dengue-epidemic countries after helping with their outbreaks, and the
presence of foci of _Ae. aegypti_ in Havana, it would not be surprising to
see a new outbreak there. Any reliable information about this report would
be welcome. - Mod.JW]
