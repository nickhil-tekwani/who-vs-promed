Bharatpur and Alwar are the 2 districts reporting the highest cases of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in the state. In 2013, Bharatpur reported 2.86 lakh [286 000] cases of FUO, and it continues to report the largest number of cases of the fever in 2014 as well in the state. So far, Bharatpur has reported more than 77 000 cases in 2014, as per the health department's figures.

Sawai Man Singh hospital's additional superintendent Dr Ajit Singh said, "When the origin of fever is not known for at least 2 to 3 weeks, such cases are known as FUO cases. In FUO, the cause of fever is not found even after a basic medical evaluation."

In 2013, more than 30.36 [lakh] [3 036 000] cases of FUO were found in the state. When the cause of the fever is not known, the doctors list the case as FUO. So far, in 2014, Rajasthan has already reported more than 7.99 lakh [799 000] such cases. A health department official said that FUOs could be viral or any other kind of fever whose cause is not known.

The areas which fall in the eastern part of the state, like Bharatpur, Alwar, Dausa, Dholpur, and Karauli, are the group of districts which witnessed the highest number of FUO cases, whereas the tribal belt of the state, including Dungarpur, Udaipur, Banswara, and Jhalawar, were also among districts reporting the highest number of FUO cases.

In Rajasthan, scrub typhus hit Alwar 1st more than 3 years ago. However, the health department officials were confused about the fever, as its cause was not known. Later, the health department officials declared that it was scrub typhus which was victimizing the people, and they provided treatment accordingly. Then scrub typhus spread to other neighboring districts including Bharatpur and Dausa.

In 2013, the Sawai Man Singh hospital witnessed cases of a fever which has dengue-like symptoms, but the test came out negative [for dengue]. The doctors called it "dengue-like fever."

Jaipur reported 1.29 lakh [129 000] cases of FUO in 2013, and so far in 2014, as many as 39 500 cases of FUO have already been reported in the district. The districts which reported the lowest numbers of cases of FUO are Jhunjhunu, Kota, and Sirohi with 1120, 6030 and 5600 cases [respectively] so far in 2014.

[The etiology and, indeed most probably, etiologies of the FUO (fever of unknown origin), or PIE (pyrexia of indeterminate etiology), illnesses is/are likely to be multi-factorial, including viral infections such as dengue and chikungunya, rickettsial diseases such as scrub typhus, as well as lots of other infections and even non-infectious diseases. - Mod.LL
