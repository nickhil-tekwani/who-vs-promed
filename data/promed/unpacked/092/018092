Re: "An experienced medical entomologist informs ProMED-mail that he does
not know of any scientific study that shows effective reduction of disease
risk by taking such precautions" [reference above.
This statement is misleading to travellers and their travel medicine
counsellors. The entomologist is correct, however, in saying that there are
surprisingly few of these type of studies, which are difficult to conduct.
The following are 2 such studies:
(1) Soto J, Medina F, Dember N, Berman J. Efficacy of
permethrin-impregnated uniforms in the prevention of malaria and
leishmaniasis in Colombian soldiers. Clin Infect Dis 1995; 21(3): 599-602.
"In the study of malaria, soldiers were issued impregnated uniforms (that
is, a shirt, an undershirt, pants, socks, and a hat) or uniforms washed in
water; the soldiers wore the uniforms day and night for a mean of 4.2 weeks
and were observed for an additional 4 weeks. Three (3 per cent) of 86
soldiers wearing impregnated uniforms contracted malaria, whereas 12 (14
per cent) of 86 soldiers wearing control uniforms contracted malaria (P =
.015)." This is highly statistically significant.
(2) Schoepke A, Steffen R, Gratz N. Effectiveness of personal protection
measures against mosquito bites for malaria prophylaxis in travelers. J
Travel Med 1998; 5(4): 188-92.
This study covered 100 000 subjects but relied on retrospective
questionnaires in travellers and showed a more modest effect due mostly to
long clothing and time spent in air conditioned quarters. The problem with
studies with DEET not conducted in a military-type setting is that
compliance with personal protection measures is not only generally poor but
difficult to standardize and document. Moreover, there is little argument
that treated mosquito bed nets reduce malaria transmission by reducing
contact between vector and host. The corollary that otherwise reducing
contact by using personal protection measures (DEET and permethrin treated
clothing), which have been proven highly effective in preventing mosquito
bites, seems quite logical.

Schreck CE, Haile DG, Kline DL. The effectiveness of permethrin and deet,
alone or in combination, for protection against Aedes taeniorhynchus. Am J
Trop Med Hyg 1984; 33(4): 725-30.
"The combined use of both protection methods was the most effective
treatment in preventing bites, resulting in an average of 1.5 bites/9 hour
day, compared with 53.5 and 98.5 bites on subjects protected only with
treated clothing or DEET, respectively, and 2287 bites (extrapolated) on
subjects who wore untreated clothing during the same time period."
