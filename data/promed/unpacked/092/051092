2004/076 1st report of Pepino mosaic potexvirus in Bulgaria
-----------------------------------------------------------
Since 2003, protected crops have been surveyed for Pepino mosaic potexvirus
[PepMV] (EPPO Alert List). In 2003, 267 tomato samples were collected and
tested. All results were negative. But beginning in 2004, 88 tomato samples
presenting leaf distortion and mosaic were sent to the Central Laboratory
of Plant Quarantine and tested by DAS-ELISA (double antibody sandwich
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). PepMV was detected in 14 samples. These
infected plants had been grown from seeds (cv. Monroe) imported from the
Netherlands, and further testing on tomato seeds was also positive for
PepMV. The affected glasshouse was declared a quarantine area and the NPPO
took strict eradication measures.
The situation of PepMV in Bulgaria can be described as follows: Present,
found in 1 tomato glasshouse in 2004, under eradication.

[PepMV, a highly infectious virus, is widely dispersed in European tomato
crops. Disease management in tomato depends upon planting of virus-free
tomato transplants and strict adherence to established phytosanitary
practices. The list of countries reporting PepMV infections is increasing,
and I have included only the 1st and most recent reports for your
information. - Mod.DH]
