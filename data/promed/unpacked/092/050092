Every day 1000 people throughout Europe develop tuberculosis, with one expert claiming that multi-drug resistant TB continues to "ravage" the region.

With World TB Day falling next Tuesday -- 24 Mar 2015 -- new data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDPC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for Europe shows that cases fell by 6 percent between 2012 and 2013. About 360 000 Europeans developed TB in 2013 but, even with an annual 6-percent decline, Europe will not be TB-free until the next century.

There has been a sustained decline in cases over the last decade but rates of multi-drug resistant TB remains at very high levels. WHO regional director for Europe, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said only 50 percent of an estimated 75 000 multi-drug resistant TB patients were found in 2013 and just half were successfully cured.

"Multi-drug resistant TB is still ravaging the European region, making it the most affected area of the entire world," he said. ECDC director, Marc Sprenger, said the EU countries were not all progressing in the same way and faced significant challenges in their TB control efforts. "In most low-incident countries, rates are stable or going down only very slowly and the majority of patients are of foreign origin," he said.

There were 328 cases of TB reported in Ireland last year -- 7.1 per 100 000 -- the lowest notification rate recorded since surveillance began in 1998. The number of TB cases reported in Ireland has declined since the 1990s with 604 cases reported in 1992. The decline has been even more considerable since the early 1950s, when 7000 cases of TB were notified annually. Ireland is among the low-incidence countries in the EU and European Economic Area.

However, there is concern that multi-drug resistant TB continues to be most prevalent in the 3 Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

Also, TB is one of the diseases that kills most people with HIV and this deadly combination is increasing in Europe. The prevalence of HIV among TB cases throughout Europe increased from 3.4 percent in 2008 to 7.8 percent in 2013.

Of the 60 296 TB cases notified in 2012 where there was a treatment outcome, 44 318 (73.5 percent) were treated successfully and 4571 died (7.6 percent). Of 1386 multi-drug resistant cases notified in 2011 where there was a treatment outcome, 524 (37.8 percent) were treated successfully and 235 (17 percent) died.

A national TB surveillance report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC] [Ireland] for [2014] found that 40 percent of the 328 cases it was made aware of last year were foreign born. Men accounted for 54 percent of all cases. The HPSC was notified of 2 cases of multi-drug resistant TB and both were foreign-born and had no previous history of TB. There were 11 deaths, with TB reported as the cause in 3 cases.

[The news report above refers to: Tuberculosis surveillance and monitoring in Europe 2015, published jointly by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and ECDC. Below is a summary; the full report is available at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/tuberculosis-surveillance-monitoring-Europe-2015.pdf.

"Executive Summary
--------------------------
This is the 7th report launched jointly by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe following on from reports under the EuroTB project, established in 1996.

The WHO European Region
-----------------------------------
Despite notable progress in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) is still a public health concern in most of the countries within the WHO European Region.

In 2013, an estimated 360 000 incident TB cases (range 340 000-370 000) occurred in the WHO European Region, equivalent to an average of 39 cases (38-41) per 100 000 population. 85 percent of incident TB cases in the Region occur in the 18 high-priority countries. In 2013, the absolute number of incident TB cases fell by 20 000 compared to the previous year, corresponding to 5.6 percent decline. Since 2001, TB incidence has been falling at an average rate of 4.3 percent per year.

In 2013, there were an estimated 460 000 prevalent TB cases (range 350 000-590 000), which is equivalent to 51 (39-65) cases per 100 000 population. Considering the downward trend observed during last decade, it seems feasible that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a 50 percent reduction by 2015 against a baseline of 1990 will not be reached.

There were an estimated 38 000 TB deaths in 2013 among HIV-negative people in the European Region, equivalent to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (range 4.0-4.2). Yet, despite a constant decline in estimated mortality observed over the past 12 years, the MDG target will not be achieved in the Region.

During the period 2004-2013, TB notification rates decreased by almost 20 percent, from 40.3 to 32.8 cases per 100 000 population. This trend reflects a true reduction in the spread of the disease, strongly influenced by the 17.7 percent decrease in notification rates throughout the Region's 18 high-priority countries (from 77.8 to 64.0 per 100 000 population).

In 2013, the 25-44 year age group was predominant (44 percent) among new TB cases registered in the European Region. The percentage of new TB patients under 15 years in the Region is around 4 percent.

In 2013, 17 096 (81.4 percent) TB cases with HIV co-infection were detected from approximately 21 000 cases in the European Region, based on an estimated prevalence of HIV infection among incident TB patients of 5.8 percent. Due to low HIV testing coverage (68 percent) the status was only known for 219 095 TB cases, 17 096 of which were determined to have HIV-co-infection. Moreover, there was a notable decrease in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive TB patients (from 62.3 percent in 2012 to 53.8 percent in 2013).

Overall, 6.4 percent of the burden of new TB cases in the Region originated from prisons. In EU and EEA countries the proportion of TB cases detected in prisons was only 1.6 percent of all new TB cases detected in the country, while the corresponding proportion in non-EU countries was 7.4 percent. Overall, the notification rate of new TB cases in prisons within the WHO European Region was 893 per 100 000 population, indicating that the risk of developing TB in prisons was, on average, around 23 times higher than in the general population.

Of an estimated 75 000 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases in the European Region in 2013, 34 941 (46.6 percent) were detected. The prevalence of MDR among new pulmonary TB cases in the Region amounted to 16.9 percent and was 48.0 percent among previously treated cases. Information relating to second-line drug susceptibility testing (SLD DST) remains limited as only a few countries provided data, altogether accounting for 12 percent of all notified MDR TB cases. Coverage of SLD DST among the reporting countries was 56.4 percent. In total, 532 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were detected, equivalent to 12.7 percent XDR prevalence among MDR TB patients.

Coverage of 2nd-line TB treatment continued to improve in 2013. In total, 46 710 TB patients were enrolled into MDR treatment, 45 147 of whom had confirmed MDR TB. In 2013, the proportion of patients starting MDR treatment out of the total notified cases of MDR TB was 116.7 percent, or 110.7 percent including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB). In some countries the number of patients enrolled exceeded the total notified because prevalent MDR cases detected in previous years were still enrolled in treatment.

Treatment success among new and relapse TB cases was 75.6 percent. Among previously treated cases (excluding relapses) it was 57.1 percent. The treatment success rate in the MDR TB cohort was 46.0 percent, which is lower than in 2012.

Given all of the above, and the fact that the vast majority of the TB burden occurs in the 18 high-priority countries of the European Region (85 percent of TB incidence, 86 percent of prevalence, 90 percent of the mortality caused by TB, 90 percent of TB/HIV co-infections and 99.5 percent of the MDR TB), the main efforts to combat and prevent TB in the Region still need to be focused there.

In collaboration with national and international partners and civil society organisations, WHO Regional Office for Europe has been implementing the Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, 2011-2015 at regional level and helping Member States to adopt evidence-based interventions in order to improve TB and M/XDR TB prevention and control. The WHO Regional Office for Europe has also established the European Green Light Committee and the European Laboratory Initiative to help countries develop and/or adjust their national plans in response to the M/ XDR-TB threat. Now that implementation of the Consolidated Action Plan is in its final year, and with the endorsement of the post-2015 global End TB Strategy by the 67th session of the World Health Assembly, Member States, WHO and partners are currently developing a new TB Action Plan for the WHO European Region, 2016-2020." - Mod.ML]
