I am saddened to be providing you with the attached news release concerning the passing of Hank Eigelsbach but happy that his contribution to infectious disease research may be acknowledged by ProMED, a reference source that he continued to access until his passing.

Hank spent his entire research career at Camp/Fort Detrick having joined in the 1st intake of military personnel/research scientists in 1944. As you will recall, at that time containment was mostly an idea that had yet to see much implementation and the early studies included a lot of effort to create working environments where pathogens could be safely handled, requiring not just scientific knowledge but also a grasp of the fundamentals of engineering. To sit with Hank and have him recall the early days of pathogen research and the conditions for conducting live agent aerosol testing, reliance on shipboard laboratories and the wealth of facilities at Detrick and Porton Down were some of the most enjoyable memories that Sue and I have of a fine scientist but also a grand old man of biodefence studies.

So, please find attached the news release that the family has approved and used to inform Hank's friends in Palm Beach Florida and Frederick Maryland of his death. I know that the family would delight in seeing him remembered by the global audience that ProMED reaches and thank you in advance for the opportunity to share but a small slice of a scientific life that was well-lived and much enjoyed by Hank and all who knew him.

Henry Eigelsbach dies: renowned Fort Detrick microbiologist, infectious disease researcher, educator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Henry T ('Hank') Eigelsbach, 100, a microbiologist who made significant contributions to studies on microbial pathogenicity, immunological response and prophylaxis (vaccine protection) of infectious diseases, died of natural causes at his home in Boca Raton, Florida on [6 Dec 2019].

"His contribution to tularemia vaccines, which began at the outset of his scientific career and remained a lifelong passion, is recognized around the world," said research colleague Dr Stephen Prior. Dr Eigelsbach was one of the pioneers of microbiology and vaccine development at a time when the knowledge of infectious diseases was just beginning to pay dividends in terms of medical products, and when scientists enjoyed few of the research tools that are now commonplace in medical research.

In 1958, at the height of the Cold War, Dr Eigelsbach was a member of the team at Fort Detrick who reached out to their Soviet counterparts to obtain a vaccine strain for tularemia. Amazingly, they succeeded. The vaccine strain and the path-finding work that Dr Eigelsbach subsequently led remains the key to current research to develop vaccines against tularemia.

During a career spanning nearly 60 years, Dr Eigelsbach was the author of more than 50 papers published in recognized research journals, and 7 book chapters, including in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology and The Manual of Clinical Microbiology. He also delivered dozens of presentations at national professional meetings that established him as an international authority on tularemia, the field in which his research concentrated. He was a Charter Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, and Diplomat of the American Board of Microbiology. He was the Frederick, Maryland Branch president of the Scientific Research Society of America.

In 1962, following publication (with Cora Downs) of his seminal work on a protective tularemia vaccine, Dr Eigelsbach's research was recognized with the highest award at the Army Service Conference in West Point, New York. Then, in 1968 he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award -- one of the highest recognitions given by the US Department of Defense -- for the development of an effective tularemia vaccine.

He served in the US Navy during World War II and ultimately achieved the rank of Commander in the US Navy Medical Service Corps (Reserves). In 1944, he was assigned to a laboratory at Camp Detrick, which later became the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, where he continued his research work and led key studies on infectious diseases until his retirement in 1975.

Following his retirement as medical microbiologist at Fort Detrick, he served as consultant for the national drug company Aries, the Salk Institute, and DynPort. His work with DynPort led to the advanced development and large-scale production of tularemia vaccine.

From 1975 to 1981, Dr Eigelsbach was a professor of biology at Western Maryland University. He mentored many students who went on to pursue careers in science, drawing on his own educational experiences to provide support and guidance for his students. A 1937 graduate of Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois, the village of his birth, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1941 at Purdue University, a Master of Science in 1943 at the University of Kentucky, and was awarded his doctorate by The University of Cincinnati in 1947.
