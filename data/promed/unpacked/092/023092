The Democratic Republic of the Congo today [27 Apr 2021] launched a preventive yellow fever vaccination campaign targeting more than 16.3 million people -- the 1st such drive against the disease in Africa in 2021.

The campaign -- being carried out in 7 of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's 26 provinces among people aged 9 months to 60 years, including nearly 300 000 refugees -- is a collaborative effort involving the country's health authorities with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, PATH, UNICEF, and Village Reach.

The campaign has taken more than a year of planning and was partly delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Tackling other health emergencies is now doubly difficult as countries are also working hard to contain the COVID-19 pandemic," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. "While yellow fever is a dangerous disease, it is easily preventable with one shot in the arm. This campaign illustrates that by adjusting to the new normal, working together, and innovating we can avert other outbreaks and combat COVID-19."

WHO is providing technical and coordination support to the campaign, training vaccinators as well as providing real time monitoring tools, including data management and a post campaign survey.

Although the Democratic Republic of the Congo introduced yellow fever vaccination as part of the national routine vaccination programme in 2003, coverage remains around 56%, below the recommended minimum of 80%. Low coverage has led to a resurgence of the disease in the country, with 6 outbreaks erupting between 2010 and 2019. A major outbreak in neighbouring Angola in 2016 spread into the Democratic Republic of the Congo's capital Kinshasa and 2 other provinces.

Yellow fever is caused by a virus spread through the bite of infected mosquitos. Some patients can develop serious symptoms, including high fever and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).

"We applaud the launch of this preventive vaccination campaign, the mobilization by partner organizations as well as the population who have taken ownership of the vaccination drive and are part of the collective efforts to eliminate yellow fever in the country," said Dr Luc Alungu, the Provincial Minister of Health for Tshopo, one of the 7 provinces where the vaccination is taking place.

The vaccination campaign is part of a comprehensive strategy to eliminate yellow fever epidemics (EYE) globally by 2026. WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and more than 50 partners are supporting the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other high-risk countries to assess epidemic risk, roll out vaccination campaigns, engage with communities and deliver other response activities, including surveillance and laboratory diagnosis.

Nationwide preventive measures are also needed to ensure the protection of the entire population at risk. Rapid outbreak detection and response and long-term prevention are integral to sustained yellow fever control.

In January [2021], Guinea and Senegal carried out reactive yellow fever vaccination campaigns after cases were detected. In 2021, aside from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo, and Sudan are to carry out yellow fever preventive campaigns, targeting a total of 53 million people in the 4 countries.

The burden of yellow fever in Africa is estimated at between 84 000 and 170 000 severe cases and 29 000 and 60 000 deaths annually. In Africa, 27 countries are at the highest risk for yellow fever epidemics.

Health authorities in Sudan began implementing yellow fever vaccination campaign activities last month in priority states as part of a broader vaccination campaign against yellow fever, cholera, and polio targeting 100 000 people, including host communities and recently arrived Ethiopian refugees.

Last month [March 2021], over 77 000 Ethiopian refugees were reached with yellow fever and cholera vaccines in Kassala and Gedaref states in the eastern part of Sudan through fixed and temporary sites and mobile vaccination teams. Networks of community volunteers were also established to raise community awareness of yellow fever and cholera symptoms, transmission, and preventive measures. Since the beginning of the conflict in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia in November 2020, 63 000 Ethiopian refugees have arrived in Kassala and Gedaref states,(1) fleeing the increasing levels of violence in their country. Additional outreach and vaccination activities are currently underway in other states, including catch-up vaccination campaigns for children in host communities.

These activities are being carried out by the Federal Ministry of Health and supported by WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in line with the "WHO Global Strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics, 2017-2026".

Sudan is at high risk for the spread of yellow fever due to a combination of climatic and ecological factors, and because there are still areas of low population immunity. Sudan has a high presence of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that can transmit yellow fever to human populations. The risk of yellow fever is also particularly high in neighbouring countries, such as Chad, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and South Sudan, and is exacerbated by cross-border population movement. These factors have previously resulted in at least 4 recent outbreaks of yellow fever in Sudan, which is the only country in WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region in the yellow fever zone.

There is currently no treatment for yellow fever although proper care management to treat dehydration, fever, and liver and kidney failure improves survival rates. Vaccination remains the most important measure for preventing this fatal disease. One single dose of the yellow fever vaccine offers lifetime protection.

In the last few years, Sudan has strengthened its commitment to assuring equitable access to vaccination and includes refugees, migrants, and displaced communities in its vaccination campaigns under an innovative approach. By organizing multi-antigen vaccination campaigns, including for yellow fever, health authorities have efficiently reached populations in need and reduced their risk of becoming ill with preventable diseases.

Protecting its populations against yellow fever has always been a public health priority for Sudan. In 2019, after a 5-year nationwide campaign, health authorities successfully reached more than 30 million people from 9 months to 60 years of age living in Sudan's 18 states with the yellow fever vaccine.

This year [2021], Sudan plans to introduce the yellow fever vaccine into its national immunization schedule as per WHO recommendations that all endemic countries should do so. This is a remarkable achievement given the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out and other public health activities, including circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2.

On the eve of World Immunization Week, celebrated during the last week of April every year, Sudan demonstrates how investing in vaccines and routine immunization brings us closer to ending diseases like yellow fever, especially among populations most at risk.

The "Global strategy to eliminate yellow fever epidemics" has been developed by a coalition of partners (Gavi, UNICEF, and WHO) to address yellow fever's changing epidemiology, resurgence of mosquitoes, and the increased risk of urban outbreaks and international spread. This global, comprehensive long-term strategy (2017-2026) targets the most vulnerable countries while addressing global risks, by building resilience in urban centres and preparedness in areas with the potential for outbreaks and ensuring a reliable vaccine supply.

[It is encouraging, indeed, to see these national yellow fever (YF) campaigns move ahead without the immediate and impending threat of a YF outbreak. The inclusion of YF vaccination in the national immunization schedule is more practical and economic than emergency efforts in the face of an ongoing YF outbreak such as the one that occurred in Angola and spilled over into Congo DR in 2016-2017. - Mod.TY
