[Philadelphia] CBP intercepts port's 1st Anatolian brown tick
-------------------------------------------------------------
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed Thursday [16 Jan 2014] that US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists recorded the area's 1st interception of _Rhipicephalus bursa_ (Ixodidae), or Anatolian brown ticks, on 23 Dec 2013.

CBP discovered the ticks at Philadelphia International Airport on untanned ruminant hides that a passenger brought from Macedonia and Greece.

The USDA further reported that this is only the nation's 4th documented interception of Anatolian brown ticks. This species was previously intercepted at John F Kennedy International Airport [New York] in 1966 on a live horse imported from Italy; on trophy hides of Spanish ibex that arrived at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport in 1995; and trophy hides of 4 big game species from Spain that arrived at JFK International Airport in July 2010.

According to the USDA, this tick occurs commonly in most countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and in the Middle East. All active life stages (adult and immature) feed on the same hosts, which most commonly are larger hoofed mammals. This tick is a known vector of infectious diseases of cattle, sheep, and horses. It also may cause tick paralysis in sheep, and it may occasionally bite humans.

Macedonia is a country that is affected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).

"Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists take their job of detecting dangerous insect pests very seriously, and any introduction of potential animal disease to the US livestock industry is of grave concern to us," said Tarance Drafts, Acting CBP Port Director for the Port of Philadelphia. "This is an excellent example of our agriculture specialists performing a thorough inspection and finding a new potential threat to US agriculture."

The passenger, who arrived from Rome on [23 Dec 2013], was referred to a secondary agriculture inspection after he reported possessing goat skins. During close examination, CBP agriculture specialists discovered that the hides were heavily infested with both live and dead ticks.

CBP submitted 7 live ticks to the USDA tick specialist for identification.

On [31 Dec 2013], the USDA tick specialist determined the ticks to be _Rhipicephalus bursa_ (Ixodidae), commonly known as Anatolian brown ticks.

CBP agriculture specialists destroyed the ruminant hides.

CBP agriculture specialists work closely with USDA's, APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service], PPQ [Plant Protection and Quarantine] to protect our nation's agriculture resources against the introduction of foreign plants, plant pests, and animal diseases.

[_Rhipicephalus bursa_ Canestrini and Fanzago, 1877 is an ixodid (hard) tick generally found in areas ranging in latitude from low to medium. It can also range in environment from mountainous slopes to semi- desert, but is generally found in grassy areas. Its geographical distribution includes, in Africa the coastal areas from Morocco to Libya; in Europe, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Switzerland, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania (southern), Ukraine (southern), and the islands (Madeira, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Cyprus); in Russia (North Caucasus and Lower Volga region); in Asia: Turkey, Syria, Israel, Iraq (northern), Iran (northern), Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and China (Xingjiang).

_R. bursa_ is a 2-host species and only one life cycle is completed in a year. While all mammals can serve as hosts for _R. bursa_, sheep, goats, cattle, and horses are the preferred hosts and the tick seldom infests wild mammals or humans. As a vector of many diseases to livestock, it is a serious pest to animal husbandry.

This particular tick is responsible for transmission of the following pathogens:
Cattle: _Babesia bigemina_, _Babesia bovis_, _Anaplasma marginale_
Horse: _Babesia caballi_, _Babesia equi_
Sheep: _Babesia motasi_, _Babesia ovis_, _Theileria ovis_, _Anaplasma ovis_, _Ehrlichia ovina_

Other diseases associated with _R. bursa_ include Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and tick paralysis (thought to be caused by a toxin in tick saliva and transmitted to its host during feeding).
