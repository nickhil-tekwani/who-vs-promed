publication 7 Jul 2004.
Common bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L.) is grown on approximately 1500 ha in
commercial greenhouses and is of major economic importance in the
Souss-Massa Region, Agadir, Morocco. Since October 2003, symptoms
resembling a viral disease, consisting of pod mosaic and distortion and
mild to severe mosaic in leaves, have been observed on bean plants in
several greenhouses.
Mechanical inoculation with symptomatic leaf extracts produced necrotic
local lesions on _P. vulgaris_ 'Pinto' and systemic symptoms similar to
those observed in the naturally infected bean plants _P. vulgaris_ 'Donna'
(5 plants per cultivar).
Inoculated and naturally infected samples reacted positively using a double
antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) to Southern
bean mosaic virus (SBMV) (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany), a member of the
Sobemovirus genus that is transmitted by contact, soil, beetles, and seeds
(1). Virions purified from a naturally infected 'Donna' plant contained a
30-kDa polypeptide that reacted positively using sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis with SBMV
antiserum (DSMZ).
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification with SMBV
primers as described by Verhoeven et al. (2) produced an expected 870-bp
band. The amplicon was cloned, sequenced (GenBank Accession No. AJ748276),
and compared to those isolates available in GenBank and had a nucleotide
sequence identity of 87 percent and a derived amino acid sequence identity
of 95 percent with an SBMV isolate from Spain (2).
During a survey in different areas of the Souss-Massa Region, 20
symptomatic leaf and pod samples were randomly collected from 12
greenhouses (50 ha) where significant commercial losses were suffered
because of this virus disease, and all samples were positive using
DAS-ELISA for SBMV.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of SBMV in Morocco.

[SBMV, 1st reported in common bean in samples from USA (Louisiana and
California) in 1943, also infects _Vigna unguiculata_, [Vu] _V. mungo_ and
_Glycine max_, causing mosaic and/or mottle, and stunting (especially in
Vu). It is transmitted in a semi-persistent manner by bean leaf beetles
(_Ceratoma trifurcata_ and _Epilachna_ varieties), mechanical inoculation,
grafting, by seed (3-44 percent) and by pollen. SBMV has been reported from
Africa and from regions in the Americas (North, South and Central), and
France. SBMV is transmitted to bean seedlings if germinating seeds are in
contact with infective extracts or are planted in soil near roots of
infected plants. Disease management essentially involves use of virus-free
seed.
