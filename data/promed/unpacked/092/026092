[In yesterday's update (7 Jan 2016), I mentioned that there was no report on MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia for 6 Jan 2017, and based on the numbers presented as of late afternoon EST (GMT-5), I surmised there were no newly confirmed cases, nor fatalities, nor recoveries reported on 6 Jan 2017, and stated: "If I am in error, a correction will be posted once further information is available." Today's update [8 Jan 2017] on the Saudi MOH website provided a 2nd update posted effective 7 Jan 2017 that was in fact for 7 Jan 2017. Hence, the one new case and 3 new recoveries reported were for the day 6 Jan 2017, and the numbers presented in today's update include 7 and 8 Jan 2017 reports.

That being clarified, in the 1st 8 days of January 2017, there have been a total of 9 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia. Of these 9 cases, 5 are from Buraidah, 2 from Riyadh, one each from Madinah and Hufoof, geographically in a belt through the central part of the country going from west to east with Buraidah a bit to the north (see http://www.saudia-online.com/Map%20of%20proviance.htm for visual clarity).

Given the regular reporting of newly confirmed cases, it seems safe to say that MERS-CoV is an endemic disease in Saudi Arabia with periodic outbreaks associated with nosocomial transmission. That being said, we still do not understand why this is the case in Saudi Arabia and not in its neighbors on the Arabian Peninsula, where there are camels and camel breeding.

A map showing the locations of the cases discussed in today's (8 Jan 2017) update can be found at the source URLs.
