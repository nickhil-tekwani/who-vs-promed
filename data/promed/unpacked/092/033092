Fungus rather than _Pfiesteria microbe_ may be harming fish
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A fungus and not the _Pfiesteria_ microbe may be causing lesions on fish in
the eastern United States, researchers said Wednesday. A team at the U.S.
Geological Survey said they checked menhaden fish that had lesions
previously blamed on _Pfiesteria_ and found a fungus was in fact
responsible. It comes from a species of fungus called _Aphanomyces_
that is known to have caused lesions on fish, and even killed some,
in other parts of the world, Vicky Blazer, a fish pathologist at the
USGS, said.
They found the fungus in 95 percent of lesions on fish taken from the
Chesapeake Bay in 1997 during an outbreak of _Pfiesteria_. It causes
severe damage. "In numerous fishes the fungal organism had actually
penetrated to and through organs such as the liver," Blazer said in a
statement.

_Pfiesteria_ is blamed for killing billions of fish, mostly
menhaden, in the waters off North Carolina and in the Chesapeake bay
area.
The organism, a dinoflagellate, is usually benign but can transform into a
fish-killing strain. An expected outbreak did not happen this year, much to
the relief of local fishermen. Blazer said the next step is to see whether
menhaden with open sores caused by the fungus may in fact stimulate the
_Pfiesteria_ attacks.
