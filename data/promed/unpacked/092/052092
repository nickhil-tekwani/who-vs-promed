Carrot crops hit by disease in autumn
-------------------------------------
Disease took its toll on carrot crops throughout autumn 2009, say
researchers who recently held trials. They found high levels of
foliar disease and cavity spot, said Barrie Smith, senior technical
officer at the Processors and Growers Research Organisation.

"This is down to growing conditions from October to November," he
explained. "Cavity spot is rearing its head this year [2009] and I've
heard some crops are being taken up early rather than being strawed
down for winter." Growers were restricted on how to minimize problems
because we were so far into the season, he added. Unhealthy-looking
carrots should be harvested before disease spreads.

Full results are due in late January [2010], said Smith. "Disease
levels were high this year [2009] but indications are showing good
varietal differences for _Pythium_," he said. "The ranking of cavity
spot tolerance is continuing to hold."

[Cavity spot is a disfiguring disease of carrots and related root
crops (for example parsnips) caused by species of soil fungi
belonging to the genus _Pythium_. _P. violae_ is reported to be the
primary cause in European temperate areas. Symptoms include depressed
lesions, predominantly on the upper part of roots, which enlarge as
the crop matures. While total yield is not affected, the cavities
make crops unmarketable. Roots are rejected at grading with 1 or 2
visible lesions, and when disease incidence passes a relatively low
threshold it becomes uneconomic to harvest crops.

The disease develops slowly and is favoured by cool soil
temperatures. Hosts are generally more susceptible when the
conditions are unfavourable for plant growth. The fungi can be
dispersed by water and mechanical means. Disease management includes
cultural practices, crop rotation, and use of tolerant host
varieties. Agrochemicals are used to control the disease in some
parts of the world, however this is not always reliable.

_P. violae_ can also affect lucerne (alfalfa). Infections of other
hosts such as celery, black eye beans, wheat, cucumber, and beets may
not result in symptoms. _Pythium_ species cause damping off and root
rots in a range of hosts including many crops, for example cucurbit
vegetables, onion, maize and soybean.
