Mumps outbreak at UC Berkeley grows to over 40 suspected and confirmed
cases
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The California Department of Public Health confirmed Monday [10 Oct
2011] that the mumps outbreak at UC Berkeley -- which has grown to 44
suspected and confirmed cases -- began when a UC Berkeley student
contracted the virus in Great Britain. Department spokesperson Matt
Conens said in an email Monday [10 Oct 2011] that laboratory-confirmed
cases of the virus [disease] had increased from 7 to 9 cases and
suspected cases had grown to approximately 35 cases.

According to Mike Sicilia, spokesperson for the department, the
department located the source of the outbreak through interviewing
infected students. "We believe this outbreak was started by a student
who was exposed to mumps while in Europe and returned to campus and
unfortunately developed mumps and spread it to others," Sicilia said.
"It's actually not unusual for outbreaks of mumps in the US that there
has been some contact with someone who has been out of the country."

University Health Services has been advised by the department as well
as the City of Berkeley Division of Public Health to refocus its
containment efforts on students in high-population housing, where
officials currently suspect the outbreak began. University Health
Services medical director Brad Buchman said prevention efforts are
being focused on high-population student living areas with shared
dining and bathroom facilities, including dorms, coops, and
fraternities and sororities, because these areas have seen the most
suspected and confirmed cases. Cases have been reported in the
residence halls, coops, and in fraternity and sorority houses across
campus, including Cloyne Court and the Clark Kerr Campus.

The Berkeley Student Cooperative [BSC], which has experienced at least
one confirmed and one suspected case of the virus, has responded to
the outbreak by educating residents about preventative measures. "The
health worker coordinator is disseminating resource material and all
the information we've gotten from the chancellor," said BSC executive
director Jan Stokley. "We're educating people at the house level about
what the symptoms are and what to do to prevent contagion."

Health officials at UC Berkeley and the department are recommending
that at-risk individuals who have already received 2 doses of the
vaccine receive a 3rd dose. According to Buchman, though 2 doses of
the vaccine were thought sufficient, previous outbreaks have revealed
that up to half the patients with mumps had already had 2 doses.

Buchman said most reported cases of the virus have been mild and
involved swelling of the parotid gland and inflammation of the
testicles. The mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine will be available
for free to students, faculty and staff at the Tang Center from 12
p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday [11 Oct 2011] and from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. Friday
[14 Oct 2011].

[Mumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose,
or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs,
sneezes, or talks. Items used by an infected person, such as soft
drink cans or eating utensils, can also be contaminated with the
virus, which may spread to others if those items are shared. In
addition, the virus may spread when someone with mumps touches items
or surfaces without washing their hands and someone else then touches
the same surface and rubs their mouth or nose. The incubation time can
range from 12-25 days. Most mumps transmission likely occurs before
the salivary glands begin to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling
begins. Therefore, isolation of mumps patients is recommended for 5
days after their glands begin to swell.

Mumps was initially considered a monotypic virus and immunity induced
by one vaccine strain lead to a significant reduction of reported
cases of mumps. However, large outbreaks in vaccinated individuals and
monoclonal antibody studies have revealed that there are several
strains of mumps virus. Additionally, both symptomatic and subclinical
re-infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with
different genotypes of mumps virus have been reported. (For more
information, see
http://ecdc.europa.eu/EN/HEALTHTOPICS/MUMPS/BASIC_FACTS/Pages/factsheet_professionals.aspx?MasterPage=1).
In this respect it will be relevant to establish if the outbreak
strain in California corresponds the predominant mumps virus genotype
(G5) circulating in the UK currently (see: Mumps - UK (02): (Scotland)
young people 20110224.0612). - Mod.CP]
