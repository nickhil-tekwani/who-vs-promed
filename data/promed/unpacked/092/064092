The 3rd case of the deadly bird flu virus in 10 days has been
discovered on a small poultry farm in the German state of
Brandenburg, resulting in the culling of 46 chickens, officials said
Tuesday [25 Dec 2007]. The H5N1 virus was detected among 15 chickens
on a property in the state, which surrounds the German capital Berlin.
The property's owner, who had contacted officials on Monday [24 Dec
2007], was also looking after a neighbouring property with 31
chickens over the Christmas period. As a precaution, the chickens on
both properties were destroyed.
The 3-km area has been shut off around the properties, which is
dominated by small private holdings.
Poultry in the surrounding area are now being held in closed pens
with owners having been told to immediately report any signs of
illness among their birds to local veterinary authorities.

A 5th case of bird flu has been confirmed at a farm in the Rostov
Region, south Russia, close to the site of previous outbreaks, the
regional emergencies ministry said.
"The outbreak at 2 smallholdings was registered on Saturday [22 Dec
2007]; samples were taken and sent for analysis; they came back
positive for bird flu," the ministry said.
All 79 birds on the smallholding have been culled. A quarantine zone
has been introduced in the Tselinsky district near the site of the
1st case of the deadly virus.
The 1st bird flu outbreak was discovered in late November 2007 at the
Gulyai-Borisovskaya poultry farm in the Rostov Region. The farm's
entire population of 500 000 chickens was culled. Later, a bird flu
outbreak was registered at a smallholding close to the farm. Another
outbreak was then discovered at a farm in the Tselinsky district.
The Rostov Region is particularly vulnerable to bird flu as part of
the Krasnodar Territory, which is on a route taken by migrating birds
in winter.
In September 2007, the region was hit by the H5N1 strain, and 230 000
birds were culled.
In February 2007, dead poultry with traces of the lethal virus were
found in Moscow, in 8 nearby areas. All cases were traced to a single
market in southwest Moscow.
The virus, which was 1st isolated in humans in 1997, has been
spreading rapidly, resulting in the deaths and culling of millions of
birds, and a human death toll of over 200.

[3] FAO, global update

Despite recent spikes in H5N1 avian influenza activity in humans and
birds, there have been fewer bird outbreaks in fewer countries this
year [2007] than in 2006, according to a preliminary report from the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
As of 10 Dec 2007, 30 countries had reported H5N1 cases in birds this
year [2007], compared with 54 in 2006, the FAO reported. This year, 5
countries have reported their 1st outbreaks: Bangladesh, Benin,
Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and Togo. Except for sporadic outbreaks in wild
birds, most of the H5N1 cases this year occurred in domestic poultry,
such as chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and quail.
The H5N1 outbreaks seemed to follow a seasonal pattern, in line with
evidence that cooler temperatures are more favorable to influenza
viruses. The FAO said outbreak numbers in 2007 were high between
January and April, declined until September, and then started rising
again in November and December.
Increased awareness and improved disease surveillance have enabled
countries such as India, Romania, Malaysia, and Turkey to detect and
control the spread of the H5N1 virus, the FAO reported. However, the
disease persists in Asia, Africa, and Europe and poses a risk for
countries that have controlled outbreaks in the past and those that
have not experienced infections yet, the organization stated.
The FAO said Indonesia is still having a large number of H5N1
outbreaks in poultry, which largely reflects a new "participatory
disease search" program designed to detect infections in backyard
poultry. The program, with support from the FAO, is operating in 162
districts and 9 provinces.
Among other Asian hot spots for the disease, Viet Nam reported H5N1
outbreaks in 22 provinces in May 2007, the FAO reported. It said the
disease appears to be endemic in Bangladesh.
China had H5N1 outbreaks in Tibet in March 2007, Hunan province in
May 2007, and Guangdong province in September 2007, the agency said.
In addition, routine surveillance detected the virus in March and
April 2007 in the southern Chinese provinces of Fujian, Guangdong,
Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Chongqing, the FAO reported. Also, wild
bird deaths were reported in Hong Kong but not in mainland China.
The only Middle Eastern country reporting an H5N1 outbreak so far
this year [2007] has been Saudi Arabia, which had its 1st cases in
March 2007, followed by several outbreaks near Riyadh in November
2007 [Seven outbreaks officially reported to the OIE, but unofficial
data mention 38 outbreaks since November 2007; see 20071224.4131. - Mod.AS].
In Africa, 4 countries have reported H5N1 outbreaks in 2007, and the
FAO said the virus is considered endemic in Egypt and possibly in
Nigeria. "Several countries in West, Central, South, and North Africa
are at risk of becoming infected, and early warning, surveillance,
and preventive measures should urgently be taken," the organization reported.
Eight European countries have reported H5N1 outbreaks in 2007, the
FAO noted [These are the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Russia and UK. - Mod.AS].

[The EMPRES interactive world map "HPAI temporal spread (last 6
months), June - 11 Dec 2007," demonstrates the global spread (in 3
continents) of H5N1. The map provides 3 additional layers: country
borders, wetland & rivers, and poultry density. See at

The renewed spread and increased seasonal incidence of the epizootic,
which started in November 2007, will become more apparent when the
map is updated to include the 2nd semester of December 2007. - Mod.AS]
