France has identified its 1st outbreak of tick-borne encephalitis from consumption of raw milk products, with more than 40 people affected.

The infections are linked to eating a brand of raw milk goat cheese in Ain, in the Rhone-Alpes region, between April and May this year [2020], according to Sante publique France.

The cheese producer is GAEC des Chevrettes du Vieux Valey, based at Condamine in Haut-Bugey, Ain. It is thought ticks carrying the virus infected a goat, then its milk, then the cheeses, and finally consumers.

A total of 42 cases of lymphocytic meningitis, encephalitis, and infectious syndromes have been identified in people living in the commune of Oyonnax, within a radius of 30 km [19 mi]. There are 2 additional people who live in Loire-Atlantique and Jura but consumed the implicated raw milk goat's cheese. Cases occurred between the week of 13-19 Apr and 18-24 May [2020] with a peak from 20-26 Apr [2020].

At the end of May [2020], the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, the agent responsible for tick-borne encephalitis, was confirmed for 33 of the 44 cases. The other 11 are under investigation, and biological tests are being done to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis.

Among confirmed cases, the median age is 49 with the youngest patient aged 11 months and the oldest 86 years old. Of those infected, 30 people were hospitalized or went to hospital, and 2 have been admitted to intensive care.

Of the 43 cases, 41 reported having raw milk cheese from the same producer in Ain from mid-April [2020]. Presence of the TBE virus has been identified in a goat cheese from the company. A recall of dairy products from the firm was carried out before this result was known.

The producer has started pasteurizing goat milk before processing. A withdrawal and recall of products on sale at the time of the alert was conducted in late May [2020].

A statement from GAEC des Chevrettes du Vieux Valey said the TBE virus carried by ticks was found on a single batch of cheeses produced on 20 Apr [2020] with checks on more recent products negative, but it continues to discard product from milking until authorities say it can restart sales.

"We are awaiting the results of the blood tests on our goats to ensure that our animals are no longer carriers of this virus. We also wish a speedy recovery to the victims of this virus, and we will inform you of the progress of the investigation concerning us," according to a statement from the farm owners.

Occurrence of sporadic cases of tick-borne encephalitis is not new in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region with a few identified each year. One case was identified at the end of May 2020 in Ain in a person bitten several times by ticks but who did not consume the cheese.

Most infections with the virus result from infected ticks, which often remain attached to the skin for days. On rare occasions, infection can result from consumption of unpasteurized milk from infected goats, sheep, or cows, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The incubation period of TBE is usually 7-14 days. In an early phase, symptoms may include fever, malaise, anorexia, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. After an asymptomatic interval, a 2nd phase of disease occurs in some patients who could experience symptoms of meningitis such as fever, headache, and a stiff neck and encephalitis (e.g., drowsiness, confusion, sensory disturbances, and/or motor abnormalities such as paralysis). Encephalitis developing during this 2nd phase may result in paralysis, permanent health issues, or death.

Severity of illness increases with age of the patient, and there is no specific treatment for tick-borne encephalitis, according to the WHO.

The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) is doing additional environmental studies on ticks and the TBE virus in the geographic area concerned. Investigations are also being carried out, particularly among dairy farmers, because ticks carrying this virus may be present in other municipalities.

[The number of reported cases has increased from 32 on 4 Jun 2020 to the 33 confirmed, with 11 suspected cases (under investigation) reported above. The source apparently was a single batch of goat cheese. It will be interesting to learn how many animals have been infected with the virus. Pasteurization of milk should eliminate the risk of TBE virus infection from consumption of contaminated milk or cheese in this TBE virus endemic area.

Tick-borne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
