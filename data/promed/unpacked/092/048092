Patients presenting with severe fever and thrombocytopenia have been admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital for the past several months (approximately 9 months). These patients had no history of travel outside Kathmandu.

Serological tests for typhoid fever, malaria, brucellosis, leptospirosis, dengue, and chikungunya were negative. Most of the patients had platelet counts of around 50 000/cumm, while other remaining blood counts were within a normal range. All patients were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and some of them received platelet rich plasma (PRP) during treatments and recovered uneventfully.

Test for bacterial pathogens are widespread for diagnosis in febrile patients, while viral pathogen testing is uncommon, perhaps due to lack of infrastructure and diagnostic capabilities in Nepal. Although there have been no reported deaths due to similar clinical manifestations in Nepal, there is increasing urgency for the identification of the pathogen, particularly viral pathogens, because patients having severe fever with thrombocytopenia are being attended to in this hospital in both in-patient and outpatient settings.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun for sending in this report.

The need for definitive laboratory diagnosis is critical for these cases. The diagnosis of these cases apparently has been made exclusively on clinical grounds, although tests have excluded several other pathogens.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a serious emerging infectious disease, was 1st reported in rural areas of central China in 2009. The characteristic signs and symptoms of SFTS include fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia, and the disease has a case-fatality rate of up to 30 per cent. SFTS is caused by infection with SFTS virus (SFTSV; family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Phlebovirus_). The virus was 1st isolated in 2010 from patients with SFTS. Since then, additional cases have been reported from many areas of China, Japan and South Korea. In China and South Korea, SFTS virus has been isolated from _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ ticks. No mention is made of tick bites for the above Nepalese patients.

Additional information about specific dates and localities where these patients acquired their infections would be of interest, as would results of any tests if samples have been sent to any reference laboratories for confirmation of the diagnosis.
