After previously ravishing hundreds of people in Mohmand [Peshawar division of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa], a leishmaniasis outbreak has been reported in South Waziristan [Dera Ismail Khan division of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] with hundreds of patients registered at the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) while others have sought treatment at the Bannu district [Bannu division of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] Headquarters Hospital.

Afraid of any adverse health impacts of the parasitic infection caused by the bite of infected sandflies, many residents have opted to shift to other parts of the tribal belt to 'escape' the disease.

Locals say that dozens of residents from the worst affected areas of South Waziristan including Kotkai, Badar, Makeen, Kanigurm, Shawal, and Sara Rugha have relocated to Bannu or even to the provincial capital of Peshawar.

The district administration, though, has yet to adequately respond to the outbreak even as the district health officials struggle to cope with the situation. A local claimed that the DHQ [District Headquarter Hospital] in Wana [South Waziristan district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] did not have any remedy to treat the disease.

Meanwhile, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa health ministry told The Express Tribune on contact that they had dispatched some 300 anti-leishmaniasis injections to the tribal district and that they were working on arranging further doses to treat the affected there.

Meanwhile, locals have summoned a grand Jirga [traditional assembly of leaders that make decisions by consensus and according to the teachings of Pashtunwali] for [10 Apr 2019] to decide on a future course of action.

Last year [2018], nearly 1500 cases of leishmaniasis were reported in the Mohmand tribal district. As a result, the provincial and federal governments along with the World Health Organisation (WHO) had to dispatch vials of serum to treat patients.

[Pakistan is endemic for leishmaniasis, mostly the cutaneous form. Control of leishmaniasis depends on control of the reservoir, small rodents, and the vector, the sandfly.

However, there is no systematic, government-supported control program (ref: Mursalin SM. _Leishmania_ disease gap analysis study - Pakistan. Int J Infect Dis. 2016; 45(Suppl.1): 185; available at https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(16)30410-6/fulltext).

Drugs being used are probably sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or Pentostam or the very closely related meglumine antimoniate, Glucantime, or pentamidine. - Mod.EP
