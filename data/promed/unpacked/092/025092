An outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis -- also known as kala azar or black
fever -- has been reported in Isiolo and Wajir in north eastern Kenya.
According to a senior health official 4 people have died.

Shahnaaz Sharif, the senior deputy director of medical services in Kenya's
health ministry, said 66 people had been infected in the outbreak that was
first reported in Wajir in April 2008. Sharif said the most affected age
group was children between the age of one and 5 "This is due to lowered
immunity and the prevailing malnutrition problem in the northern region,"
he said.

The most affected areas in Wajir are the districts of Wajir West with 50
per cent of the total cases (in the localities of Arbijahan, Eldas,
Giristu, Wara, and Malale), Wajir East, and Wajir North. In Isiolo, the
Merta Alba area was the most affected.

Sharif said the health ministry and other stakeholders were carrying out
case management and distributing drugs to the sick in treatment centres in
Wajir and Isiolo. The affected communities are also being provided with
health education on disease prevention and control, while therapeutic
feeding of malnourished children is also taking place.

Control measures for kala azar include the use of insecticide treated bed
nets and skin repellents as well as early diagnosis, complete treatment,
and effective surveillance. Sharif said it had not been possible to reach
all of those potentially affected by the outbreak as some had travelled in
search of water and pasture for their livestock. Isiolo and Wajir are
located in Kenya's pastoral-nomadic region.

Kala azar is endemic in northern Kenya and outbreaks are common in times of
drought. Once it enters the body, the leishmaniasis parasite, which is
carried by sand flies, migrates to internal organs and bone marrow. If an
infection progresses to disease and is left untreated, it almost always
results in death.

Sand flies thrive in the cracks of mud-covered dwellings, in cow dung, rat
burrows, anthills, dry riverbeds, and vegetation. In Wajir, the flies often
bite people as they dig for water in the bed of the Ewaso Nyiro River or
graze their livestock on nearby bushes. The most effective methods of
diagnosing kala azar can only be conducted in large hospitals located far
from the worst-affected areas.

[Please see the extensive moderator's comment from the ProMED-mail posting
on VL (visceral leishmaniasis) in northern Kenya date 21 Jul 2006 (archive
no. 20060721.2007). The comment concluded that, "The present increase in
cases is most probably part of a larger outbreak of the entire region
including eastern Ethiopia, Somalia, and north eastern Kenya." The comment
posted 23 Jul 2006 (archive no. 20060723.2030) from Ellicott McConnell
emphasized the connection between outbreaks of VL and malnutrition. It
seems that malnutrition is still part of the problem and the situation has
not changed since 2006. - Mod.EP
