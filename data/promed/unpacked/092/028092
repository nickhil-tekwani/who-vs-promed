The Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) declared a yellow fever (YF) outbreak. On 6 Mar 2022, the MOH reported 4 cases of YF confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), with specimens collected between 3 Jan 2022 and 18 Feb 2022.

Of these cases, 3 are from Wakiso district (Katabi, Masulita, and Kitende sub-counties) and one case is from Masaka district (Bukakata sub-county).

As of 16 Mar 2022, a total of 8 PRNT-positive cases were reported, of which 7 have been investigated and 4 have a history of vaccination against YF.

Uganda falls within the YF endemic zone in Africa and is classified as a high-risk country in the "Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics" (EYE) Strategy. The exact prevalence and incidence of YF in Uganda is not known. In addition, the country has previously registered several YF outbreaks with the most recent outbreaks reported in 2020 in Buliisa and Moyo districts, and 2019 in Masaka and Koboko districts.

However, YF vaccine has not yet been introduced into routine immunization, and the MOH is currently planning for a preventive campaign in selected districts. Accordingly, these recurrent outbreaks illustrate the ongoing risk of sylvatic spillover of YF and risk for disease amplification in both rural and densely settled urban areas in the largely unimmunized population.

[Presumably, the 4 earlier cases were diagnosed as yellow fever positive by a diagnostic rise in antibody determined by the plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) of acute and convalescent sera. It is not clear if these 4 PRNT-positive tests are included in the 8 mentioned in the 16 Mar 2022 total. If 4 of these 8 were previously vaccinated against YF, they would be seropositive for the virus but not infected and not cases.

Yellow fever is no stranger in Uganda, and outbreaks occur sporadically. Recent previous outbreaks were reported in 2020 and in May 2019 after laboratory-confirmed cases. These cases and the current ones are spillover from endemic sylvan (forest) maintenance of the virus. Maintaining adequate vaccination coverage in these areas is important to prevent initiation of urban transmission of the virus, which can quickly get out of hand. The Ministry of Health would be wise to increase YF surveillance and to mount a prompt vaccination campaign. The current vaccination coverage is reported as low and far short of the 80% that would provide adequate immunity for the population. - Mod.TY
