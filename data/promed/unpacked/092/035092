From: Cummings, Dr. Ian <ICummings@hnne.org>

I'm an emergency physician in the very Northeast corner of Connecticut
(Windham County). I've been on the list for a few years listening.
We commonly see Lyme disease in our region (more common than pneumococcal
pneumonia). [Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) is a dime a dozen, Lyme CNS
happens occasionally, rarely Lyme carditis and most kids with hot knees are
Lyme.
This winter we all observed [expected that this summer would be a bad Lyme
[disease season. We were right. Each day we see scads of primary Lyme but
this year we are seeing cases compatible with Ehrlichiosis. Patients have
headache, myalgias and arthralgias. Usually no ECM (occasionally yes). WBC
less than 4,000, often low platelets and SGOT invariably double or so above
controls.
I called the [human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE) epidemiology people in
New Haven and they said yes, [there has been some increase this year. They
also speak of a new viral tick borne illness (emerging pathogen).
We don't see babesiosis here it seems.

[Knowing that we have a large number of informed members in New England,
would they please enlighten us as to the wider reality of what is, or is
not, happening concerning Lyme disease incidence, Ehrlichiosis, and this
"new viral tick borne illness." Thanks to Ian for this 'heads-up'. - Mod.MHJ
