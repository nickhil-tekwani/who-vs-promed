Skin anthrax may be more common than thought in UK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skin anthrax, the less serious form of the disease, may be more common in
Britain than previously thought, a research scientist told a conference on
Monday. Only 14 cases of skin anthrax have been detected in Britain in the
last 20 years, but 2 British cases were reported soon after the 11 Sep 2002
attacks in the United States.
Dr Charles Penn, of the Centre for Applied Microbiological Research (CAMR),
a government institute, said "2 cases in 6 months, compared with 14 in 20
years, statistically does not tell you a lot, but it does raise the
possibility that there are more cases that go undiagnosed."
Skin anthrax is more common among people who work with animals. It is
likely that more cases were diagnosed after the attacks in the US because
there was greater awareness of the disease, he told the British Association
for the Advancement of Science conference. Unlike the more serious inhaled
anthrax, skin anthrax can be effectively treated with antibiotics, so cases
can go unnoticed.
Penn told the conference the threat of bioterrorism was a new challenge to
efforts to maintain free societies with high expectations of safety and
security. Effective planning and preparation by scientists and governments
can make outbreaks of infectious disease less damaging, he said.
"Preventative and protective measures include greater security and
surveillance, restrictions on technology sharing, advanced biological
detection and new vaccine and treatments," he told the meeting.

[I checked with Charles Penn at CAMR, who confirmed this Reuters report.
Apparently the 2 cases were the result of occupational exposure -- one
worked with imported animal skins, the other with old building materials.
Confirmation was by serology. Interestingly the incidence of human cases
in the UK has always been essentially independent of agricultural livestock
cases, reflecting exposure to industrial sources and latterly, also when
modifying old buildings when workers come across contaminated insulation
and such. For example, some years ago Peter Turnbull found the pathogen in
horsehair insulation in St. Pancras Station. Our thanks to Charles for his
help and to Stu in New Zealand for forwarding this report. - MHJ.Mod]
