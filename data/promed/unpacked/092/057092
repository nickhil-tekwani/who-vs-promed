Pakistan's push against polio
-----------------------------
With nearly all of the rest of the world on the brink of being free of polio, the disease's persistence in Pakistan has long challenged health experts both inside and outside the country. Last year [2015], the 51 cases of wild poliovirus reported here represented the bulk of all 70 [72, see section [3] below] cases reported throughout the world.

Even so, last year's [2015] count is cause for optimism, since it was a huge drop from the 294 cases reported in Pakistan in 2014, and because it seems to be a product of some clever adjustments the country has made to its longstanding polio eradication programme, with help from the Pakistani Army and smartphone-based technology.

Since 1978, the country has had an official Expanded Programme on Immunisation, in which vaccinators go door to door to immunise against many childhood and other diseases -- tuberculosis, hepatitis, meningitis, measles and more. But when the goal became finally stamping out the last traces of polio, the regimen had to be ramped up to include more than these periodic household visits.

As part of the World Health Organisation's Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018, the government announced that [25 Apr 2016] will be a National Switch Day for updating the kind of vaccine used, to account for the fact that Types 2 and 3 of the polio virus appear to have already been eliminated in Pakistan, with only Type 1 remaining.

Recognising that, the WHO recommended a switch from a trivalent oral polio vaccine to a version that can target Type 1 more effectively.

Next milestone will be phasing out the oral vaccine, which is built from a weakened live virus, and replacing it with an inactive polio vaccine administered by injection. Starting in Punjab, that strategy will supplement live-virus vaccine schedule with one dose of the inactive version, which eliminates even the small risk of contracting the disease from live virus vaccine.

One reason the inactive vaccine is coming into use only now is that it is 5 times more expensive than the live oral type. To overcome that obstacle, GAVI, a public-private organisation funded by various countries, charities and international institutions, will help cover the cost.

At the same time, Pakistan's government has supplied vaccinators with motorcycles, for which Britain's Fund for International Development, along with UNICEF, will provide fuel allowances. Lack of fuel has been a popular excuse for vaccinators who miss their vaccine targets because they don't want to travel to the far-flung areas where they are most needed. Security for vaccinators is an even bigger issue, illustrated by the bombing last Wednesday [13 Jan 2016] of a polio eradication centre in Quetta that killed 14 policemen during an immunisation drive. [See http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/bomb-attack-at-polio-vaccination-centre-kills-14-in-pakistani-city-of-quetta for details on that bombing. - Mod.MPP]

Indeed, a long campaign of disinformation spread by the Taliban helps explain why Pakistan's polio eradication programme has not yet wiped out the disease. In 2006, the extremist group declared vaccination to be a Western plot to sterilise Pashtun children and stunt their growth. It threatened to kill parents who had their children immunised, and attacked polio vaccinators in Pakistan's tribal areas and in metropolitan Karachi. Celebrities joined campaigns to counter the propaganda, and religious leaders issued fatwas declaring that Islam permitted the immunisation of children, but those efforts did nothing to stop the attacks.

Security to vaccinators
But much of that changed last January [2015], after the Taliban disrupted a 3-day immunisation drive in Sindh Province by killing 3 polio workers. 1st, vaccinators refused to work until they were given more protection. Then, the Pakistani Army provided the vaccinators with visible security.

By that point, the army had already begun a nationwide anti-militant campaign in the wake of an attack on an army-run public school. When the offensive drove militants out of North Waziristan's tribal areas and Karachi's no-go zones, parents finally lowered their resistance to immunising their children. What followed was the 70 per cent drop in new polio cases over the full year.

Nevertheless, the Taliban's efforts to fight the campaign continue, as do management problems within the national immunisation campaign. Some officials have been accused of siphoning money from its programmes, or of using expired vaccines, and some vaccination plans have had difficulty targeting vulnerable populations.

One effort to resolve that problem was the introduction in Punjab last year [2015] of a smartphone app on which the region's 3700 vaccinators could keep track of their work. Now, instead of going household to household, they go to a centre where children have been assembled for vaccination. The vaccinators then send the data via phone to a central office. Using this approach, vaccinators' attendance rates, which at times had been as low as 21 percent, have risen to 95 per cent to 100 per cent.

Encouraged by those results, the Punjab government and the World Bank plan to invest in 10 000 more vaccinator smartphones, which will also capture a child's photo and the mother's cellphone number, enabling automatic reminders to a mother that a child is due for a vaccine scheduled near home.

The Punjab government is eager to share its technological know-how with the rest of the nation. One target area this year is remote Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [province]. And if Sindh and Baluchistan follow suit, there's every chance that Pakistan can catch up soon to the rest of the world.

[The above article is an excellent review of the challenges Pakistan has faced in the quest for polio eradication. The security issues have not been minor, and the majority of cases have occurred in areas with security challenges. The most recent bombing of a vaccination center in Quetta (Balochistan province) is a setback in security, as there was significant renewed optimism on the part of the public health sector that things were quieting down and that progress was being made on the polio eradication effort. (see http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/world/asia/pakistan-quetta-suicide-bombing-polio.html?_r=0)

There was a recent media report mentioning that a father was arrested when his 2-year-old non-vaccinated son was diagnosed with polio, and investigations revealed he would not permit vaccinators to give his son vaccine (see http://www.dawn.com/news/1158810) -- a sign that the government is very serious on the goal of polio eradication.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus -- Lao People's Democratic Republic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [17 Jan 2016], the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) of Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) notified WHO of 2 additional cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1). Both cases are from Longsane district, Xaisomboun Province.

Details of the additional cases
- The 1st new case is a 14-month-old male from Longsane district, Xaisomboun Province. He developed fever on [16 Nov 2015], progressing to hyporeflexia and asymmetric paralysis in both legs by [18 Nov 2015]. Local health authorities reported the AFP case on [19 Nov 2015]. Vaccination history indicated that the child had received 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). On [1 and 3 Dec 2015], samples of the patient were collected and shipped to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan for testing. On [21 Dec 2015], the samples tested negative for any polioviruses. However, a sample taken from his asymptomatic sister tested positive for VDPV1. The 14-month-old AFP case was classified by the National Coordination Committee as VDPV1 case based on the epidemiological link with the positive contact and also as one additional AFP case from the same district tested positive for VDPV1 indicating the plausibility of VDPV1 circulation in the area.

- The 2nd new case is a 40-year-old male from Longsane district, Xaisomboun Province. The patient presented with symptoms on [18 Dec 2015] with hyporeflexia and symmetric paralysis in both legs, but no pulmonary involvement. No fever was reported. The patient had no recent history of any nervous system disease, recent trauma, or animal or insect bites. He had not received any OPV. The Vientiane Provincial Hospital informed the Provincial Health Department of an AFP case on [21 Dec 2015] and a case investigation was conducted on the same day, including stool specimen collection. On [9 Jan 2016], NIID reported that this patient tested positive for VDPV1.

According to WHO criteria, these 2 AFP cases are therefore classified as confirmed cVDPV1 cases.

Public health response
Since the detection of the 1st confirmed cVDPV1 in Lao PDR, outbreak response activities have been conducted nationwide, including the national round in December [2015] and the affected provinces (Bolikhamxay and Xaisomboun) and a neighbouring province (Xiengkhuang). The national Emergency Operations Centre has been activated to coordinate response efforts and a polio outbreak response plan was drafted. Enhanced surveillance is occurring throughout the country, including daily zero-reporting of AFP cases. Active case finding is ongoing in high risk districts, including retrospective review of hospital and health centre records.

Six rounds with trivalent OPV vaccine have been planned from October 2015 to March 2016 (4 sub-national and 2 national) with approximately 10 million doses to be administered to children younger than 15 years. Three rounds of supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with OPV vaccine were completed in October [2015], November [2015] and the 1st nationwide round in December [2015]. The 4th round is planned for [25 Jan to 7 Feb 2016] in all 15 provinces which were targeted in December 2015 including 19 high risk districts targeting all ages. This age range was determined by the age distribution of the cases and their cVDPV1 positive contacts. Independent monitors have been recruited to assess the quality of these campaigns.

To ensure the success of SIAs, emergency risk communications and social mobilization activities, including training of mobilizers and information sessions to build trust and address barriers to immunization, are being conducted. Key messages in several languages have been developed for radio and loudspeaker to target identified communities. On [13 Jan 2016], the Prime Minister of Lao PDR declared cVDPV1 outbreak as a public health emergency.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

In November 2015, following the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), the WHO Director-General extended the Temporary Recommendations to limit the international spread of poliovirus from countries affected by cVDPVs (previously, these Recommendations had been limited to countries affected by wild poliovirus) under the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by cVDPV should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. For the latest report on the Temporary Recommendations, see related links.

[The persistence of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) in Laos is disconcerting as it is a surrogate indicator of low vaccination coverages. Equally disconcerting is the observation that this is a cVDPV type 1. With the exception of 2005 when there were 46 cases of cVDPV-1 reported in Indonesia, cVDPV-1 has been less frequently associated with cVDPV outbreaks (99 out of 803 or 12 percent of cVDPV isolates during the period 2000-2016 -- see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).

According to the Polio Eradication weekly update, as of 27 Jan 2016 there had been a total of 7 cases of cVDPV reported by Laos in 2015 (see section [3] below). It is unclear if these 2 newly confirmed cases reported in the DON above are included in the current weekly tally. As the last DON on this outbreak was 15 Dec 2015, giving the total number of cases as of that date as 5, one presumes that with the addition of these 2 new cases, the total number of cases in this current outbreak is now 7. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Lao People's Democratic Republic
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week [see section [2] above]. The most recent case was reported in Longxan district of Xaysomboune province, with onset of paralysis on [18 Nov 2015]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2015 is 7. [the table at the beginning of this section mentions the most recent date of onset as 18 Dec 2015, clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.
- An emergency outbreak response is continuing in the country, with particular focus on 3 high-risk provinces.
- Efforts continue to further strengthen surveillance activities in all provinces of the country, to assure that no cVPDV1 transmission is missed anywhere.
- Subnational Immunization Days are taking place from [26 to 31 Jan 2016]. National Immunization Days (NIDs) are also planned from [15 to 28 Feb 2016], also using tOPV. All campaigns are targeting an expanded age group of children up to the age of 15 years.

Madagascar
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015] from Sud-Ouest province. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 10.
- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset of paralysis in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.
- The focus of the outbreak response is on strengthening subnational surveillance, and filling vaccination coverage gaps.
- The emergency outbreak response continues to be intensified. National Immunization Days (NIDs) in and March and April [2016] will reach children using the trivalent oral polio vaccine.

Myanmar
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have been reported in Myanmar. The most recent reported case was isolated from a 16-month old child in Rakhine, with onset of paralysis on [5 Oct 2016]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2015 remains 2.
- The case is genetically linked to a VDPV isolated in the same village in April [2015], which has now been reclassified as a cVDPV type 2. The genetic changes in the isolate suggest the cVDPV2 has been circulating for more than a year.
- The Ministry of Health of Myanmar is being supported by WHO and partners of the GPEI in planning and implementing an urgent response to the newly detected outbreaks. Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) were carried out from [23 to 25 Jan 2016] and National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned from [20 to 22 Feb 2016], both using trivalent oral polio vaccine.
- Significant immunization gaps remain in Myanmar, with an estimated 24 percent of children un- or under-immunized. Vaccination coverage remains particularly low among special at-risk populations. AFP surveillance quality indicators are acceptable at the national level, but subnational gaps persist.
- While WHO assesses the risk of international spread from Myanmar to be low, surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2015. Three cases of WPV1 were reported in the Middle East in 2014 -- 2 in Iraq and 1 in Syria.
- The most recent WPV1 case reported from Syria had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014], while the most recent case in Iraq had onset of paralysis in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, on [7 Apr 2014].
- The extensive regional outbreak response has been successful in stopping the outbreak, although continued conflict means the population remains at risk from further importations of polio, and continued surveillance and immunization is essential.

Nigeria
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2015. Nigeria's total WPV1 case count for 2014 is 6. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis in Kwali Local Government Area (LGA), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, with onset of paralysis on 16 May [2015]; this is the only cVDPV2 case reported in Nigeria in 2015.
- Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that all children are reached with polio vaccines and that surveillance systems remains alert to polioviruses.
- Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) were carried out from [16 to 19 Jan 2016] in the south west. National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in February and March [2016], both using the trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV).

Ukraine
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2016] in the Zakarpatskaya oblast, in south-western Ukraine, bordering Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The number of cVDPV1 cases reported in 2015 remains 2.
- An assessment of the outbreak response in Ukraine, while acknowledging the efforts of Ministry of Health staff and partners, has concluded that major and rapid improvements are required in campaign quality and surveillance to ensure the outbreak is closed within 6 months.
- Ukraine had been at particular risk of emergence of a cVDPV, due to very low vaccination coverage.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are ongoing from on [25 to 29 Jan 2016] using tOPV.

West Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case in West Africa (excluding Nigeria) occurred in Tahoua province, Niger, with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in Guinea in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [2 Oct 2015] in Siguiri district, Kankan province. The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case with onset in August 2014.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) were carried out in Guinea from [25 to 28 Jan 2016] and are planned for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone in February [2016]. All campaigns are using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV).

[To date in 2016 there have been no cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) associated disease confirmed in any countries. Looking at the country by country discussions in the above global update one of the common themes is the occurrence of cVDPV associated polio cases in 2015, signalling low vaccination coverages in countries where transmission of the WPV has been apparently interrupted. (I use the word "apparently" here as there aren't discussions about environmental sampling in the countries where there haven't been WPV cases in several years and remembering the occurrence of "sporadic" cases in Kenya and Uganda that viral genetic studies suggested the virus had been circulating "silently" in the region for a year.)

To address the concerns re: cVDPV, the use of the injectable inactived poliovirus vaccine (IPV) has begun in many areas. India began the use of the vaccine in November 2015 in 17 high risk states (http://www.scidev.net/south-asia/health/news/india-rolls-out-injectable-polio-shots.html), Pakistan has begun introducing a single dose of IPV in Punjab and now FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas) (http://www.pakistanherald.com/article/9234/22-january-2016/inactivated-polio-vaccine-launched-in-fata).

In addition, the planned transition to using the bivalent OPV, eliminating the OPV2 virus -- the most commonly seen vaccine virus in cVDPV associated cases -- should impact on reducing the amount of VDPV type 2 potentially in circulation (according to figures on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website, of 803 cVDPVs associated with polio-like illness identified during the period 2000-2016, 692 or 86 percent were associated with cVDPV type 2; see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).
