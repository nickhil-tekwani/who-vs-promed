A rise in cases of infectious syphilis affecting men across Herefordshire [England] has prompted health experts to urge those at risk to get tested. NHS services and the Health Protection Agency (HPA) are investigating the rise in cases of the sexually transmitted infection, which has predominantly affected men who have sex with men.

Syphilis is infectious in its early stages and symptoms may not be immediate. Left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to many organs including the eyes, heart, and brain.

In 2011, 20 cases have been confirmed by the Gaol Street Health Centre in Hereford, compared to fewer than 5 during 2010. As a result, a dedicated men's clinic has been set up and a campaign of awareness-raising has been undertaken, including posters, flyers, and adverts on dedicated websites.

For help contact the Hereford Sexual Health Service at the Gaol Street Health Centre on 01432 378915. There is a dedicated men's walk-in clinic on Wednesday evenings from 6 pm to 7.30 pm.

[The total number of cases of syphilis (primary, secondary, and tertiary) reported annually in the United States declined dramatically in the 1940s to a low in 2000. As the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike occurred in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941.

From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate increased nationally in the United States to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm). Prior ProMED-mail posts reported an upsurge in syphilis cases in New York City (Syphilis - USA (NY) 20070814.2650) and Indianapolis (Syphilis - USA: (IN) 20080826.2668) that centered on gay men. In New York City, the syphilis outbreak was associated with an increase in cases among women, who may have been having sex with bisexual men. Infectious syphilis in women can be followed by an increase in neonatal syphilis.

Ulcerative sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis increase transmission and acquisition of HIV infection sexually. There is an estimated 2- to 5-fold increased risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to that infection when syphilis is present (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm).

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue", which appears to limit effective condom use and to result in high-risk sexual behavior associated with use of "club" drugs, such as methamphetamines, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Ecstasy, and ketamine, which can also lead to unsafe sex with multiple partners (http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/Clubdrugs.html). Syphilis increases have occurred among MSM who have met sex partners in internet chat rooms (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm).

However, the current syphilis outbreak in Herefordshire among MSM is not fully characterized in the news report above as to, for example, HIV-co-infection, the use of drugs, or the use of the internet to meet sex partners, and requires a detailed epidemiologic investigation so that preventive measures can be targeted to specific high-risk activities.

Herefordshire is a mostly rural and sparsely populated county in the West Midlands region of England (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herefordshire). It borders Wales to the west. Hereford is the county town, with a population of about 55 800. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of England can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1NjK. - Mod.ML]
