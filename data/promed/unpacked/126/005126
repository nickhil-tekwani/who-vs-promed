New US soybean virus arrives in Ontario
---------------------------------------
A relatively new disease in soybeans has officially made the jump into southwestern Ontario from the US, according to provincial specialists.

Albert Tenuta, Ontario's agriculture ministry, said that infections with soybean vein necrosis virus (SVNV) have been confirmed in soybean plants collected in Kent and Elgin counties. "There is not a lot known about SVNV and many questions need to be answered before we get a better understanding of the potential impact of this new disease in Ontario."

It's most likely, however, that the virus has been present in soybeans for years and has been misdiagnosed, Tenuta said. The symptoms look very similar to conditions such as cercospora leaf blight, scald (sunburn), and plant stress response.

SVNV was first identified in Tennessee in 2008 [ProMED-mail post 20100922.3430] and has since been reported in at least 15 states [of the USA]. Purdue University, which recently confirmed the disease in Indiana, said the severity of the symptoms in affected plants "appears to be variety-dependent" and noted symptoms may also be confused with injury from herbicides. "At this point in time we do not recommend that growers change soybean production practices in response to detection of SVNV."

[A previously unknown virus was first identified in Tennessee in 2008 and in Illinois and Kentucky in 2009 (see ProMED-mail post 20100922.3430) as the cause of a new disease of soybeans. Symptoms observed included vein clearing that becomes necrotic as leaves mature leading to large necrotic regions on leaves and reduced plant vigour.

The name Soybean vein necrosis(-associated) virus (SVNV/SVNaV) was suggested and preliminary classification placed it in the genus _Tospovirus_. However, it has minimal similarity to previously characterised members of the genus and is now included in a new clade, together with the new Bean necrotic mosaic virus (ProMED-mail post 20120830.1271798). SVNV was found to affect a range of soybean cultivars and may be widespread in parts of the US, but this is the 1st report outside that country. No information is available yet on its presence in other countries.

Tospoviruses (type member _Tomato spotted wilt virus_, TSWV) are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of infecting a large range of crops. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips species which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs and tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, and use of resistant crop cultivars.
