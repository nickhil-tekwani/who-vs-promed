Agency were H5N1 positive, with confirmation by Community Reference
Laboratory Weybridge [UK}.
Measures: Since 19 Feb 2006, the entire country is defined as a "risk

measures, and prohibition of bird markets according to
EU-legislation. Protection and surveillance zones have been
established around the reservoir. Other suspicious bird deaths
occurred in the Federal Provinces of Steiermark (district Hartberg),

Unfortunately, the Austrian notification does not specify the exact
geographic location, the swan species involved or their number. It
would also help to know whether these are sedentary or migratory
birds. - Mod.AS]

Factbox: bird flu in Europe, 20 Feb 2006
----------------------------------------
European governments have sought to calm consumer fears as they take
action to limit the spread of bird flu.
The following is the latest information about the status of bird flu
and some measures taken in Europe:
AUSTRIA: Austria found 2 cases of H5N1 near Vienna, raising the total
number of cases there to 7 and prompting a nationwide order to
confine poultry indoors.
BOSNIA: Bosnia banned hunting of wild fowl, ordered all poultry to be
kept indoors and banned imports of live birds and poultry products
from Slovenia, Italy, Greece and Bulgaria. Bosnia reported its 1st
suspected case of avian influenza in 2 swans, but further tests will
show whether it is H5N1.
BULGARIA: Bulgaria announced that H5N1 had been found in a wild swan
in a wetland region near Romania. On 16 Feb 2006, the EU banned
imports of poultry and products from Bulgaria.
FRANCE: France said it had found H5N1 in a dead wild duck in the east
of the country. It has extended its ban on keeping poultry outside to
the whole of the country and has said that 900 000 birds would be
vaccinated against bird flu.
GERMANY: Germany began a ban on keeping poultry outdoors last Friday
[17 Feb 2006]. The next day, 2 dead birds were confirmed with H5N1 on
Germany's mainland after previously being confined to its Baltic Sea
island of Ruegen, where over 75 dead wild birds were infected with
the H5N1 strain.
GREECE: Greece said a wild goose found on the Aegean island of Skyros
had tested positive for H5N1, the 4th migratory bird to be discovered
with the strain. Industry officials said poultry sales had fallen 95
percent since Saturday [18 Feb 2006].
ITALY: Italian poultry producers said demand for chicken meat has
plummeted by 70 percent since news that H5N1 virus had been found in
swans in the south of the country.
NETHERLANDS: The Netherlands extended its order to keep poultry
indoors to the whole country.
NORWAY: Norway ordered farmers to keep chickens and turkeys indoors.
ROMANIA: Romania said it had found new cases of H5N1 in poultry found
dead close to the Black Sea port of Constanta. Romania has found bird
flu [in] over 30 villages since 1st detecting the virus last October
[2005].
RUSSIA: President Vladimir Putin told the government to take measures
to prevent a new outbreak. Russia has been battling with bird flu in
poultry since July [2005], culling more than 600 000 domestic fowl,
but no human infection has occurred.
SLOVENIA: Tests have confirmed a dead swan found in Slovenia had died
of H5N1. The bird was found less than 10 km (6 miles) from the
Austrian border. Slovenia has ordered the confinement of all poultry.
SWEDEN: Sweden ordered farmers to keep chickens and turkeys indoors.
Birds should also not be allowed to drink from water where migratory
birds might appear.
SWITZERLAND: Switzerland ordered a nationwide poultry lock-up.
TURKEY: The WHO has confirmed 12 cases of human H5N1 infection, with
4 deaths, in Turkey since it reported its 1st case last October 2005.
UKRAINE: Officials in the Crimean peninsula said they had detected
new cases of bird flu among wild birds in the port of Sevastopol.
More than 200 000 birds have been destroyed in Ukraine since H5N1 was
discovered in a dozen villages in northeastern Crimea last year
[2005].

[4] Palestinian authority (Gaza strip), suspected

Bird flu may have reached Gaza Strip
------------------------------------
Is bird flu approaching Israel? After Iran, India, and Egypt, the
virus has been discovered, it is suspected, in the Gaza Strip. A
chicken farm in northern Gaza has reported that 300 chickens have
died.
The Palestinian health ministry sent monitors to the area in order to
take lab samples from the chickens and to determine whether bird flu
is in fact involved.
Chicken farmer Ahmed Abu Halub told Ynet: "Strange things have
happened in my market in recent days. A number of days ago, I found
50 dead chickens. 2 days ago the number reached 100 chickens,
yesterday 150, and the number now [20 Feb 2006?] is 300."
Abu Halub says he does not know whether it is bird flu or another
disease striking down his chickens. "It's not a natural situation,
the chickens are not eating and not drinking and they're barely
walking."
As someone who raised 6000 chickens, Abu Halub fears the outbreak of
bird flu and its consequences.
The PA [Palestinian Authority] has checked a number of outbreaks of the
disease, but have not been able to confirm that bird flu is behind the
occurrences.

[The above description is not very reminiscent of HPAI, which is generally
characterized by a more acute course and higher death rates. The alert is in
place. Results of laboratory investigations will be welcomed.

[translated from Hebrew by Mod.ARN, abridged, edited]

The following data on the current Egyptian outbreak, based upon
the Egyptian press, are brought forward in the Israeli Daily Yediot
Aharonoth:
2 million (domestic) birds have, reportedly, already been culled. The disease
has been recorded in 7 governorates [provinces]. The movement of poultry
between the governorates has been banned and trucks prohibited from entering
Sinai and Sharm-el-Sheikh. Even though the price of poultry meat has plummeted
to USD 0.20 - 0.70 per kilogram, customers stay away. The Ministry of Defense
has been recruited to assist in the control operations.
