The National Veterinary Services ordered blood samples to be taken at
a 7-day interval from the largest herds of susceptible animals in the
villages within the Tsarevo, Malko Tarnovo, and Sredets
municipalities. The number of samples from the villages is defined in
accordance with 5 percent prevalence of the disease and 95 percent
confidence of the results. From 8 to 10 Feb 2011, the 1st sampling in
the Tsarevo and Sredets municipalities was completed. The sampling in
Malko Tarnovo municipality will be carried out from 15 to 17 Feb
2011.

In addition, blood samples were taken according to 5 percent
prevalence of the disease and 95 percent confidence from susceptible
animals in settlements (Strandja, Krainovo, Lesovo [Yambol region] and
Matochina [Haskovo region]) located near the Turkish border and
belonging to regions described in Annex II to the 2011/44/EC Decision
in Yambol and Haskovo [see comment 1].

All tested animals were negative for FMD.
For surveillance purposes, 434 blood samples have been taken from 11
