Germany's medical authority said Friday [7 Mar 2008] it has recalled
a locally produced version of the blood thinner heparin believed to
be linked to contaminated ingredients from China after 80 patients
suffered adverse reactions.

Axel Thiele, a spokesman for the Federal Institute for Drugs and
Medical Devices, told The Associated Press the drug, produced by
RotexMedica GmbH, was pulled from the market Wednesday night [5 Mar
2008] after 80 patients suffered shortness of breath, low blood
pressure and episodes of an overly rapid heartbeat. No one taking the
drug in Germany has died, he said, and no other drug companies'
products are involved.

"We have indications that after taking heparin, some, sometimes quite
serious, side effects have occurred," Thiele said, adding that most
patients who suffered a reaction were undergoing dialysis treatment.

The German institute said it believes the complications suffered by
the German patients are derived from possibly contaminated
ingredients imported from China, the world's leading source of
heparin. What kind of contaminant could be involved, however, was not
known, it said, noting that the drug's chemical makeup is very
difficult to decipher.

The only version of the drug that seems to be triggering a reaction
in Germany so far is an inexpensive, less highly processed form,
Thiele said. A more heavily processed form of heparin appeared not to
be affected.

A different brand of heparin produced in the USA has been linked to
19 deaths there, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA urged all USA suppliers of heparin to start using high-tech
tests to make sure their products are free of a contaminant that is
the prime suspect for hundreds of allergic-type reactions linked to
Baxter International Inc.'s USA-sold heparin injections.

[The heparin is from a different company but is from China and it is
likely that the reactions are related to the same contaminant as the
USA cases. - Mod.LL]
