I. LDRC: CDC finds less Lyme but more tickborne diseases in a California
community
----------------------------------------------------------------
Reprinted from the Lyme Times, Number 19, November / December 1997
The headline in the January 10, 1995, Sonoma Index-Tribune proclaimed,
"Community A [name changed] not a hot spot for tickborne Lyme disease" - and
the community breathed a sigh of relief. But was it really such good news?
A recently completed CDC research study found that almost one quarter of the
study participants had tested positive for at least one of three tickborne
diseases. And if the humans weren't testing positive for Lyme disease in
great numbers, an astounding 37% & the local dogs did - but then the dogs
were not subjected to the rigid two tier Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) testing protocol, and when dogs get sick, no one calls them
hypochondriacs.
Approximately 450 residents live in the semirural community in Sonoma County
in northern California, and 230 participated in the serologic study.
Fifty-one tested positive for one or more of three tickborne disease agents:
Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis. Half of the children in the
study tested positive. Researchers from the CDC along with University of
California scientists and health department personnel report the results in
the June issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases. (1)
The Sonoma study was initiated by a local mother and horse-owner Susie
Merrill. She had participated in a Lyme disease study of her neighborhood,
working with state and county biologists to trap rodents and drag for ticks.
She conducted a phone survey and marked suspected Lyme disease cases,
including on her map dogs that had tested positive for Lyme disease.
Merrill's son had been diagnosed with Lyme disease in 1991, and had not
totally recovered after treatment. Several of Merrill's horses and her dog
had also been diagnosed with ehrlichiosis. Merrill began to wonder if
chronic Lyme disease really was the cause of her son's continuing headaches
and other symptoms. Maybe ehrlichiosis was the culprit. Perhaps it was
responsible for the chronic symptoms of some of her neighbors, too. At the
time, ehrlichiosis was not thought to infect humans.
Merrill went back to the phone and called the neighbors again. As she
collected information, she became convinced that more than one tickborne
disease was being diagnosed as Lyme disease. When she plotted the cases of
ehrlichiosis on her map, she noticed that sick people seemed to be clustered
near infected animals - but the animals were infected with ehrlichiosis, not
Lyme.
Merrill's initial entreaties to public health agencies to investigate the
situation in her community fell on deaf ears. For the next two years, she
badgered health officials, enlisting the support of her senators and
congresspeople with a barrage of letters. Finally the CDC agreed to assist
the state and county health agencies in conducting a study.
The published results now suggest that Merrill's hunch was correct. Samples
from 23% of the residents were seroreactive to antigens from one or more
tickborne disease agents: 1.4% to _Borrelia burgdorferi_, 0.4% to _Ehrlichia
equi_, 4.6% to _Ehrlichia chaffeenis_, and 17.8% to the Babesia-like
piroplasm WA1.
Some scientists are raising questions about the study conclusions, however.
The incidence of Babesia is very high, raising suspicions about the test,
which is quite new. Then the researchers report an incidence of Lyme disease
barely over the 1% generally considered as background seropositivity in a
control group. Serosurveys in endemic areas have typically reported much
higher incidences. An epidemiologic study of a community in Mendocino County
found 24% of the inhabitants had positive Lyme disease tests. (2) Many were
symptomatic at the time and more have developed symptoms since, including
psychosis and pancarditis. Later tests of that community also showed two
percent positive for babesiosis, an unrecognized human disease in this area
at the time of the original serosurvey (unreported data).
The results of the Sonoma dog study are intriguing, also, although the dog
data were not included in the present study. If the same ticks were biting
both dogs and humans, it is curious that such a low percentage of humans
were apparently acquiring the Lyme disease bacterium, when, judging by the
ehrlichiosis and babesiosis figures, many of them were in fact being bitten
by ticks. The dog sera were tested by Rance LeFebvre, PhD, at the University
of California laboratory in Davis.
Initially, community residents had to pass a screening blood test before
being allowed to participate in the study. This blood test, an ELISA, has
been criticized for its lack of, sensitivity, i.e. many true cases of Lyme
disease test negative. According to the College of American Pathologists
Proficiency Testing Program, which receives samples from every laboratory in
the United States, current screening tests are inadequate. In a paper
published in March, researchers concluded that "the sensitivity and
specificity of the currently used tests [ELISA or IFA] for Lyme disease are
not adequate to meet the two-tier approach being recommended [by the CDC].
Ideally a screen test should have a high degree of sensitivity (>95%)." The
data showed that the sensitivity of the ELISAs fluctuated between 75 and
93%. (3)
Further, participants who may have been seronegative were not counted,
although the researchers acknowledge that they may have existed in the
population sample. Several investigators have estimated seronegativity in
both early or chronic Lyme disease at 17 to 29.4% of patients. (4)(5)(6) The
low figure for Lyme disease reported in the present study may be partly
attributable to the use of the restrictive CDC testing criteria, which were
intended for surveillance purposes and not for clinical diagnosis. It may
also be related to the study's use of the B31 strain of _Borrelia
burgdorferi_ used as antigen, although the researchers claim to have
observed no difference in the interpretation of reactivity. The Mendocino
study found a 20% discrepancy between sera tested B31 and CA5 when people
infected with the California strain were tested against the B31 Shelter
Island, NY, strain, and vice versa. (7)
After the study was underway, Merrill complained in a letter to Dr. Duc
Vugia, study collaborator and Chief of the Disease Investigations and
Surveillance Branch at California Department of Health Services, that many
of her neighbors had had a positive test for Lyme disease in the past, but
not in this study. They had also responded to treatment for Lyme disease.
She was concerned that these people had Lyme disease but were being dropped
from the study since they did not meet the entry criteria.
CDC principal investigator Curtis Fritz didn't see it that way. At an
interview after one of the community meetings for participants, he assured
residents, "Ninety-five percent of the people who have been diagnosed with
late Lyme disease but with negative antibody tests in fact have never had
Lyme disease." He also claimed that the CDC test was much better than those
of commercial laboratories. In a recent controversial paper, the CDC
reported a 100% sensitivity, 89% specificity of their in-house ELISA test,
exceeding previously reported standards. (8)
People who passed the first screening test had additionally to pass a second
test, the Western Blot, in order to be considered positive for Lyme disease.
This test is sensitive, but the official criteria for a positive are very
restrictive, and are still being debated in medical circles.
Dr. [Nick] Harris, president of IGeneX, a laboratory in Palo Alto,
California, which specializes in Lyme disease testing, points out that
different patterns of reactivity and levels of antibody may be seen in
confirmed Lyme disease cases, but these were not considered in the study.
Other experts feel that it is premature to apply such restrictive criteria
to a disease whose clinical spectrum is still being defined. Many agree
standards used for surveillance are not appropriate for clinical diagnosis.
No physical examinations were done to corroborate serologies, no attempt was
made to gather additional serologic data on people who were symptomatic but
ELISA negative, and no Western blots were obtained on ELISA-negative people,
although some investigators have found Western Blot positive/ELISA negative
patients.(9)(10)
In addition, the questionnaire utilized in the study instructed participants
to skip over questions about symptoms if they had not been diagnosed with
Lyme disease. "Even if people previously had symptoms of Lyme disease, some
have never been diagnosed with it, so they would have skipped these
questions," claims Merrill.
This study assumed a low (1 to 2%) infection rate among ticks found in the
neighborhood. While this figure reflects early assessments of adult ticks in
California, it is at variance with newer reports on _Ixodes pacificus_
nymphs, which are considered to be the main vectors of Lyme disease to
humans. Some parts of Mendocino and Sonoma Counties have a reported nymphal
tick infection rate as high as 14%. (11)
Dr. Fritz tried to mitigate public fears by assuring people that
seronegative late Lyme disease after treatment is a rare phenomenon and that
the chances of acquiring a tickborne disease are low. Some residents of the
Sonoma community accepted his assurances, while others did not. Some worried
that the neighborhood would be labeled as a Lyme disease hot spot, adversely
affecting real estate values.
Since the early l980s, over 1400 cases meeting the strict CDC case
surveillance definition have been reported from California. This figure is
artificially low even for surveillance because many physicians do not bother
to report their cases since they will not meet the case definition
anyway.(12) In addition, many West Coast physicians still deny even the
possibility of Lyme disease thinking of it as an East Coast disease, in
spite of the fact that biologists with the California Department of Health
have found the vector in all but two of the California counties, and
infected ticks in more than half of those.(13)
This new study opens anew the debate about the risk of acquiring a tickborne
disease in northern California. The Sonoma study concluded, "The risk of
infection with these emerging tickborne diseases may be greater than
previously recognized... particularly in children." (14)
