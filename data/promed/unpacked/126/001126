In response to your request for information on this case reported to WHO:
This case was a 33-year-old man holidaying (1 week) in a well-known
resort area in Bali, Indonesia. He had onset of profuse watery
diarrhea on 13 Feb 2004, and returned to Perth, Western Australia on
16 Feb. He had an uncomplicated course and did not require
hospitalization, and has subsequently cleared the organism (serogroup
01).
His wife, who travelled (and ate) with him, was not ill and screening
stools were negative.
Thousands of Australians holiday in Bali every year. There have been
no other cholera cases reported in Australians returning from Bali,
to my knowledge, in recent months, although at least one sporadic
case was reported a couple of years ago.
