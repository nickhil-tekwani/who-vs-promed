The coffee region is declared free of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
---------------------------------------------
Once again, the fight against foot and mouth disease in Colombia has
received very important international support, and this will transform
stockbreeding, particularly now that the Free Trade Agreement with the US
is about to be signed. Both meat and dairy products will occupy a
privileged place among the agricultural products to be exported.
Last week in Paris, an ad hoc group appointed by the International Office
for Epizootic Diseases (OIE), as well as its Technical Commission -- the
topmost animal sanitation authority in the world -- approved 2 new areas in
Colombia that will be officially recognized as free of foot and mouth
disease in May 2005.
The 1st area is in the central part of the country and extends from the
current free area, including the southern part of Santander; Caldas,
Quindio, and Risaralda departments; central-southern part of Choco, the
northern parts of Tolima and del Valle; and the middle course of the
Magdalena river in Antioquia, Boyac� and Cundinamarca.
The 2nd recognized area comprises the southeast part of Colombian
territory, including Amazonas, Guaviare, Vaupes, and Guainia departments,
as well as the eastern part of Caquet�. Therefore, 55 percent of Colombia
has been declared free of foot and mouth disease, as well as 62 percent of
Colombian livestock.
With the recognition of these 2 new zones, Colombia now has 5 regions free
of FMD: 1) Uraba in Choco, 2) The North, including the Atlantic coast,
Antioquia, and 7 communities in Caldas, 3) The Santander area, comprising
northern and central parts of southern Santander, 4) the southern parts of
Cesar and Bolivar departments; and 5) the Necocli community in Antioquia.
The 4th and 5th zones are the ones that have been declared free of the
disease this week.
This new achievement of the Colombian stockbreeding industry represents an
enormous advance towards the competitiveness of Colombian meat and dairy
products; and it is also a significant step towards modernization of the
Colombian stockbreeding industry, which is currently the main goal pursued
by the Colombian Stockbreeders Federation (FEDEGAN).
When emphasizing this good news for Colombia, and particularly for its
stockbreeding industry, the Chairman of FEDEGAN, Mr. Jose Felix
Lafaurie-Rivera, said that "this is very good news for Colombia,
particularly for its stockbreeding industry, since, in addition to
supporting the competitiveness of our meat and dairy products, it is an
acknowledgement of the modernization efforts of the stockbreeding industry".
Mr. Lafaurie explained that the Colombian stockbreeding industry, supported
by achievements such as these 2 new regions declared free of FMD, now is
positioned as one of the most promising stockbreeding industries in the
world, since it now complies with conditions currently favored by the most
important markets: the production is a natural pasture-based process, with
excellent genetics, and it also has a good sanitary conditions, certified
by international sanitary authorities.
He also emphasized the importance of teamwork between the stockbreeding
industry, the Agriculture Ministry, and the Colombian Farming Institute,
which is the national authority for the stockbreeding industry; so this is
a successful example of coordination between public and private sectors.
Finally, Mr. Lafaurie paid a special tribute to all Colombian farmers and
to their regional organizations, who are responsible for the success of the
vaccination program. "Without the willingness of Colombian farmers to
modernize their business, nothing would be possible. This is why we must
continue to believe in a livestock sector that is more modern, more
productive, more profitable, and more committed to its social role, to
benefit Colombia and its people."
