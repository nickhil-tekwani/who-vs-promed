We have attempted to confirm the above-referenced report of an
outbreak of 600 fatal cases of JE in Cambodia. Our latest
information is that 600 is the cumulative total for 1998.
Since the case fatality rate of untreated JE may be 10% (or more),
this indicates a considerable incidence of the disease, even if it
was distributed throughout the year rather than concentrated in an
epidemic.
