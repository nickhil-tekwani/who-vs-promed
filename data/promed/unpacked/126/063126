Mumps cases suspected at Northeastern University
------------------------------------------------
A total of 4 Northeastern University students have suspected cases of
mumps, Boston public health officials announced today [16 Apr 2009],
and they urged any unvaccinated students and staff to get immunized
against this once-common childhood illness.

Though laboratory results are not yet back to confirm these as mumps
cases, Dr. Anita Barry, director of infectious diseases at the Boston
Public Health Commission, said the 4 students -- 2 of whom just
returned from Ireland where there was a recent mumps outbreak -- have
symptoms that are consistent with mumps. Given the relative ease with
which this illness can be spread, she said, "it's likelly we'll see
more cases."

Mumps is caused by a virus that is spread through infected
respiratory tract secretions, and people typically catch it by being
within 3 to 6 feet of an infected person who coughs or sneezes.
However, it is difficult to tell whether someone is infectious or
not. Barry said people are generally considered to be infectious from
3 days before until 5 days after the onset of swelling of the
salivary glands. She said most infected people often feel sick for a
few days with low-grade fever and "look like chipmunks." The
incubation period for mumps is usually 16 to 18 days, meaning it
takes that long for symptoms to appear after someone has been exposed
to the virus. But as many as one in 3 people infected with the mumps
virus show nosymptoms at all. Serious complications are rare with
mumps, but it has been known in rare cases to cause hearing loss in children.

The mumps vaccine doesn't always protect against the illness. Barry
said all 4 sick Northeastern students have medical records showing
that they had the 2 recommended doses of mumps vaccine. Barry said
roughly 10 or 20 percent of those who receive the mumps vaccine are
still vulnerable to the illness.

[It is somewhat surprising that the all 4 affected students at
Northeastern University had ben properly vaccinated, although it is
known that vaccine-induced protection may wane in a small proportion
of individuals (M.M.Cortese et al., Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Apr
15;46(8): 1172-80).

It is not surprising, however, that these students were exposed to
mumps infection during a stay in Ireland. According to The Dublin
City University College View of 21 Mar 2009
(<http://www.thecollegeview.com/2009/03/21/mumps-outbreak-hitting-colleges/>)
an outbreak of mumps across Ireland is affecting students worst. It
is reported that there have been over 800 cases of mumps throughout
colleges all over Ireland this year (2009). That's up from well under
100 at the same time last year. 14 people have been admitted into
hospital this year with the viral illness.

Mumps has been on the increase in Ireland since last year [2008], and
there is currently an extensive outbreak among students in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland (see:
<http://www.hpsc.ie/hpsc/News/MainBody,3484,en.html> and ProMED-mail
references below), as well as in the the Republic of Ireland (see:

Surveillance Centre (Republic of Ireland). [online] [10 Mar 2009]). - Mod.CP]
