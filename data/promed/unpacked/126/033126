The Florida Department of Health says 4 children who were diagnosed with measles were never vaccinated.

The health agency says the children in Sarasota County on Florida's Gulf Coast had close contact with each other but didn't elaborate further.

The Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports that health officials are trying to notify others who may have been exposed.

Federal officials declared the contagious virus had been eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. But infections periodically occur nationwide, as the virus is still common in many other parts of the world. Travelers can bring measles into the country, where it can spread among people who are not vaccinated.

[2] USA: New York (Rockland County): ongoing outbreak

A third of the people who have contracted measles during the recent Rockland outbreak are under the age of 3; 15 are younger than 1 year old. A total of 3 people who contracted measles had been fully vaccinated.

"It happens," said Dr. Debra Blog, the New York State Health Department's director for the Division of Epidemiology. "The vaccine is 97 percent effective, so 3 percent of the time it fails."

So when measles comes into a community, everyone is vulnerable. The overwhelming majority, more than 84 percent of cases, are among people with zero immunity, health officials said. That means they haven't had the usual 2 MMR shots, given at age 18 months and then around age 4, before a kid enters school.

Health officials gave out free measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccines to residents at the Palisades Center on [Tue 11 Dec 2018]. There are currently 91 measles cases in the county and 8 under investigation, and officials said the Best Buy at the Palisades Center was one of the sites recently visited by a measles infected person.

Rockland's measles tally is at 91, but 5 more cases in Orange County are counted in these numbers, because they emanated from Rockland, state Health Department officials confirmed. Health officials say the measles cases have shown up in people from infancy to age 62.

This is why the current outbreak remains front-and-center for state health officials, including state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker. State health officials from Albany and metro regional offices are in Rockland weekly; officials, including Zucker, participate in a daily conference call with Rockland and Orange health officials.

And it's why health officials have taken the unusual step of recommending an early vaccine for babies over 6 months old, even though it means they are telling people who may be resistant to vaccinations to give their child 3 shots rather than the standard 2.

The Rockland outbreak has been, by far, the largest in the state for decades. "This is huge," said Blog, who has worked in epidemiology for the state for 20 years.

In this particular outbreak, the early cases are in people who are part of the Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish community around New Square, Monsey and Spring Valley. The Orange County cases, first announced on [21 Nov 2019], were linked to a Rockland visitor to Kiryas Joel. But the measles cases reach beyond those geographical boundaries.

The concept of a large outbreak here wasn't shocking to New York health officials. They had been preparing for cases as measles spread worldwide. The World Health Organization recently announced that cases of measles rose 30 percent last year [2017]. Regions in European countries like Ukraine, Belgium and England and areas in Israel had been hit especially hard, with lower inoculation rates fed by vaccination suspicions. There was also a lack of knowledge about the risks from measles, because it had been largely eliminated.

Especially as the Jewish holidays approached this fall and international travelers would head here for the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot, the state Health Department started public outreach.

A radio campaign that targeted New York's Orthodox community was already running when the Rockland outbreak began. Health officials were notified of 4 separate exposures among sick travelers from Israel. The first Rockland case was reported around [1 Oct 2018]. The radio campaign quickly shifted to include: "Measles is in your community."

The state produced 45 000 door hangers, with English on one side and Yiddish on the other, to place on doorknobs in communities with ZIP codes having the most exposures. They have placed notices in Jewish publications. The information is now going out in Spanish and Kreyol as well, because every community could be impacted.

"Our message is being heard," said Adrienne Mazeau, the state Health Department's deputy director of the Office of Public Health, during a conference call with Albany officials on [Wed 12 Dec 2018]. "We have had over 11 000 kids being vaccinated."

So far, some 11 100 doses of the MMR vaccine have been given through county-offered vaccine clinics like one held on [Tue 11 Dec 2018] afternoon at the Palisades Center, which vaccinated 47 people, as well as health centers and local pediatricians' offices.

As the state continues to work with Rockland and Orange County health officials, their overall message is clear: Measles does not discriminate.

Rockland County held its 12th measles vaccination clinic in Rockland County on [Tue 11 Dec 2018] in an effort to stop the spread of the highly contagious disease.

Rockland health officials say a total of 91 cases have been reported in the county since the outbreak started back in September [2018].

[...] The outbreak of the disease was traced back to an international traveler who carried the disease from Israel to Rockland. It quickly spread within the Hasidic Jewish community, which typically has large gatherings.

Rockland officials say the cases are in clusters in New Square, Spring Valley and Monsey.

The county says a total of 11 100 MMR vaccines have been given by the Department of Health and local doctors.

[4] USA imported cases

A new retrospective analysis of imported measles cases in the United States from 2001 to 2016 shows that almost two thirds of cases occurred in US residents who were infected with the virus while traveling abroad, and the rate of imported measles have more than doubled in recent years. The study appeared yesterday [Sun 9 Dec 2018] in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

During the 16-year study period, 553 cases of measles were imported to the United States, an average of 28 per year, based on data collected by the CDC. Patients' ages ranged from 3 months to 75 years, with a median age of 18 years; 87% of the 553 case-patients were unvaccinated.

"U.S. residents (as opposed to foreign visitors) accounted for 62% of imported measles cases. Overall, 62% of all imported case-patients reported travel to countries in the Western Pacific and European Regions of the World Health Organization during their exposure periods," the authors said. India, China, and the Philippines, were the most common source countries.

The proportion of imported cases in US residents more than doubled during the study period, from 31% in 2001 to 67% in 2016. The study authors said this finding highlights the importance of measles vaccination prior to international travel for all Americans 6 months of age and older.

A 3-year-old boy died from measles at Odesa City Infectious Diseases Hospital, as Dumskaya reported.

He became the 3rd child in Odesa, who died from this disease in 2018. In total, 4 residents of Odesa died from measles.

Preliminarily, a child got infected in the regional children's clinical hospital, where he was treated after being diagnosed with bronchitis. When his state deteriorated, the doctors diagnosed pneumonia and sent the child to the infectious diseases hospital (there is a note in a medical history that the boy contacted with people infected with measles). Later, the boy was discharged but his state deteriorated in 5 days. The child was hospitalized in the infectious diseases hospital again. He also contacted with the possible carrier of measles.

According to his mother, the doctor explained the contact with an ill child by accident.

"He recommended giving him injections of immunoglobulin to prevent the infection. When he was discharged, he ran, moved. On [1 Dec 2018], he had fever and workers of the hospital said it looked like [he was] falling ill with measles. I gave him the prescribed medicines in the morning. He immediately felt bad. I told doctors but they said that it was ok, just consequences of measles," she said. Despite the fact that the child began to eat the night before, he died at night.

[...] Earlier, 45 school students and a pregnant teacher got sick with measles in Rukshyna village, Chernivtsi region, southwestern Ukraine. Later, it turned out that the majority of the affected were not vaccinated.

Besides, 28 children got sick with measles in one of the Vinnytsia region's schools. The measles outbreak is related to the fact that parents refuse to vaccinate their children.

The number of cases of measles in January-September 2018 has increased 17 times in comparison with the same period of time in 2017

[6] UK: ongoing outbreak
Date: Tue 11 Dec 2018

https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/17286773.dr-zak-uddin-rise-in-measles-deaths-is-a-worrying-trend/


Although previously declared measles free by the World Health Organisation, the UK experienced an outbreak of the disease in 2018, with 913 confirmed cases, compared to 259 in 2017. The majority of these were in those who had not received 2 courses of the MMR vaccination.

One third needed admitting to hospital. Across Europe as a whole, there were 41 000 cases and sadly 37 deaths in the 1st 6 months of 2018, the highest figures in the last decade.

[Measles] is highly contagious; if 100 non-immunised people were exposed to measles, 90 would catch it. [...] In those whose immune systems are not fully developed, namely children under 5, or individuals with another major illness, complications can range from pneumonia to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). These can be fatal. A rare complication of measles is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which develops many years after the initial infection, yet causes progressive and devastating destruction of the person's nervous system.

A vaccination programme has existed since 1968, and its uptake has demonstrably saved millions of lives in the last 5 decades.

The current UK vaccination schedule provides immunisation against Measles, Mumps and Rubella combined, in 2 injections, one at 12--13 months of age and another at 3 years and 4 months. It is entirely free, yet it is not compulsory unlike in some other countries, for example the United States.

Several reasons exist as to the drop off in vaccination uptake, including research linking it to autism and bowel disease, which has since been completely discredited.

At the same time, fewer people today in developed nations will have had first-hand experience of measles.

There are not many reasons why your child, or indeed you yourself shouldn't be immunised, if you haven't been already. Life threatening allergic reaction to any of the components is the strongest reason, and if you are pregnant you should wait until after delivery.

Attempting to acquire immunity naturally is more risky than getting vaccinated with a greater risk of developing complications. Success of a vaccination programme also requires a high uptake, with an estimated 95% needed to cover those who cannot be immunised for to definite reasons. [...]

A total of 5 people working in the Samara hypermarket "Lenta" contracted measles in November--December this year [2018].

This was reported by the head of the regional Department of Rospotrebnadzor, Svetlana Arkhipova, said TASS. According to her, they are all employees of the hypermarket located in the shopping center "Aurora".

According to preliminary information, the 1st patients used to travel to Dagestan for personal reasons. In connection with the incident, the Mall carried out a complex of anti-epidemic measures. In addition, more than 350 employees of the "Aurora" were vaccinated.

In turn, the head of the Department of organization of medical aid of Ministry of health of the Samara region Ilya Sirota stressed that we are talking about a group scenario, rather than the measles outbreak. Doctors have written out from hospital 2 cases, he said.

Measles is an infectious viral disease that is transmitted by airborne droplets. Regional CPS said that for the first 10 months of this year [2018] in the Samara region there were 13 cases. In 2017--2016 years there was not a single case.
