[This 6th case of ASF in China is located in Jiamusi, northeast Heilongjiang province. "Jiamusi has previously been identified as the origin of pigs found to be infected with the disease when they reached a slaughterhouse in Zhengzhou [Henan province] last month (August 2018)" https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2018/sep/05/china-reports-new-swine-fever-outbreak-in-heilongjiang-province/. That information was covered in ProMED-mail postings 20180817.5969883 and 20180819.5975008.

In addition to this new reported event, since early August to date (5 Sep 2018), China also continues to have 5 active events of ASF. The situation for each of these ASF events is as follows:

1. ASF Liaoning: event started 1 Aug 2018; date of notification 3 Aug 2018; 1 outbreak reported, and the event still continuing. See event summary and updated map: <www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27442>

2. ASF Henan: event started 14 Aug; date of notification 16 Aug; outbreak reported, and the event still continuing. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27568

3. ASF Jiangsu: event started 15 Aug 2018; date of notification 19 Aug 2018; 2 outbreaks reported, and the event still continuing. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27598

4. ASF Zhejiang: event started 17 Aug 2018; date of notification 23 Aug 2018; 1 outbreak reported, and the event still continuing. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27636

An assessment for China's ASF situation, authored by DEFRA (UK) experts and updated 3 Sep 2018, is available at https://tinyurl.com/ydc2mn5u. The document includes a map, presenting the 6 provinces from which official ASF reports have been submitted to the OIE. Please note that the 2nd outbreak in the province Jiangsu is not yet indicated on the map.

The assessments concluding remarks are:

"The distances between the different infected farms (many hundreds of kms) and the time between the reports (just 4 weeks) does suggest that [the] infection has been present for some time and this is unlikely to be due to wild boar. In Europe, where ASF has been present since 2007 when 1st introduced into Georgia, it is accepted that when wild boar is infected, their natural range and the high mortality rate means they don't move disease long distances, but they could be responsible for long term establishment (as carcasses are not removed and environmental contamination occurs). When the disease "jumps" long distances, this is because of the movement of live pigs or infected / contaminated products.

"The high density of pigs in China, in particular the high percentage of backyard pigs (estimated at over 50 percent of the total pig population) and the wild boar population will mean disease will be very difficult to eradicate."
