[Montana] Fish, Wildlife, and Parks released their test results for Brucellosis in Elk and out of the more than 140 animals tested, 7 came back positive.

Of the 100 elk sampled in the Tendoy Mountains [a mountain range in Beaverhead county Montana - Mod.TG], 1 was found to have Brucellosis. This is the first time an elk has tested positive for exposure in the Tendoys. A total of 30 elk in the Tendoys were outfitted with radio collars to learn more about movement patterns and understand how the disease may spread.

In the southeastern Madison Valley, 6 elk tested positive for exposure out of the 41 sampled there.

"The discovery of an exposed elk in the Tendoys emphasizes the importance of elk surveillance near the boundary of the DSA [designated surveillance area - Mod.TG]" said Montana State Veterinarian Martin Zaluski. The goal of brucellosis surveillance operations is to evaluate the presence and understand the movement of Brucellosis in Montana's elk populations.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that infects cattle, bison, and elk and can result in abortion or the birth of weak calves. The disease is primarily transmitted through contact with infected birth tissues and fluids.

[Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, and in many places around the world, it still causes severe infections in humans. Brucellosis also causes decreased milk production, weight loss, abortion, and infertility in cattle. For these reasons, beginning in the mid-1950s, great efforts were made to eliminate the disease from all livestock within the United States. While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase. Brucellosis can result in serious financial burdens to cattle producers, potentially resulting in quarantine of a herd, increased testing and vaccination costs, and possible difficulty in trade with other states and countries.

Although the disease can cause abortions in elk, measurable population effects on population size or trend due to brucellosis have not been documented. However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range. Historically, rates of exposure in elk (measured by blood tests) have been very low (below 2 percent in the early 1990's) and limited in distribution. Recent research and surveillance efforts have indicated that the prevalence and geographical distribution of the disease in elk is likely increasing. Brucellosis now exists in elk populations outside of the Greater Yellowstone Area. Hunters and game processors should take precautions (gloves and good hygiene) when handling reproductive and/or fetal material from hunter-harvested elk and bison.
