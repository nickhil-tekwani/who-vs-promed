After 4 persons died of anthrax in a month in Luhaba village in
Semiliguda block, a 3-member central medical team of the Infectious
Disease Control Centre, New Delhi, led by Dr N C Panda, rushed to the
affected village on Friday [8 Feb 2008] to assess the situation.

According to reports, apart from the 4 deaths, around 20 persons were
afflicted with anthrax after consuming raw meat in Luhaba last month
[January 2008], and the contagious disease is still prevailing in the
area. The team members collected blood samples of the patients for
further examination in New Delhi. The medical team also held
discussions with Koraput medical officers and veterinary officials,
who have been monitoring anthrax-related reports.

The team will submit a report to the Health Ministry on steps to be
taken to curb anthrax in the tribal areas in the future.

Another medical team comprising biologists will travel to Koraput to
conduct further examinations next week.

About 20 anthrax-related deaths have been reported during the past 2
years in different blocks, which forced the Health Ministry to take notice.

Four suspected anthrax deaths have been reported from Koraput
district of Orissa, while 5 persons are being treated for the disease
in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh.

The Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry is monitoring the
situation and has sent out prevention and control guidelines to
Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. According to reports received
by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) from the
Orissa government, the deaths were reported between 19-25 Jan 2008 in
Lohaba village, where there is a history of villagers consuming meat
of dead cattle. A total of 278 people who were taken ill after
consuming infected meat have been treated.

In Andhra Pradesh, 5 persons contracted cutaneous anthrax after
reportedly consuming meat of infected sheep. The sheep had been
purchased by a retired Assistant Director of Veterinary Department in
Gudur, of which 20 [sheep, presumably] died of suspected anthrax.

Ministry sources said teams headed by the Assistant Health Officer,
Koraput and the Medical Officer (Primary Health Centre) visited the
affected Lohabab and Mina Rao Camp villages under Semiliguda gram
panchayat and strictly advised the villagers not to consume meat of
dead animals.

In Andhra Pradesh, a team of health officers visited the area and
instructed the villagers to take precautionary measures.

[Thanks also to T Jacob John for this submission.

The impacts of these outbreaks are striking: 278 in Orissa taken ill,
some 20 confirmed cases and 4 deaths, 5 cases of cutaneous anthrax in
Andrga Pradesh, and multiple sheep deaths. All in all, these and
other related events should amply persuade the Indian and state
governments that they need to get coordinated and initiate an
effective control and surveillance programme for the livestock at
risk. If this disease is prevented in livestock, automatically the
human population is protected. - Mod.MHJ]
