Yet more dead fish found in Prince Edward Island's Wilmot River
----------------------------
CHARLOTTETOWN (CP) -- The numbers in a substantial P.E.I. fish kill
continue to climb. Fisheries officials say they have found about 4500 dead
trout and sticklebacks in the Wilmot River.

Initial lab results suggest the fish were killed by pesticide runoff from
farm fields.

Fisheries spokesman Jim Young says necropsies on 6 dead fish show they were
in good health with no signs of disease. Their condition was consistent
with toxic exposure.

Any further determination will have to wait until results of a lab analysis
come back from Moncton, N.B., in 2 or 3 weeks.

The dead fish were first discovered last week.
