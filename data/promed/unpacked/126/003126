A 25-year-old male patient went [on 1 May 2015] to the outpatient department of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital with complaints of fever, body aches, lethargy, and yellowish discoloration of sclera.

This is the 1st known case of post-earthquake suspected hepatitis, which indicates a possible outbreak of hepatitis in Kathmandu, because he is living together with another 1200 people in the same shelter.

It was not possible to identify the type of hepatitis virus due to an electric power outage.

Patients seeking medical care for fever, influenza like illnesses, gastroenteritis, and dog bites are on the rise. There is growing concern about the possibility of an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu, as well as in other earthquake-affected areas, due to an inadequate supply of clean water.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Pun for this firsthand report.

It is expected that contaminated waterborne infectious diseases including cholera, typhoid and hepatitis A and E will be significant issues in the earthquake-affected areas of Nepal, adding to the endemic nature of these diseases in the country.

As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices in many developing countries, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

Because of this, the cause of this outbreak is likely to be the other food/waterborne form of viral hepatitis, hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.

A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in persons aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia.

A more recent publication (Zhang J, Zhang XF, Huang SJ, et al: Long-term efficacy of a hepatitis E vaccine. N Engl J Med 2015; 372:914-22) found that the duration of protection from the vaccine was up to 4.5 years with a protective efficacy of 86 percent. - Mod.LL
