Epidemic in Andhar Pradesh cause deaths among children
----------------------------------------
With 2 more children succumbing at the Government Children's Niloufer
Hospital on Thursday, the toll in the mysterious fever that had
spread panic in 3 districts of Andhra Pradesh rose to 23.

In the past ten days, 15 children in Karimnagar, 6 in Nizamabad, and
2 in Adilabad districts died with symptoms of fever, nausea,
headache, and fits. Unable to identify the etiology, doctors of the
Niloufer Hospital have asked the National Institute of Communicable
Diseases at Delhi and National Institute of Virology at Pune to help
identify the cause for the unknown fever. According to an official
release, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu held a high-level review
meeting at his residence and directed the officials to take
appropriate and necessary measures to contain the spread of the
disease.

[ProMED has not been able to find any further reference to this
apparent new outbreak of an unknown disease in children in Andhra
Pradesh. It is unclear whether there is any connection to the recent
reports of the outbreak in West Bengal reported over the past week.
The disease in West Bengal is still unresolved. Any information on
signs, symptoms, and laboratory investigations from either outbreak
would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.EP]
