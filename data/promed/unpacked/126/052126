The USA government is encouraging farmers to report any signs of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), promising to pay fair market value for
any livestock killed as a result.
The highly contagious virus has devastated Britain's livestock
industry this spring. Related outbreaks in France, the Netherlands and
Ireland have been contained.
If you don't get early detection and an early hit, we won't look like
France, we'll look like England,'' Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman
said.
Details of the compensation program are still being worked out between
the US Agriculture Department (USDA) and the White House Budget
Office. In addition to paying for livestock, the agency also may
compensate farmers for additional expenses, such as the costs of
disposal and disinfection. Livestock producers also want compensation
for income they would lose during a quarantine.
The department has broad legal authority to spend whatever money it
needs to control an outbreak of animal and plant diseases. The money
comes from a revolving fund, known as the Commodity Credit Corp., that
is used for farm programs.
At a hearing of the House agricultural appropriations subcommittee,
Veneman said U.S. farmers can report the disease with the full
assurance that they will be indemnified.''
FMD has not been reported in the United States since 1929, but the
latest outbreak in Europe has heightened fears that it could return.
The department has banned the import of livestock and meat from
Uruguay, the latest country in South America to report an outbreak.
David Huxsoll, the director of an agency lab that studies the disease,
recently said the chances of a U.S. outbreak were quite great,''
given the amount people travel between the United States and Britain.
Veneman deflected questions about Huxsoll's comment, saying the
department was doing everything it could to keep the virus out of the
country. The department has banned imports of livestock and raw meat
from the European Union and increased its inspection staff at
international airports. The Departments web site is

FMD threat to USA: A radical proposal
It has previous been suggested that, in the event of the arrival of
FMD in the USA, vaccination will be pointless since vaccine stocks are
inadequate to provide any kind of barrier, & would best be used to
protect breeding stock [see: Foot & mouth disease - EU: use of
vaccination (03) 20010329.0636.
It was also argued that mass culling would not be the way to go --
selective culling could be instituted, but at a projected cost to the
economy of $8000 per head for cattle, or $8 billion for each million
head sacrificed, the point of unbearable financial pain would soon be
reached [see: Foot & mouth disease, mass culling issue - USA
20010404.0673.
A further complication would be that farmers would undoubtedly slap
restraining orders on the USDA to postpone both vaccination & culling,
wrecking the whole exercise. And although experience in other
countries has shown that the logistics of culling are best handled by
the military, the US public could well object to daily TV coverage of
the National Guard slaughtering healthy livestock by the hundreds of
thousands, and the smoke from the pyres rising all over rural America,
polluting the air and water.
So if vaccination is out, & culling will be hindered until it´s too
late to be effective, what´s the solution? Consider the following
scenario. Many different conditions apart from FMD can produce
blisters on the mouths & feet of livestock, but in a climate of
apprehension the smart farmer will, at the first sign of a suspicious
lesion, sell the affected beasts. When a responsible vet gets to see
a genuine case, the implications will be so grave that USDA
confirmation will be required before the official announcement. This
might take a week, time for 2 cycles of viral replication, & for the
farmer & his neighbors to sell before a movement ban is slapped on
them. The stock will be in Texas in 24 hours. No 3km or 10km or any
radius cull of adjoining farms will then be of the slightest use. At
the official confirmation of the first case of FMD, Japan & South
Korea, which between them buy 60% of all US beef exports, will slap a
ban on US beef & pork. Other countries will follow suit. Beef prices
will fall, beef futures will fall, rapidly followed by pork belly
futures, since pigs can also be infected.
A state-wide ban on livestock movement will be impossible to enforce,
since US cattle do not carry individual ID´s & passports like UK
cattle, & state borders are wide open. The disease will run out of
control much faster than it did in the UK.
Proponents of mass culling will object that stamping out did succeed
in eradicating FMD outbreaks in Italy in 1993 and in Greece in 1994 &
1996. -- & maybe in France this year (but the chance for re-infection
in France remains). But those countries have nothing like the
livestock population size & speed of movement that the US has. It
takes about 6 months of disinfection before a culled farm is ready for
restocking, but if cases are still occurring elsewhere which result in
a movement ban in the area, it will not be possible to restockat that
time, and the farmer may lose an entire breeding cycle. How is he
supposed to survive financially in those circumstances?
Vaccination proponents will say that vaccination worked for years in
Euope until it was banned there in 1990-1991. But there is not enough
vaccine available in the world to do any good in the US context.
Plus, for the US to obtain FMD-free status, all vaccinated livestock
will have to be destroyed eventually.
So what does this all boil down to? The US will just have to give up
its FMD-free status, join the ranks of other big meat producing
countries that have lost theirs, such as Argentina, Uruguay & Brazil
(partially), and accept the reduction in productivity of flocks &
herds caused by FMD infection. Australia & New Zealand will not be
able to make up the shortfall in FMD-free beef on the international
market, and exports of US beef will slowly rise again. The financial
pain will be uncomfortable, but not nearly as severe as if several
million head of livestock had to be slaughtered and disposed of.
Somebody should run the numbers and confirm this.
What will happen, of course, in real life is that the US will repeat
all the mistakes made in the UK in dealing with the current outbreak
there. It will be too slow to implement the first cull, too slow to
enforce movement restrictions, offer disincentive levels of pay to
veterinarians and of compensation to the farmers, and still be wasting
time talking about vaccination 10 weeks after the first recognized
case occurred. Politicially, it probably has to develop like that.
But in the end, as the legal challenges multiply & the economy begins
to falter, it will be recognized that the most cost-beneficial
solution will be to let the epidemic run its natural course.
So now let´s hear the arguments against this radical proposal.
