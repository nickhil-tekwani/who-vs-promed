The disease which caused the sudden death of cattle in the Pasir Puteh
district in Malaysia is under control, state Veterinary Department director
Dr Idris Kadir said.
He said 2 more deaths from hemorrhagic septicemia had been reported on
Tuesday but there were none on Wednesday.
"Measures taken to control the disease are still in place," he said. Dr
Idris said 1261 heads of cattle--987 cows and 274 buffaloes--in the Pasir
Puteh district had been vaccinated.
Earlier, only 200 of the 4500 heads of cattle in the area affected by
hemorrhagic septicemia were vaccinated.
A total of 19 buffaloes died of the disease last week and the department
had classified it as an outbreak. Dr Idris said breeders were still urged
to vaccinate their cattle and he reminded them the vaccination was
provided for by the department.
The disease could spread to other cattle through grass, water, feed that
they consumed together and also the body fluids of sick cattle. Humans
would not be infected, he said.
In Kuching, state Agriculture director Mohd Sepuan Anu said the cattle in
Sarawak were not affected by the outbreak. He said the department carried
out annual vaccination of the animals against the disease. Sarawak, he
added, had banned the import of live animals and frozen meat from the
peninsula several years ago because of the prevalence of the foot and
mouth disease there.
The ban is still in force. "Sarawak get its supply of beef from Australia,
New Zealand and India and mutton from Australia and New Zealand. "The beef
and mutton in the local market are not contaminated by _Pasteurella_ and
are therefore safe for consumption," said Sepuan.
