There is no salmonella outbreak in Region 8, announced Dr. Archie
Lluz, who is Chief of the Regional Animal Disease and Diagnostic
Laboratory of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in the region.

Lluz said that the results of the laboratory examination on specimens
sent to the Philippine Animal Health Center at the Bureau of Animal
Industry in Manila proved to be negative for salmonella.

The results were identified as _Pasteurella hemolytica_, a type of
bacterial infection that reportedly causes deaths of swine and is due
to bad sanitation and changes in weather conditions.

Pigs with this infection reportedly suffer from loss of appetite,
dehydration, fever and diarrhea.

Lluz was referring to the specimens from Tacloban and Babatngon,
where cases of sick pigs were reported.

In Babatngon, there were 270 reported swine deaths due to this
condition. Swine vaccination had already been conducted to avoid the
spread of the disease.

Lluz said, however, that there remains a possibility that some of the
dead hogs contracted hog cholera. He said, however, that this has yet
to be confirmed.

He also said that hog raisers should immediately report sick pigs to
local government veterinarians so that necessary measures could
immediately be taken.

Never butcher sick hogs, Lluz also warned. He said that this will
only increase the spread of the disease. Also, the sick hogs must be
isolated from the healthy ones, he advised.

He said hog raisers should always see to it that the environment in
which the swine are held is kept sanitary and clean. Lluz said that
the affected swine were those raised in backyard pens and not really
those in hog farms.

The agriculture department has received reports of sick hogs and
early slaughtering from Babatngon, Tacloban City, Alangalang, Sta.
Fe, Palo, Pastrana, Dagami, Burauen, Tabontabon, Lapaz, Mayorga, and
Abuyog in Leyte; Sogod in Southern Leyte; Catbalogan, Calbiga, Daram,
and Sta. Rita in Samar; and Lope de Vega in Northern Samar.

Agriculture officials in the region reported that hog diseases have
spread to 18 towns and one city in Eastern Visayas this month
[February 2009] and have affected thousands of backyard hog raisers
in the region.

DA officials said that unrestricted slaughtering of sick animals has
triggered the spread of swine diseases.

Pork vendors in Tacloban are already complaining. They said there is
a marked decrease in their sales because many consumers now refrain
from buying pork for fear of salmonella.

There is no salmonella outbreak yet, reiterated DA officials. They
also said that this type of infection can be treated by antibiotics.

[The spread of a serious pig disease and mortality throughout most of
Eastern Visayas' territory (Leyte, Southern Leyte, Samar and Northern
Samar; see map at
<http://www.blancsablon.com/Philippines/map/pictures/philippine-map-leyte-samar-region-8.jpg>)
deserves a thorough laboratory investigation. The information on the
clinical and epidemiological aspects of the described syndrome, which
reportedly has been spreading since the end of January 2009 (and
maybe earlier), is rather incomplete.

According to a previous report (see 20090203.0485), the animals
suffer from anorexia, diarrhea, high fever and mortality. Such signs
can be attributed to several porcine pathogens. Bacterial agents,
such as salmonella (now refuted) and pasteurella, may have
contributed to the severity of the disease, but their role as primary
etiological causative pathogens may be doubted.

The testing protocol should include viral diseases, such as classical
swine fever (hog cholera) and African swine fever, hopefully
excluding the latter.

The recent established presence of Ebola-Reston virus in pigs in
another part of the Philippines may provide justification for its
testing in Eastern Visayas as well; see item 3 in posting
20081220.4008. Exclusion of ER virus in Visayas will be a relief. -
