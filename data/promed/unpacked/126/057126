Bangalore's neighbour Ramanagara district has been a cause for perpetual concern, with the highest number of dengue and chikungunya cases coming to light in the district.

According to statistics provided by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, 45 out of 188 chikungunya cases that were tested positive across the state were from Ramanagara. An official from the department also confirmed that the district had been consistently showing a large number of cases over the years.

Officials of the department told Deccan Herald that special care had been taken to ensure that appropriate measures were taken in Ramanagara. However, they added that most measures fell flat, with unhygienic conditions prevailing in the district.

"There are awareness programmes that are conducted. However, the issue is that it is one of the primary areas where vegetables are cultivated. Water-logging and leaking drainage is a common problem in the district," said the official. Further, in places like Doddipalya, chemical contamination is rampant.

He added: "From what we have noticed, the conditions are so bad that people even fear buying the farm produce from this region, as water from the drainage gets mixed with drinking water. This even stagnates in the fields making it conducive for mosquitoes to breed."

Despite the state's dubious distinction of recording the highest number of deaths due to vector-borne diseases in the country in 2013, little has been done to tackle the situation.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India and causes sporadic outbreaks in various parts of the country. Not surprisingly, Karnataka state, including Bangalore, is having a mixed outbreak of chikungunya and dengue virus infections, since both viruses are transmitted by the same vector mosquito. If the chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_, are relatively abundant, as is likely, the occurrence of additional cases can be expected unless the vector control efforts are effective. The report seems to imply that contaminated irrigation leakage water is responsible for vector mosquito abundance, rather than clean water in catchments in and around buildings where these mosquitoes breed. Although the fatality rate for chikungunya virus infections is low to nil, morbidity can be high, with persistent arthralgia that can last weeks to months. There is no commercially available chikungunya virus vaccine.
