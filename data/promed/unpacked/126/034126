CONCURRENT BABESIOSIS AND LYME DISEASE DIAGNOSED IN ONTARIO
Introduction: Human babesiosis (caused by _Babesia microti_) and Lyme
disease (caused by _Borrelia burgdorferi_) are among the most common
tick-transmitted zoonoses. Recent evidence indicates that both diseases are
emerging in the northeastern and Great Lakes regions of the United States
as the deer tick (_Ixodes scapularis_), which transmits both infections,
increases in geographic distribution. Because _B. microti_ and _B.
burgdorferi_ reside in the same rodent reservoir (_Peromyscus leucopus_)
and are transmitted by the same tick vector, human co-infection may be
relatively common in endemic areas. In support of this contention, up to
two-thirds of Long Island residents with Lyme disease have antibodies to
_Babesia_ species. However, until recently, only three episodes of
co-infection had been described and, in each case, a particularly severe
illness was experienced and one individual died. A recent report from New
England found that the severity of symptoms and duration of illness in
patients with concurrent babesiosis and Lyme disease was greater than for
either infection alone.
_Ixodes scapularis_ ticks have been found in a number of provinces in
Canada and 205 cases of Lyme disease were reported to public-health
officials from 1984-1994 (105 locally acquired). However, there have been
no previous reports of co-infections in Canada and, to our knowledge, no
case of babesiosis has ever been reported in Canada. This report describes
a co-infection of babesiosis and Lyme disease acquired by a Canadian
traveler...
Discussion: This case represents the first description of human babesiosis
and the first report of a co-infection with Lyme disease recognized in
Canada. Human babesiosis in the northeast and Great Lakes regions of the
United States is caused by _B. microti_, an intracellular parasite that may
be confused with _P. falciparum_ malaria both clinically and
morphologically, as initially occurred in this case. The morphologic
features that permit discrimination from malaria include the presence of
paired piriform stages and a tetrad configuration ("Maltese cross") formed
by binary fission of the trophozoite to form four merozoites. These later
forms are diagnostic for babesiosis but may be difficult to find. The
absence of pigment and gametocytes in babesiosis may also be helpful
distinguishing features. A new species of babesiosis (WA-1) which is
morphologically identical to _B. microti_ has been described on the west
coast of the United States and in Missouri.
The nymph stages of _I. scapularis_ are primarily responsible for
transmission of both Lyme disease and babesiosis. The nymph is less than 3
mm long even when fully engorged, and most infected persons do not remember
a tick bite. It is probable that the small pinpoint lesion removed by the
patient in this case was in fact an engorged nymphal-stage tick. Nymphs
typically feed more actively in May and June resulting in a peak of
clinical illness in July. As in this case, symptoms of babesiosis usually
begin 1 to 4 weeks after a tick bite. The clinical spectrum ranges from a
mild, self-limited illness to a serious life-threatening infection with
severe hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure and hypotension.
Mortality rates in the United States have been less than 10%, and deaths
more common in the elderly, those with splenectomy, and those with HIV
infection.
Co-infection with other tick-borne agents has recently been recognized as
an important determinant of the outcome of infection with babesiosis. The
disease caused by the co-infection with both Lyme disease and babesiosis
was shown decades ago to be more severe in experimental animals. This
observation has now been extended to human co-infections. Krause and
colleagues reported that 11% of patients with Lyme disease in southern New
England are co-infected with babesiosis. Co-infected patients had
significantly more fatigue, headache, sweats, chills, anorexia, emotional
lability, nausea, conjunctivitis, and splenomegaly than those with Lyme
disease alone. Furthermore, 50% of these patients were ill for [about ]3
months [or longer] compared to 7% with Lyme disease. This increase in the
number and duration of symptoms may be attributed to immunosuppression
associated with babesial infection.
Recently, immunoserologic evidence of co-infection with a third
tick-transmitted bacterial zoonosis, _Ehrlichia_ species (HGE and HME), has
been reported. In a sero-epidemiologic study of residents of Wisconsin and
Minnesota, 9.4% of patients with Lyme disease had serologic evidence of
co-infection: 5.2% with HGE, 2.1% with babesiosis, and 2.1% with both.
Similarly in Sonoma County, California, 23% of residents were seroreactive
to antigens from one or more tick-borne agents: 1.4% to Lyme, 0.4% to HGE,
4.6% to HME, and 17.8% to babesia-like piroplasm WA-1. These studies
indicate that tick-borne diseases are widespread and prevalent in some
regions of the United States. Travelers from Canada will be at risk when
they visit these areas during tick season (generally from May to September
in the northeast). Furthermore, _I. scapularis_ ticks have been identified
in approximately 250 locations in Canada. Prolonged parasitemias that may
accompany co-infection with babesiosis, or subclinical infection in
Canadian travelers who acquire any of the tick-borne pathogens, may
facilitate transmission of infection to _I. scapularis_ ticks in regions of
Canada where they reside. Finally, blood products are not routinely
screened for _B. microti_ or _B. burgdorferi_. Babesiosis may be
transmitted by blood transfusion and is a cause of febrile transfusion
reactions in endemic areas.
In summary, malaria should always be considered in febrile travelers and in
cases of fever of unknown origin, even in those without a travel history.
But clinicians should also consider babesiosis in the differential
diagnosis of febrile travelers returning from enzootic areas of the United
States where, during the tick season (May to September), infection with _B.
microti_ and _B. burgdorferi_ is not uncommon. Furthermore, we suggest that
all patients with a documented tick-transmitted infection be evaluated for
co-infection with other known tick-borne agents, particularly if symptoms
are severe or persist after therapy. Given the current levels of travel
between Canada and the United States, and the emergence of Lyme disease,
babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis, we must anticipate an increase in the number
of imported cases of these tick-borne pathogens in Canadians. Prompt
recognition of cases, accurate identification, and appropriate initial
management is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with
these infections.
