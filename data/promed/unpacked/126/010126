Brucellosis has been present for close to a century in elk and bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area, including the northwest corner of Wyoming.

Brucellosis is a federally controlled disease, caused by a bacterium called _Brucella abortus_. State Veterinarian Jim Logan said in a media release it's important for the public to understand brucellosis has not been found in any livestock in our region.

The Wyoming Livestock Board, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and Logan are working together to assess the situation and identify appropriate action.

The elk that tested positive were identified through the department's statewide brucellosis surveillance program. Through the program, hunters voluntarily submit blood samples from elk they've harvested. Game and Fish says samples are collected from hunters in the fall and early winter, and then analyzed at the department's lab through the winter.

Logan said he'll be working with livestock producers in the area where the elk were found to ensure they are aware of the situation -- and he said they're moving quickly to analyze which actions should be taken. Logan could not be reached for additional comment.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. Collaborative efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the livestock industries and State animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 States with no known infection in 2002.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department carries out a program maintain spatial and temporal separation of bison and elk from cattle, developing habitat enhancements to reduce elk dependency on supplemental feed, implementing management strategies based on research to reduce brucellosis transmission among elk, and conducting a _B. abortus_ strain 19 ballistic elk vaccination program on feedgrounds. [Ballistic vaccination involves shooting vaccine pellets into the animals. - Mod.JW] From 1985 through the winter of 2008-2009, 79 837 elk were vaccinated with _B. abortus_ strain 19, with 95 percent coverage of all calves classified on the feedgrounds.
