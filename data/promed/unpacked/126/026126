The Department [Natural Resources and Renewables] is notifying the public that avian influenza has been detected in Nova Scotia.

On Friday, [28 Jan 2022], the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed a Canada goose in the Grand Desert area of Halifax Regional Municipality tested positive.

Avian influenza is a viral infection that can spread easily and quickly among birds. There are at least 15 types of avian influenza. Some wild bird species, such as ducks, can carry the virus and infect other birds without getting sick themselves. Other bird species are more likely to become severely ill and die when infected with some types of avian influenza.

As a general guideline, the public should not handle live, sick, or dead wild birds. People should contact the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables at 1-800-565-2224 to report sick or dead birds.

The Province is working with the federal government and other agencies to monitor and respond to the situation.

"Avian influenza poses little risk to people, but the virus is highly infectious and potentially deadly in wild and domestic birds. We urge the public to avoid feeding or handling wild birds like ducks, geese, pheasants, pigeons, and gulls to prevent disease spread," said Bob Petrie, Director of Wildlife, Natural Resources and Renewables.

Quick facts
-----------
- Birds that meet testing criteria will be collected and sent to the lab at the Atlantic Veterinary College in Charlottetown.

- Avian flu has been detected recently in other parts of Canada and the eastern United States.

[This news report from Canada confirms that Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses are spreading in North America. From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8.

So far, the subtype reported in the Americas is H5N1. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swans, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways breed in Arctic tundra regions, providing opportunities for HPAI viruses to be introduced into another continent. Thus, the migration of those species could have been the cause of the introduction of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 into the Americas. - Mod.PMB
