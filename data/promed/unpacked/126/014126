Canker outbreak confirmed in Polk County
----------------------------------------
The suspected outbreak of citrus canker (CC) in Polk County was
confirmed by genetic testing today [25 May 2005], said Denise D.
Feiber, spokeswoman for the Division of Plant Industry in the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The dreaded disease,
confirmed as Asian citrus canker, causes premature leaf and fruit
drop.
Officials must burn all trees within 1900 feet of a tree spotted with
CC. Workers at a Ben Hill Griffin Inc. nursery in Frostproof spotted
the suspected canker tree more than one week ago. Feiber said earlier
that more than 5000 trees will be burned, based on the initial
finding. It will be about a week before officials know how many trees
in total will be destroyed.

5600 trees to be cut in Polk; canker may have spread to 2 groves
----------------------------------------------------------------
The apparent discovery of Citrus canker (CC) in Polk County,
Florida's top citrus producer, has local growers worried that the
dreaded disease could threaten the state's USD 9 billion-a-year
industry. The suspected outbreak -- Polk's 1st in more than 70 years
-- has triggered destruction of about 5600 citrus trees from a
14-acre nursery in Frostproof, a state spokeswoman said on Friday [20
May 2005].
Workers recently found indications of the CC at the nursery, owned by
Ben Hill Griffin Inc., and at 2 groves served by the site, state
officials said. CC is an incurable, contagious bacterial infection
that can't harm humans but causes leaves and fruit to drop
prematurely. Growers fear CC, because it can be spread rapidly by
wind, rain, animals and humans. All trees at the nursery will be
destroyed, as well as some that were shipped from there, because they
have the potential to infect working groves.
While trees from the nursery were sent to groves in neighboring
Highlands and Hardee counties before the infestation was discovered,
others in the industry said they were hopeful, because the outbreak
was caught early. Polk is the state's No. 1 citrus-producing county,
but there are plenty of groves out there to keep the state's industry
afloat, Pace said.
"We still have 700 000-plus acres of citrus in the state." Citrus
canker hasn't been found in Polk since the early 1900s, said Denise
D. Feiber, spokeswoman for the Division of Plant Industry in the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
Since the discovery at the nursery, employees have also found
suspected canker in 2 of Ben Hill Griffin Inc.'s Polk County groves,
where "reset" plants from the nursery were moved, Feiber said.
Florida's citrus-canker eradication process requires growers to burn
all trees within 1900 feet of every diseased plant, including those
moved to the 2 groves. CC primarily shows up when new leaves and
blossoms come out, experts say, suggesting that the trees could have
been infected months ago.
Last year's [2004] hurricanes are thought to be responsible for the
spread of CC from South Florida northward to Orange and Hillsborough
counties last summer and fall. But the migration of the disease is
erratic, experts say, because many variables are involved, including
wind, rain and humidity.
More than 23 000 trees in Orange had to be destroyed last summer
[2004] because of CC. Workers, equipment and vehicles undergo a
decontamination process every time they enter a grove to prevent CC
from spreading. "We are adamant in doing the proper procedures almost
to the point of overkill," Causey said. Each time workers enter a
grove, they must spray an anti-bacterial mixture on their hands and
legs. Equipment, including trucks, trailers and ladders, is also
sprayed with a chemical solution before entering a grove.
State officials won't be able to absolutely confirm the presence of CC at
the Ben Hill Griffin nursery and groves until early next week [see above].
But Feiber said, ". . . as of today [21 May 2005], initial diagnostic tests
of the samples are positive for CC, and the eradication program is
proceeding."

remove suspect trees at the nursery and those shipped to other nursery
destinations will, hopefully, prevent any further spread. - Mod.DH]
