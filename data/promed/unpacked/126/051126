Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 3 new confirmed cases of this virus have been recorded. The 1st case is a 42-year-old Saudi citizen in the Eastern region, who is suffering from chronic asthma, and receiving proper treatment at the hospital. The 2nd case is a 63-year-old Saudi female in Riyadh Region, who is suffering from chronic diseases, and still in the ICU, receiving proper treatment. The 3rd case is a 2-year-old child in Jeddah, who is suffering from chronic pulmonary disease, and still in the ICU receiving proper treatment.

Furthermore, MOH has announced the deaths of 4 cases, who had been previously announced to be infected by this virus; 2 of them in the Taif and other 2 in the Eastern Region.

The MOH has pointed out that it has tested 104 samples all over the Kingdom's regions, and all of them have proved negative [except for the positive results we have published].

[The reports of the 3 new cases of MERS-CoV infection and 4 new deaths among previously reported MERS-CoV infected individuals, raise the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to 64 with 38 deaths, and the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia to 49 including 32 deaths. New cases continue to be confirmed among individuals with known pre-existing health conditions. Questions still remain on possible routes of transmission.

It is unclear if the newly diagnosed case of MERS-CoV in the Eastern Province is related to the nosocomial outbreaks directly or indirectly, or if this case was a community acquired infection, either through contact with known earlier cases occurring in the community or some other as yet unidentified source of infection in the community.
