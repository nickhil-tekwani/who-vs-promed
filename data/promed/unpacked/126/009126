The recent CDC recommendation concerning control of meningococcal disease
(MMWR v.46 RR-5, Feb 14, 1997) does not mention this situation. Experience
with the vaccine in the control of outbreaks suggests that hospital
personnel, ER staff in particular, should be vaccinated when a decision is
made to vaccinate all or most of the population in a given community.
Prudence, no more than that, would recommend that ER personnel should be
first in line when vaccination begins. I would admit [this is only a
personal opinion] that if a decision is made to vaccinate certain
age-groups, exception could be made for health care workers directly
involved in the care of meningococcal disease patients.
Meningococcal vaccine usage is based 90% on commonsense and 10% on the
results of controlled trials.
