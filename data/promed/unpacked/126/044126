Influenza Update Number 212
---------------------------------------

Summary
------------
Globally, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels in most countries:
- In North America, influenza levels were at inter-seasonal levels with influenza B circulation still detected.
- In Europe, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in most countries.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity approached interseasonal levels in most countries with influenza B virus predominating at low levels.
- In southern and southeastern Asia, influenza activity continued to decline in most countries except the Islamic Republic of Iran, where a slight increase was observed. In northern Africa and western Asia, influenza activity remained low in most countries.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low, although in some of the countries in the temperate zone of South America, increase in ILI activity with a small increase in influenza detections were observed.

Based on FluNet reporting (as of 2 Jun 2014, 12:25 UTC), during weeks 19 to 20 (4 May 2014 to 17 May 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 86 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 31 706 specimens. 2920 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1417 (48.5 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1503 (51.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 241 (29.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 568 (70.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 32 (94.1 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2 (5.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-------------------------------------------
North America
In North America, overall activity continued to slowly decline, and the late-season wave of influenza B seemed to have peaked as well. In Canada, influenza activity remained within expected levels for this time of year, with continued circulation of influenza B virus. Influenza-like illness (ILI) rates as well as the percent of specimens testing positive for influenza B decreased further.

In the United States of America (USA), influenza activity continued to decrease with ILI rates at interseasonal levels; however, there was still some late season circulation of influenza B. The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza remained below the epidemic threshold.

In Mexico, influenza activity was within the expected levels for the time of year, with low influenza virus detections. Pneumonia and acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity decreased compared to the previous week. Among the positive specimens, 41.7 percent were influenza A viruses (32.0 percent A(H1N1)pdm09, 60.0 percent A(H3N2) and 8.0 percent untyped A) and 58.3 percent were influenza B viruses.

Europe
In Europe, overall activity declined, indicating the end of the influenza season in most countries. Influenza A has remained the dominant virus type in circulation across the region in the 2013/2014 season. Consultation rates for ILI and ARI were approaching inter-seasonal levels in most countries. The number of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)-hospitalizations and proportion of influenza positive SARI samples dropped further.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
In Northern Africa and Central and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low in the majority of countries. Bahrain reported an increased number of detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses in recent weeks.

Eastern and Southern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity continued to decline. Influenza B was the primary virus in circulation, with low levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) also detected.

In China, influenza activity declined further and reached inter-seasonal levels. The proportion of influenza positive specimens was low in both the north and south. The rates of ILI cases remained within expected levels.

In Mongolia, ILI activity increased compared to recent weeks, although not due to influenza.

In Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity reached interseasonal levels.

The Islamic Republic of Iran reported an increasing proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections in recent weeks following an influenza winter season with 1st predominantly influenza A(H3N2) followed by influenza B.

Bhutan reported a decreased number of influenza detections after a peak in mid March 2014, and the ILI activity, which remained elevated in previous weeks, also declined.

Thailand reported decreased activity, with ILI activity levels below baseline levels and low levels of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B virus detections.

Countries in the tropical zone
----------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean:
The overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical areas of South America was at low levels.

The tropical areas of Peru and Plurinational State of Bolivia reported slightly increased influenza activity, mainly due to influenza A(H3N2).

Central African tropical region:
In Africa, influenza detections were reported from western (Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria), middle (Cameroun) and eastern Africa (Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda and Tanzania) with mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections, with the exception of Mauritius where a high number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was still reported.

South-Eastern Asia
In most South-Eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
-----------------------------------------
In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained relatively low, with low level circulation of influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B virus.

In Australia and New Zealand, ILI activity increased compared to the previous 2 weeks but remained at low levels.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with an increase observed in several islands.

Countries in South America reported increased ILI activity but within expected levels for this time of year, with low level of influenza virus detections.

In Chile, [seasonal] influenza started. Among the positive influenza specimens, most were unsubtyped influenza A with some influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B identified. ILI activity increased due to predominantly RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and adenovirus circulating in the area, although it remained below the expected levels for this time of the year.

In Paraguay, influenza activity increased and was higher than the expected levels for this time of the year. Of the positively identified specimens, most were influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B. ILI activity was also higher than the previous weeks and is above the expected levels, due to both RSV and influenza.

In South Africa, although there was some influenza activity, detections are still sporadic, and the season has not appeared to have started yet.

Both Australia and New Zealand had low influenza activity and were below the threshold levels. Nationally, influenza activity levels were stable but higher than in previous years. Influenza A remained the predominant influenza virus type in these countries.

[The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

For updates on influenza at the human-animal interface, see the following WHO web pages: Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface (HAI) and Disease outbreak news.

Interested readers are advised to consult the original document via the source URL to view the above information in diagrammatic form. Overall, the northern hemisphere epidemic has declined to the background level, whereas the Southern hemisphere epidemic is progressing sporadically, with some parts of Southern America having a predominance of RSV and adenovirus over influenza viruses. In Southern Africa, the epidemic has yet to begin. - Mod.CP]
