The Las Vegas Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada so far has been
linked to almost 90 cases of hepatitis C. The figure, however, should
continue to rise as more of the 50 000 patients notified by the
clinic are tested for possible exposure to the virus. The case could
surpass the damages caused by a similar incident in Nebraska in 2000,
considered the nation's largest health care-related outbreak, with 99
reported infections.

[In February 2008, the Southern Nevada Health District advised
patients who received injected anesthesia medication at the Endoscopy
Center of Nevada of a risk for possible exposure to hepatitis C and
other bloodborne pathogens [see: Hepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial
(02): USA (NV), archive number 20080228.0809]. The health district
recommended that patients who had procedures requiring injected
anesthesia at the clinic between March 2004 and 11 Jan 2008 contact
their primary care physicians or health care providers to get tested
for hepatitis C as well as hepatitis B and HIV.

At that time, the health district had received notification of 3
acute cases of hepatitis C in January 2008 and has identified a total
of 6 further cases; 5 of these cases had procedures requiring
injected anesthesia on the same day. Following a joint investigation
with the Nevada State Bureau of Licensure and Certification (BLC) and
with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the health district determined that unsafe injection
practices related to the administration of anesthesia medication
might have exposed patients to the blood of other patients. Genetic
testing on 4 of the cases contracting infection on the same day has
identified that they likely came from a common source. The patient
that had a procedure on a different day did not share a common source
as did the other 4. This indicated that the problem that allowed
disease transmission to occur was not a one-time event but had
recurred over an extended period. Investigation of the clinic
practices identified common practices that would allow disease to be
transmitted in this manner.

Since that report, it transpires that more than 90 cases of hepatitis
C virus infection have been identified, and more than 50 000 patients
are being recalled for testing. Thus, this outbreak may become the
largest outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection in the USA. Up to the
present, the largest hepatitis C outbreak was a consequence of
malpractice at a clinic in Nebraska. In November 2002, ProMED-mail
(see, Hepatitis C, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) (02), archive
number 20021120.5857) reported that 612 patients at the Fremont
Oncology Clinic had been sent letters advising them of risk of
hepatitis C virus infection as the result of a faulty procedure. In
total, 81 of 485 patients who responded tested positive for hepatitis
C virus infection. Mod.MPP commented at the time that an attack rate
of 17 percent (81/485) suggested that unsafe injection practices were
occurring over a period of time rather than as a unique event. This
observation is supported by a recent report (see: News Blaze online
<http://newsblaze.com/story/20080925110427zzzz.nb/topstory.html>)
that the number of confirmed cases in this incident has risen to 99. - Mod.CP]
