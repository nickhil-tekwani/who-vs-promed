--------------------------------------------
Summary
In this study, we investigated recent sheep pox outbreaks that occurred in the Ononsky and Borzunsky regions of the Zabajkalskij kray of Russia. The outbreaks involved 2756 animals, of which 112 were infected, and 3 were slaughtered. Samples of injured skin of infected sheep were analysed by electron microscopy and CaPV specific P32 gene amplification. The subsequent sequence analysis of the entire P32 gene showed that both specimens were identical to the sequence of several sheep poxvirus isolates from China and India. The close location of China to the last decade's Russian outbreaks suggests that possible future outbreaks in Russia could occur along the border regions with countries where sheep and goat pox are not controlled.

[The above short communication addresses 2 outbreaks of sheep pox in September-October 2012 affecting 2 "partially vaccinated" flocks of 2153 sheep/goats and 603 sheep in the Ononsky and Borzunsky regions of Zabajkalskij kray of Russia. A total of 112 sheep were infected; not one of them died, but 3 were slaughtered.

One specimen from the Ononsky and one specimen from the Borzunsky outbreaks were sent to SRC VB Vector, as the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Orthopoxvirus Diagnosis and Repository for Variola Virus Strains and DNA, for confirmatory diagnosis. The report adds diagnostic data to those included in ProMED-mail's 2012 postings on the said outbreaks. In Russia's reports to the OIE on recent sheep pox outbreaks (postings 20121010.1335877, 20131019.2009540), the test used to confirm the disease was named to be "optical microscopy". We asked whether this statement referred to electron microscopy; this has now been confirmed.

The full text of the paper, submitted in August 2013 and updated as of the end of June 2013, includes the following information on the vaccination activities:

"For prevention of economically significant poxvirus diseases, the majority of sheep and goats in the risk zone have been vaccinated against sheep pox and goat pox (1.7, 1.6 and 1.8 million animals in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively). Right now, vaccination of millions animals is still practised, and there were no CaPV outbreaks in the 1st half of 2013. However, there is a constant threat of new CaPV outbreaks in border areas of Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia and the Caucasus countries, which makes it almost impossible for Russia to become free of Capripoxvirus disease in the near future." Interestingly, the Russians vaccinate both sheep and goats even though the virus strain currently circulating seems to be a specific sheep pox strain.

The forecast of new outbreaks, as expressed in the paper, has been realised earlier this month [October 2013] in the Zabaykalsky territory. - Mod.AS
