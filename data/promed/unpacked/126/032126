The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was cited as saying
that nine adults and three unborn children have died since last August in a
nationwide outbreak of [listeriosis linked to a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary
in Michigan.
Officials were cited as telling the Chicago Tribune that the bacterium has
been identified in [specimens from 62 people, with five new cases
confirmed in Arizona.
In December, Chicago-based Sara Lee recalled more than 300 types of meat
products processed at its Bil Mar plant in Zeeland, Michigan. But CDC
epidemiologist Paul Mead stated that the bacterial strain found in unopened
packages of deli meats made at the plant hasn't yet been linked to human
illness.
Health officials say there are certain to be more deaths and illnesses,
since [listeriosis can have up to a 6 week incubation period and the
recalled products may still be stored in people's freezers.
A lawyer who has filed a class-action lawsuit against Sara Lee was cited as
saying that he has learned of 15 deaths and 325 illnesses in 12 states not
reported by health officials.

[The comments attributed to Paul Mead in this posting are puzzling, as
earlier reports cited above have indicated that the unusual strain of
_Listeria_ had been isolated from an opened package of frankfurters
partially consumed by one of the patients. Perhaps it's a misquotation. -
