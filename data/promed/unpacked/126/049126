Raising public awareness of avian influenza needs to eliminate people's
misunderstanding on this epidemic, said an expert with the World Health
Organization (WHO) here on Fri 25 Nov 2005.
"There was a high degree of fear of H5 avian influenza virus both in animals
and humans." said Dr. Julie Hall, coordinator of epidemic alert and response
in WHO's Beijing office, when referring to WHO's mission in central China's
Hunan Province.
There were misunderstandings that the people may remain infectious after they
recover from avian influenza, which they don't, and fears whether the disease
would spread very quickly between people, which no evidence can prove at the
moment, Hall said in an interview with Xinhua. Therefore these things need to
be addressed, such as giving people accurate information, telling people very
clearly what to look for in terms of early detection of symptoms, what to do
to protect themselves, and what to do if animals are getting sick, she
said. "So on the trip to Hunan, we recommended a good public education
campaign and suggested that the authorities give people actual, practical and
mutual information and help them reject misunderstandings," she said.
Based on her observation, Hall also noted that when someone has died, there
appeared to be a misconception that the body itself might be infectious and
pose risk to people so it must be cremated quickly. "We believe that it is
important to inform the people of these misunderstandings so the families can
go through proper grieving and burial process or cremation. There is no need
to cremate a body too quickly," she said.
WHO will be working with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on developing some
guidelines on this issue, Hall said, "hopefully it will be culturally
sensitive and acceptable to the relatives, enable some samples to be taken to
make a correct diagnosis, and enable the families to grieve and bury the dead
in a way they would like."
Earlier in November 2005, 5 WHO experts went to central China's Hunan Province
to look into 3 pneumonia cases at the invitation of the MOH. The MOH later
announced one of the 3 cases -- a 9-year-old boy -- was a confirmed human case
but he has recovered, and his sister who died was a suspected case. So far,
China has reported 3 confirmed human cases of bird flu, including 2 fatalities
and one recovered case.
WHO experts have been invited again to take part in a joint mission to probe
the 2 confirmed human deaths from avian influenza in China's eastern Anhui
Province, a mission that will set off fairly soon, according to WHO Beijing
office. MOH has reported all confirmed cases of bird flu to WHO because of the
potential significance of the disease, as other countries do, but they are
actually reporting more than they need to and doing more than they have
to. "That -- we feel -- is very encouraging," said Hall.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Fri 25 Nov 2005 refuted rumors that
China was hiding human cases of avian influenza. Dick Thompson, an official of
WHO, told reporters that concerning some news reports in German newspapers, he
wanted to say that WHO did not believe that China was hiding any human cases
of bird flu. WHO believed that China was notifying the organization as rapidly
as it could and it was being as transparent as possible in this outbreak, he
said.
German newspapers cited a Japanese virologist saying that avian influenza has
killed 300 people in China, including 7 cases caused by human-to-human
transmission. The Chinese Ministry of Health has confirmed from the WHO
Beijing office that there was no Japanese expert in WHO's mission in Hunan
Province early this month.

China's Ministry of Health (MOH) on Fri 25 Nov 2005 refuted a rumor on the
Internet spread by a Japanese virologist saying China has had several hundred
human deaths from bird flu. "The rumor is absolutely groundless," MOH
spokesman Mao Qun'an told Xinhua in an interview. "MOH has confirmed from the
World Health Organization (WHO) Beijing office that there was no Japanese
expert in WHO's mission in Hunan Province early this month," said Mao. All the
reports quoting this so-called Japanese expert said that China has had several
hundred human fatalities from bird flu were unreasonable and without
foundation, he stressed.
China has so far reported 3 confirmed human cases of avian influenza,
including 2 deaths in east China's Anhui Province and one recovered case in
central province of Hunan. In the areas where bird flu outbreaks occurred,
health authorities have put all the people who had close contact with sick and
dead poultry under strict medical observation. Surveillance, reporting and
separate treatment of fever and respiratory cases have also been strengthened,
said Mao.
MOH has made timely report to WHO, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and some countries
on each confirmed case and has immediately released the information to the
public as well, he said. The cooperation between the Chinese government and
WHO on bird flu control has been going smoothly, a spokesman at WHO
headquarters was quoted by Mao as saying.
China is not covering up any human cases of bird flu, and the Japanese expert
has never visited China on a WHO mission, the WHO spokesman confirmed,
according to Mao. The Japanese expert, Masato Tashiro, said last week in
Germany that avian influenza has killed 300 people in China, including 7 cases
caused by human-to-human transmission, according to reports on the Internet
portals including "New Scientist" and "WorldNet daily".
