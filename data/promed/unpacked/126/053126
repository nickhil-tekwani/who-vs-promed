The Guangdong Provincial Health Bureau announced infectious disease

A total of 40 411 cases of Category C infectious diseases were

[The ranking of rabies as the 2nd highest cause of mortality from
infectious disease in Guangdong province, 2nd only to AIDS [acquired
immune deficiency syndrome], is a striking statistic emphasizing a
need for enhanced control of this disease by animal vaccination and
better availability of post-exposure prophylaxis for humans.
