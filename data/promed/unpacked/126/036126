Update on the epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia as of 24:00 8 Feb 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------
At 04:00 on [8 Feb 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported that 2656 confirmed cases (2147 cases in Hubei) were newly added, 87 severe cases (52 cases in Hubei) were newly added, and there were 89 deaths (81 in Hubei, 2 in Henan, 1 each in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, and Guangxi), and 3916 suspected new cases (2067 in Hubei).

On the same day, 600 new patients were discharged from hospital (324 in Hubei), and 31 124 close contacts were lifted from medical observation.

As of 24:00 on [8 Feb 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 33 738 confirmed cases (including 6188 severe cases), and a total of 2649 discharged patients recovered (Heilongjiang reduced one). A total of 811 deaths have been reported, 37 198 confirmed cases have been reported (1 in each of Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Hainan), and there are currently 28 942 suspected cases. A total of 371 905 close contacts have been traced, and 188 183 close contacts remain in medical observation.

A total of 53 confirmed cases were reported in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan: 26 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (1 death), 10 in the Macao Special Administrative Region (1 case recovered and discharged), and 17 in Taiwan (1 case recovered and discharged).

[A total of 2656 newly confirmed cases have been reported by China in the past 24 hours, compared with 3399 during the similar time frame [6-7 Feb 2020]. This brings the total number of reported confirmed cases to 37 198. 89 deaths were reported in this time period, bringing the total number of reported deaths to 811. In the past 24 hours there has been 1 newly confirmed case reported from Taiwan.

There has been a significant decrease (21.9%) in the number of newly confirmed cases reported by China in the past 24 hours. It awaits to be seen if there will be a continued decrease in reported cases or if this was an observed anomaly attributable to other reasons (reduced laboratory capacity for example.)

[As mentioned previously, this website is constantly updated as new information comes in, so it is likely that when you read this post, the numbers will not match the linked numbers as they will have been updated since the post was prepared.

A total of 36 newly confirmed cases were reported from areas outside of Mainland China: Japan (1), Thailand (7), Singapore (10), South Korea (1), Germany (2), Taiwan (1) Malaysia (4), France (5), Viet Nam (3) and the UAE (2). During this period, no new countries were added to the list, nor were new fatalities reported outside China. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Case fatality rate - cautions
Date: Fri 7 Feb 2020

ref: Battegay M, Kuehl R, Tschudin-Sutter S, et al. 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV): estimating the case fatality rate -- a word of caution. Swiss Med Wkly. 2020; 150:w20203. doi: https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20203
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Estimating and predicting the extent and lethality of the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, originating in Wuhan/China is obviously challenging, reflected by many controversial statements and reports. Unsurpassed to date, an ever-increasing flow of information, immediately available and accessible online, has allowed the description of this emerging epidemic in real-time [1]. The 1st patients were reported in Wuhan on [31 Dec 2019] [2]. Only a few days later, Chinese researchers identified the etiologic agent now known as the 2019-nCoV and published the viral sequence [3]. New data on the virus, its characteristics, and epidemiology become available 24/7 and are often shared via informal platforms and media [4]. Yet, key questions remain largely unanswered.

How is the virus transmitted, how long is the incubation period, what is the role of asymptomatic infected, what is the definite reproductive number R0, how long is viral shedding persisting after fading of symptoms, who is at risk for a severe course, and ultimately, how high is the case fatality rate?

Accurate answers are critical for predicting the outbreak dynamics, to tailor appropriate and effective prevention measures, and to prepare for a potential pandemic. Precise estimates of the case fatality rate and the fraction of infections that require hospitalization are critical to balance the socioeconomic burden of infection control interventions against their potential benefit for mankind. Hence, one of the most important figures to determine is the rate of asymptomatic and mild cases allowing to put severe courses and death rates into accurate context.

At present, it is tempting to estimate the case fatality rate by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude. Diagnosis of viral infection will precede recovery or death by days to weeks and the number of deaths should therefore be compared to the past case counts -- accounting for this delay increasing the estimate of the case fatality rate. On the other hand, cases in official statistics are likely a severe underestimate of the total -- accounting for this underestimate will decrease the case fatality rate. The time between diagnosis and death/recovery and the degree of underreporting will vary over time as well as between cities and countries. A precise estimate of the case fatality rate is therefore impossible at present.

Figure 1: Uncertainties of naive case count estimates [available at the source URL above], illustrates how these uncertainties manifest themselves using currently available data. This graph shows how the ratio of the number of confirmed deaths and case counts changed over time. Case counts are corrected for 3-fold or 30-fold underreporting (solid and dashed lines, respectively) and are taken 2, 4, and 7 days prior to the date of the count of confirmed death. The latter is meant to illustrate the effect of the delay between diagnosis and death or recovery. This actual delay is likely longer than one week. Data source: https://github.com/globalcitizen/2019-wuhan-coronavirus-data.

Better estimates could be derived from large-scale investigations, in particular, in the region of the epidemic's origin. Still, population-based testing of respiratory secretions by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for 2019-nCoV would most likely underestimate the scale of the outbreak, as asymptomatic patients or patients after recovery from infection may no longer test PCR positive. A sensitive 2019-nCoV-specific serological assay is needed to firmly assess the rate of past exposure and may help to assess herd immunity.

One intriguing aspect of the outbreak so far is the discrepancy between the estimates of the case fatality rate reported from Hubei province, from different regions of China and from other countries. As of [7 Feb 2020], 30 536 have been confirmed. Thereof, 22 112 occurred in the Hubei province of China with a death toll of 619 (= 2.8%). This contrasts with 16 deaths among 8702 recorded cases in other regions of China and further countries, suggesting at 1st glance a case fatality rate of 0.18%. The uncertainties and spatio-temporal variation discussed above could explain this divergence:

The higher case fatality rate reported from Wuhan may be overestimated
--------------------------------------------------------
- The true number of exposed cases affected in Wuhan may be vastly underestimated. With a focus on thousands of serious cases, mild or asymptomatic courses that possibly account for the bulk of the 2019-nCoV infections might remain largely unrecognized, in particular during the influenza season.

- Under-detection of mild or asymptomatic cases may be further fueled after further growth of the outbreak, as healthcare facilities and testing capacities in Wuhan have reached their limits.

Accordingly, the official numbers of both cases and deaths reported from Wuhan represent the "tip of the iceberg", potentially skewing case fatality estimates towards patients presenting with more severe disease and fatal outcome. As the current measures in Wuhan aim at slowing the spread, other regions of China and countries gained critical time for preparations permitting to better track cases from the first occurrence of the virus in their populations. Thus, estimates deriving from these settings may be more accurate. That case fatality rates appear to decrease overall renders this hypothesis plausible.

The lower case fatality rates outside Wuhan may be underestimated
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- As the epidemic arrived later in other regions and countries, there may be a delay of fatal cases arising and their reporting. The low number of documented recovered cases might indicate that days and weeks can pass until death occurs. Hence, the numbers, such as in Guangdong with 970 cases and no death occurring, might be false low because severe cases might still have a deadly outcome.

- Testing patients with severe respiratory diseases in outside of China might have been delayed so that unclear deaths are not yet being attributed to the coronavirus. This is unlikely at this point as international awareness has increased, but may have resulted in an underestimation of attributable deaths previously.

Case fatality rates may truly differ among different regions of the world
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Supportive care is crucial for severe respiratory disease. Differences in case fatality rates may be caused by differences in medical care during a large epidemic versus care for single cases. Hence, the large-scale capacities for medical care in the Hubei province, and specifically large-scale intensive care and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may lag behind the epidemic. This hypothesis is supported by the construction of two hospitals in record time.

- There are different susceptibilities to the 2019-novel coronavirus in different regions of China as well as different regions of the world. However, as this is the 2nd coronavirus emerging from China, it is unlikely that herd-immunity is lower in this region of the world, than in others. Immunogenetics and socioeconomic factors, however, may potentially contribute to differences in susceptibilities to the disease.

Current authorities such as the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (USA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control as well as renowned journals are challenged by the rapid generation and dissemination of data, largely published on social media platforms. Thus, new approaches will have to be defined to validate the accuracy of such posts in times where multiple tweets per second are published, sometimes with misleading, sometimes with important information. Modelling the 2019-nCoV epidemic remains challenging as relevant questions are still unanswered. So, despite the dramatic increase of rapidly available data, public health authorities remain torn back and forth between the options of overreacting and frightening the population or underreacting putting citizen at risk in their aim to provide advice to countries and individuals on measures to protect health and prevent the spread of this outbreak.

[There has been much discussion about the discrepancies in reported case fatality rates in Wuhan, Hubei compared with the rest of China. One of the explanations put forth by the Chinese National Health Commission was that Wuhan and Hubei province were not prepared to handle the volume of severe cases requiring ICU care and specialized critical care interventions -- somewhat in keeping with some of the discussion in the article above. Another fact is with time, more and more mild presentations are being tested and confirmed, resulting in increased denominators (number of confirmed cases) observed elsewhere in China and outside of Mainland China, thereby "lowering" the calculated case fatality rates. - Mod.MPP]

The country's health minister has said 5 British people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in France after being infected during a skiing holiday. The victims, one of whom is a child, were staying in the same ski resort chalet and were infected when one of the group came into contact with someone who had been in Singapore, Agnes Buzyn said this morning [8 Feb 2020]. They are in a stable condition and being constantly monitored at an unnamed hospital in the eastern Haute-Savoie Alpine region of south eastern France.

The British person who brought the infection back from Singapore arrived in France on [24 Jan 2020] and stayed at the ski resort of Contamines Montjoie for 4 days.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 8pm today (9 Feb 2020), no new case of novel coronavirus infection [has been] recorded and the number of confirmed cases so far in Hong Kong remained at 26. A spokesman for the CHP said, "According to our preliminary epidemiological investigations, some of the confirmed cases are locally infected. The CHP strongly urged the public to maintain at all times strict personal and environmental hygiene which is key to personal protection against infection and prevention of the spread of the disease in the community."

The spokesman said, "On the personal level, members of the public should wear a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, taking public transport or staying in crowded places. They should also perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes. The public should go out less and reduce social activities, and maintain appropriate social distance with other people as far as possible. As for household environmental hygiene, members of the public are advised to maintain drainage pipes properly and regularly pour water into drain outlets (U-traps); after using the toilet, they should put the toilet lid down before flushing to avoid spreading germs."

The CHP's epidemiological investigations and relevant contact tracing on the confirmed cases are ongoing. The CHP is also closely monitoring and following up on the contact tracing of relevant confirmed cases in the Mainland and overseas. Quarantine will be arranged for close contacts while medical surveillance will be arranged for other contacts. For the progress on the contact tracing of the cases, please see annex.

The CHP has set up a hotline (2125 1122) for public enquiries. The hotline operates from 8am to midnight daily. As at 4pm today [8 Feb 2020], a total of 8235 calls were received.

A dedicated webpage (http://www.gov.hk/ncv) has been set up by the CHP. Information including the latest local situation, list of buildings and list of flights/trains/ships relevant to the confirmed cases, countries/areas with reported cases as well as health advice and a "Novel coronavirus infection local situation interactive map dashboard" are available on the webpage to help the public grasp the latest updates.

The spokesman said, "The CHP will continue to maintain its liaison with the National Health Commission, WHO and the relevant health authorities, and closely monitor the situation for risk assessment."

To prevent pneumonia and respiratory tract infection, members of the public should always maintain good personal and environmental hygiene. They are advised to:
- wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
- perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes; after touching public installations such as handrails or door knobs; or when hands are contaminated by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- maintain drainage pipes properly and regularly (about once a week) pour about half a liter of water into each drain outlet (U-traps) to ensure environmental hygiene;
- after using the toilet, put the toilet lid down before flushing to avoid spreading germs;
- wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds. Then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel. If hand washing facilities are not available, or when hands are not visibly soiled, performing hand hygiene with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub is an effective alternative;
- cover your mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissues into a lidded rubbish bin, then wash hands thoroughly; and
- when having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending class at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly.

The public should take heed of the health advice below when travelling outside Hong Kong:
- do not travel to Hubei Province where community transmission of novel coronavirus is occurring;
- avoid close contact with persons with fever or respiratory symptoms in countries/areas with possible community transmission of novel coronavirus infection. If it is unavoidable to come into contact with them, put on a surgical mask and continue to do so until 14 days after returning to Hong Kong;
- avoid visiting hospitals. If it is necessary to visit a hospital, put on a surgical mask and observe strict personal and hand hygiene;
- avoid touching animals (including game), poultry/birds or their droppings;
- avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms;
- avoid making close contact with patients, especially those with symptoms of acute respiratory infections;
- do not consume game meat and do not patronise food premises where game meat is served;
- adhere to food safety and hygiene rules such as avoiding consuming raw or undercooked animal products, including milk, eggs and meat, or foods which may be contaminated by animal secretions, excretions (such as urine) or contaminated products, unless they have been properly cooked, washed, or peeled;
- if feeling unwell when outside Hong Kong, especially if experiencing a fever or cough, wear a surgical mask, inform the hotel staff or tour escort and seek medical advice at once; and
- after returning to Hong Kong, consult a doctor promptly if experiencing a fever or other symptoms, take the initiative to inform the doctor of any recent travel history and any exposure to animals, and wear a surgical mask to help prevent spread of the disease.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 AM Central European Time
Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.

- The infection prevention and control (IPC) global network is convened through weekly teleconferences with international IPC experts to discuss technical aspects of IPC measures, share epidemiological updates and experiences regarding the IPC measures put in place in affected countries. In consultation with the global IPC expert network, WHO has released three key IPC interim guidance materials on IPC measures during health care and home care, as well as advice on the use of masks in various settings.

Technical focus: infection prevention and control
-------------------------------------------------
From the beginning of this outbreak, WHO has convened several global expert networks for laboratory, clinical management, mathematical modelling, risk communication and community engagement, and infection prevention and control (IPC). The IPC global network is convened through weekly teleconferences with international IPC experts to discuss technical aspects of IPC measures, share epidemiological updates and experiences regarding the IPC measures put in place in affected countries. International participants are members of the Global Infection Prevention and Control Network (GIPCN) or members of relevant institutions caring for infected 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients.

In consultation with the global IPC expert network, WHO has released 3 key IPC interim guidance materials. These materials are available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technicalguidance.

The 1st document -- Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected. Interim guidance v2 -- defines the following 5 IPC strategies to prevent or limit human to human transmission in health care settings:

1. Ensuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection);
2. Applying standard precautions for all patients;
3. Implementing empiric additional precautions (droplet and contact and, whenever applicable, airborne precautions) for suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection;
4. Implementing administrative controls;
5. Using environmental and engineering controls.

The 2nd document -- Home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection presenting with mild symptoms and management of contacts. Guidance- v2 -- provides recommendations in the context of home care for mild patients. Guidance is provided (i) for a household/caregiver's protection including which personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when caring for someone infected with 2019-nCoV and on environmental and waste management; (ii) for an infected individual with mild disease, for example to wear a mask; and (iii) for the management of contacts (including caregivers/health care workers) which includes 14 days of monitoring of health for contacts.

The 3rd document -- Advice on the use of masks in the community, during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. Interim guidance - v1. In community settings, medical masks are not recommended for people without symptoms. For those who choose to wear medical masks, appropriate mask management should be followed, which includes how to use and dispose of masks. Symptomatic individuals are recommended to wear medical masks and seek early medical care if there are any signs of respiratory distress.
