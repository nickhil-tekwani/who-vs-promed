Pulled pork served at a church convention is most likely to blame for a salmonellosis outbreak that sickened nearly 70 people in the fall of 2014. The investigation began after multiple people sought treatment for a stomach illness in early October 2014.

The local health department collected information and found that many of the patients had attended a conference between 1-5 Oct 2014 at Living Word Tabernacle Church in Bessemer City. The NC Department of Health and Human Services partnered with the local health department to investigate the outbreak.

A report released this week found that Boston butts prepared by a church member were the likely culprits. The pork was cooked overnight in a smoker a day before it was served. Then it was returned to the smoker the day of the meals. Some of the pork hadn't cooked all the way through in time for lunch, so it was cooked longer then taken to the church for dinner.

The church member who cooked the meat said it was cooked at 350 F the 1st night, but no cooking temperature was given for when the pork was put back on the grill the next day.

About 400 people attended the church conference, and salmonella was confirmed in 69 patients.

[The serotype of _S. enterica_ is not reported nor is it clear whether there was a difference in the attack rate based on what day the pulled pork was consumed by attendees, if this can be assessed.

The Boston butt cut is not a from the derriere of the pig, but rather a pork shoulder. In eastern and central North Carolina, pulled pork, smoked or braised meat pulled apart and served on a plate or sandwich, is usually served with a dramatic vinegar-based barbecue sauce. A recipe for this delicious sauce can be found at: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/eastern-north-carolina-bbq-sauce/. - Mod.LL
