_Taenia solium_ the cause of subcutaneous nodules?
--------------------------------------------------
Subcutaneous nodules are a very common manifestation of cysticercosis in
Vietnam and is also seen in other Asian countries. We also have reports
(unpublished) from African countries such as Zambia.
We recently published a review paper on cysticercosis in Vietnam in the
Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health. In Vietnam
subcutaneous nodules are a very common manifestation of cysticercosis and
nodule biopsy is often used to diagnosis patients.
We are finding that the distribution of _T. solium_ cysticercosis is much
more extensive -- especially in Southern and Eastern Africa and Southern
and Southeastern Asia -- than previously thought.
Neurocysticercosis was just discussed at the World Health Assembly in
Geneva in May 2003 and the status of cysticercosis was reviewed by the
International Task Force for Disease Eradication in April at the Carter
Center in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. At the moment I am involved in a WHO
project assessing the global burden and impact of _T. solium_ cysticercosis
and also revising the global distribution map of cysticercosis.
In August 2002 an international workshop on _T. solium_ cysticercosis was
held in Arusha, Tanzania. The proceedings of that meeting have just come
out in a special edition of Acta Tropica (June 2003 issue).
