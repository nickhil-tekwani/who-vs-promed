Sudden death syndrome flaring up
--------------------------------
Sudden death syndrome (SDS) causes yield-robbing premature leaf-drop in
soybeans. It's become a serious problem for farmers from the western Corn
Belt to the mid-South. It's been the coolest summer ever in some parts of
the Midwest, and a cool summer usually means a lot of SDS. Farmers, crop
advisers and Extension specialists are finding "widespread occurrences" of
SDS from Nebraska to Tennessee, especially where temperatures have been
cooler than normal.

"SDS is terrible here in south-central Tennessee," says an Agriculture.com
Crop Talk member. "Never had this problem to this extent." As of last week
[week of 17 Aug 2009], on top of already high levels in the eastern and
southern Corn Belt, SDS was confirmed in half a dozen counties in Nebraska
and specialists speculate that's not the extent of the infection in the
state. "This outbreak appears to be more widespread than in any year since
it was first confirmed in Nebraska in 2004," says University of Nebraska
Loren Giesler. "Most affected fields have small areas with the disease and
large areas that are not being impacted." Cooler, wet soils are most prone
to SDS infection, which is affecting some central Iowa fields at levels of
75 per cent or greater in the last week, Iowa State University (ISU)
reports. "The SDS reports this year [2009] are unlike other years," says
ISU plant pathologist XB Yang.

But it's not just weather conditions that can spawn greater SDS issues;
management practices have inadvertently laid solid groundwork for the
disease. "We had moisture at the early reproductive stages," Yang says. "In
addition, many producers are adopting earlier planting strategies which
favor SDS. Soil compaction and high fertility levels also have been
associated with increased levels of SDS."

SDS spread has been moved along by other practices over the years that will
need change in the future. "Seems like we've gone all corn to a
corn-soybean rotation," says another Crop Talk member. "If you [included]
cyst nematode-resistant bean and wheat, you might lower your [nematode]
populations. But we spent a long time building the problem; it will be a
long time correcting it."

In the near term, though, keeping a close eye on where you have SDS is the
best way to start controlling the disease next year [2010], says certified
crop adviser Travis Rowe. That will start with crop rotation. "There is
very little we can do at this time," he says. "However, we need to be sure
to identify the fields and varieties that are showing symptoms this year
[2009] so we can make better management decisions the next time these
fields are rotated to soybeans."

[SDS was first discovered in the USA (Arkansas) in 1972 and has now become
widespread in soybean-growing regions in the United States, Argentina, and
Brazil. Plants turn yellow and die quickly after pod set and symptoms often
appear in patches in a field. Yield losses may be more than 80 per cent,
depending on variety and timing of infection. Appearance of SDS at early
pod fill is reportedly more damaging than its appearance at a later stage
of plant development. Yield reduction is the result of reduced
photosynthetic area, defoliation, flower and pod abortion, and reduced seed
size.

The fungus _Fusarium virguliforme_ has been described as the causal
pathogen of SDS in North America and _F. tucumaniae_ in South America.
Foliar symptoms are thought to be the result of a fungus-produced toxin.
Any kind of stress factors (which may include soil compaction as mentioned
above) is reported to exacerbate symptoms and cause SDS-affected plants to
deteriorate earlier. In particular, soybean cyst nematode (SCN), although
not required for severe SDS to occur, is reported to exacerbate foliar
symptoms and lead to early and severe SDS, if present at sufficient levels.
Nematode numbers in soil usually take many years to build up, and long crop
rotation with non-hosts, as suggested above, is used to limit the increase
of nematode levels. Other soybean pathogens are still being studied for a
potential role in SDS.
