Viewpoint: Farm virus spreads to deer
-------------------------------------
Evidence of extensive Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection of wild deer populations has far-reaching significance -- not least for the future control of this devastating pathogen.

SBV emerged in northern Europe in the summer of 2011. It was 1st observed in cattle, where its arrival was heralded by a series of relatively innocuous symptoms that included reduced milk production and diarrhoea. But the ensuing lambing and calving season revealed a more sinister side to this virus. Infection of pregnant sheep or cows resulted in miscarriage or in still-born or seriously deformed offspring.

SBV continued its march across northern Europe with UK cases reported in the early part of 2012. Genetic studies showed it was a member of the bunyavirus family, which includes Akabane virus -- already known to wreak similar havoc in sheep and cattle.

So can the natural history of this related virus tell us anything -- is Akabane a suitable soothsayer to predict the future impact of SBV? Yes... and no.

Akabane is mainly found in tropical and sub-tropical countries in Africa, the Middle East, south-east Asia and in Australia. It is transmitted by the same type of insect that spreads SBV -- biting midges or Culicoides. Akabane infects a wide-range of animals and the consequences of infection are pre-determined by underlying levels of virus infection.

It is perhaps counter-intuitive, but animals living in regions with a long-standing history of frequent Akabane infection -- so called endemic regions -- are protected from its worst ravages. And the reason is simple. Being exposed to high levels of virus ensures that the animal becomes infected in early life. This early infection is harmless and gives rise to long-lasting protection - or immunity -- and infection in later life, during pregnancy for example, does not occur.

So will SBV become endemic in Europe? Should farmers simply batten down the hatches until the viral tempest has passed? To determine levels of virus infection you can look directly for the virus or for the tell-tale markers of past exposure -- virus-specific antibodies. It is these antibodies that also protect against subsequent infection.

One study of SBV in Belgium cattle herds showed that following the initial wave of SBV in 2011 the number of animals that harboured virus antibodies was high -- an indication that the virus was becoming endemic. So, if SBV is charting an endemic course, should we simply sit back and let the inevitable happen or should we intervene? To answer this we need to ruminate on the issues that will shape the long-term outcome.

Climate undoubtedly exerts influence; perhaps more so in the temperate northern European home of SBV than in the sub-tropical and tropical ranges where Akabane prevails. High levels of transmission are needed to ensure early-life exposure and to protect against the more adverse consequences of adult infection. Transmission rates are intricately linked to the virus-laden midge populations -- and these are sensitive to climate change.

Adverse weather can reduce midge numbers and leave significant numbers of young animals uninfected, making them vulnerable to infection during pregnancy. Conversely, midge-friendly weather patterns can temporarily expand their range, enabling them to carry their deadly cargo to herds that had previously been safe from SBV. This could pose a particular threat to farms in southern Europe for example.

Research published in the International Journal of Health Geographics suggests that the initial spread of SBV in the summer of 2011 was facilitated by drought conditions in the northwest of Europe. So, small fluctuations in European climates may wreak massive changes in the occurrence of SBV disease. And farming methods also come into play.

In Akabane-endemic countries livestock farming is generally less intensive and livestock breeding and midge seasons more diverse; meaning animals are more likely to become infected before they reach breeding age. In SBV-affected areas mating periods are more rigid and overlap with the midge biting season. For new breeding stock, their first exposure to the virus will often coincide with pregnancy.

If reliance on natural infection to provide early protection from SBV is difficult does veterinary intervention have a role? Preventing SVB infection through vaccination is feasible. A vaccine containing killed virus is under development and a similar vaccine is already used to protect against Akabane infection. Whether or not vaccination is cost-effective or really necessary is a key question that the farming fraternity will have to grapple with.

Ultimately the price of vaccination has to be weighed against the costs associated with SBV. In areas where infection is rife and underlying protection high, sporadic lamb and calf losses might be a preferable, if somewhat unpalatable, price to pay. It is also too early to gauge whether a vaccine, or indeed natural protection, will be successful in the long-term.

A study published in the Journal of General Virology showed that viruses recovered from SBV outbreaks showed extensive amounts of genetic mutation. Crucially these mutations occurred in the genes that code for the virus proteins targeted by protective antibodies. It is unclear what significance, if any, these new findings have, but escape from antibody protection would mean a mutated virus would be free to infect once more.

Eradicating infectious disease is always preferable to management and control. So could elimination of infected livestock or mass vaccination programmes bear fruit? The simple answer is no. SBV infection of wild deer populations has already been described -- and this may be the merest tip of the iceberg.

Akabane virus can infect and replicate in the midges that carries it and preliminary studies suggest that SBV can do the same. Wholesale elimination of midges would be impossible.

Some UK farmers are reporting major livestock losses. It is too early to determine if the birth of animals with abnormalities will gather pace or if the insidious grip of SBV has diminished. But one thing is for sure: Schmallenberg virus is here to stay.

Kazakhstan has threatened to sue Austria for supplying infected cows
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Kazakh authorities intend to sue the veterinary authorities of Austria, through whose fault the country got the animals infected with the virus Schmallenberg [see comment]. According to Tengrinews.kz, this was claimed by the Kazakh Republic's Minister of Agriculture, Asylzhan Mamytbekov. He added that the complaint will be lodged in one of Kazakhstan courts.

More than 700 cows of Elite breeds were imported last [2012] September from Austria to the farms "Leon" and "Poltava" in north Kazakhstan.

During the mandatory quarantine period, local veterinarians found that at least 80 head of cattle were sick. According to the performed tests, the foreign bovine virus BVD (Bovine virus diarrhea), IBR (Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis) and SBV (Schmallenberg virus) were detected. These diagnoses, according to 24.kz News, were later confirmed by experts from Russia and the UK.

The Government of Kazakhstan decided to destroy all cattle imported from Austria, including their offspring born in the territory of the republic. In mid-February 2013 the animals were killed and their carcasses burned.

Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic asked for clarification of the Austrian veterinarians and suppliers. These have claimed that the animals were healthy when sold to Kazakhstan.

Schmallenberg virus [SBV] was 1st identified in the autumn of 2011 in the German city of the same name. The disease is caused by a virus, characterized by diarrhea, fever, and loss of offspring. It affects sheep, goats and cattle. Development of a vaccine to combat the new disease, according to experts, can take up to 2 years. Effect of SBV on human health has not been studied [but see item 3].

[The information and claims included in the above report are expected to be discussed between the 2 countries and between their relevant stakeholders. Such disputes are, generally, handled within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) but Kazakhstan is an observer, not a member (Austria became a member in 1995). The working party on the accession of Kazakhstan held on 10 Dec 2012 its 14th meeting to review progress in the membership negotiations. Members expressed hopes that Kazakhstan would reach the finishing line for accession in 2013. Animal health related issues are discussed by WTO's SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) committee, which applies criteria based upon OIE's International Animal-Health Code.

To clarify and understand the issue, additional details are required, such as the animal health certificate agreed between the 2 countries and issued by Austria (with special reference to IBR, BVD and SBV), the breed and age of the cattle, the health status in the farms of origin, the pre-export tests performed in Austria and their results, the quarantine conditions in Kazakhstan including effective isolation from local livestock, the time gap between the import and the performance of tests in the importing country, the tests performed there (methods and results), and additional details. While it may be assumed that SBV is exotic to Kazakhstan, it is not clear if IBR and BVD are. If imported cattle had been infected by SBV during pregnancy prior to export from Austria, at least some of them are expected to have delivered malformed offspring in Kazakhstan. Has this happened?

No evidence for zoonotic transmission of Schmallenberg virus in areas with veterinary activity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: The emergence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel orthobunyavirus, as a cause for malformations in ruminants in Europe triggered a joint veterinary and public health response to address the potential human health consequences. Using a risk profiling algorithm, we concluded that the potential for human infection is low but could not be excluded.

Objectives: To ascertain the public health risk of the emergence of SBV in ruminants in the Netherlands and most likely other European countries were SBV has emerged.

Methods and Materials:
1) Self-reported cases of febrile illness within 2 weeks of direct exposure to affected animals or their birth products were monitored.
2) A serological survey was conducted to determine the presence of SBV antibodies in serum from persons living and working on farms where SBV had been highly suspected on the basis of pathological findings consistent with typical SBV-induced malformations in calves or lambs, most confirmed by PCR and/or serology. The target cohort consisted of adult (= 18 years of age) farmers, farm residents, farm aids and veterinarians. Serum samples were donated and a questionnaire was filled in. The presence of SBV-specific antibodies was determined by virus neutralization (VNT).

Results:
1) None of 4 suspected case-persons showed evidence of an SBV infection.
2) The serological study comprised of 301 participants. Of these 234 worked or lived on affected farms; 67 were veterinarians. 229 participants specifically reported direct exposure to malformed new-borns and/or birth products. A total of 150 participants reported insect bites on SBV-infected farms, exposing them potentially to SBV during the vector season. None of the 301 individuals showed serologic evidence of SBV infection in the VNT.

Conclusion:
In this study we found no evidence for human SBV infection, despite the high infection rates in ruminants of the same localities (up to 100 percent within herd seroprevalence) and the high level of reported insect bites during work on SBV-infected farms. The lack of evidence for zoonotic transmission from either syndromic illness monitoring or serological testing of presumably highly exposed individuals suggests that the public health risk of SBV given the current situation is absent/ extremely low.

[The above results and conclusions are encouraging. It deserves, however, to be kept in mind that studies into the in vitro growth kinetics of SBV in several cell lines showed that SBV grew efficiently in all the cell lines tested, including human 293T; see Varela M, Schnettler E, Caporale M, Murgia C, Barry G, et al. (2013) Schmallenberg Virus Pathogenesis, Tropism and Interaction with the Innate Immune System of the Host. PLoS Pathog 9(1): e1003133. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003133; free access at
