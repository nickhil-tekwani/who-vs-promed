Orf, a contagious animal disease, has broken out in Nwoya district
killing at least 200 goats, mainly in Purongo sub-county.

The disease reportedly broke out after more than 400 goats meant for
the National Agricultural Advisory Services were ferried into the
district.

The district veterinary officer, Dr James Okwi, who confirmed the
report, said the animals were brought into the area without proper
quarantine.

Mr Okwi said despite his office's rejection to have the goats
distributed to beneficiaries, the suppliers, in collaboration with
some officials in the district, secretly distributed the goats,
causing the outbreak.

"Although it was out of order to have sick goats distributed, the
animals were given out without my knowledge," Mr Okwi said, adding
that movement of animals has been restricted to curb further spread of
the disease.

Purongo sub-county councillor Fred Oketta said some deaths have gone
unreported, adding: "The goats are dying on a daily basis; the
government should come to people's rescue because the animals are
their only source of livelihood."

[Orf, or contagious ecthyma, is a highly contagious, zoonotic, viral
skin disease that affects sheep, goats and some other domesticated and
wild ruminants. The skin lesions are painful and often occur on the
mouth and muzzle; hence the other names of the disease, contagious
pustular dermatitis, sore mouth, and scabby mouth.

Orf is a parapoxvirus infection. The lesions are of a proliferative
nature. Lesions on the udder may result in the abandonment of
offspring, and (less commonly), foot lesions can cause transient
lameness. Secondary bacterial infections can occur, and, in rare
cases, the lesions may extend to other external parts of the animal
and into the internal organs. Progression to generalized disease is
considered rare. Although contagious ecthyma usually resolves
spontaneously and the mortality rate is generally low, fatality rates
up to 10 percent have been reported. This is a very common infection
of sheep and goats, present in all sheep and/or goat raising countries
globally. In most countries, it is not a reportable disease or a cause
for movement restrictions; it is not included in the international
(OIE) lists of reportable diseases.

Humans are usually infected by direct contact with animal lesions,
e.g., children in petting zoos/parks, usually by letting infected
lambs lick their fingers. It is not transmitted by consumption of meat
or milk, direct contact with lesions being the common infection route.
Most infections in humans are localized and heal spontaneously;
however, large, poorly healing lesions can occur in people who are
immunosuppressed.

The severe picture described in the above newswire, with high
mortality of (adult?) goats, is rather unusual; other potential
infections with dermal lesions, particularly goat pox, bluetongue, FMD
and PPR should be excluded.
