Camp for Children on Orca Island Closed by Suspected Norovirus Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nearly 150 children and a number of staff members at the YMCA's Camp Orkila
on Orcas Island fell ill with what officials say may be norovirus
infection, a highly contagious illness that causes no permanent health
problems but plenty of temporary discomfort. As of last night [Sat 23 Aug
2003], some 36 remained quarantined at the camp. The rest were taken by a
chartered ferry back to Anacortes. Camp Orkila is the oldest camp in the
Northwest and was founded on Orcas Island in 1906.
In all, YMCA officials said 140 children fell ill with what appears to be
norovirus infection, a gastrointestinal sickness that causes vomiting,
diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. YMCA officials did not know how many
staff members also fell ill. The outbreak forced the shutdown of the entire
camp 2 days before campers were scheduled to leave. The YMCA said there
were 360 children at the camp, which hosts 3000 campers every summer.
Officials said they haven't done tests yet to determine whether the
illnesses were caused by norovirus infection.
The Washington State Ferry system dedicated a ship, the M/V Chelan, to
transport the children from Orcas Island to the mainland. Children who did
not display symptoms of the illness rode in the passenger section of the
ferry. They were not allowed near the food galley, and they were restricted
to using one set of men's and women's bathrooms. Some were picked up by
their parents at the Anacortes ferry dock, but most rode in chartered buses
back to Seattle. Many of the children showing symptoms were picked up by
their parents at Orkila. They were asked to stay in their parents' cars
during the ferry ride. About 36 children whose parents could not be reached
by camp officials remained quarantined at the camp.
The outbreak started when one child who was already infected arrived at
camp Monday, said Monica Elenbaas, spokeswoman for the YMCA of Greater
Seattle. The child already had spent hours traveling and playing with other
campers before symptoms started to show.
The camper was taken to the camp infirmary Monday, but not before the virus
had spread to others, Elenbaas said. The virus takes a day or 2 to show its
symptoms, so the camp doctor didn't know until Friday that a suspected
[norovirus outbreak was imminent], Elenbaas said. Realizing that the
infirmary would be overwhelmed by the number of patients, the doctor took
over the camp's conference center Friday and turned it into a quarantine.
The state ferry system was contacted Friday night, and the agency's leaders
decided to dedicate an entire ship to evacuating the children. No other
passengers were allowed on the boat. Workers boarded the Chelan after it
docked in Anacortes and cleaned all the areas where the children had been.
The ferry was back in service for the 2:45 run, leaving ferry service in
the San Juans running about half an hour late, Patterson said.
Noroviruses affect 23 million Americans each year. The virus occurs when
fecal matter contaminates food or water, often when people don't wash their
hands properly after using the restroom, then touch something that others
later put in their mouths. The virus can be transmitted by close contact
with infected persons or the things they have touched. People with the
virus tend to start showing symptoms one to 2 days after they are infected,
and the symptoms tend to last one to 3 days. The virus causes no long-term
health problems.

Jamaica: Rotavirus-associated Acute Gastroenteritis Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Jamaica, surveillance reports
have indicated an increase of gastroenteritis cases in St. Catherine,
Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. Thomas during June to July 2003. Acute
gastroenteritis (AGE) cases requiring inpatient care in Spanish Town
Hospital increased from 17 in 2002 to 38 in 2003; and AGE cases handled in
the emergency room of the same hospital increased from 494 in 2002 to 549
in 2003.
To better understand this situation, the MOH, together with CDC-Atlanta and
PAHO, has been conducting epidemiological research on AGE since the end of
July 2003. 2 different studies have been carried out: one retrospective
(in which 60 children participated) that involved household visits by a
health-care worker in addition to a review of the children's medical
records; and one prospective study in which 100 children participated.
Main findings of the outbreak investigation are the following: Of the
children, 97 percent were under 5 years of age, of whom 87 percent were
vomiting, 10 percent had a fever, 58 percent were dehydrated, and 50
percent had received medical attention prior to this episode. Rotavirus
appeared in 38 out of the 87 stool samples (43.7 percent) for the patients
under 5 years of age. For the children over 5, one out of every 4 stool
samples (25 percent) tested positive for rotavirus.
At this point, the research is showing nothing to link this outbreak to the
recent clinical study in Jamaica involving a rotavirus vaccine, for the
following reasons: (1) [blank] (2) An increase of AGE has been observed in
the southeast region of the country, while the vaccine trial is limited to
other geographical areas. Regarding the characteristics of the strain, 7
samples revealed that common strains GI, GII, and P8 were generally found
(in 5 of the 7, or in 71 percent). (3) One sample showed evidence of dual
infection with a GI/G9 P8 rotavirus (G9 is considered an emerging agent).
(4) Only one sample showed strain GII, non-typable for P, which may be
related to the vaccine.
Measures taken included the distribution of education materials as well as
media broadcasts. Case-management guidelines have been developed and are
currently in use. Training programs for public-health teams will follow. A
survey on knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) is being carried out
among health-care providers and care-givers. A total of 140 blood samples
and 120 stool samples, along with tissue samples from 5 patients who died,
have been sent to CDC for further analysis.

[These reports illustrate that outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis can have
different causation. In the very young, acute viral gastroenteritis is
frequently the result of rotavirus infection, for which vaccines are
currently under development. Sudden-onset gastroenteritis, on the other
hand, is usually associated with norovirus infection and affects adults and
older children predominantly; no vaccine is available at present. The
Seattle area has experienced several recent outbreaks of norovirus
infection, particularly aboard cruise ships. As a result of this
experience, effective and commendably rapid responses have been developed
for containment of such outbreaks. - Mod.CP]
