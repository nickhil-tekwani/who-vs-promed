[Crayfish fungal plague, fatal to many crayfish species, has affected many European countries. It is caused by a fungus, _Aphanomyces astaci_, that was brought into Europe by the introduction of _Procambarus clarkii_, a freshwater crayfish species of Louisiana, USA, which is naturally infected by this pathogen, although it does not develop clinical disease.

For detailed information about the disease caused by this fungus, see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/chapitre_aphanomyces_astaci.pdf. - Mod.PMB
