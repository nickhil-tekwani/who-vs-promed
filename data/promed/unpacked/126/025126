[Please note this article is from 2015. While it is likely not the beginning of the lead problem in the water, it is one of the better articles describing the situation. - Mod.TG]

[In 2015,] doctors are finding elevated levels of lead in the children in Flint, Michigan, and local tap water is the likely cause. That's the latest alarming news to come out of the city, which switched its water source about a year and a half ago [in April 2014. - Mod.TG]

A pediatrician with Hurley Medical Center analyzed lead levels of hundreds of children. She compared blood tests before and after April 2014. That's when Flint, unable to come to an agreement on a short-term contract with Detroit, quit buying water from its system and signed on with a new system that will draw water from Lake Huron.

But that system won't be online until next year [2016]. So, in the interim, with assurances from the state that it would be safe, the city decided to pump water from the Flint River.

Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha's research found that the percentage of Flint children 5 years and younger with elevated lead levels nearly doubled after the switch, from 2.1 percent to 4 percent.

"My research shows that lead levels have gone up," Hanna-Attisha says. "I cannot say it's from the water. But that's, you know, the thing that has happened."

The news did not surprise [the mother of a 4-year-old] who suspected the water had something to do with health problems in her son.

"I kept talking to the doctors, trying to figure out why he wasn't growing," she says. "He was 27 pounds [12.3 kg] at 4 years old. His hair was thinning, breaking out in rashes."

Complaints about foul-smelling, discolored water began soon after the city started drawing water from the Flint River. In the summer of 2014, the city issued a notice for residents to boil their water because of _E. coli_ contamination. [While boiling can kill _E. coli_, it will also cause the lead to concentrate as portions of the water are boiled away. Therefore, the resulting water has a higher concentration of lead. - Mod.TG]

Then the city was found to be in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of high levels of a disinfectant byproduct called total trihalomethanes -- an unintended consequence from all the chlorine the city had to use to kill the _E. coli_.

The mother of the 4 year old child says her whole family broke out in rashes, and they stopped drinking the water in December [2014].

Then, in February of this year [2015], the city tested her water for lead. "And I got a frantic phone call from the water department telling me to please make sure my kids didn't drink the water, don't mix their juice with it, because they had never seen a number that high for lead," said the mother of the 4-year-old child.

After that, the mother decided to take her son in to be tested for lead. He'd been tested before the city switched its water source. At that time, he had a level of 2 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. After the switch, his level was 6.5.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a level of 5 is considered "much higher" than that found in most children. It also says there is no safe level of lead exposure -- and the effects, like lower IQ, are irreversible.

The day after the lead findings were announced, the city put out a lead advisory, urging people to flush their pipes, install inexpensive filters, and use cold water for mixing baby formula.

"As a father, I want every family and household in the city of Flint to be safe and secure," the Mayor said at a press conference to announce the advisory.

Over the summer [2015], researchers from Virginia Tech found that Flint River water is highly corrosive. That means when it comes into contact with lead from service lines, household pipes or solder, it eats away at the lead and sends it right to people's faucets.

City officials and state regulators say they're now putting together a corrosion control plan to reduce lead exposure.

"Flint is the only city in America that I'm aware of that does not have a corrosion control plan," said Virginia Tech's Marc Edwards, who led the research.

Edwards also uncovered lead contamination in Washington, DC. He says Flint's lead levels are not as high, and the exposure period is not as long as it was in that city. But he has some harsh criticism of city and state officials for how they've handled the Flint situation.

"It was clearly a failure of government agencies to do their job to protect the public," says Edwards, citing the absence of a corrosion control plan from the outset.

A draft report from the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] that was obtained by the ACLU of Michigan also takes the city and state to task.

"Prior to 30 Apr 2014, the City of Flint purchased finished water from the City of Detroit which contained orthophosphate, a treatment chemical used to control lead and copper levels in the drinking water," the report read, adding that the treatment was discontinued after the switch to Flint River water [see the article below on how these chemicals work and why it is important. - Mod.TG]

"In accordance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR), all large systems ... are required to install and maintain corrosion control treatment for lead and copper. In the absence of any corrosion control treatment, lead levels in drinking water can be expected to increase," the report continued.

But officials with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) dispute the findings of the draft report. MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel says the report was the work of a "rogue employee" and promised the final report -- not yet released -- would tell a much different story. [One might wonder how a rogue employee would write such a report and have the city release it? Surely, it was read and approved prior to release? - Mod.TG]

"You have to do a full year of studying" the water chemistry as it behaves across the system before implementing corrosion control, Wurfel says, adding that's the only way to know how much phosphate to add to the water. [It seems that with constant monitoring the level of phosphate could be adjusted on a weekly or monthly basis in the face of such a problem. - Mod.TG]

An announcement about the corrosion control plan is expected soon. Meanwhile, city officials are showing increasing interest in returning to Detroit's water system -- something that even a few days ago they dismissed as economically unfeasible for the cash-strapped city.

Whatever the solution, residents like the mother of the 4-year-old say they hope the city can reach one soon. "I want them to take responsibility," the mother says. "I want them to quit poisoning their citizens."

[This is a very recent article and it has some wonderful images that display how this situation came about. Readers are encouraged to see them. - Mod.TG]

How lead got in the water
-------------------------
The town of Flint [Michigan] is still reeling from the contamination of its water supply, which exposed thousands of residents to lead-laced water, put Michigan's Governor in the political hot seat and prompted an emergency declaration from President Obama.

So how did a town of 100 000 lose access to something as basic as clean drinking water? First, you have to understand how Flint got its water before the crisis.

Flint's water when it was safe
------------------------------
For almost half-a-century, Flint purchased water from Detroit, which properly treated the water with orthophosphate, a chemical that essentially coated the pipes as water flowed through them, preventing lead from leaching into the water supply [from the old lead pipes or cast iron pipes]. Here's what the process looked like then. [See 1st graphic on the website at the source URL above.]

A change in the water supply
----------------------------
Flint switched from Detroit's water supply to the Flint River in 2014, in part to save money. But the city did not use corrosion control to prevent lead from entering the water. The river itself was also found to contain 8 times more chloride than Detroit's water, a chemical that is highly corrosive to metals. Most residents in Flint have decades-old lead service lines that connect their homes to the city's main water pipes. When water from the river flowed through those pipes, it ate away at their insides, allowing lead to enter the supply. Here's what it looked like after the switch -- with red used to connote lead, a colorless substance. [See 2nd graphic on the website at the source URL above.]

Don't drink the water
---------------------
Once Flint switched its water supply, most Flint residents knew it immediately. Residents described the water coming from their taps often as a brownish-yellow [see photo at the source URL above] and said it both smelled and tasted odd. [If the water is discolored and smells, why would you drink it? City officials should have caught this right away. - Mod.TG]

It was later discovered that the water was carrying significant amounts of lead, which can prove especially damaging to children. In October 2015, the city switched back to the Detroit water supply, but Flint's water is still deemed unsafe to drink.

America's lead poisoning problem isn't just in Flint. It's everywhere.

The city of Flint, Michigan, is in the midst of a terrible and rightly shocking lead poisoning crisis. The number of kids testing positive for elevated lead levels in their bloodstreams has doubled in the past few years, after the city switched to a new, cheaper water source.

This is an extreme case, but the problem of lead exposure among children is not a local Flint story. If you look at public health data, you begin to realize 2 things. The 1st is that it's actually really hard to get good data on which kids do and don't experience lead exposure, and which parents should worry about the issue.

Second: the data that are available show that lead exposure is a pervasive issue in the United States. In some places outside of Flint, more than half of children test positive for lead poisoning.

A total of [10] counties nationwide told the CDC that 10 percent or more of their lead poisoning tests came back positive. 4 of them are in Louisiana, 2 in Alabama, and the rest scattered across West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Oklahoma.

These are places that have told the federal government they actually have higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint, where officials say the number hovers around 4 percent. But these aren't places we talk about that much.

Of the 3143 counties in the United States, only 1573 reported lead poisoning data in 2014. 44 percent of those counties reported no confirmed cases of lead in the bloodstream. But there are also the [10] counties, largely in the south, where more than 10 percent of kids tested positive.

21 states do not regularly submit data to the CDC on lead surveillance programs in their states. 11 of those 21 states do not submit any kind of lead surveillance data to the CDC -- no state-level or county-level data. The other 10 states do submit data, but many haven't submitted anything in the past 2 years. For instance, North Carolina hasn't submitted its data since 2009. The states that don't submit any data include Alaska, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.

That means there are 1570 counties for which we don't have any data, because states are not mandated to submit their data to the CDC. [And according to the map on the original site, not all states report these data. Consequently, this number of counties is only reflective of the states that report. There are many states that do not report. - Mod.TG]

Childhood lead exposure at nearly any level can lead to permanent learning disabilities, lower IQs, and even ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]. Blood lead levels once believed to be safe -- 30 microg/dL [micrograms per deciliter or per 100 milliliters] in the 1970s, then 25, then 15, then 10 -- are now known to cause irreversible damage. The Environmental Protection Agency now says there is "no demonstrated safe concentration of lead in blood," and even levels as low as 2 microg/dL can reduce a child's IQ. CDC data estimate that almost 500 000 children in the US between the ages of 1 and 5 have a blood lead level above the 5 microg/dL standard.

[This article continues with additional information, maps, and statistics of states and counties that report and those that don't, and graphs regarding changing in reporting and blood lead levels over several years. - Mod.TG]

[In March 2013, the Flint city council voted to switch their water supply from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) to the new USD 233 million Lake Huron-sourced Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) [1]. The switch was approved by the Flint emergency manager [2]. DWSD strongly opposed Flint being allowed to join KWA and released a document accusing Flint of starting a 'water war' and asked the state to block Flint's participation in KWA [3]. Between 2011 and 2015, Flint was in receivership, with city finances controlled by a series of 4 emergency managers appointed by Governor Snyder [4].

State Treasurer Andy Dillon approved Flint joining KWA but gave DWSD the opportunity to make a final offer to convince Flint to stay on Detroit water [5]. Flint declined the final DWSD offer. Immediately after Flint declined the offer, DWSD gave Flint notice that their long-standing water agreement would terminate in 12 months [6]. This meant that Flint's water agreement with Detroit would end in April 2014 but construction of KWA was not expected to be completed until the end of 2016. Therefore, in April 2014 (when the water agreement terminated), Flint switched their water supply from DWSD to Flint's backup supply, the Flint River. The Flint River was expected to supply potable water until KWA construction was completed in 2016. Given that DWSD strongly opposed Flint joining KWA and that Flint provided 6 percent (USD 22 million) of DWSD revenue, it is not clear why DWSD terminated the agreement in 2013 as they could have received revenue for at least 2 additional years and they did not have a buyer waiting to take over the Flint water [7]. (The preceding 2 paragraphs were sourced from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis, and the references (see ** below) renumbered accordingly)

CDC determined that lead concentrations in drinking water should be below the EPA action level of 15 parts per billion because no safe blood level has been identified for young children, all sources of lead exposure for children should be controlled or eliminated (http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm).

Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in the earth's crust, but human activity -- mining, burning fossil fuels, and manufacturing -- has caused it to become more widespread. Lead was also once a key ingredient in paint and gasoline and is still used in batteries, solder, pipes, pottery, roofing materials, and some cosmetics.

Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds up in the body, often over a period of months or years. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

There is a long list of ways to encounter lead:
- Houses painted before 1978. Even if the paint is not peeling, it can be a problem. Lead paint is very dangerous when it is being stripped or sanded. These actions release fine lead dust into the air. Infants and children living in pre-1960's housing (when paint often contained lead) have the highest risk of lead poisoning. Small children often swallow paint chips or dust from lead-based paint.
- Toys and furniture painted before 1976.
- Painted toys and decorations made outside the US.
- Lead bullets, fishing sinkers, curtain weights.
- Plumbing, pipes, and faucets. Lead can be found in drinking water in homes containing pipes that were connected with lead solder. Although new building codes require lead-free solder, lead is still found in some modern faucets.
- Soil contaminated by decades of car exhaust or years of house paint scrapings. Lead is more common in soil near highways and houses.
- Hobbies involving soldering, stained glass, jewelry making, pottery glazing, and miniature lead figures (always look at labels).
- Children's paint sets and art supplies (always look at labels).
- Pewter pitchers and dinnerware.
- Storage batteries.
Children get lead in their bodies when they put lead objects in their mouths, especially if they swallow those objects. They can also get lead poison on their fingers from touching a dusty or peeling lead object, and then putting their fingers in their mouths or eating food afterwards. Children also can breathe in tiny amounts of lead.

Symptoms
--------
There are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms.

However, it is more common for lead poisoning to build up slowly over time. This occurs from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead. In this case, there may not be any obvious symptoms. Over time, even low levels of lead exposure can harm a child's mental development. The health problems get worse as the level of lead in the blood gets higher.

Lead is much more harmful to children than adults because it can affect their developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable.

Possible complications include:
- Behavior or attention problems
- Failure at school
- Hearing problems
- Kidney damage
- Reduced IQ
- Slowed body growth

The symptoms of lead poisoning may include:
- Abdominal pain and cramping (usually the 1st sign of a high, toxic dose of lead poison)
- Aggressive behavior
- Anemia
- Constipation
- Difficulty getting pregnant
- Difficulty sleeping
- Headaches
- Hearing loss
- Irritability
- Loss of previous developmental skills (in young children)
- Low appetite and energy
- Reduced sensations
Very high levels of lead may cause vomiting, staggering walk, muscle weakness, seizures, or coma.

Exposure to even low levels of lead can cause damage over time, especially in children. The greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage may occur. Higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults. Very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness, and possibly death.

People with higher lead levels have a greater risk of long-lasting health problems. They must be followed carefully. Their nerves and muscles can be greatly affected and may no longer function as well as they should. Other body systems may be harmed to various degrees, such as the kidneys and blood vessels. People who survive toxic lead levels may have some permanent brain damage. Children are more vulnerable to serious long-term problems.

A complete recovery from chronic lead poisoning may take months to years.
(https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002473.htm)

Alternative names for lead poisoning are plumbism, colica pictorum, saturnism, Devon colic, or painter's colic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning).

Doctors usually use a simple blood test to detect lead poisoning. A small blood sample is taken from a finger prick or from a vein. Lead levels in the blood are measured in micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL). A level of 5 mcg/dL or higher indicates your child may have unsafe levels of lead in their blood and should have their blood tested periodically. If levels become too high -- generally 45 mcg/dL or higher -- your child should be treated.

The 1st step in treating all degrees of lead poisoning is to remove the source of the contamination. If you can't remove lead from your environment, you may at least be able to reduce the likelihood that it will cause problems. For instance, sometimes it's better to seal in rather than remove old lead paint. Your local health department can recommend ways to identify and reduce lead in your home and community.

For children and adults with relatively low lead levels, simply avoiding exposure to lead may be enough to reduce blood lead levels.

For more severe cases, your doctor may recommend:
- chelation therapy. In this treatment, you take a medication that binds with the lead so that it's excreted in your urine.
- EDTA therapy. Doctors treat adults with lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL of blood with one or more of 3 drugs, most commonly a chemical called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, or edetic acid). Depending on your lead level, you may need more than one treatment. In such severe cases, however, it may not be possible to reverse damage that has already occurred.

Children may need chelation therapy at lower levels than adults do.
