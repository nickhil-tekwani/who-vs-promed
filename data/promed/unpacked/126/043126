This year's [2022] Japanese encephalitis outbreak was at least 6 times larger than health authorities originally thought, prompting warnings NSW must be prepared for more tropical infections with another wet summer ahead.

A serolological survey conducted by NSW Health using blood samples from 917 people in the Griffith, Temora, Corowa, Balranald and Dubbo regions found 1 in 11 -- or 80 people -- showed evidence of previous infection.

The survey excluded people who had been vaccinated against the disease, or had been born in or spent more than one month in a country where the virus is commonly found.

Just 13 cases of the mosquito-borne illness were confirmed in the state during an outbreak across January and February this year [2022], linked to piggeries in the state's south and west.

There are 2 men who died from the disease: a man in his 60s from the Corowa area and a man in his 70s from Griffith. Deaths from the virus were also recorded in regional areas of Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, in what was the country's 1st detection of the virus in humans since an outbreak in the Torres Strait in 1995.

While Japanese encephalitis infection can be a serious disease, only 1% of people infected will experience symptoms.

"The results of this serosurvey provide us with valuable insight into the prevalence of past Japanese encephalitis infections in these communities after it was first detected earlier this year [2022]," NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.

With concerns another outbreak could occur this summer [2022], NSW is expanding its free Japanese encephalitis vaccination program, to anyone over the age of 50 who spends more than 4 hours a day outside and lives and works in specific council areas, including Albury, Dubbo and Griffith. The program was previously limited to people working with pigs or mosquitoes in affected areas.

"Vaccination is an important part of the public health response but, currently, global supply of [the] vaccine is very limited, so we're urging people to protect themselves by avoiding mosquito bites altogether, particularly as we head into warmer months," Chant said.

Scott Ritchie, a professor at the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, said the parameters of the study and the absence of cases in mainland Australia for decades meant that the extra cases detected through the serology survey were "undoubtedly" part of the outbreak, rather than infections picked up at an earlier time.

With another wet summer forecast for the state, Ritchie said it was likely Japanese encephalitis would be detected again this summer [2022]. However, transmission patterns may be smaller even if the number of official cases rise.

"Diseases that are new come into a naive population, so you have this big explosion in cases," he explained. "But then in the following years you've got some degree of herd immunity, including in animals."

"I can't imagine transmission will be as great as it was last year [2021], but you need to remember that we will be looking for it. So we could have less transmission but pick up more cases because people are testing and aware of the symptoms."

Dr Ali Zaid, a viral immunologist at the Menzies Health Institute in Queensland, said it was "reasonable to assume" the previous infections were from this year [2022], although the asymptomatic nature of most Japanese encephalitis cases meant previous outbreaks in mainland Australia may have been missed.

He said mosquito-borne viruses would be an ongoing problem.

"Even before the 2nd La Nina event was announced, around the time the Northern Rivers areas was really underwater, it was already apparent there would be enough waterlogging for the mosquitoes to breed and continue their cycle," he warned.

[With the oncoming summer season in Australia, it will be interesting to see if Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission resumes. Much will depend on how abundant the vector mosquito population becomes. There is no specific information in the above report about the plans for surveillance. Presumably, the presence of JEV in mosquito populations will be monitored. Perhaps sentinel pig herds will be followed over time in key geographic areas. The expansion of vaccination of individuals who might be at risk of infection is prudent. - Mod.TY
