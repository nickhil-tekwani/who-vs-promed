Epidemiological week 5, 27 Jan-2 Feb 2020
-----------------------------------------

Key points
Table 1: Summary of current week (5) indicators
Suspected cases: 531
Confirmed cases: 104
Probable cases: 0
Deaths: 6
Case fatality rate (CFR): 5.8%
Number of states affected: 15
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 39

Table 2: Cumulative data compared with previous year (weeks 1-5)
Suspected cases
- 2019: 794
- 2020: 1226
Confirmed cases
- 2019: 294
- 2020: 365
Deaths for confirmed cases
- 2019: 52
- 2020: 47
CFR%
- 2019: 17.7%
- 2020: 12.9%

Highlights
- In week 5, the number of new confirmed cases has increased from 95 cases in week 4, 2020 to 104 cases. These were reported from 15 states (Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Delta, Taraba, Plateau, Bauchi, FCT, Gombe, Enugu, Kebbi and Anambra) (see Table 3 at source URL).
- The number of deaths has decreased compared with the previous week, with 6 deaths reported in week 5. Cumulatively from weeks 1 to 5, 2020, 47 deaths have been reported with a CFR of 12.9%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (17.7%) (Table 2).
- In total for 2020, 23 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 74 LGAs (see Figure 3 at source URL).
- Of all confirmed cases, 76% are from Edo (35%), Ondo (35%) and Ebonyi (6%) states.
- The predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (range: less than 1 to 78 years, median age: 33 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (see Figure 4 at source URL).
- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared with that reported for the same period in 2019.
- One new healthcare worker was affected in Delta state in the reporting week 5.

Response activities
- The National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to coordinate response activities across states. Of the states with confirmed cases, 8 of them have activated state-level EOCs.
- Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 5 states.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre are activated in affected states.
- The 5 molecular laboratories for Lassa fever testing in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.

Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever EOC.
Case definitions:
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss and either (a) History of contact with excreta or urine of rodents (b) History of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.
- Active state: where there has been at least one confirmed case, and contacts within 21 days postexposure.
Calculations:
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[The 104 new confirmed and 531 suspected cases in week 5 of 2020 indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing to accelerate. There are now 47 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). There was one infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 5). The report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. Nigeria is now well into the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
