Experts call for end to mass slaughter
--------------------------------------
Experts at an urgent meeting on bird flu will urge animal vaccination as an
alternative to slaughtering millions more birds in efforts to contain the
disease, which has claimed 15 [human] lives in Asia.
Officials from the Food and Agriculture Organisation [FAO], the World
Health Organisation [WHO], authorities from affected countries, and other
experts began meeting yesterday to find a unified approach to tackling the
disease.
"People totally agree that we don't need to kill so many chickens or
birds," said Hualan Chen of the Chinese Agriculture Ministry.
Dewan Sibartie of the World Animal Health Organisation [OIE] said the
meetings recommendations included "the option of vaccination."
Health officials have said safely destroying infected birds is the best way
to contain the disease, but mass slaughter and import bans have ravaged
Asia's poultry industry.
Experts also fear that threatened species could come under threat if too
many wild birds are culled. Some 50 million chickens have already been
slaughtered in hopes of containing the disease.
The conference, held at the UN food agency's headquarters in Rome, will
present its findings at a news conference tomorrow. The recommendations
will focus on coordination, surveillance, and transparency in reporting,
the FAO said.
Sibartie said some affected countries had failed to pass on local
information about outbreaks to the OIE within the required time frame of 24
hours. "Had they reported in time, we could have taken more timely action.
We could have provided expertise and other kinds of assistance a long time
back," Sibartie said.
In a conference call with representatives from affected countries,
including China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia, experts stressed
that withholding information would let the disease to spread further and
cripple trade.
"I think we made very clear to them the importance of transparent and
timely reporting and I think they have got the message," Sibartie said.
Juan Lubroth, an animal health official at the FAO, said that the
recommendations would include human-protection measures. For example, those
involved in clean-up operations at poultry farms will be made to wear
protective gear and trained on how to use it. "We've also discussed
rehabilitation: how can we get villages and even countries back onto their
feet," Lubroth said.
Measures would include restocking culled animals and re-evaluating
bio-security procedures to encourage good farming practices, he said.
The slowly mounting human death toll has added urgency to the question
about how avian influenza, or bird flu, is spread.
Although 10 countries are battling bird flu, cases in humans have been
reported only in Viet Nam and Thailand. Most of the infections have been
traced to direct contact with sick birds.
[Byline: Aidan Lewis]
[The title of this article might be somewhat misleading; affected farms are
not likely to be vaccinated. Most probably, the experts do not see the
destruction of poultry around the foci as the only way to contain the
outbreak, but include the option of (preventive) vaccination for such
farms/districts as an alternative measure. This policy might be based upon
experience gathered during previous epizootics of highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI), such as the Dutch one in 2003. Final recommendations are
anticipated.
The FAO is to manage Technical Cooperation Projects to assist affected
countries in their endeavors to control the outbreaks and rehabilitate
their poultry industries, while maintaining strong links with OIE and WHO.

China confirms another H5N1 outbreak
-------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on Wednesday confirmed a previously
suspected outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in Chenggong
County in Yunnan Province, southwest China.
The confirmation was based on the report from the National Bird Flu
Reference Laboratory. No person has been reported to have contracted the
disease so far.
The local government has been taking measures including fowl slaughter and
compulsory vaccination to prevent the spread of the outbreak.
In addition, the ministry on Wednesday announced 2 more areas where
suspected outbreaks of bird flu cases have been found. The 2 areas are
Guandu District of Kunming, Yunnan's capital city, and Gaolan County of
Gansu Province, northwest China.
As soon as the suspected cases were spotted, local governments began
slaughtering chickens and implementing compulsory vaccination. Samples have
been sent to the National Bird Flu Reference Laboratory.

3 features for bird flu in mainland
---------------------------------------
The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or bird flu, outbreaks in China have
3 features, a press release by the Ministry of Agriculture issued at a
press conference on bird flu situations said on Thursday.
Firstly, they occurred in spots that are widely scattered. Secondly, the
situations were more serious in southern China, while outbreaks were
reported largely in central, eastern and southern China. Thirdly, the
virulence of the virus was relatively stronger, according to the press release.
Besides causing disease and death in large number of chickens, the sub-type
H5N1 strain that affected Chinese mainland can also cause disease and death
in other poultry such as ducks and geese. In bird flu cases found so far in
China, 16 cases are with chickens, 5 with ducks, and 2 with geese. By 4 Feb
2004, there have been altogether 23 bird flu cases [outbreaks] in China,
including 18 suspected cases, and 5 confirmed ones since the first
confirmed case was announced on 27 Jan 2004
[A report on the Avian influenza situation in China has been received by
the OIE on 4 Feb 2004 from Dr. Shen Zhenzhao, Ministry of Agriculture, P.R.
China; this first official report, regarding the current outbreak, to the
OIE is included in OIE's "update on AI in animals in Asia" of 4 Feb 2004
<http://www.oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>).
According to the detailed (5-page) report, the following 12 regions have so
far been found infected (date of first report in brackets):
1. Guangxi Autonomous Region (27 Jan 2004)
2. Hubei Province (26 Jan 2004)
3. Hunan Province (26 Jan 2004)
4. Anhui Province (30 Jan 2004)
5. Guangdong Province (30 Jan 2004)
6. Shanghai (30 Jan 2004)
7. Zhejiang (1 Feb 2004)
8. Yunnan Province (1 Feb 2004)
9. Henan Province (1 Feb 2004)
10. Xinjiang Production and construction Corps (1 Feb 2004)
11. Gansu Province (1 Feb 2004)
12. Shanxi Province (3 Feb 2004)
China reported, in its annual reports to the OIE, that vaccinations against
HPAI have been carried out since 2002.

Information on the characteristics of the vaccine in use and the applied
vaccination policy will be useful. - Mod.AS]

UN food agency gives aid to 4 Asian countries hit by bird flu outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The United Nations food arm has announced it is giving 4 Asian countries --
Cambodia, Laos, Pakistan, and Viet Nam -- USD 1.6 million to help them
battle the recent outbreak of avian influenza or "bird flu."
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) created the emergency aid
package after a request from the 4 nations to improve their emergency
disease control and surveillance systems.
He Changchui, head of the FAO's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific,
said yesterday the aid would be sent immediately. "More international
assistance is needed to enable poorer countries to better deal with the
crisis," he said.
At least 13 people have died in Viet Nam and Thailand as a result of
contracting the H5N1 virus strain in the current outbreak. Millions of
domestic birds have died or been slaughtered in the Republic of Korea, Viet
Nam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, China, Laos, Pakistan, Taiwan (Province of
China), and Indonesia since December 2003.
The aid package will be used to prepare a zoning plan for culling birds, to
train farmers and government workers on safe disposal and disinfection, to
provide protective gear, equipment and laboratory supplies for making rapid
diagnoses, and to begin national epidemiological studies of the disease.
Meanwhile at FAO headquarters in Rome, health and veterinary experts are
today wrapping up a 2-day meeting on the outbreak organized by the FAO, the
UN World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Animal Health
Organization (OIE).
