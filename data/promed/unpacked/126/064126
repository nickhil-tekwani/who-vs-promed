Bad weather in Sindh and a disease known as 'powdery mildew' in
Punjab has damaged the crop of mango. Experts, who were predicting a
bumper crop, now stress that this year's [2007] crop would be better
than last year's [2006], but not as good as they had expected.
According to Khawaja Muhammad Shoaib of Farmers Vision Forum,
hailstorms have badly damaged the mango crop in Hyderabad, Tandu
Adam, Tandu Allah Yar, and adjoining areas of these districts in
Sindh, while February [2007] rains damaged the crop in Punjab.
However, he said, the sudden start of a heat wave after the rain
helped control the damage, but the crop would be late by about 15
days in Punjab.
The President of the Mango Growers Association, Zahid Ali Gerdezi,
said that there was a need to improve harvest technology with
emphasis on cold chain systems and establishment of export processing
zones in mango farm areas.
Shamoon Sadiq, chief executive officer of the Pakistan Horticulture
Development and Export Board, told this correspondent that 7
mango-exporting groups applied for the Euro-gape certificates that
would make them eligible to export mango to Europe. He confirmed that
hailstorms and powdery mildew infection had slightly damaged the crop.
Pakistan is the 6th largest mango producing country of the world.
Major markets for Pakistani mango are the UAE [United Arab Emirates],
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Amman, France, Afghanistan, Germany, Bahrain,
and the UK.

[Mango powdery mildew (_Oidium mangiferae_) is found in all mango
growing areas. It is one of the most serious diseases of mango,
affecting almost all the varieties to varying degrees. The disease is
reported to cause crop losses of up to 80 percent on individual
plants. Damage may often be underestimated when disease outbreaks
occur early in the flowering stage.
The pathogen causes a white 'powdery' fungal growth parasitizing
young tissues on leaves, stalks of panicles, flowers, and young
fruits. The affected flowers and fruits drop prematurely or fruit set
may be prevented.
The fungus is spread by spores produced in the white patches of
mycelium. The spores are dispersed by wind, water, or mechanical
movements. Rains or mists accompanied by cooler nights during
flowering favor disease spread. During the winter the fungus survives
on infected plant parts and in debris such as fallen leaves.
Fungicides are used for disease control.
Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a
range of host plants. Generally, each species of fungus is confined
to a number of host species it affects. Powdery mildews cause serious
losses in many important crops including grapevine, hops, cereal, and
vegetable species.
