Illinois health officials say they're investigating 2 additional reports of patients developing abscesses after receiving potentially contaminated steroid injections at a clinic. The Illinois Department of Public Health said on Fri 31 May 2013 that the additional patients -- like the earlier cases -- had received injections at the Logan Primary Care clinic in the Williamson County town of Herrin. Last week [week of 20 May 2013], the state health department announced that 5 patients had developed similar infections after the injections.

The steroid is methylprednisolone acetate, and was produced by a compounding pharmacy in Tennessee. The pharmacy has voluntarily recalled all its sterile products. The steroid is the same drug [as was] at the center of last year's [2012] deadly outbreak of fungal meningitis, caused by contaminated injections from a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy.

Health officials say no cases of meningitis have been reported.

[Several more cases are reported. It is not yet known how many potentially contaminated vials were distributed and used. Likewise, no further information has been made available about the fungus isolated in one patient and if it was isolated from other patients or any unused vials. - Mod.LL
