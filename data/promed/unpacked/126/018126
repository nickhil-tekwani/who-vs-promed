Beijing reports 1st case of H7N9 infection
---------------
- A 7-year-old girl in Beijing was infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu, the 1st such case in Beijing.
- The child is being treated at the Beijing Ditan Hospital, and is in stable condition.
- The new case raised the number of H7N9 infections in China to 44.

A 7-year-old girl in Beijing was infected with the H7N9 strain of bird flu, the 1st such case in the Chinese capital, local health authorities said Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

The case was confirmed following a test by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention early on Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

The child is being treated at the Beijing Ditan Hospital, and is in stable condition, Zhong Dongbo, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, said in a press briefing.

The girl developed flu symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat and headache, Thursday [11 Apr 2013] morning. She was brought to the Beijing Ditan Hospital to seek medical treatment around noon and was then hospitalized for lung infection.

The child received the drug Tamiflu as well as intravenous drips on Thursday[11 Apr 2013] night and later was transferred to an intensive care unit after condition worsened. After an oxygen therapy and other treatment, her suffocation and coughing symptoms eased markedly and body temperature fell to 37 degrees Celsius from 40.2 degrees Celsius, a spokesman with the Beijing Ditan Hospital said.

Two people who have had close contact with the child have not shown any flu symptoms, a spokesman said. He added that the girl's parents were engaged in live poultry trading in a township of Shunyi District in Beijing's northeastern suburbs.

The new case raised the number of H7N9 infections in China to 44, with all the other 43 in the eastern parts of the country. The 1st known human infections have claimed the lives of 11 people, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

First human H7N9 bird flu case in Beijing confirmed
----------------
A 7-year-old girl was confirmed as Beijing's 1st human case of H7N9 bird flu on Saturday [13 Apr 2013], local authorities said, as China's outbreak of the disease spread to the capital.

The girl, whose parents are poultry traders, was in a stable condition in hospital, the Beijing health bureau said. Her mother and father had been quarantined for observation but had shown no symptoms so far, it added.

She developed a fever, sore throat and headache on Thursday [11 Apr 2013], it said, and her parents took her to hospital. Samples from her tested positive H7N9 the following day, and the national disease control centre confirmed the results on Saturday [13 Apr 2013].

Chinese officials announced nearly 2 weeks ago that they had found the H7N9 strain in humans for the 1st time, and the girl brought the number of confirmed infections in the outbreak to 44, 11 of whom have died.

All previous cases had been confined to eastern China.

Experts fear the prospect of such viruses mutating into a form easily transmissible between humans has the potential to trigger a pandemic.

But the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week that there was as yet no evidence of human-to-human transmission of H7N9.

Health authorities in China say they do not know exactly how the virus is spreading, but it is believed to be crossing to humans from birds, triggering mass poultry culls in several cities.

The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FA0) has said H7N9 shows "affinity" to humans while causing "very mild or no disease" in infected poultry, making finding the source of transmission more difficult.

The statement from the Beijing health bureau did not say whether the girl or her family members had recently travelled to any of the areas where H7N9 infections have been identified.

But Cheng Jun, vice-director of Ditan hospital, where the girl was being treated, told state broadcaster CCTV: "Ever since the outbreak started in Shanghai we have been making preparations."

Beijing, which has a population of more than 20 million, has already banned live poultry trading and pigeon releases, the health bureau said.

Authorities have also ordered stepped-up surveillance of wild birds in the city and people at risk of infection, such as poultry farmers, transporters and vendors, it added.

Shanghai has had 20 confirmed cases so far and was the 1st to halt trading in live poultry and cull birds last week, followed by other cities in eastern China.

US fast food giant KFC, already hit by an earlier scandal in China over antibiotics in chicken, saw March [2013] sales in the country plunge 16 percent, with parent Yum! Brands saying bird flu publicity had "a significant, negative impact".

In 2003 Beijing was accused of trying to cover up the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which went on to kill about 800 people globally.

But it has been praised for transparency over H7N9, with the WHO saying it was pleased with the level of information sharing and US scientists congratulating it for "the apparent speed with which the H7N9 virus was identified" in a New England Journal of Medicine article.

China has said it expects to have a vaccine ready in 7 months but in the article the US experts said developing one could take "many months".

All provincial regions can test for H7N9: authority
------------------------
All influenza network laboratories in the 31 provincial regions on China's mainland are now capable of testing for the H7N9 bird flu virus, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) said Friday.

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDCP) has sent a total of 160 000 samples of test reagents to the laboratories in all the provincial regions, the NHFPC said.

CCDCP director Wang Yu said it developed the test reagents as quickly as possible in a bid to better control H7N9 bird flu.

As of Thursday [11 Apr 2013], a total of 38 people had been infected with H7N9 bird flu in China's mainland, including 10 that have died. [As of this morning, 13 Apr 2013, there have been a total of 44 confirmed cases with 11 deaths].

Wang added that the next step of CCDCP's work is to strengthen the monitoring of key regions, including some areas that have had no reports of H7N9 cases so far.

The CCDCP will focus on changes in the virus, such as its drug resistance and variations of its gene sequences, in a bid to find the variation that can lead to human-to-human transmission, Wang said.

[This is the 1st confirmation of H7N9 human disease outside of the initial 4 provinces where cases has been reported - Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. (see prior ProMED-mail reports listed below for details).

In the 3rd newswire presented above [3] from yesterday (12 Apr 2013) there was mention that the Government of China had distributed testing materials to all 31 provinces to ensure the capabilities to adequately diagnose H7N9 infection. It was not surprising that shortly there after there is confirmation of a case in another province. Of note, in another ProMED-mail post from yesterday (12 Apr 2013), a newswire mentioned that Beijing was prepared to face the introduction of H7N9, both in terms of avian surveillance as well as case management (see http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20130412/105444.shtml in prior ProMED-mail post Avian influenza (35): China, LPAI H7N9, update 20130412.1641185).

If one looks at a map of China showing provinces, one can see that Beijing is to the Northwest of Jiangsu province, separated by 2 other provinces. (see http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png for a map of China showing provinces). This moderator does not have the expertise to comment re: the possible role of migratory birds in possible transmission of the H7N1 into new geographic areas along the flyways (which in northern hemisphere springtime have the movement of birds to the north) vs the role of humans transporting domestic fowl from one area to another; either mechanism might result in a relatively silent movement of this organism as it is a low pathogenic avian influenza virus with minimal to no clinical illness in infected avians. (For information on the East Asia Australasia bird flyways, see http://www.cms.int/publications/pdf/Flyways/CMS_Flyways_2012_Internet.pdf and http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/userfiles/file/sowb/flyways/8_East_Asia_Australasia_Factsheet.pdf)

As stated in the above newswires, this case's father works in the live poultry trading sector, so the possibility of exposure to live fowl either local or imported from other provinces is there. - Mod.MPP]
