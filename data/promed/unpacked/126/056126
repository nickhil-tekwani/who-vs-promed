This is indeed an encouraging development and a plus for all those involved
in the program.
It further reinforces that collaborative multidisciplinary based public
health practice should be a major focal point as we forge ahead into the
next hundred years. I would like to ask how and where the borders around the
drop-zones were defined and maintained? What quarantine measures were
incoming animal traffic(from outside the various drop zones) subjected to --
whether from outside the zones, the state of Texas or the US?

The borders of the drop-zones for the Oral Rabies Vaccination Program (ORVP)
in South and West-Central Texas have been determined by epidemiologic
surveillance. Vaccine has been distributed on a yearly basis along the
epizootics* outermost boundaries, which were determined by the location of
laboratory-confirmed rabies cases.
In 1995, prior to the first implementation of the ORVP, an emergency
statewide rabies quarantine was enacted. Although it has been modified
through the years, it is still in effect. In essence, Texas Health and
Safety Code, Ch. 826, Rabies Control Act, Rules of the Board of Health
prohibits the transport of coyotes, raccoons, or species of foxes indigenous
to North America from, to, or within the State of Texas except by specified
categories of individuals.
