In Alex Langmuir´s article (The philosophy of disease eradication, AJPH
53(1)) he says: "While the unqualified word 'eradication' may be understood
to signify the
world-wide extermination of a biological species, e.g. of an agent or a
vector or a reservoir of human disease, our use of the expression, disease
eradication, is restricted to its application on a state, regional,
island-wide, continental, or on any substantial area or population basis,
so long as its extent is clearly delineated."
The problem lies with the use of the same word in relation to a biological
species and to the transmission of a disease. In scientific terms,
eradication means the complete extinction of a species from the biosphere.
But in practical terms, eradication is used to signify the suppression or
cessation of the transmission of a disease in a certain region, or in the
world. Luis Rey in his "Dicionario de Medicina e Saude" quotes the WHO in
1992 to restrict eradication to the disappearance of a disease from the
whole world.
So, when dealing with a disease that has non-human hosts and vectors, it
must be made clear if we are speaking of the "eradication" of the disease
in humans, or if we mean the "eradication" of the agent, vectors and
reservoirs - permanently.

[Our thanks to Fernando, but we´ll stick with the latest definition, with
'eradication' meaning species extinction from the world. This thread is
now cut. - Mod.JW
