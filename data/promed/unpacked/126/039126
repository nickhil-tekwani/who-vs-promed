The Ministry of Health's Preventive Healthcare Department has urged people to protect themselves against outbreaks of dengue fever, a disease spread by mosquitoes.

The department has urged people to clean places where mosquitoes and larvae may be prevalent, such as bushes, and kill the insects to stop the spread of dengue fever.

According to the Ministry's statistics, 51 000 people contracted dengue fever across the nation since the beginning of the year [2012], and 42 of these cases resulted in fatalities.

Cases of dengue have risen rapidly in recent months. In September [2012] alone,
13 000 cases were reported, including 13 deaths. The department warned that August and September are a peak time for outbreaks of the disease, and early rains this season [2012] along with urbanisation have exacerbated the situation.

Statistics from Ha Noi's Preventive Healthcare Centre meanwhile reveal 450 cases recorded in the capital city so far this year [2012], a 50 per cent decrease compared with the same period last year.

Dr Sirichai Pataranutaporn, a public health medical official of Lampang province, has made it known that following the flooding situation and severe rainfall within the province, additional cases of patients with dengue fever have been reported. Within 2 weeks, there have been reports of over 30 cases. There are a total of 171 confirmed cases of patients afflicted with dengue fever.

Local governing bodies must be prepared in terms of materials and equipment to control and prevent the disease. They must also coordinate with public health officers in the area to contain the disease if it is detected. Containers that can trap water, such as bottles, cans, and container fragments in public areas, must be collected and eliminated in order to reduce breeding grounds for mosquitoes. All citizens can take part in preventing the birth of mosquito larvae, whether it be at home, in their villages, their communities, temples, schools, or government spaces.
