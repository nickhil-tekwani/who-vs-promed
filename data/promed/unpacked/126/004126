Chicken-to-man VRE?
This is, apparently, the first reported case of human VRE infection where
the probable source was animals colonised with VRE'
The link between animal colonisation with vancomycin-resistant enterococci
(VRE) and human infection is contentious. Avoparcin, a glycopeptide, is used
as a growth promoter in farm animals. Animals that are treated with
avoparcin are commonly colonised with VRE.
Das and colleagues report a community-acquired infection in a man who worked
for a chicken-packaging factory. Preliminary findings indicate an
occupationally acquired infection from poultry. The man was admitted to
hospital with a compound fracture and a wound swab grew vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis. 41% of swabs collected from chicken carcasses and the
enviroment of the packaging factory grew VRE.
