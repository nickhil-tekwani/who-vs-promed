[According to the report of the GF-TAD's Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe 15th meeting (SGE ASF15) 6 May 2020 (teleconference) https://rr-europe.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a_report_sge-asf15.pdf, Russia reported the following: "Unfortunately, the huge territory and the fact that China is not reporting outbreaks in the [wild board (WB)] population, does not help Russia. The situation is worrying in the area bordering China and close to Europe and Eurasia. These are the zone where regionalization has been carried out through the Cerberus System. COVID-19 has impacted daily controls, especially surveillance related to WB hunting, as hunting activities are forbidden."
