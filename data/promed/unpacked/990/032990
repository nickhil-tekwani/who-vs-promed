State health secretary Dr Calvin B Johnson today [2 Mar 2007], advised
consumers who purchased raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy of New Salem, York
County, to immediately discard the raw milk due to the risk of
contamination with salmonella. Raw milk is milk that has not been
pasteurized or homogenized.
"We are working very closely with the Pennsylvania Department of
Agriculture to conduct local public health investigations," Dr Johnson
said. "If you have any raw milk from Stump Acres Dairy at home, do not
drink the milk and immediately discard it."
Individuals who drank raw milk purchased from Stump Acres Dairy and became
ill are advised to consult with their physician and are also urged to
contact their local health department. If no illness occurred, it is not
necessary to seek medical attention, but consumers should still discard the
raw milk.
This consumer advice is based on reports to the Department of Health about
2 confirmed cases and one probable case of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Typhimurium infection among York County residents who drank raw milk from
Stump Acres Dairy in February 2007. Additional cases of illness are suspected.
The Department of Agriculture has suspended sales of raw milk at the dairy
and is ensuring that corrective action is taken and that multiple
laboratory samples come back negative for salmonella before raw milk sales
can resume.
As part of the investigation, the Department of Agriculture obtained 3
positive milk cultures from the dairy. A milk sample obtained from
consumers also tested positive at the Department of Health's Bureau of
Laboratories.
Stump Acres Dairy has a customer base of about 250 clients. The customers
of the dairy are known to be from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. No
cases of salmonella infection have been identified at this time in the
other states.
The shelf life for raw milk is about 14 days but can be longer if the milk
is frozen. Freezing the milk will not kill the salmonella bacteria.

[This paragraph is adapted from ProMED-mail post E. coli O157,
unpasteurized milk, 2005 - USA (WA) 20070302.0741:
"Raw milk is a well-documented cause of enteric infections and was 1st
recognized as such about 100 years ago. Pathogens that infect humans,
including _Salmonella_, are shed in the feces of cows and can contaminate
milk during the milking process. Using standard hygiene practices during
milking (such as, washing hands, keeping equipment clean, and keeping the
milking area separated from other areas) can reduce but not eliminate the
risk for milk contamination. Pasteurization decreases the number of
pathogenic organisms, prevents transmission of pathogens, and has been
determined to improve the safety of raw milk more than other measures,
including certification of raw milk. Because raw milk certification has
failed to prevent many raw milk-associated infections in the past,
consumers should not assume that certified raw milk is free of pathogens.
To prevent salmonella and other infections, consumers should not drink raw
milk.
