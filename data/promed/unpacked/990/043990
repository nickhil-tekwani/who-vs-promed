Five horses have been quarantined in Maricopa County after a stallion
tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease.

The Arizona Department of Agriculture says the horse has contagious
equine metritis (CEM), which can cause spontaneous abortion and
infertility in mares.

Doctors say CEM has be transmitted through breeding practices like
artificial insemination and embryo transfer.

The state is working to trace mares that were bred to the positive
stallion this breeding season [2011]. Farm records show those mares
could be in 3 different states. All breeding samples from the horse
have also been quarantined.

Officials say the stallion was tested as part of a protocol to allow
international shipment for horse breeding.

The state says infected and exposed equine animals are being held
under movement restrictions by state animal health authorities, until
they complete veterinary treatment and are certified as CEM-negative.

[We certainly hope this is not the beginning of another major outbreak
of CEM like we had earlier, in late 2008 and most of 2009.

A good summary of the likely economic and trade impacts of CEM can be
found at the USDA-APHIS-CEAH (Centers for Epidemiology and Animal
Health) website at

[Sometimes contagious equine metritis (CEM) outbreaks don't spread and
are solved relatively simply. Other outbreaks, like the 2009 sequence
of events, are much more involved The 2009 USA outbreak led to the
exposure of close to 1000 horses as positive stallions can expose many
mares, sometimes in multiple states.

A detailed look at contagious equine metritis and the consequences can
be found in the moderator TG comments of ProMED-mail postings 20090116.0178 and 20090131.0442. - Mod. PC]
