Shifting weather and disease patterns mean phoma stem canker has crept up the order of concern. Virulence of the pathogen is increasing in some UK regions.

LS Plant Breeding [LSPB] is encouraging growers to consider varieties containing a new phoma-resistance gene. Selected from turnip rape, the RlmS gene provides a new varietal resistance alternative to the Rlm7 gene found in many established OSR varieties with phoma resistance.

Population monitoring has already shown an increase in isolates virulent to Rlm7, with 25% virulent against this gene in 2018. Mean phoma scores of OSR varieties with Rlm7 have consistently dropped over the past 6 years which suggests that this resistance gene is in danger of being overcome. This is already the case e.g. in France, where 90% of the crop is affected.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) of brassicas can be caused by two different fungi: _Leptosphaeria maculans_ inducing severe disease; or _Plenodomus biglobosus_ which has previously been reported in some areas in association with milder symptoms. Blackleg is the most serious disease of crops in the Brassicaceae family with a possible yield loss of 50% or more. The disease affects oilseed rape, turnip, turnip rape (oilseed turnip, _Brassica rapa_ ssp. _oleifera_), radish, mustard, vegetable brassicas (including various cabbages), as well as brassicaceous weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Depending on the host, symptoms may include lesions on leaves, stems and seed pods; stem cankers may lead to premature ripening or collapse of the plant. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may occur.

The pathogens are seed borne; spores are also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected plant litter. They may overwinter in crop residues, which are therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum, as well as fungicides. Cultivars with different levels of blackleg resistance are available for some of the crops. However, new strains of the pathogens evolve frequently and may be able to overcome host resistances or show new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of crop cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.
