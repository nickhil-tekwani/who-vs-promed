Officials in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin today [5 May 2015] reported a total of 14 more confirmed or probable H5N2 avian flu outbreaks on turkey and chicken farms, undermining hopes that warm spring weather would slow the virus's spread.

Minnesota reported 8 outbreaks, including 2 in previously untouched counties and one on a farm housing more than one million chickens. Iowa, the nation's leader in egg production, revealed 4 probable outbreaks, 3 of them on turkey farms, while Wisconsin had 2.

Agriculture officials have been saying that warmer weather with the advancing spring should slow the H5N2 virus, which does not survive as well in warm conditions. But so far, the pathogen seems to be defying such expectations.

The 2 newly affected counties in Minnesota are Nicollet, which is about 50 miles southwest of the Twin Cities, and Renville, which is just northwest of Nicollet. The Nicollet outbreak involves a farm with 1 102 900 chickens, while the Renville farm holds 12 900 turkeys, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) said in today's [5 May 2015] update. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) specified that the Nicollet County farm houses egg-laying hens.

In addition, 3 more outbreaks were reported in the state's top turkey-raising county, Kandiyohi, raising its total to 29. Two of the farms harbor 89 200 and 11 200 turkeys. The release did not list a number for the 3rd farm and said the barns there are being cleaned and disinfected because of exposure to potentially infected birds. The state also reported Pipestone County's 2nd outbreak, involving 72 900 turkeys, and the 4th and 5th events in Swift County, one farm having 72 200 turkeys and the flock size on the other one not yet determined. Pipestone is near the state's southwestern corner, while Swift is a west-central county that borders Kandiyohi.

The H5N2 toll in Minnesota has reached 80 farms in 21 counties, with about 5.34 million birds, not counting those on farms where flock sizes have not yet been reported, the DPS said. The state's annual turkey production is put at 46 million birds, making it the nation's leading producer.

The 4 new Iowa outbreaks include 3 turkey farms, but the one chicken farm is a big laying operation, with 2.8 million birds, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) said in today's [5 May 2015] update. Birds at all 4 sites tested positive for an H5 virus, with the full subtype yet to be determined, officials said, but, as in previous cases, confirmation of H5N2 seemed likely. The egg-farm outbreak in Wright County, in north-central Iowa, is the county's 1st. The 3 turkey outbreaks are the 7th and 8th outbreaks in Buena Vista County and the 2nd outbreak in Cherokee County; both counties are in northwestern Iowa. Estimates of the number of birds at each site were still awaited.

The new events raise Iowa's outbreak count to 25. With the Wright County egg farm toll, the number of layer hens lost appears to be close to 19 million of the state's total population of about 60 million layers, in view of numbers reported last week.

The 2 new Wisconsin outbreaks involve a Barron County farm with 14 600 breeding turkeys and a Jefferson County farm holding 127 970 chickens, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATPC) announced today [5 May 2015]. The 2 counties are far apart, with Barron in the northwest and Jefferson in the southeast. Barron County has had 3 previous H5N2 outbreaks, while Jefferson County had at least one, on a chicken farm in mid-April 2015.

Today's [5 May 2015] update said the state has now had a total of 10 outbreaks involving about 1.6 million birds. Other affected counties are Juneau and Chippewa.

Bird flu has struck its biggest operation yet in Minnesota, a farm with over 1.1 million chickens in Nicollet County of south-central Minnesota, and the number of farms hit by the virus across the state has now grown to 80.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health said Monday [4 May 2015] it's the 1st farm in Nicollet County with a presumptive positive test for the H2N2 virus, which has now cost Minnesota poultry producers over 5.3 million birds.

The board also reports that Renville County has seen its 1st outbreak, at a farm with 12 900 turkeys. And the board also reports new cases at turkey farms in Kandiyohi, Pipestone and Swift counties. The newly affected farms have been quarantined, and the remaining birds will be euthanized and kept out of the food supply.
