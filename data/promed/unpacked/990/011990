Mumps outbreak sweeps across Brighton and Hove
----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of mumps is continuing to sweep across Brighton and Hove.
There have been 46 confirmed cases of the virus in the city since
January compared to 27 for the whole of 2009. Health bosses say cases
are affecting both young adults and children and are concerned there
could be more to come before the outbreak is contained. One teenager
from Hove ended up in intensive care at the Royal Sussex County
Hospital in Brighton after being struck down by the virus. He is
still in hospital but no longer in intensive care and is progressing
well.

The outbreak has been blamed on the low uptake of the measles, mumps
and rubella [MMR] vaccine. The take up rate for the 1st of 2
recommended MMR jabs is currently at 82 percent but the percentage
having 2 doses is 69 percent. This is well below the 90 percent the
World Health Organisation says needs to be vaccinated to protect a
community.

Those affected are mainly young adults, who may have been too old
because the vaccine was not around when they were young. Others may
not have had the jab because of concerns about research published in
the late 1990s which suggested a link with autism. This study has
been largely discredited but take up rates have struggled to recover.

Cases of mumps have also emerged across the rest of the county [of
Sussex], with 25 in East Sussex so far this year and 18 in West
Sussex.

[A proposition that the combined vaccination for measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) might raise a child's risk of bowel disorders and
autism has proved to be one of the most controversial in medical
science for decades. In 1998 Dr Wakefield claimed he had evidence
that children's behaviour changed drastically shortly after they
received the triple MMR jab. Dr Wakefield theorised that the
combination of the 3 virus strains contained in MMR may overload the
body's immune system and cause the bowel disorder to develop.
Although his theories were discredited subsequently on the basis of
data for MMR vaccination accumulated throughout the world, the
controversy caused vaccination rates to fall sharply particularly in
the UK and Ireland. Although last week, Dr Wakefield was struck off
the Medical Register by the General Medical Council for serious
professional misconduct, lasting damage had been done and vaccination
rates are only now beginning to recover. The city of Brighton and
Hove has a large student population and appears to particularly badly
affected by the drop in overall MMR vaccine coverage.

The city of Brighton and Hove was established when 2 adjacent towns,
Brighton and Hove, joined together to become a city. Brighton and
Hove is in the county of Sussex on the south coaast of England and
