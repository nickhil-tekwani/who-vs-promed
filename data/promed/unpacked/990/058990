Saudi authorities have made a meningitis vaccination compulsory for all people planning to come for Hajj [annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca] this year [2015], according to sources. The Saudi foreign ministry has sent a circular abroad asking people to follow quarantine regulations while issuing visas to intending pilgrims, according to health ministry spokesman Khalid Al Mirghalani.

The pilgrims must be vaccinated against the disease at least 10 days before arriving in the Kingdom, he stated. Mirghalani further added that vaccinations against the disease are valid for up to 3 years, however, it is not administered to pregnant women.

He added that his ministry's national scientific committee would be monitoring all the pilgrims arriving from various countries. Teams of officials would be deployed at 14 ports of entry in the western province to look for infection cases among pilgrims.

[More than 2 million Muslims from over 183 countries make the Hajj pilgrimage each year. Because of intense crowding and high carrier rates of _Neisseria meningitidis_ among pilgrims, large epidemics of meningococcal disease have been linked to the Hajj pilgrimage, at first due to meningococcal serogroup A in 1987. After requiring vaccination with the bivalent A and C meningococcal vaccine for attending the Hajj, no further outbreaks due to serogroup A occurred, but then in 2000 and again in 2001, large epidemics due to meningococcal serogroup W135 occurred among pilgrims and their families.

A change in the Hajj pilgrimage requirements from bivalent to quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W135) meningococcal vaccine ended further meningococcal outbreaks. Pilgrims on Hajj or Umrah are required to present a certificate of vaccination with ACYW135, issued at least 10 days, but not more than 3 years before arrival. Hajj visas cannot be issued without proof of vaccination. Conjugated meningococcal vaccines are preferred over polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines because of lack of herd immunity and persistence of meningococcal carriage among vaccinated pilgrims with the polysaccharide vaccine. Menveo and Nimenrix are 2 conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W135 and Y); Nimenrix is conjugated to tetanus toxoid.

For the official documentation of full requirements for entry into Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, see the following websites:

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also outlined its recommendations for pilgrims during the Hajj (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-4-select-destinations/saudi-arabia-hajj-pilgrimage). These recommendations include restricting travel to only those in good health and being up to date on all routine vaccinations, which include vaccines for polio, influenza, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. CDC also recommends vaccinations for meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and B, and typhoid. - Mod.ML
