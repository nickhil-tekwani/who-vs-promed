The number of confirmed illnesses linked to a contaminated food dip has
risen to 16, with another 14 people showing similar symptoms in Washington,
the state Department of Health said.
The recalled dip is sold under the names Senor Felix 5 Layer Fiesta Dip,
Trader Joe's 5 Layer Fiesta Dip and Delicioso 5 Layer Fiesta Dip. It is
manufactured by Senor Felix of Baldwin Park, California, and is sold
locally at Costco, Trader Joe's, Wal-Mart and the Puget Consumers Co-op.
The dips were distributed nationwide, primarily through Costco and Trader
Joe's, according to the California Department of Health Services. The dips
contain layers of black beans, salsa, guacamole, nacho cheese and sour cream.
Thirty cases of shigellosis have been reported in Washington, and at least
16 of the victims had recently consumed the dip, the Department of Health
said.
Symptoms of shigellosis, caused by a bacteria, can include bloody diarrhea,
cramps, fever, nausea and vomiting. Though serious and highly contagious,
it can be treated with antibiotics.
"People who think they have been infected should pay close attention to
hygiene. Carefully washing your hands could prevent getting a family member
sick," Health Department spokeswoman Marcia Goldoft said.
The recall applies to products prepared without preservatives with an
expiration date of 9 Feb 2000 or earlier and products prepared with
preservatives with an expiration date of 4 Mar 2000 or earlier, the
California Department said.
Businesses have removed the remaining product from stores and the
manufacturer has issued a voluntary recall, state health officials said.
Consumers with questions can call Senor Felix's hot line number at
800-807-7335.
