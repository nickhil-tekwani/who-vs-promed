All information concerning this outbreak assumes from the beginning that the
strawberries suffered contamination during some step of its processing in
the San Diego plant. Details concerning the preparation of the end products,
i.e. the fruit cups, served in the two Michigan schools are not available.
It is impossible to bring forward any reasonable explanation without further
information.

As a Communicable Disease Coordinator working for the Missouri Department of
Health at the District level (I have jurisdiction over 20 counties
accounting for about 20% of the population of the state) in a state that
ranked 5th overall in the number of cases of Hep A last year, I may be able
to shed some light on this. [The apparent selective distribution of
contamination. MHJ]
In any foodborne illness, the distribution of the disease-producing agent
within the food is unlikely to be homogenous. In the case of strawberries
contaminated by (presumably fecal material containing) hepatitis A virus,
which, unlike bacterial agents, does not grow out in food, the distribution
could be limited to only a few containers in a particular lot.
I cannot speak specifically to this incident, since I have had no direct
contact with the investigation, but my experience would be that the entire
lot that supplied the suspect food, as well as other lots that may have come
from the same general processing batch (especially if the records describing
the batches were not too specific) would be candidates for recall.
Given the relatively restricted supply of immune globulin (IG), and the high
potential number of people exposed, I'm sure the decision about which lots
to list, and which kids to shoot was cause for much thought and debate.
DISCLAIMER: The above is my personal opinion, and NOT the stated nor
implied position of the Missouri Department of Health.

Subject: Hepatitis A, strawberries - former Czechoslovakia
MHJ asks how one can have high attack rates in two Michigan schools, but
nothing elswhere -- all presumably sharing the same distribution of these
frozen strawberries.
Dr.Prikazsky and Dr.Plesnik from State Health Institutes in Banska Bystrica
(Slovakia) and Ostrava (Czech Republic) remember their personal experience
from very large epidemics in 1979. In Slovakia there were more than 8000
cases of Hepatitis A hospitalized.
[Only a] Very limited number of publications concerning these epidemics have
been published, and we are looking for them.
Epidemiological analysis of the epidemics showed links to the frozen creams
with strawberries produced by two plants, one in the Czech part and one in
the Slovak part of the former Czechoslovakia. A precise distribution area of
the plants was identified, and most of the cases indicated a favorite kind
of frozen product (frozen strawberry cream) bought in the stores in this area.
Strawberries originating from a large producer were picked mechanically,
washed and frozen right in the field. Frozen strawberries were shipped to
two processing plants.
Strawberries, packed in large containers for commercial use, were stored at
the plants and gradually transformed into the end product -- frozen creams
with strawberries, without pasteurization.
It has been suspected that on the fields of the producer contaminated water
was initially used and picking, washing and freezing followed some days
later. Washing of the strawberries in the machine before freezing was not
sufficient.
