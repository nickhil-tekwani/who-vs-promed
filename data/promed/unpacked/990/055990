CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant human _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections linked to contact with puppies from pet stores.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Campylobacter_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria from people infected with _Campylobacter_ were related genetically to each other. This means that people in the outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection. WGS also showed that bacteria from people infected with _Campylobacter_ in the current outbreak are related genetically to a 2016-2018 outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ infections linked to pet store puppies.

As of 17 Dec 2019, a total of 30 people infected with _Campylobacter_ have been reported from 13 states.

Connecticut / 1
Florida / 1
Georgia / 1
Illinois / 1
Kentucky / 3
Maryland / 1
Minnesota / 6
Nevada / 4
Ohio / 5
South Carolina / 2
Tennessee / 1
Utah / 3
Wyoming / 1
-------------------
Total / 30

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 6 Jan 2019 through 10 Nov 2019. Ill people range in age from 8 months to 70 years, with a median age of 34; 52% of ill people are female. Of 26 people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

WGS analysis of 26 isolates from ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance to tetracycline (26 isolates), ciprofloxacin (25), nalidixic acid (25), azithromycin (23), erythromycin (23), clindamycin (23), telithromycin (23), and gentamicin (18). Testing of one outbreak isolate using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results.

Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that puppies purchased from pet stores are the likely source of this outbreak. Many of the cases had contact with puppies or were employees at pet stores, including Petland.

CDC included ill people in this outbreak if:
- Their stool (poop) sample grew _Campylobacter jejuni_ in the laboratory (called a culture-confirmed infection) and they also had a link to puppies, or
- They had a culture-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection that was closely related genetically to a confirmed puppy-linked case by WGS.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about dog, puppy, and other exposures they had in the week before they became ill. Of 24 people interviewed, 21 (88%) reported contact with a puppy in the week before illness started, and 15 (71%) of those 21 people reported contact with a puppy from a pet store. When asked about the specific pet store, 12 (80%) of those 15 people reported either having contact with a puppy or working at a Petland store.

Investigators reported 8 more ill people who had contact with a puppy at Petland and had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with _Campylobacter_ bacteria. However, the CDC did not include these people in the outbreak case count because no bacterial samples were available for WGS. Public health investigators use WGS to identify illnesses that are part of multistate outbreaks.

A single common supplier of puppies has not been identified. This investigation is ongoing. The CDC will provide updates if more information becomes available.

[Pet-associated campylobacteriosis is underappreciated in human _Campylobacter_ infection. The following is a recent review of the topic.

Abstract: _Campylobacter_ is regarded as a leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the USA. We report on a case of laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania among members of a household living with a laboratory-confirmed but non-speciated _Campylobacter_-infected puppy. We describe an outbreak of likely dog-associated campylobacteriosis, the risk factors, potential routes of exposure, and the clinical features in the exposed family members, which began shortly after exposure to the recently purchased dog. We also provide public health recommendations to prevent _Campylobacter_ infections in veterinary care providers, pet owners, and those planning to adopt pets in the future. Finally, this report underscores the importance of the One Health approach when public health responders, human and animal healthcare providers, and clinical diagnostic laboratories are tasked with developing effective strategies when investigating, detecting, and responding to zoonoses (diseases shared between animals and humans).
