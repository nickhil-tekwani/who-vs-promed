7 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), known locally as "mouse fever", were registered in Tolyatti between Fri 5 and Thu 11 Oct 2012. 5 of the victims live in the Avtozavodskii District, and 2 in the Komsomolskii District. During the previous week 8 patients wit symptoms of HFRS had been admitted to medical facilities. However, the diagnoses have still to be confirmed by laboratory analysis at the Samara Virology Institute.

The 'Novosti online' agency has been informed by the Tolyatti Health Department that 18 cases of HFRS have been registered during the past 9 months. With the onset of autumn there has been a marked increase in the number of cases of HFRS.

Outbreaks of "mouse fever" occur at regular intervals. This year [2012] as a consequence of a mild winter and an early onset of spring there has been a marked increase in the abundance of mice -- the vectors of the disease.

To reduce risk of infection it is recommended that dachas and other living spaces be spring-cleaned [using precautions listed in 2nd comment below]. Dust and debris can disseminate the virus present in mouse droppings. Rodent traps should be positioned around houses and gardens.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) combines a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses of the family _Bunyaviridae_. HFRS occurs throughout the world. Puumala virus is the specific virus likely to be the cause of HFRS in Samara Oblast. Contamination of dust, food, and hands with the dried urine and excreta of infected rodents, stirred up during cleaning of rodent-infested premises, is the main route of infection.

The metropolitan area of Samara-Tolyatti-Syzran within Samara Oblast has a population of more than 3 million people. Formerly a closed city, Samara is now a large and important social, political, economic, industrial, and cultural center of European Russia, which in May 2007 hosted the European Union/Russia Summit.

The Samara Oblast has a continental climate characterized by hot summers and cold winters. It can located in the map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_Oblast. - Mod.CP]

[When cleaning, wear gloves and a mask, and sprinkle disinfectant on the floor before sweeping it to keep the dust down. - Mod.JW
