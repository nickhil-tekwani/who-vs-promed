CHAPTICO, Maryland
An elderly woman died of _Salmonella_ [food poisoning and at least 143
people became sick after eating turkey, ham and oysters at a church dinner.
Approximately 1,400 people ate the meal Sunday at the church in Chaptico
[about 65 miles south of Baltimore, Maryland.
[State and hospital health officials have been cited as identifying a
_Salmonella_ as [responsible for the death, but they had not yet
determined the [specific food source of the bacteria. Meat, poultry and
eggs routinely carry _Salmonella_.
Since Sunday, at least 17 people were admitted to hospitals in southern
Maryland suffering from diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting and
fever. All of them were in stable condition Wednesday night. Hospital
officials said dozens more had been treated and were not admitted. The ill
range in age from 2 to 81.

More recent news reports have indicated that the number of cases has risen
to 702, and that two deaths have resulted from this outbreak. Health
officials appear to be focusing on the stuffed ham dish served at the
dinner as contaminated food. The ham was apparently purchased at a local
market, taken to the church to be stuffed, returned to the market for
slicing, and then brought back to the church for the dinner.
