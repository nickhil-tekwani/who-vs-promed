According to the veterinarians of the Jayyl [district, Chuy region], the 1st signs of [lumpy skin] disease [LSD] were detected in the Ak-Suu and Tup districts of the Ysyk-Kol region. After that, isolated cases were noted in Ysyk-Ata, Alamudun, and Sokuluk districts of Chuy oblast. Outwardly, nodular dermatitis looks like a skin-nodular rash. The disease is accompanied by fever, edema of the subcutaneous connective tissue and organs, the formation of skin nodes, damage to the eyes, the mucous membrane of the respiratory and digestive tracts. The virus is detected in the blood 3-4 days after the temperature rises and the mass formation of [nodules].

"During this period, the virus penetrates with blood into the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, eyes, etc. The inflammatory process involves the lymph nodes. In severe cases, there is a prolonged fever, loss of appetite, emaciation of the animal. Nodules are palpable throughout the body, severe damage to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract is noted. Flat round erosions and grayish-yellow plaques form on the mucous membrane. Further, their suppuration is noted. Erosions and ulcers appear on the eyelids, the cornea becomes cloudy, partial or complete blindness [may] occur. Thick, viscous saliva comes out of the mouth, mucus comes out of the nose", said Daniyar Abdykerimov, deputy head of the veterinary department.

The source of the virus is sick animals and virus carriers -- animals in the latent period of the disease and those remaining after they have been ill. Nodular dermatitis is transmitted to animals mainly by blood-sucking insects -- mosquitoes, midges and flies.

As Daniyar Abdykerimov said, lumpy skin disease appeared in Kyrgyzstan a month and a half ago [September 2019]. Perhaps the disease was brought to our country from neighboring Kazakhstan. The 1st case of lumpy skin disease of cattle in Kazakhstan was recorded in 2016 in the west of the country.

An animal with lumpy skin disease [may] become unproductive and goes to slaughter. Therefore, for prevention purposes, a single vaccination is required.

It should be noted that there were no cases of lumpy skin disease in cattle in the Jayyl region.

[The detailed media report (dating back to October 2019, accessed 29 Jul 2020), which includes a photograph (showing the typical lesions) is supported by a reliable source who informs us that LSD is currently "rampant" in Kyrgyzstan and that LSD vaccination of cattle is currently applied by veterinarians in various parts of the country. Combined, these sources provide valid evidence that LSD has been circulating in Kyrgyzstan the latest since September 2019. Probably, circulation decreased or discontinued during the winter months, resumed recently in the familiar seasonal pattern of this vector-borne viral disease, which may have become endemic in Kyrgyzstan.

LSD is an OIE-listed disease of cattle. Kyrgyzstan's most recent periodic report to the OIE was the "6-monthly report on the notification of the presence of the OIE-listed-diseases" for the period January-June 2019 (OIE Reference: 148307, 148494). In the said report, LSD was included among the "never reported" diseases. Kyrgyzstan's OIE reports for the period July-December 2019 and the annual 2019 report are pending, similar to the LSD "immediate notification." Preferably, the notification presents laboratory test results.

LSD, initially an African cattle disease, spread beyond its endemic sub-Saharan region in 1988 when it entered Egypt, becoming endemic there. In 1989, a single outbreak in Israel was eradicated by stamping out. The disease returned to Israel in 2006; later (2013), the disease continued its spread throughout the Near East, particularly in Turkey, reaching Cyprus and Azerbaijan in 2014. Further spread was seen in 2015, involving Greece and Caucasian Russia. In 2016 the disease extended its domains northwards, westwards, and eastwards, entering the entire Balkan area (Macedonia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Romania), further within the Russian territories in East Europe, West Asia, and eastwards to Kazakhstan. Since 2016, LSD continued its extension, reaching in 2019, China, India, Bangladesh and -- according to the current report -- Kyrgyzstan. During the current year (January-July 2020) LSD has entered Taiwan and Nepal.

To view the spread of LSD since 2016, see OIE's global LSD map at https://tinyurl.com/y2k2m6df. To perceive LSD's rate of spread, select, on the same map, "from 2005 to 2012."
