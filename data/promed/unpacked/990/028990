Provisional freedom from rinderpest was declared for the whole Turkish
territory on 24th February 1999.
In October 1998, Thrace region of Turkey had been declared provisionally
free from rinderpest. This was published in Disease Information, 11 (44),
155, of 6 November 1998. In Thrace region vaccination against rinderpest
had been ceased on 1 October 1998.

There had been no rinderpest outbreak in Turkey since the last foci
reported in Diyarbakir in January 1996. The National Animal Disease
Surveillance and Reporting System in the country is deemed capable of
detecting rinderpest if it were present.
Turkey had been free from rinderpest from 1969 to 1991. The rinderpest
epidemic spread to the south-eastern part of Turkey in October 1991. It was
effectively eliminated by emergency vaccination campaigns. The disease
reoccurred in 1994 in Ardahan province and in 1996 in Diyarbakir province,
which are located in the Anatolian part of Turkey.
Vaccination campaigns have been conducted yearly for the protection of the
population all over the country since RP was seen in Turkey in 1991.
Following each round of vaccination serological evaluation through antibody
assay was carried out in the whole country. The epidemic was controlled by
conventional control measures such as destruction of sick and in-contact
animals with compensation, animal movement control, vaccination and
surveillance.
Rinderpest vaccination was stopped in Anatolia region, with effect from 1st
January 1999.
Considering the above, the Republic of Turkey declares the Anatolia
provisionally free from rinderpest, effect from March 1999, thus the whole
territory of Turkey is now entering into the OIE "pathway", having
fulfilled the OIE specified conditions stipulated in the recommended
standards for epidemiological surveillance systems for rinderpest.
In order to guard against all eventualities, the following conservatory
measures have been taken: Both clinical surveillance and disease reporting
systems for rinderpest in use in the country are adequate to detect
clinical disease if present. All clinical evidence suggestive of rinderpest
within the country is systematically investigated by field and laboratory
methods. In case of suspicion (clinical/subclinical rinderpest-like
diseases), notification takes place immediately resulting in thorough
clinical and and laboratory investigations.
Effective methods are in force to prevent the reintroduction of the disease
into Turkey from neighbouring countries. Increased attention is maintained
at the import gates and quarantine stations, in particular at those from
the eastern and south-eastern neighbours. Illegal movements across the
borders are controlled as good as possible. Respective strategies have been
planned together with the relevant security forces. A cordon of transport
check-points for livestock transports on main roads has been established to
gain control on the movements from east to west, at any time (24 hours
service). This cordon encompasses the belt consisting of the provinces of
Giresun, Sivas, Tokat, Malatya, Maras,Gaziantep and Hatay.
If the peste des petits ruminants (PPR) outbreaks occur, vaccination of
sheep and goats against PPR with a rinderpest vaccine produced in Etlik
Veterinary Control and Research Institutes, Ankara, Turkey, will be
practised.
