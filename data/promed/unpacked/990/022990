According to the Press Service of Rosselhoznadzor (the National
Surveillance Center), a resident of the village of Jukovo contracted
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and 7 days later he died. The
investigation has shown that he was infected by a tick bite at a
picnic on 9 May 2007.
On 11 May 2007, all cattle in the Oktyabrskk region were treated with
an anti-acaracide compound. On 18 May 2007, the administration of the
Volgograd region established an office to combat the spread of CCHF.
