UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, CANADA GEESE - USA (OREGON) (03)

I am the veterinary toxicologist at Oregon State University and I
have been consulted by the Wildlife Disease Lab at Madison on this
case.
Necropsy/histopathology results have not demonstrated any infectious
disease process. At this stage, it is considered to be a
toxin-related issue. Though limber neck (botulism) is very common in
geese (and other water fowl), the animals were negative for botulinum
toxin based on the mouse protection assay.
Other toxins that are being considered are some of the heavy metals,
low-dose bromethalin, and various herbicides/insecticides used in
cropping the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Metaldehyde is also being
considered; however, the clinical signs (weakness, ascending
paresis/paralysis) are not consistent with this agent. Metaldehyde
is a very common cause of small animal poisoning in the Willamette
Valley (and elsewhere). Brain cholinesterase was normal, ruling out
the anticholinesterases (e.g. organophosphates, carbamates).
Notably, other waterfowl at the same locations were not affected;
however, the geese frequently feed away from the water bodies where
they roost and where many of the dead birds were found. It is also
entirely possible -- given that separate locations are involved --
that different agents are involved, since live birds that displayed
clinical signs were not available from each location.
If anybody has any suggestions, they would be welcome.

[We appreciate the detail and the information provided here. Since
botulism is common in waterfowl, it was certainly on my differential
list, but the clinical signs did not fit as closely as I would have
liked. We will be interested in future findings. Since other birds
are not involved, it would seem that avicides could also be ruled
out. - Mod.TG]
