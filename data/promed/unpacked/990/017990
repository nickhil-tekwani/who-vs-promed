Argentina: Outbreak of Hepatitis A in Buenos Aires
--------------------------------------------------
The government of Buenos Aires reported that more than 160 cases of
hepatitis A, one of them [in the locality of Berzategui] fatal, have
been registered in Berzategui, Quilmes, and Florencio Varela, and
that an emergency sanitary program has been implemented.
Vaccination is being administered in the areas with higher
concentration of cases, because authorities believe that there is
more than one focus of disease.

[Information on the suspected source of this outbreak would be
appreciated. Risk factors for hepatitis A infection include
inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene, pollution of water and food
(especially shellfish), confinement in prison, attendance at day-care
centres, male homosexuality, and many others. Systematic surveys have
indicated that in South America more than 90 percent of members of
low-income communities exhibit serological evidence of hepatitis A
infection by early adulthood. Although only one major serotype of
hepatitis A virus is recognised at present, some recent strains of
hepatitis A virus isolated in South America have exhibited
significant genetic and antigenic heterogeneity. For an in-depth
review, see: Genetic variability of hepatitis A virus, by J Mauro
Costa-Mattioli, Anna Di Napoli, Virginie Ferre, Sylviane Billaudel,
Raul Perez-Bercoff, and Juan Cristina. J. Gen. Virol. 84, 3191-3201,
2003. - Mod.CP]
