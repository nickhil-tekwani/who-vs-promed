Cholera is spreading in Trincomalee (a city on the NE coast of Sri Lanka);
of the 12 cases admitted to the Trincomalee base hospital two are found to
be positive cases. Ten patients under observation are from Salapararu,
Pallathottam and Chelvanayagapuram. There are about 60 migrant fisher
families at Salapararu from Arachchikattuwa and Udappu in the Chilaw area.
Health officials feel the disease has been transmitted by the migrant
fishermen who are in close contact with fisher folk at Pallathottam.
Health officials here discovered that the 10 cases from Chelvanayagapuram
and Pallathottam had attended a funeral at Pallathottam before they were
admitted to hospital. Medical officer of health and a team of field
officers have advised the people to take precautions against cholera.
