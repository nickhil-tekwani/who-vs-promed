Extract from an e-mail received on 14 Aug 2000 from the Delegate of Greece
to the OIE:
Date of suspicion: 31 Jul 2000.
Date of confirmation: 8-9 Aug 2000.
Location: Potamia (40deg. 07' 30" N - 25deg. 05' 30" E), a village in
south-eastern Xanthi.
Affected population: dairy cattle.
Number of animals present in the infected holding: 124.
Protection and surveillance zones, with a radius of 3 km and 10 km,
respectively, have been established around the outbreak.
Standard measures for the control of FMD have been initiated in Xanthi
since 8 August. In addition, the Greek Authorities have unilaterally
expanded the safeguard measures laid down in Annex I to Commission Decision
2000/486/EC to include the Prefectures of Xanthi and Rodopi, imposing on
them the same disease status as Evros until the situation is clarified.
