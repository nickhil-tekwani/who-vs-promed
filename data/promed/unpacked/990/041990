[Below is the Veterinary Medicine Today Special Report on the
Executive summary of the American Veterinary Medical Association
(AVMA) One Health Initiative Task Force (OHITF) report published in
the Journal of the AVMA (King LJ, Anderson LR, et al. Vet Med Today:
Special Report - Executive summary of the American Veterinary Medical
Association One Health Initiative Task Force report JAVMA, 233(2), 15
Jul 2008). The full report is available at

The convergence of people, animals, and our environment has created a
new dynamic in which the health of each group is inextricably
interconnected. The challenges associated with this dynamic are
demanding, profound, and unprecedented. While the demand for
animal-based protein is expected to increase by 50 [percent] by 2020
(2), animal populations are under heightened pressure to survive, and
further loss of biodiversity is highly probable.

On top of that, of the 1461 diseases now recognized in humans,
approximately 60 percent are caused by multi-host pathogens
characterized by their movement across species lines (3). And, over
the past 3 decades, approximately 75 percent of new emerging human
infectious diseases have been zoonotic (4). Our increasing
interdependence with animals and their products may well be the
single most critical risk factor to our health and well-being with
regard to infectious diseases.

There is a growing concern that the world's latest generation could
be the 1st in history to experience a reduction in life expectancy
and health in general. Yet, veterinary and human medicines are
considered separate entities and the obvious links between them
frequently ignored. According to the KPMG study "The Current and
Future Market for Veterinarians and Veterinary Medicine in the United
States," (5) published in May 1999, "our traditional approaches and
past requisite skills and levels of knowledge may not be commensurate
with the rapid changes and new demands of food animal industries and
the shifting requirements needed for the corporate and public
opportunities of the future, including public health, biomedical
research, and the global food system."

The need for a holistic, collaborative approach -- One strategy to
better understand and address the contemporary health issues created
by the convergence of human, animal, and environmental domains is the
concept of One Health. Although the concept of One Health is not new
-- the theory was supported by William Osler and Rudolf Virchow, the
Father of Comparative Pathology, and re-articulated in Calvin
Schwabe's Veterinary Medicine and Human Health (6) in 1984 -- our
increasing interdependence with animals and their products has
spurred the human medical and veterinary professions to readdress
such an approach. This approach would encourage the collaborative
efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and
globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals, and our environment.

The benefits of One Health
--------------------------
The benefits of a One Health approach include:
- improving animal and human health globally through collaboration
among all the health sciences, especially between the veterinary and
human medical professions, to address critical needs;
- meeting new global challenges head-on through collaboration among
multiple professions -- veterinary medicine, human medicine,
environmental health, wildlife health, and public health;
- developing centers of excellence for education and training in
specific areas through enhanced collaboration among colleges and
schools of veterinary medicine, human medicine, and public health;
- increasing professional opportunities for veterinarians
- adding to our scientific knowledge to create innovative programs to
improve health.

The One Health Initiative Task Force
------------------------------------
On 14 Apr 2007, the AVMA Executive Board took official action to
establish a One Health Initiative by approving a recommendation by
then-president Dr Roger K Mahr to establish an OHITF. The purpose of
the task force was to study the feasibility of a campaign to
facilitate collaboration and cooperation among health science
professions, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and
industries to help with the assessment, treatment, and prevention of
cross-species disease transmission and mutually prevalent, but
non-transmitted, human and animal diseases, and medical conditions.

The OHITF, comprising 13 visionary individuals and communicators, was
charged by the AVMA Executive Board with the task of defining "One
Health," and providing recommendations and strategic actions that
would support and expand the concept across the health professions.
Just 2 months later, the AMA [American Medical Association] House of
Delegates followed suit, with unanimous approval of a resolution in
support of One Health.

Partnership is critical to success
----------------------------------
The veterinary profession must implement solutions to the critical
workforce challenges in collaboration with multiple professions,
including public health, human medicine, bio-engineering, animal
science, environmental science, and wildlife. By working together,
more can be accomplished to improve health worldwide, and the
veterinary medical profession has the responsibility to assume a
major leadership role in that effort. One Health calls for the
collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally,
nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people,
animals, and our environment.

OHITF recommendations
---------------------
The following recommendations, which are not listed in order of
priority, were based on the findings of the OHITF both during their
meetings, and in the follow-up sessions held by the working groups.
While the AVMA and the AMA plan to take a leadership role in this
effort, the success of these recommendations will depend heavily on
the collaboration of various health science professions, academic
institutions, governmental agencies, and private industries.

- create and fund a One Health Joint Steering Committee to begin the
execution of the other recommendations and associated actions;
- complete a One Health Proposal for Donors as well as a Business
Plan and continue the process of engaging potential donors and sponsors;
- create and implement initial components of a One Health Communication Effort;
- engage an all-inclusive communications firm to develop and
implement a communications plan and coordinate ongoing media
relations, public relations, publicity, marketing, and advertising.
- plan a study on One Health to be conducted by the National Academy
of Sciences and secure the necessary funding to underwrite this effort;
- develop, charter, and form a National One Health Commission (to
replace the steering committee) and recruit full-time staff in key
positions to support the goals and mission of the commission and
complete the recommendations within the full report;
- appoint a national/global One Health Advisory Team to help support
the National One Health Commission and give it direction, counsel, and wisdom;
- plan and hold a One Health National Summit;
- convene several panels and a national meeting to establish a
national research agenda for One Health;
- work toward the inclusion of key One Health outcomes for listing in
the strategies for Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Animals 2010;
- inform, engage, and solicit the support of medical, veterinary
medical, and public health students and their respective organizations;
- create a guiding coalition of liaisons, champions, and key
supporters to promote the One Health concept.

Call to action
--------------
We now stand at the precipice of health care transformation where
disease prevention and health promotion in people, animals, and our
environment have become a critical strategic need. The most pressing
need for a transformation of this magnitude is almost always vision
and leadership. The OHITF recommendations can serve as an action plan
to guide individuals and professions during the process of change.
But, while the AVMA and AMA are eager and willing to take the lead on
this effort, we cannot succeed without the support of others.
Decisions made today impact events of tomorrow. We live in a world in
which the difference between what can be imagined and what can be
accomplished has never been smaller. Veterinary medicine is in a
unique position. Veterinarians are well grounded in population
health, comparative medicine, and preventive medicine. The profession
has the potential to help lead the efforts of One Health. However,
this is not a given, and a reluctance by our profession or by the
other health sciences to take this step will, without question, be a
lost opportunity that will be picked up by other groups.

The responsibility sits clearly on our shoulders. The human medical
profession is faced with the same dilemma -- it also must decide on
its future role in One Health. Every profession has its defining
moments -- special points in time when talented individuals work
cooperatively to influence the course of events for generations to
come. For veterinary medicine and the other health sciences, that time is now.

Our recommendations will only be fulfilled if action is taken,
resources identified and committed, and leadership supported. We urge
you to join us in supporting the One Health Initiative.

[We at the ProMED-mail family strongly support the "One Health"
concept and many of the ProMED-mail moderators were early signatures
on this initiative. For those of our subscribers who receive all
ProMED-mail postings, our support of this concept is evident --
ProMED-mail covers emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and
toxic exposures of interest to the plant, animal, and human health
sectors. Plant diseases impact on food security and the economy,
which impacts on animal and human health; animal diseases impact on
human health indirectly through food security and directly through
zoonotic diseases and the economy; and human diseases can also impact
on animals directly through a reverse zoonosis, and indirectly
through neglect. And as seen in the scientific literature, more than
70 percent of newly identified human diseases in the past 25-40 years
have been zoonotic diseases where a species jump has occurred.

We are grateful to Dr Bruce Kaplan for sharing the abstract and
article above with us, and feel strongly that we should share this
with the greater ProMED-mail community worldwide.
