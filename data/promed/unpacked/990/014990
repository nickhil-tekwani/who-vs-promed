Anthrax spreads in Wood Buffalo National Park
----------------------------------------------
WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK, Alta. (CP) - Anthrax has killed another 15
bison in a remote national park in an area called Brousseau Creek, bringing
the death toll up to 85 animals including two black bears.
Parks Canada crews monitoring forest fires Saturday discovered the latest
victims in the park which straddles the boundary between Alberta and the
Northwest Territories. The Alberta Wood Buffalo National Park has some 2
400 wood bison.
The animals died about 3 to 4 weeks ago, which is about the same time the
disease claimed the first group of bison, said park spokesman Mike Kiezer.

[From independent sources this "new" area is immediately adjoining the
first place where dead bison were found. It indicates that the primary site
was larger than originally thought. Two bison calves have also died but
this was from starvation following their mothers' deaths. MHJ
