Because _H. heilmanii_ cannot be grown in vitro there is no possibility of
producing antigens to set up serological assays. Based on what is known
about the sequences cloned from _H. heilmanii_ and related cultivable
species like _H. felis_ and _H. salomonis_ they are only distantly related
to _H. pylori_. Therefore at most minor cross-reactions in serological
assays for _H. pylori_ can be expected in patients infected with _H.
heilmanii_.
Looking for _H. heilmanii_ (ot other unusual gastric helicobacters) may be
justified in the _H. pylori_ negative patient suffering from peptic ulcer
disease. However, because many of the species involved are fastidious or
non-cultivable, special staining of gastric biopsies and detection of the
bacteria with the microscope are probably the only reliable and widely
available test for detection of non-_H. pylori_ helicobacters for the
moment being.
_H. heilmanii_ has a very characteristic morphology with several relatively
large spirals. It can therefore be reliably differentiated from _H. pylori_
by light microscopy. However, several different species of helicobacters
have already been described for each type of morphology; therefore
morphology alone is unreliable for identification of gastric helicobacters.
All gastric helicobacters described so far possess a strong urease and will
therefore give a positive CLO test.
My concern with the paper is different: based on published evidence
zoonotic transmission of _H. heilmanii_ is rare and the authors appear to
agree with that. How do they then explain the fact that the patient
apparently was infected with three different strains of _H. heilmanii_
simultaneously. Just being exposed to pets since youth does not appear to
me to be a sufficient explanation for such an unusual finding.
