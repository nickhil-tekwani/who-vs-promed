1st report of soybean cyst nematode (_Heterodera glycines_) on soybean in
North Dakota.
-----------------------------------------------
C. A. Bradley, C. R. Biller, and B. D. Nelson, Department of Plant
Pathology, North Dakota State University, Fargo, 58105. Plant Dis. 88:1287,
2004; published on-line as D-2004-0918-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication
7 Apr 2004.
During August 2003, soybean (_Glycine max_) plants from Richland County,
North Dakota, with white-to-yellow lemon-shaped structures on the roots,
were brought to the North Dakota State University Plant Diagnostic
Laboratory. To confirm that the structures were females of a cyst nematode,
they were crushed and observed microscopically to determine if nematode
eggs and 2nd-stage juveniles were present. Morphology of the 2nd-stage
juveniles was consistent with _Heterodera glycines_, the soybean cyst
nematode (SCN).
A survey was conducted in soybean fields in 34 sq km around the field in
which the samples originated. 10 of 20 fields surveyed had visible females
on the roots of plants. Symptoms observed in those fields included patches
of stunted, chlorotic, and dead plants.
Soil samples were collected from selected areas within 8 fields, eggs were
extracted using standard soil sieving techniques, and egg numbers were
determined. Egg numbers ranged from 550 to 20 000 eggs per 100 cubic cm of
soil. SCN collected from 2 different fields, designated as Dwight and
LaMars, were used to determine their HG Type.
Standardized procedures (1) were used in a growth chamber set at 27 C with
16-h days. Pots in the test were organized in a completely randomized
design with 3 replicates; the test was repeated over time. After 30 days,
females were extracted from roots and counted, and a female index (FI) was
calculated for each indicator line (1).
The mean number of females on susceptible standard cv. Lee 74, was 110. The
Dwight SCN population had an FI of 5.3 on plant introduction (PI) 88788,
1.5 on PI 209332, 5.8 on PI 548316 (Cloud), and 0 on all other indicator
lines. The LaMars population had an FI of 1.0 on PI 88788, 3.1 on PI 548316
(Cloud), and 0 on all other indicator lines. These results indicate that
both SCN populations tested are HG Type 0.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of SCN on soybean in North Dakota.
Because other hosts of SCN, as well as soybean, are economically important
in North Dakota, such as dry edible bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) and dry pea
(_Pisum sativum_), this disease could adversely impact several commodities
throughout the state.

[_Heterodera glycines_ [Hg] causes one of the most important diseases of
soybeans. Yield losses can range up to 30 percent, mainly because fewer
pods are produced on infected plants. Moreover, soybean yield is directly
related to the numbers of nematodes feeding on soybean roots. SCN-infected
soybean is also more susceptible to infection by brown stem rot of soybean,
caused by the fungal pathogen _Phialophora gregata_, in both resistant and
susceptible soybean cultivars. Unfortunately, SCN cannot be eliminated from
affected fields. The tough cyst, besides providing long-term protection for
eggs and juveniles, allows for possible long distance dispersal. Cysts are
found in "soil-peds" (aggregates of soil) which adhere to anything that
moves through an infested field. To restrict spread of SCN to uninfested
areas, and to control populations in known infested fields, the following
management practices are necessary; decontamination of farm implements and
footwear, controlled movement of infested plants, weed control, crop
rotation, and use of resistant cultivars. A new bioassay for Hg has been
developed and is described in the links below. The gist of the new test is
that a low FI means the field's SCN population reproduces poorly on that
line. A high number means a high rate of reproduction and that a variety
from that line would be a bad choice for planting.
