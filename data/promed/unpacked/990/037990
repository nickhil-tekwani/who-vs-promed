Russia: HFRS is a continuing problem in Udmurtia
------------------------------------------------
Most of the people infected with hemorrhagic fever [with renal syndrome]
(HFRS) were working in the basements of their houses. Basements and attics
are favorite places for mice. This season the virus transmitted by these
rodents appears to [have enhanced virulence]. Furthermore, entomologists
state that every second mouse is carrying [hantavirus].
Unfortunately, most homeowners have rejected disinfestation of their
gardens on account of the expense involved. This has resulted in a serious
outbreak of disease. So far 108 people have been admitted to hospital with
HFRS. During the same period of 2003, only 5 people were admitted with
hemorrhagic fever.
Physicians are observing the following trend: in 2004, most of the patients
admitted to hospital have a severe form of the disease. The first stage of
disease is often confused with the common cold and patients do not seek
hospital care initially. When they are admitted [they are given] infusions
[?]. Physicians say that this can lead to severe consequences such as
bleeding from intestine and nose and even renal failure.
The course of the treatment is 4 weeks. After that patients need to adhere
to a diet and to be followed up by a primary care doctor. Local physicians
are predicting that the number of patients will increase through summer and
fall.

[Udmurtia is a republic located in Central Russia about 1000 km to the east
of Moscow. Previous posts earlier in 2004 reported a large build-up in the
population of field voles, the vector of the hantavirus responsible for
HFRS, which may explain to some extent the apparent severity of this
outbreak. - Mod.CP]
