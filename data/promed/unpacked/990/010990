[The following extracts, addressing Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), have been derived from the recent 3 weekly reports published by the Chief Veterinarian of Hachaklait, Dr Benny Sharir. - Mod.AS]

1. Circular of 02 Dec 2012
--------------------------
A total of 3 cows, found LSD-positive by PCR testing in the dairy farms of Kibbutz Dafna and Kibbutz Kefar Blum, have been culled.
New morbidity observed in beef herds grazing on the southern and eastern fringes of the Golan Heights.

Reported morbidity and mortality in a beef herd, grazing near Kibbutz Ayelet Hashahar. The herd (not member of "Hachaklait") had, reportedly, been vaccinated.

Dairy farms in the vicinity of affected beef herds are advised to activate their ventilators during daytime in order to try remove arthropods which may carry the virus.

Next week's forecasted high temperatures may enhance the arthropod populations.

2. Circular of 09 Dec 2012
---------------------------
During the recent week, additional LSD cases in dairy and beef herds in the north, vaccinated with the sheep pox vaccine, have been reported. The infected area's southern margins are currently located west and east of the Sea of Galilee: in the west, a beef herd grazing near Ginosar. In the east, a beef herd grazing near Ramot.

3. Circular of 15 Dec 2012
--------------------------
A milking dairy cow with high fever, salivation and generalised dermal nodules ("lumps") has been euthanised at the end of the week in the dairy farm of Kibbutz Dafna.

The plentiful rains with temperatures remaining mild enable continued arthropod activity.

The District Veterinary Office [State Field Veterinary Services] is engaged in the control of the disease in vaccinated herds and the performance of new vaccination of newborns in the dairy and beef herds.

[LSD has been evolving in north-eastern Israel (sub-districts Golan and Zefat) since 1 Jul 2012. Until the submission of the most recent OIE follow-up report, 12 Nov 2012, 30 outbreaks had been reported, affecting a population of 13 721 susceptible bovines, mainly beef cattle, of which 3125 suffered, reportedly, a clinical disease, 296 died and 6 were culled. The disease seems to continue its simmering spread, now -- according to the current, unofficial report -- observed also in the Kinneret sub-district, south of the Zefat sub-district.

This outbreak has been handled mainly by quarantine measures and "vaccination in response to the outbreak" of beef and dairy cattle within and around the affected zone. "Modified stamping out" has been limited to the sporadic cases seen in vaccinated dairy cattle farms.

Though several cases have been seen in animals which, reportedly, had been vaccinated (with the Jovac Sheep pox vaccine). According to the animal vaccine compendium of CFSPH (Iowa University), the only specific LSD vaccine commercially available is "LUMPYVAX," a live vaccine of the SIS strain produced at Onderstepoort, South Africa. Its safety and efficacy against the Middle Eastern LSD virus strain, compared to those of the vaccine applied in Israel, may be verified if/when comparative challenge trials are carried out.

The potential origin of the LSD virus introduction to north Israel will become apparent to subscribers visiting the map showing the 1st 30 accumulated outbreaks, at the bottom of the OIE summary report, available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012559_20121112_153839.pdf. Unfortunately, Israel's information on LSD remains solitary in the region. - Mod.AS
