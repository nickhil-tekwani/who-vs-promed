Bornavirus antibodies have been detected in horses in Iceland. The virus' presence should not be cause for alarm among Icelandic horse owners, however, as borna antibodies are also detected in healthy horses, Bjornsdottir said.

In a country isolated from the rest of the world, in which horse importation is strictly prohibited, local horses have tested positive for antibodies against a virus previously undetected in equids on the island: Several horses residing at a single stable in northern Iceland tested positive for borna disease virus (BDV) antibodies.

Several of the positive horses showed clinical signs of borna disease, specifically, neurologic problems, said Sigridur Bjornsdottir, DVM, PhD, study author and veterinary officer for equine health and welfare in Iceland. However, veterinarians could not conclude definitively that BDV was the source of the neurologic problems, she added, as other diseases could not be ruled out.

Borna disease is a rare and potentially fatal equine disease most commonly identified in central Europe. In the study, Bjornsdottir and colleagues explained, "The clinical signs in horses usually start with disturbances in feed intake, fever, and various degrees of somnolence. Later, ataxia (incoordination) and other gait disturbances, more severe somnolence, and finally paralysis of extremities and head develop. Other mental changes are also common, such as depression, coma, and excitations."

Researchers don't yet know the virus' transmission routes; however, previous research has suggested reservoir hosts -- such as wild birds, rodents, and insectivores -- are likely involved, the team noted.

In Bjornsdottir's study, researchers found that 6 of 8 horses residing at one stable showed neurologic signs, including ataxia (incoordination).

One of those 4 horses was euthanized due to severe neurologic deficits, she said. None of the horses tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1, West Nile virus, or the equine arteritis viruses. However, 4 of the 6 affected horses were positive for BDV antibodies; one horse with neurologic signs and the euthanized horse were not tested.

One of the 2 healthy horses at the stable was seropositive for antibodies, and the other was seronegative, Bjornsdottir noted.

This marks the 1st time veterinarians have identified antibodies against BDV in horses in Iceland, she said.

A year later, a horse residing in a stable about 50 km (about 31 miles) southwest of the affected stable tested positive for BDV; there was no contact between the 2 stables, and the affected horse, along with its 3 stable mates, remained healthy, Bjornsdottir said.

As BDV can be carried by a wide variety of species, Bjornsdottir said the most likely transporters in this case were birds migrating from areas where the disease is more commonly seen.

However, the presence of the virus is no cause for alarm among Icelandic horse owners, she said. "There might have been a correlation between serious sickness in a few horses in north Iceland and antibodies against the virus, but as nothing has happened since then, and as borna antibodies are also detected in healthy horses, there is no reason to believe that bornavirus presents, at the moment, a threat for the horse population," Bjornsdottir told The Horse.

Because viruses such as BDV and, more importantly, _Streptococcus equi_ (the bacteria that causes strangles) can be imported on inanimate objects, Icelandic officials ask that visiting equestrians only bring clean riding clothing and disinfected boots into the country, she said. Additionally, no used riding gloves can be brought into the country.

The study, "Serological markers of Bornavirus infection found in horses in Iceland," was published in Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica.

[This article may be somewhat misleading. It appears this is a research article about the Borna disease virus antibodies that have been found in Iceland. The article details a case, and then says: "...a year later," indicating some time has passed before a 2nd discovery. It is also unclear whether this 2nd discovery is more recent (i.e. now) or whether this is also part of the epidemiological investigation reported in the research paper.

Borna disease is a sporadically occurring neurological disease caused by Borna disease virus (BDV), an RNA virus of the Bornaviridae family (Rott and Becht 1995, Staeheli 2002). BDV infection has been reported in a growing number of species, although sheep and horses are the main natural hosts; in horses, clinical disease is invariably fatal (Herden and Richt 2009), although more recently, milder forms of the disease have been reported by some researchers (Dieckhofer and others 2004, Bode 2008).

Since the 1700s, classical clinical disease due to BDV infection has occurred only in geographically restricted areas of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Lichtenstein (Rott and Becht 1995, Staeheli and others 2000, Durrwald and others 2006, Herden and Richt 2009). There is serological evidence for BDV infection of horses and other species in an increasing number of countries, including several other European countries, Israel, Japan, Iran, Australia, and the USA (Herden and Richt 2009). However, whether natural Borna disease exists outside the areas in Europe where it is endemic and whether BDV infections might be associated with other clinical manifestations are still matters of considerable debate (Staeheli and others 2000, Durrwald and others 2006, Herden and Richt 2009).

In the UK, serological studies of BDV in horses have not been reported; however, antibodies have been detected in cats and human beings without any clear association with disease (Reeves and others 1998, Thomas and others 2005). Moreover, until now, there have been no confirmed cases of clinically manifesting Borna disease in horses or sheep in Great Britain.

Borna disease and, later, BDV were named after the town of Borna in Saxony, Germany, where an epidemic of infectious encephalitis caused a large number of equine deaths in 1885 (120). Veterinary scientists spent many years carefully describing the natural history of BDV infection in animals in Central Europe, including infections of horses, sheep, rabbits, and birds, and subsequently started working with the virus in tissue culture (120). BDV research spread from laboratories in Central Europe to the United States in the mid-1980s (99), where projects in disease pathogenesis and animal models were initiated (28). Later, the 1st cDNA clones were isolated that identified the Borna disease agent as an RNA virus (88, 143) and the sequencing of the BDV genome was reported (26, 39). Since that time, researchers all over the world, including groups in Asia, Scandinavia, and Australia, have joined in the study of BDV.

Although it is suspected that BDV may be spread by bodily secretions (e.g., intranasal transmission by nasal discharge) in natural infection (120), there is no formal proof of this assumption. In experimental settings, BDV, in the form of concentrated virus stocks, can reach the brain by the intracranial, intranasal, peripheral (footpad), or peritoneal cavity routes (120).

BDV replicates preferentially and persistently in cells of the nervous system, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (56). Initially, BDV was believed to replicate exclusively in the central nervous system, but later, BDV sites of replication were found to include the peripheral nervous system and nonneural cells in the blood, thymus, and bone marrow (62, 123, 133). The nonneuronal tissue infection with BDV is more commonly seen in settings of BDV-specific or generalized immunosuppression (62, 133, 139).

The specific disease syndromes produced by BDV infection depend on many host factors including the species and strain and the age of the animal at the time of infection; they may also depend on the strain of virus. If humans are indeed hosts for BDV, identifying and understanding the various clinical syndromes in animals will probably provide important information that is applicable to human BDV disease.

To date, BDV has not been identified as a clear etiology of any known human disease. However, based on what is known about BDV biology and disease pathogenesis in many nonhuman species, it is tempting to speculate about the clinical outcomes of human BDV infection.

Although BDV might be the etiologic agent of idiopathic acute or chronic inflammatory encephalitis in humans, no large-scale studies have evaluated such a connection, and so no data are available to support or refute this hypothesis. Nonetheless, a clinical picture of human EBD might be similar to that of a hospitalized patient with idiopathic acute encephalitis associated with changes in the level of consciousness, along with fever and significant neurological impairment. As with rabies or herpes simplex encephalitis, damage to the neuroanatomical targets of BDV, such as the limbic system, might lead to erratic personality changes or even violent behavior. Individuals who survived EBD and developed CBD might show evidence of chronic neurological damage, even in the face of a receding inflammatory response in the brain. Impaired cognitive function, apathy, and emotional instability would probably be exhibited by the survivors of the infection.
