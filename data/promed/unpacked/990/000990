No Human Influenza Virus Genes in Avian H5N1 Virus from 2 Human Patients
--------------------------------------------------
The avian influenza virus that infected 2 Hong Kong people this month
contains no human genes [i.e., no human influenza A virus genes - Mod.CP],
meaning that the risk of person-to-person transmission is low, a government
official said on Mon 24 Feb 2003.
A 33-year-old Hong Kong man died last Monday [17 Feb 2003] of pneumonia and
doctors confirmed he had contracted an H5N1-type avian influenza virus
after visiting relatives who keep chickens in China's southern Fujian
province. His 9-year-old son was also infected but recovered. They were the
first cases of avian influenza passing to humans since an outbreak in the
territory killed 6 people in 1997, triggering worldwide alarm.
"Results of the laboratory tests ... show that the virus genes were purely
avian in origin," a spokesman for the Department of Health said in a
statement. In the absence of human [influenza virus] genes in the avian
virus, the risk of human-to-human transmission will be low." Earlier on
Monday, government officials told legislators that the absence of human
[influenza virus genes] meant it was unlikely there would be an epidemic. A
leading microbiologist in Hong Kong has said the virus could only cause a
pandemic if it got mixed up with human flu strains [i.e., if the avian
virus had acquired human influenza virus genes, facilitating
person-to-person transmission of the reassortant virus. - Mod.CP]
On Fri 21 Feb 2003, a government official said it had detected no unusual
increase in flu activity or any other H5-type virus over the past few
weeks. It said it was still investigating the source of the recent
infection and conducting further laboratory tests on the victims' relatives
to determine whether they had also contracted the virus.

[This is the second recorded occurrence of apparent direct transmission of
an avian influenza virus to human hosts, unmodified by reassortment of
viral genes or by adaptation to an intermediate mammalian host.
Fortunately, this H5N1 avian influenza virus, although able to cause severe
disease in the initial human host, probably because there is no
pre-existing immunity to H5-type virus, has no ability to spread from
person to person. There are many other avian influenza viruses, however, in
wild and domestic bird populations in relatively close proximity to man,
especially in the Far East, and it may only be a matter of time before an
avian virus able to spread from person to person makes its appearance.
Nonetheless, since generally avian influenza viruses multiply in the gut
and are spread through water, the probability of such an event should
remain low. Perhaps the most important matter to be resolved at this
juncture is the manner in which the original infections occurred. - Mod.CP]
