Chinese bird flu vaccine now available
---------------------------------------------------
The Agriculture Ministry has announced that the bird flu vaccine imported
from the Qilu Animal Health Factory in China is available to the general
public as of March 2004.

Chief spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry Hari Priyono in a press release
in Jakarta on Friday said the testing of the subtype virus on 7.2 million
doses of imported bird flu or avian influenza (AI) vaccines by the Animal
Drug Quality Testing and Certification Institute had been completed by the
end of February 2004.

"The result of the test indicates that the vaccine produced by QILU in China
is suitable for local application, and will be distributed to fowl breeding
farms," he said.

remains our hope that such information will be forthcoming, especially
relating to the virus strain used and to the characteristics of the vaccine
