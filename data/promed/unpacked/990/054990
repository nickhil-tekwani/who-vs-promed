Officials warn of rabies outbreak in Central Park
-------------------------------------------------
Authorities and medical experts warned Friday [29 Jan 2010] that a
rabies outbreak in Central Park could spread from raccoons to humans.
Health investigators have confirmed reports of 28 rabid raccoons in or
near Central Park this month [January 2010] and last [December 2009],
compared with just 3 cases from 2003 through November [2009].

The reason is not clear, but the city's health department -- which has
been monitoring the situation since December [2009] -- is taking it
seriously: It's working with the parks department and others to
increase surveillance and vaccinate wild raccoons in New York's
Central Park, Morningside Park and Riverside Park. [Likely this is

Dr Charles Rupprecht, chief of the rabies program at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday [29 Jan 2010] that ideal
conditions in Central Park for animals -- few predators -- could
exacerbate an outbreak.

"Urban ecosystems sometimes have the ideal measures," he said. "When
you get an infectious agent like rabies, it tends to have these
untoward effects, meaning an outbreak."

Similar outbreaks of rabies in Eastern Pennsylvania and Washington,
however, were contained through the same measures that officials in
New York are following, he said.

In addition to the increased surveillance and vaccinations,
authorities in New York are suggesting that visitors to city parks
keep pets on a leash and be wary of raccoons they see during the day.
Raccoons are nocturnal animals who rarely venture out in the daylight.
Being out during the day "means they are probably carrying rabies,"
said Marlene Elizondo, a nurse with the International SOS, which
offers medical care and consulting services to companies, nonprofits,
and other organizations.

"In such a condensed area like New York, it's more likely that a human
would come into contact with" a rabid raccoon, Elizondo said. Celina
De Leon, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of Health, urged
park visitors to alert authorities if they see any animal behaving
strangely.

Health officials received 10 reports of rabid raccoons in Manhattan
last year [2009], but 8 of them were in December [2009]. It confirmed
only 1 case from 2003 through 2008.

Most of the cases it has seen in the past 2 months were from the
northern part of Central Park, between 79th and 110th streets. If left
untreated, rabies will infect the central nervous system and
ultimately cause death. Health professionals encourage people who come
in contact with infected animals to seek medical attention
immediately. New York's health department says that "while raccoons,
skunks, foxes, and coyotes are considered high-risk sources of virus,
bats are the most common source of infection for people across the
United States."
