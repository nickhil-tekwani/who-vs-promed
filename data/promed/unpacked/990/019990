Ten people have died and another has been hospitalized after consuming
turtle meat on a remote island off the west coast of Sumatra in Indonesia.
The deaths occurred late last week after residents on Siberut Island ate
turtle meat during a wedding party.
Local residents say it is a local Mentawai tradition to consume turtle meat
at weddings. The family fell ill with vomiting after eating turtle soup
made from a turtle they had captured. Three children died that day and 7
others died in hospital.
A local health official says preliminary findings indicate the fatalities
were due to food poisoning after consuming turtle meat.

[Siberut Island is a small island off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia.
It is under the control of the Indonesian government, but remains separate
from the rest of the country. Siberut Island is home to the Mentawai
people, who are native to the island, having had their first encounter with
the western world in the 1970s.
A map of Indonesia showing the location of the island can be found at:

ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this and similar events.
Whether this outbreak represents the below entity is not clear from the
posting.
Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. One
example was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve <cturtle@lists.ufl.edu> by
a marine conservation officer in the Solomon Islands:
"28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon,
western province, Solomon Islands suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pains, needles and pins and general weakness after eating turtle meat
(which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of 16 Jan
2001. The symptoms described occurred 4-6 hours after consumption of turtle
meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein source
consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience the
symptoms.
6 people (all children between 3 months - 11 years old) out of the 28
people died within 5 days. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught,
was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents
smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and
the meat was unusually soft."
Other citations include (both from Madagascar):
Yasumoto T: Fish poisoning due to toxins of microalgal origin in the
Pacific. Toxicon 1998; 36:1515-18:
"From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal
intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified. . . As turtles feed on sea
grass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were
deduced to be the source of the toxin."
Ranaivoson G, Champetier de Ribes G, Mamy ER, et al: Mass food poisoning
after eating sea turtle in the Antalaha district. [Article in French] Arch
Inst Pasteur Madagascar. 1994; 61:84-6:
Abstract: In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of
turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar.
The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia,
acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning
attack rate was 48 percent with a lethality of 7.7 percent. Such [an]
accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to
control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures.
Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the
flesh of certain marine turtles (Green Sea Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle,
Leatherback Turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many
countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin,
which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who
eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea, a burning
sensation of the lips, tongue, and mouth, difficulty in swallowing, and a
tightness in the chest, skin rash, enlargement of the liver, or even coma
and death. - Mod.LL]
