The virus of Aujeszky's disease has been detected in the sheep pox vaccine imported from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan, according to the press service of the State Inspectorate for sanitary, veterinary and phytosanitary safety (GISVFB) on Monday [1 Oct 2012].

"Samples of the product, delivered on 20 Sep 2012 from Uzbekistan, were not found to be the [anticipated] sheep pox dry culture vaccine of a batch manufactured on 26 Apr 2012 by the State Scientific Institution All-Russian Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Instead, according to the conclusions in the protocol cited by GISVFB, the imported vaccine has been found [by whom? -Mod.AS] to include the genome of the Aujeszky's disease virus [ADV].

It should be recalled that the official investigations of mass deaths of sheep in Suzak Jalal-Abad, undertaken by a State Investigatory Commission, revealed that all dead animals had been vaccinated "against sheep pox" with a vaccine imported from the Republic of Uzbekistan, where mass deaths of sheep have been reported as well.

The state inspectorate of sanitary, veterinary and phytosanitary safety has submitted samples of the vaccine, illegally imported from the Republic of Uzbekistan, to the All-Russian Research Institute [for testing].

[From the above text, it might be understood that, on top of locally available sheep-pox vaccine officially imported from Russia by the Kyrgyz government, additional quantities were imported without official permits. Results of comparative tests involving both batches (or were they presented as of the same batch?) will be interesting to obtain.

The Compendium of Veterinary Vaccines for Transboundary Diseases, presented in the web-site of CFSPH (the Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University), mentions one manufacturer of sheep-pox vaccine in Russia; the same manufacturer reportedly produces also Aujeszky's viral vaccines. See http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/country_list.php?country=118&lang=en.

Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies, is caused by an alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, in a variety of mammals.

ADV is associated primarily with pigs, the natural host and the only animals to become latent carriers. However, the virus can infect nearly all domesticated and wild mammals including cattle, sheep, goats, cats and dogs. It does not infect humans or the tailless apes, and infections in horses are rare.

The disease in sheep is not common; sheep get infected when kept in close proximity to infected pigs. The disease in sheep (and cattle) is almost always fatal within a few days. The 1st symptom is intense pruritis concentrated in a patch of skin; this is usually manifested as severe licking, rubbing or gnawing. Self-mutilation is common. Affected animals become progressively weaker, and eventually recumbent. Convulsions, bellowing, teeth grinding, cardiac irregularities and rapid, shallow breathing are common. The clinical signs are similar in dogs and cats, and a combination of neurologic signs, pharyngeal paralysis and profuse salivation may resemble rabies. Affected animals typically die within 1-2 days.

The above and additional information on ADV is available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/aujeszkys_disease.pdf.

Several question arise: Why was there a need for importation of sheep-pox vaccine if the Kyrgyz government imported sufficient quantities of the vaccine the official way?

Has a live Aujeszky's disease vaccine been applied instead of a sheep pox vaccine, or rather was the sheep pox vaccine contaminated by the ADV?

In case ADV has been diagnosed as the causative pathogen responsible for widespread mass mortality in sheep in Kyrgyzstan (and Uzbekistan?!), notification of the exceptional event(s) by the country or countries involved to the OIE is expected. - Mod.AS
