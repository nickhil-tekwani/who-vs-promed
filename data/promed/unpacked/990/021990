The Valencian regional government on Friday [29 Jul 2022] approved the emergency declaration of the work and actions necessary to control the outbreak of botulism in the protected wetlands of southern Alicante.

The Ministry of Ecological Transition declared the emergency and announced actions to remove corpses and transfer animals affected by the disease, detected in the El Hondo Natural Park, to the Santa Faz wildlife recovery centre.

El Hondo Natural Park is part of the old Elche lagoon, created by the mouth of the Vinalop√≥ River and almost completely dried up between the Middle Ages and the 18th century to convert it into arable land.

The immediacy of the control actions, for an amount of Euro 150 688 [about USD 156 000], has made it possible to minimise the effects of the infection, caused by anoxia as a result of the high temperatures in the wetland, as well as preventing its spread to other adjacent wetlands such as the Clot de Galvany, els Carrissars d'Elx, the Salinas de Santa Pola, or the Lagunas de la Mata-Torrevieja.

The disease was detected in June [2022] in the Parque Natural del Hondo, an area that is home to populations of waterfowl of great conservation value for biodiversity reasons. This is a fundamental nesting point at the European level for the Anatidae, a species declared critically endangered at the national level.

["Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_." This pathogen is "widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin."

"There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E."

"Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g. chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots."

"Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area." The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation."
(https://www.beautyofbirds.com/botulism.html)

"Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) are highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment."

"Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Also, providing it to wild bird populations is extremely challenging and often unfeasible. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin."
