[This is the final Lebanese report addressing the FMD outbreak which
started there in January 2009, involving cattle in at least 11 villages (a
map is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7809>). It
adds the essential information on the etiological agent, identified by the
OIE ref lab at Pirbright as FMDV serotype A, a new strain in Lebanon (known
to have been previously reported there in 1973; see WRLFMD website at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/leb.htm>).

The previous outbreak in Lebanon, notified to the OIE on 09 Jul 2008, had
started 02 Feb 2008 and resolved on 01 May 2008. The diagnosis was
"clinical", no serotyping of the pathogen available since the infected
animals were "not sampled"; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7168>.

Clarifications concerning the following issues related to the current
outbreak would be helpful:
1. Which vaccine strain(s) has(ve) been included in the "Vaccination in
response to the outbreak"?
2. Have other species, namely sheep, goats and/or pigs, in contact with the
FMDV-A infected herds, been clinically affected?

On top of virus isolation and serotyping, the Pirbright reference
laboratory has also genotyped 4 of the 7 2009 Lebanese isolates, all
designated as type A, topotype Asia, strain Iran-05 BAR-08. Further
details, including tables of the "Ten most closely related viruses' and of
Relationships to reference virus strains", as well as a comprehensive
dendogram, are available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-00013-Lebanon-A.pdf>.
The Lebanese strain is closely related to 2009 FMDV-A strains from Iran and
Iraq (percent identity 99.37). - Mod.AS]
