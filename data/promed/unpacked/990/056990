A 9-year-old boy developed a fever on 18 Aug 2006 and was
hospitalized 2 days later. He died Thursday [31 Aug 2006] afternoon,
said Christine Powers-Perry, a spokeswoman for Children's Hospital in
Boston.
Middleborough [where the boy lived] was among the communities in
southeastern Massachusetts that have undergone 2 rounds of aerial
spraying to kill the mosquitoes that carry the virus. The 1st round
of spraying on 8 Aug 2006 reduced the mosquito population by at least
60 percent, officials said.
The boy could have contracted the virus as early as 8 Aug 2006 but
probably got the virus the following week, according to state health
officials.
Two other people [in Massachusetts] -- a 52-year-old woman from
Lakeville and a 23-year-old man from Acushnet -- have contracted the
virus this year [2006].
Four people have died in the state from the virus in the last 4
years. There were 4 human cases last year [2005], all in Plymouth
County.
The virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. Symptoms
range from mild flu-like illness to encephalitis -- inflammation of
the brain -- coma and death. According to state health officials,
about 3 of every 10 human cases are fatal.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) occurs sporadically in humans and
equine animals in the northeastern United states. Mod.CP had an
excellent summary of EEE epidemiology in archive number
20050908.2663, which is duplicated here:
"EEE is endemic in North America along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
In northern regions, human cases occur in late summer up to the time
of the 1st frosts, whereas cases of infection may occur throughout
the year further south. In North America, the virus is maintained in
freshwater marshes, the habitat of the mosquito _Culiseta melanura_.
This mosquito feeds almost exclusively on birds (rarely on small
mammals and reptiles) and is an amplifying host for the virus in
spring and summer. A secondary epidemic cycle then occurs in areas
adjacent to salt marshes involving other species of birds and _Aedes_
spp. mosquitoes. These mosquitoes transmit the virus to horses and,
less frequently, to humans, both of which are dead-end hosts for the
virus. In endemic areas, equines can be protected by vaccination, but
there is no vaccine approved for administration to humans. It is not
entirely clear how the virus survives from year-to-year in endemic
areas, and other factors may determine the frequency of exposure of
horses and humans to EEE virus infection" (Mod.CP). - Mod.TY]
