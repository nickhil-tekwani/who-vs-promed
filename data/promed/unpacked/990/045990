A Comment on Risk of Alkhurma Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------
There may be a need to clarify the risk situation -- this being very
important to physicians attending to returning pilgrims or those compiling
travel advisories. Increased slaughtering of animals and animal movement
does not necessarily mean increased risks to pilgrims visiting Makkah [Mecca].

Greatest risk occurs when [pilgrims slaughter animals themselves] or there
is other direct contact with animals. This was also echoed by Mod JW in one
of his comments on the original outbreak [See: Encephalitis, tickborne -
Saudi Arabia (03) 19970914.1959]. This post includes a comprehensive report
that details exposure patterns in the first cases documented and is thus a
good reference source. In the present case, we have not been informed of
the means of exposure of the diseased patient

The Saudi Government greatly minimizes this risk by providing for pilgrims
a proxy service that takes care of all animal slaughtering, butchering, and
distribution. Payment is made at banks and kiosks remotely located from the
slaughter sites. Most of the pilgrims [from] the West do make use of this
facility.
