West Nile Virus Detected In Horse in Southeastern Massachusetts
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported today that one horse
in Southeastern Massachusetts has tested positive for West Nile virus
infection and has died. In all 7 other horses are suspected to have been
infected and confirmatory testing continues. The horse which tested
positive for West Nile virus infection was located in Middleboro. Of the
suspect cases, 4 are also in Middleboro, and one each is located in Carver,
Lakeville, and in Plympton.
Horses are particularly susceptible to West Nile virus infection because
they are constantly exposed to mosquitoes. MDPH is working with local
health officials in these communities and with the Plymouth Country
Regional Mosquito Control District to discuss appropriate mosquito control
measures.
To date in Massachusetts, there have been no human cases of West Nile virus
infection identified. The virus has been detected in primarily bird-biting
mosquitoes in several locations in Massachusetts and in a single isolate of
human-biting mosquitoes in Franklin. MDPH reminds Massachusetts residents
to reduce their risk of West Nile Virus infection by avoiding mosquitoes
and by taking care to eliminate standing pools of water where mosquitoes
can breed. As the weather turns colder, the potential for West Nile virus
infection diminishes. The mosquito season virtually ends following the
first frost.
