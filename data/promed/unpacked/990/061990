Birds and the transmission of West Nile virus
The moderator asked, regarding Eleanor Kellon's query about bird deaths and
the spread of West Nile virus in North America, whether "statistics are
available from the dynamics of bird death during 1999 outbreak to allow
some provisional prediction". There is an analysis, published recently in
Emerging Infectious Diseases (at
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol6no4/rappole.htm), tracing the paths of
migratory birds known to acquire the virus, which clustered in large
numbers on wetlands with mosquitoes that can spread the virus near New York
during their migrations last autumn. The conclusion was that the virus
could have spread throughout North America, and to Central America,
northern South America and the Caribbean by now.
The question for human risk is whether the virus has actually been carried
to any region by enough birds, with enough viremia, that were then exposed
to enough mosquitoes to establish a local chain of transmission among
potential local carrier birds. Several species, such as eastern phoebes,
have been found carrying West Nile virus asymptomatically despite high
levels of viremia, meaning it could have travelled in migrants and will
circulate locally if enough local birds are infected, without necessarily
causing a visible surge in dead birds. Dead birds are in any case not
always terribly visible.
European researchers familiar with the virus in its home territory say
human outbreaks occur when prevalence in urban birds is high. This was the
case in New York at the time of the human outbreak last year. The authors
of the EID paper predicted that the Gulf Coast of the US was the next most
likely site for a human outbreak in North America, as the northern migrants
that go there remain more concentrated than migrants elsewhere and could
have transmitted the virus most frequently to local birds. But the question
can only be answered by looking for the virus in local, healthy, wild
birds. Here there appears to be a difference of opinion between veterinary
and medical authorities. The US monitoring programme is focused on testing
dead birds, sentinel chickens, mosquitoes, horses and humans. US veterinary
experts want to test healthy wild birds, preferably this autumn after they
have been exposed to a season of potentially infected mosquitoes and any
infection will be maximally detectable. This study had not, as of a week
ago, yet been funded.
Yet veterinary experts warn that testing dead birds and chickens lacks
sensitivity, and may not detect the next focus of enzooticity. Medical
authorities, on the other hand, fear testing wild birds may not be
cost-effective. Yet around ten state authorities do so regularly to keep an
eye on the related, native virus that causes St. Louis encephalitis.
Unfortunately these states are in areas, chiefly the Midwest, where the
last St. Louis outbreak occurred, not where the migratory birds' pathways
suggest West Nile may next migrate.

Comment on species of birds affected by West Nile virus
Perhaps the reason why "house "sparrows (actually the English sparrow) and
starlings appear to be immune is because they were invader species from
Europe. Just a thought, but that is probably why no European or near
eastern species of bird at the Bronx Zoo died last year. Only those from
the Americas
or the Indian subcontinent were felled by the infection, even though birds
from Africa and the Middle East were housed next to them.

Virus Found in 3rd Suffolk County Crow; bird count up-date
A third crow in Suffolk County has tested positive for West Nile virus,
health officials announced Friday. The crow, found in a residential area of
Wading River, was young. Since the bird was not born last year, this might
indicate that the bird had been infected this year by [virus-infected
mosquitoes, according to Health Commissioner Clare Bradley. Last Friday,
Bradley announced that two adult crows found in Lindenhurst and West
Babylon had tested positive for the virus, but said it was unclear whether
they had become infected this year or last year.
However, this young crow did not test positive on all tests, making it
difficult to say definitively that the bird had been bitten this year,
Bradley said. "We can't say with 100 percent certainty that this is current
infection. The fact that it is a fledgling indicates it might be, but it's
possible that it was somehow otherwise exposed -- it could have been
infected at birth [by the mother... We just don't know that much about
this virus," Bradley said.
Bradley added that there are no plans to spray the area because mosquito
counts remain low. "The benefit is just not there for me [!... It would be
like shooting a rabbit with a bazooka," Bradley said. However, she
cautioned people to avoid going into areas where they know there are lots
of mosquitoes. Bradley said the crow, which was picked up June 6 -- the
same day the two previous positive Suffolk crows were picked up -- tested
positive by two tests, by [a standard polymerase chain reaction test, and
by a more sophisticated Pachman [? PCR test. But it tested negative by an
immunofluorescent antibody test and did not culture, meaning that
scientists were unable to grow the virus in the lab.
The State Health Department announced on Wednesday that a red-tailed hawk
in Westchester County had tested positive, bringing to two the number of
positive birds in that county this year. Three more dead crows -- making a
total of 7 -- have tested positive in Bergen County, N.J., authorities said
on Friday. Also 4 crows and a blue jay have tested positive this year in
Rockland. To date, no crows have tested positive in Nassau County or New
York City, the epicenter of last year's outbreak. Bradley said scientists
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week visited
Babylon, where the two previous positive crows were found. On Monday, the
U.S. Geological Survey and CDC will test roosting birds near where the
virus-positive crows had been found previously.

Statement on test procedures from the Arbovirus Laboratory of the Wadsworth
Center (New York State Department of Health)
Tissues from dead birds submitted to the Wadsworth Laboratory for detection
of West Nile virus (WNV)are tested by procedures to detect viral RNA, viral
antigen, and infectious virus. To detect RNA, two sets of primers are used
in two separate TaqMan assays. If positive, two additional sets of primers
are used in two standard RT-PCR assays using newly excised tissue. A bird
is considered positive if these 4 assays are positive.
To detect viral antigen, frozen tissue sections are stained with monoclonal
antibody to WNV. If this assay is positive, or virus is detected by plaque
assay and/or evidence of cytopathology in Vero cell culture (followed by
IFA staining with monoclonal antibody to WNV), the bird is confirmed
positive. Sometimes the bird is submitted with the tissues badly autolyzed
and no virus is isolated; at other times, most commonly with blue jays, the
virus appears to be present at low levels and virus is not isolated. In
these situations, we continue to try to isolate virus by further passage in
Vero cell culture, and try other tissues and other cell cultures such as
C636. Positive results by cell culture or IFA on frozen sections is the
additional confirmation we seek.
