[1] UK (Suffolk), epidemiological report
Date: Fri 30 Nov 2007
Source: Defra, Preliminary Epidemiology Report: Avian Influenza
Outbreak In Suffolk, November 2007 As At 26 Nov 2007 [edited]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
------------------
(I) Following a report of suspected avian notifiable disease in
turkeys in Suffolk on 11 Nov 2007, highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 avian
influenza (AI) infection was confirmed on 12 Nov 2007.

(ii) The infected premises (IP) comprised 5000 growing turkeys, kept
in 5 groups of 1000, 1118 ducks and 410 geese maintained under a free
range system. Samples collected at slaughter for laboratory
examination revealed that 2 groups of turkeys had a significant
prevalence of infection (more than 50 percent), a further group had a
maximum prevalence of 5 percent. No evidence of infection was found
in the geese, but infection was detected in the ducks for which the
maximum prevalence was 2 percent.

The findings suggest that there had been an initial focal
introduction of virus into one of the groups of turkeys, rather than
a widespread exposure of all poultry on the site.

(iii) Epidemiological investigations of the IP resulted in the
identification of 5 dangerous contact (DC) premises as a result of
them being tended by the same stockmen who employed poor biosecurity
measures. Only turkeys were kept on 4 of these DC premises; ducks,
geese and turkeys were kept on the other DC premises. Samples were
taken for laboratory examination from the birds culled at the DC
premises. Infection was detected in one group of turkeys on one of
these premises, which became designated as IP2. The maximum
prevalence of infection in this group was 10 percent. This was
consistent with infection having been transmitted from IP1.

(iv) Genetic analyses of the virus isolates from the turkeys on the 2
IPs and the ducks on IP1 indicated that the birds were infected from
a single source.

The current isolate has the closest genetic identity to an isolate
from wild birds in the Czech Republic detected in mid-2007. The
current isolate is phylogenetically distinct from the previous
isolate of H5N1 in 2007 obtained from the Holton outbreak.

(v) The poultry on the premises which supplied the birds to IP1 and
IP2 were sampled and tested with negative results. All of the birds
were hatched in Great Britain.

(vi) The surveillance of poultry in the PZ and SZ has not revealed
any further infected flocks indicating that infection has been
confined to the 2 IPs.

(vii) The results of the epidemiological investigations to date
provide no evidence that infection was introduced via imported
poultry or poultry products or any activities associated with such
importations.

(viii) IP1 was located in an area where wild birds were relatively
common and was notably near to an ornamental lake which supports some
1000 waterfowl. H5N1 infection has not been detected in wild birds
nor have any incidents of high mortality been observed in the area.
An enhanced surveillance programme has been initiated. At the present
time, wild birds, most likely migratory species from central Europe,
cannot be ruled out as the source of infection. Epidemiological
investigations are continuing, and the results will be provided in
further reports.

(ix) Two important and epidemiologically significant findings are
evident from the investigations to date. These are:
- The poor biosecurity measures employed by the stockmen, which in
this case were peripatetic and therefore cared for more than one unit
of poultry, which resulted in the transmission of infection in the
area
- The siting of a free range poultry unit (IP1), which is likely to
attract wild birds because of feed availability, in an area already
unavoidably occupied by populations of wild bird species, notably
migratory waterfowl, but also "bridge" species (such as gulls), which
are capable of becoming infected by HP H5N1 and transmitting the
virus from primarily infected wild birds to commercial poultry.

[2] Poland, turkeys: 1st case

Two poultry farms northwest of Warsaw were cordoned off after the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu was found in turkeys, Polish officials
said on Saturday [1 Dec 2007].

Earlier reports had said 3 farms were affected, but the governor of
Mazowsze province, where the outbreak occurred, later revised the
count.

"A 3rd farm had initially been suspected, but that suspicion was not
confirmed," Governor Jacek Kozlowski told a news conference in Plock.

There are plans to cull 4000 birds at farms around the village of
Brudzen near the city of Plock, Poland's chief veterinary officer Ewa
Lech said on television.

She said the virus was most likely brought to Poland by migrating
ducks, geese or swans, adding that an area within a 3-km (1.8 miles)
radius of the outbreak had been cordoned off.

"Areas of contamination and danger have been marked off and are being
constantly monitored by veterinary officials and police," said Plock
crisis-management official Hilary Januszczyk.

Poland's efforts to contain the spread of the virus won the approval
of the European Commission.

"The Polish authorities notified us in the middle of the night about
a strong suspicion of bird flu," European Commission spokeswoman
Barbara Helfferich told Reuters.

"We have been in contact with them since then; they are now taking
the appropriate measures."

This includes disinfection mats over which pedestrians and vehicles
entering and leaving the affected areas must pass, Polish officials
said.

Bird flu was discovered in wild swans near the north Poland city of
Torun in early 2006.

"There is no cause for alarm," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said
on television.

"I am in touch with the interior and health ministers as well as
veterinary officials in charge. This is not the kind of threat we had
several years ago."

[3] Poland, turkey meat

In the Pomorze region, 480 kg of turkey meat has been found to
contain the bird flu virus.

Also it has been announced due to the outbreak in Plock, central
Poland, that information bulletins will be passed out in schools
tomorrow, Mon 3 Dec 2007. Local priests have also stepped in to
supply information to local residents.

Ongoing research is being carried out in infected areas in farms
around the town of Plock [pronounced Pwotsk]. Vehicles passing
through the area are also being disinfected.

Anna Obuchowska, spokeswoman for the Sanitary Inspectorate in the
Pomorze region, has stated that the meat came from 2 warehouses, in
Zukow and Sierakowice.

The Zukow plant supplied meat to shops in Gdansk and Gdynia, with the
Sierakowice source providing shops in Czluchow, Chojnice, Koscierzyna
and Kartuzy.

Obuchowska has said that there is a search for remaining meat in the
shops, but it is unlikely that any remains, as the turkey meat was
delivered to the shops at the beginning of the previous week.

Shop employees are under surveillance by the Sanitary Inspectorate
for their own safety.

Avian flu has the same effects as "normal" flu, and can be treated
with the same anti-viral treatment, including Tamiflu.

Specialists have stated that meat preparation at temperatures above
70 C should kill any viruses that were present in the meat before its
preparation, rendering it safe to eat.

Bird flu has spread to another district in northwestern Bangladesh,
forcing health and veterinary workers to cull some 6000 chickens and
destroy over 2500 eggs, officials said on Sat 1 Dec 2007.

The latest case was reported in a village in Pabna district, 160 km
from the capital Dhaka, a senior official of the fisheries and
livestock ministry said.

Bird flu was 1st detected near the capital in March 2007 and has
since spread mostly to northern districts. There have been no cases
of human infection.

Including Pabna, 20 of Bangladesh's 64 districts have been affected
by the virus, which has forced authorities to kill 256 000 chickens
and destroy nearly 3 million eggs since its outbreak.

About 4 million Bangladeshis are directly or indirectly associated
with poultry farming.

[The upsurge in the incidence and spread of avian influenza, observed
since the beginning of fall 2007, seems to continue.

The following 27 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa have reported
H5N1 in wild birds or poultry during 2007 so far:

Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong (SARPRC), Hungary, India, Japan, Kuwait,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Poland,
Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, United
Kingdom, Viet Nam. (Poland reported to the EU; official notification
to the OIE will certainly follow soon).

occurrence of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and wild birds since 1
Jul 2007, status as of 19 Nov 2007 (latest available update), can be
