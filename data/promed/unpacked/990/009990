[1] California - devastating tomato disease

For the 1st time in California, agricultural officials confirmed
finding what some call the worst tomato virus in the world -- tomato
yellow leaf curl virus.

"It's a significant threat to tomato growers in the state," says Bob
Gilbertson, a University of California (UC), Davis, plant
pathologist. "Right now, all of the varieties in California should be
considered susceptible."

Florida and Georgia growers have battled the viral disease since the
early 1990s, and breeders have developed resistant varieties for
Southeastern markets, he says.

The whitefly-spread disease was confirmed last year [2006] in Texas
and more recently in Arizona and northern Mexico.

UC Cooperative Extension farm advisor Eric Natwick discovered the
disease in a high school greenhouse in Brawley in the Imperial
Valley. The plants had been grown from seed, and none had been moved outside.

Because the virus is not seed-transmitted, Gibertson says infested
silverleaf whiteflies most likely brought it into the greenhouse.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture is working to
minimize the outbreak.

Whiteflies can acquire the virus in as few as 5 minutes of feeding
and remain infected for life, he says.

Infected tomato plants develop severely curled, yellowing leaves,
shattered nodes and short, upright stalks. The virus causes flowers
to abort, lowering fruit set and reducing yields. Plants are stunted
and upright. Symptoms are most visible on the growing tips of plants.

"It would be difficult to confuse this with too many other diseases,"
Gilbertson says.

If you suspect you have the virus in your field, contact the local
farm adviser or Gilbertson at <RLGilbertson@ucdavis.edu>. The
university has developed a diagnostic test that can confirm the
disease within 24 hours

[2] Texas - disease originating from transplant facilities

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a monopartite virus in the
genus _Begomovirus_ (family, _Geminiviridae_) from the Middle East,
is one of the most damaging whitefly-transmitted viruses of tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) worldwide. TYLCV was 1st identified in
the United States in 1997 in Florida (4), and most recently, in the
Pacific Coast states of Mexico where fresh market tomatoes are grown
for the U.S. market (1). During September 2006, tomatoes grown from
transplants in Waller County, TX, exhibited shortened internodes,
stunting and puckering of leaflets, green vein banding, and diffuse
chlorosis. The disease incidence in 2 fields (4 hectares (ha) total
(10 acres) was 95 percent and yield was substantially reduced. Many
of the transplants were symptomatic at planting. The transplants
originated from 2 facilities in Hidalgo County, TX. Both facilities
had experienced heavy infestations of the whitefly, _Bemisia tabaci_
(Genn.), during transplant production. At the same time, transplants
produced in Uvalde and Bexar counties, TX, where whitefly
infestations were also prevalent, had similar virus symptoms. Total
DNA was extracted from the leaves of symptomatic tomato plants from
10 samples from these 4 counties and amplified by PCR (2). DNA
samples from Waller, Hidalgo, and Uvalde counties were cloned, and a
partial fragment of the viral coat protein gene (core Cp) was
sequenced. Blast analysis of the core Cp sequences of each sample
confirmed the presence of TYLCV. No other begomovirus was detected,
and all attempts to amplify a bipartite begomovirus by PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) using degenerate DNA-B specific primers
(3) were unsuccessful. The full-length TYLCV DNA was amplified from 3
samples using the rolling circle amplification method as described
(1), cloned, and the sequences were determined. The 3 sequences
shared 99.6 to 100 percent nt identity and so only one sequence was
deposited in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information)
GenBank database (Accession No. EF110890) (1). Analysis of the
complete genome nucleotide sequence corroborated TYLCV identity
predicted by core Cp analysis that was 98.1 percent identical with
TYLCV from Egypt (GenBank Accession No. AY594174) and Spain (GenBank
Accession No. AJ489258), 97.6 percent with TYLCV from Mexico (GenBank
Accession No. DQ631892), and 96.5 percent with TYLCV-Is (GenBank
Accession No. X15656). Additionally, a Southern blot with TYLCV as
the probe detected replicating (double-stranded) TYLCV DNA in all
samples consisting of 3 plants from Uvalde County and 21 plants from
Bexar County. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of TYLCV in
Texas that occurred in 2 transplant production areas approximately
400 km apart. Transplants produced in Uvalde and Bexar counties were
planted there, while Hidalgo County transplants were shipped outside
of the usual range of the whitefly. Hidalgo County has a subtropical
climate, which can allow overwintering of TYLCV and the whitefly
vector, allowing the establishment and spread of this virus in the future.

[TYLCV infection of tomato causes plants to be stunted with small
chlorotic puckered leaves and fruit yield to be much decreased. The
virus is transmitted by a whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ in a
persistent manner; can be transmitted by mechanical inoculation
(poorly) and by grafting; not transmitted by contact between plants.
Disease control possible by control of the vector. Resistant tomato
cultivars are available.
