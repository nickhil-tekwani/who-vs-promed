About 5 cases of hemorrhagic fever have been reported in Kadulgli town in Sudan's South Kordofan, according to medical sources.

A source told Radio Tamazuj that about 5 children were taken to Kadugli Hospital, amid a media blackout due to a visit by the First Vice President Bakri Hassan Selah to the town today [5 Nov 2014].

The visiting vice-president was expected to inaugurate health facilities in the area. Meanwhile, security agents allegedly refused a transfer of one of the suffering children to El Obeid Hospital for treatment.

This comes after similar reports in October 2014 of patients suffering from high grade fever and epistaxis (bleeding from the nose) in an oil-producing area of neighboring West Kordofan State.

Emails obtained from PetroEnergy E&P say the company took "serious precautions" after Field Medical Officer Dr. Samir Alkhair Mohamed reported cases of "Ebola virus or hemorrhagic fever cases" at Fula hospital in West Kordofan.

"The 2 cases are now isolated and receiving treatment as hemorrhagic fever till further blood investigations confirm diagnosis about the type of hemorrhagic fiver," another company official wrote.

Alkhair the medical officer also wrote, "Two cases died in Mujlad as a result of hemorrhagic fever," without elaborating, according to the correspondence obtained by Radio Tamazuj.

UN and World Health Organization officials in Sudan contacted by email and phone for comment on 22 Oct 2014 either declined to respond to calls or said they were unable to comment due to lack of information.

On 24 Oct 2014, however, an oil company official in West Kordofan told Radio Dabanga that 2 people had died from bleeding and fever in Muglad, and another 2 were hospitalized in Fula, reiterating the same information contained in the mentioned company emails.

The disease remains undetermined.

[On 24 Oct 2014, 4 cases of an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever were reported (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141028.2907268). Now, there are 5 cases, but still there are not enough details provided to make a definite diagnosis. Interestingly, no mention is made of diarrhea, a common symptom of Ebola virus disease in the current outbreak in West Africa.

Yellow fever (YF) virus infection is an obvious possibility, given that it has occurred in the region in the not too distant past. Rift Valley fever is another possibility, but there is no mention of affected small ruminant animals in the area. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak.

As noted in the previous post, a thorough laboratory study is needed for the cases above. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about additional cases or results of any laboratory tests that become available.
