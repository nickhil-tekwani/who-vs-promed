12th and 13th Human Cases of Avian Influenza H5N1 in Cambodia
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to
advise members of the public that an 11-month-old male residing in
Takong village, Ta Kong Commune, Malay district, Banteay Meanchey
Province died on [17 Feb 2011] as a result of respiratory
complications after contracting avian influenza virus H5N1.
Additionally further tests done on blood sample from his mother
indicate that she too was infected with the H5N1 influenza virus. The
19-year-old mother from the same village died of respiratory
complications on [12 Feb 2011].

Although both patients became sick in Banteay Meanchey province, they
were exposed to eating and preparing sick poultry while visiting
relatives in Prey Veng province. They developed high fever and cough
on [5 Feb 2011] a few days after preparing and eating sick poultry in
Rokar Chor village, Bantey Chakrey commune, Prash Sdach district,
Prey Veng Province.

The mother was admitted to a private clinic in Banteay Meanchey
province but died as result of complications of infection on [12 Feb
2011]. The baby was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of
Jayavaraman VII Hospital in Siem Reap. Despite intensive medical
care, the baby died on [17 Feb 2011], 2 days after admission from
complications. Samples that were sent to Institut Pasteur du Cambodge
tested positive for influenza H5N1.

"Compared to last year, we have seen more cases of H5N1 Avian
influenza this year. There seems to be a strong link between
preparing and eating sick birds and becoming infected in all the 3
cases. I urge people to only cook and eat healthy birds which don't
cause infection. I also urge all our medical and nursing
professionals to ask their patients with respiratory disease if they
have had any contact with sick poultry. If a suspicion is there,
please report to MoH," said HE Mam Bun Heng, Minister of Health.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry
but that it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. The H5N1
influenza virus does not spread easily between humans. Human H5N1
avian influenza is a very serious disease that almost always requires
hospitalization. The H5N1 influenza is also very different to the
H1N1 virus. The H1N1 virus is a mild disease similar to the seasonal
flu. The H1N1 virus spreads easily between people so it is easy to
catch but the majority of those affected recover completely without treatment.

As part of the Ministry of Health's routine outbreak response
measures, government Rapid Response Teams (RRT) are now in the area
conducting field investigations to identify close contacts and to
initiate preventive treatment as required. A public health education
campaign is being conducted to inform families on how to protect
themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is:
- wash hands often;
- prepare food safely meaning well cooked, even healthy poultry;
- keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; and
- do not eat sick or dead poultry.

From 2003 to [23 Feb 2011], there have been 13 laboratory confirmed
cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus in humans in Cambodia, 11 of whom
died. Globally since 2003, there have been 522 laboratory confirmed
cases of avian influenza with 309 related deaths.

The Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of
developments via the MoH website <http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh> where
relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.For more

press release on 23 Feb 2011 and sincerely apologizes for the delay
in posting due to technical difficulties. - Mod.MPP]

[This is the official MOH/WHO confirmation of the two fatal cases of
avian H5N1 influenza virus infection described in ProMED-mail
previously, with some additional details. These are the 2nd and 3rd
cases in Cambodia this year. There appears to have been no secondary
spread of infection and the two fatal cases were likely infected from
the same source (diseased poultry).
