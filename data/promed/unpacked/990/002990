Health chiefs say last year's [2012] worrying measles outbreak is now being brought under control as the MMR catch-up programme continues at pace. In St Helens, there were just 2 confirmed cases in the 1st 6 months of this year -- in January and March 2013 -- compared to 13 in the same period in 2012.

But, as part of the catch-up programme, NHS (National Health Service) GPs are still offering catch-up vaccinations to teenagers who missed out on their 1st or 2nd childhood MMR. This is crucial for teenagers and young adults, especially those starting work or for women thinking of starting a family. The aim is to offer MMR to as many 10-16 year olds as possible who missed out on one or 2 doses, and to get to 95 percent protection in teenagers.

Dr Sam Ghebrehewet, the health protection lead for PHE Cheshire and Merseyside, said: "While it's too early to say the MMR catch-up campaign is responsible for the declining number of measles cases, we can say definitively that children who have not had the MMR vaccine remain at high risk of catching the disease. We are making good progress towards the 95 per cent target, but there still remains a number of 10-16 year olds within the area, together with some younger children and adults who remain under-vaccinated. We'd urge parents of children, and teenagers themselves, who haven't had the MMR vaccine to get them vaccinated. The whole measles story shows us how important childhood vaccination programmes are. Every parent needs to make sure that children are offered all their childhood vaccines."

[The catch-up campaign is clearly succeeding, but the aim of 95 percent coverage has still to be achieved.

Ministry of Health officials in Teso South have raised fears over the outbreak of measles in the area. The area District Medical Officer for Health, Festus Kigen, made the startling revelation yesterday [22 Aug 2013] while announcing that 32 088 children were vaccinated against polio in Teso South. Kigen said 4 cases of suspected measles had been reported in the area with samples taken to Nairobi medical laboratory to confirm whether the outbreak is real. He said measles and polio are related owing to the fact that they affect children who have not undergone immunisation since they were born.

Kigen warned parents to be wary of measles symptoms, like high fever, red eyes and running nose. "Children with such cases should be reported to the nearest health facility for immediate attention," Kigen said while addressing the press in his office.

Kigen said the polio campaign in the area was 102 percent[?] successful, with Chakol Division registering the highest number [of cases?], 18 576, while Amukura recorded 13 512 [cases].

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) announced on Tuesday [13 Aug 2013?] that a measles outbreak in Nigeria's Katsina state is over, after 28 weeks and more than 36 000 infections. MSF supported Nigerian authorities throughout the outbreak by providing case management and epidemiological surveillance in Katsina's 34 local government areas. The organization began supporting the Nigerian outbreak in February 2013.

The outbreak started in December [2012] in the southern part of Katsina during the dry season. The outbreak subsequently spread to all 34 provinces. During the 28-week outbreak, 36 428 people were infected with measles, and 198 people died. MSF supported the Nigerian Ministry of Health by regularly visiting 300 health facilities and donating treatments for 14 290 measles cases, including 420 cases designated as complicated.

As a result of a measles vaccine shortage in Nigeria, only 10 percent of the vaccines needed to conduct a mass vaccination campaign were allocated to the state. In March 2013, MSF further supported authorities by conducting a mass vaccination campaign in 5 of the 34 local government areas. During the campaign, approximately 217 500 children aged 6 months to 5 years received vaccinations. The number of cases declined in the 5 areas of the campaign.

MSF also screened 215 038 children aged 6 months to 5 years for malnutrition, determining that the severe acute malnutrition rate was 1.8 percent, and the global acute malnutrition rate was 6 percent. Epicentre, MSF's epidemiological research branch, conducted a malnutrition and vaccination coverage survey to thoroughly analyze the situation. Results from the survey are expected by the end of August 2013.

Hamilton Public Health Services is investigating after a confirmed case of red[?] measles in a Hamilton adult. The case is travel-related but may have led to other exposures in the city. Public Health is trying to identify individuals who may have been exposed. Anyone who has visited the following locations may have been exposed to measles unless they have already had 2 doses of a measles vaccine, such as MMR or MMRV, or if they have been infected with measles in the past. The locations are:

- Jackson Square Mall, 2 King St. W on 18 Aug 2013, 9 am-2 pm
- Harvest Moon Restaurant, 80 James St. N on 19 Aug 2013, 4-8 pm
- Crowne Plaza, 150 King St. E, in the elevators and Saffron Mediterranean Restaurant and Bar on 18 Aug 2013

Please call public health services at 905-546-2063 if you were at any of these locations at the specified times. "Red measles is highly contagious to those who are susceptible from the beginning of the illness until 4 days later after the rash 1st appears," said Dr. Ninh Tran, associate medical officer of health for Hamilton. Symptoms start with cough, runny nose, red watery eyes and fever. After about 4 days, a rash begins on the face and moves down the body, and there may be white spots inside the mouth. If you think you may have red measles, call public health and call ahead to your doctor's office so that you can wear a mask when you arrive.

A case of measles was confirmed in the Portland metropolitan area, prompting health officials to alert people who were at specific locations between 15-17 Aug 2013. The person with measles was traveling and visited the Portland area for the US Tennis Association Pacific Northwest Juniors Sectional Tennis Tournament in Washington County. That began on 14 Aug 2013 and continued through 17 Aug 2013.

Health officials said in a release that people at the following places on the following dates may have been exposed:

Measles is highly contagious and is spread through the air after a measles-infected person coughs or sneezes. People who have not been vaccinated are at the highest risk. Most people in this area have been vaccinated, officials said, so the risk to the general public is low. After someone is exposed, illness usually develops in 7 to 14 days. In rare cases, it can take up to up to 21 days for symptoms to occur. For this particular exposure, public health officials expect the onset of symptoms in newly infected people by 7 Sep 2013 at the latest.

A mother's 5-year-old son just started school at Saint Matthew Catholic School on Monday [19 Aug 2013] as reports of a measles outbreak make headlines in North Texas. "As a parent, we're always concerned about sicknesses and diseases for our children," she said. As of Monday [19 Aug 2013], there have been 15 cases reported across the state, with most of the cases in Tarrant County. The child's mother said she's making sure that doesn't happen to her only son, who had a series of 4 shots before school started.

According to the San Antonio Metro Health District, the city hasn't had a measles case since 2007. Dr. Fred Campbell said he's a little surprised that the city has been so fortunate. He hopes that won't change when students return to school. "I think it's something of a problem as far as educators [are concerned] because of the likelihood of this to spread to other children that may not be immune," Campbell said.

A family doctor in this Fort Worth suburb said she almost didn't believe it when members of her local church started showing up at a church clinic with cases of what turned out to be measles. "It was such a classic case, the 1st one I recognized," Dr. Smith said.

That was a few weeks ago. Dr Smith had already seen an adult man who visited the church and had just returned from an overseas trip to Asia. But she didn't realize until later that he was the original patient to whom the outbreak could probably be traced.

The outbreak was 1st noticed at the clinic at Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark. Smith said there are close to 20 cases connected to the outbreak. Tarrant County Health officials have only confirmed 11 cases but did concede that the number will probably go up as additional official test results are processed. There have been countywide immunisation clinics since the measles outbreak was confirmed last week.

A renewed measles warning has been issued for Brisbane residents after a 2nd case was reported to Queensland Health. Last week, Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said people should have shown symptoms by 18 Aug 2013 if they had contracted the virus after an infectious Victorian visited Sunnybank, Fairfield and Brisbane airport in late July 2013.

This 2nd case, who is believed to have been exposed to the Victorian person, was infectious between 9-17 Aug 2013 and used Brisbane's public transport system extensively, visiting Boondall, Rochedale, Underwood, Springwood, Brisbane City and Fortitude Valley.

Close contacts of this case are being contacted by Queensland Health, but acting senior director of the Department of Health Communicable Diseases Unit, Dr Stephen Lambert, said a large number of other people could have been exposed to the disease. He said further cases could present anywhere in Queensland, especially in the South East, over the next few weeks.

"True measles is a serious viral infection that causes fever, cough, runny nose, then a red spotty rash and sore eyes a few days later," Dr Lambert said. "Measles occasionally has dangerous complications, with up to 1/3rd of young adults with measles ending up being treated in hospital. Anybody who has or knows someone who has these symptoms should make an appointment to visit their GP immediately and advise them that you possibly have measles."

A fact sheet for the public about measles is available from Queensland Health at: http://access.health.qld.gov.au/hid/infectionsandparasites/viralinfections/measles_fs.asp.
