Viet Nam: 6th Death from Avian Influenza Confirmed; Fatalities Now Total 26
--------------------------------------------------
An 18-year-old woman has died of avian influenza in Viet Nam, bringing the
death toll in the country since December 2004 to 6.
"The 18-year-old woman from Tien Giang province was the 6th H5N1 victim,"
Health Ministry spokesman Tran Duc Long told Agence France Presse (AFP).
She died on Wed 19 Jan 2005, 13 days after being admitted to a tropical
disease hospital in Ho Chi Minh city. All 6 deaths were in southern
Vietnam, and the victims had all been in close contact with poultry,
officials said.
The latest deaths take to at least 26 the number of people on record as
having died from the H5N1 serotype of avian influenza in Viet Nam since the
end of 2003. The real number of deaths is thought to be higher, as tests
were not carried out on some suspected cases.
Another 12 people have died in Thailand, where officials confirmed Thu 20
Jan 2005 the 1st outbreaks this year of H5N1 of avian influenza, prompting
authorities to declare a high alert throughout the country. Thai scientists
found the virus in 20 fighting cocks in the eastern province of Rayong,
said Yukol Limlamthong, director general of the Livestock Development
Department.
"Tests confirmed on 10 Jan 2005 that some 20 fighting cocks in 2 houses
were infected," he told AFP. The 20 infected birds were all found in Klang
district and have already been killed, he told AFP.
A 2nd outbreak was confirmed in Thailand's central province of Phitsanulok,
where 50 locally bred chickens were confirmed to have the disease on 17 Jan
2005, he said. Both districts where bird flu was found were under a 21-day
surveillance period, and no chickens could be taken in or out of the area,
Yukol said.
Avian influenza is now reported in 1/3 of Viet Nam's territory, or 22 out
of 64 provinces and cities, with the culling of more than 362 000 poultry
since the start of 2005, according to the Agriculture Ministry.
Meanwhile, the 1st suspected human H5N1 case in the northern part of the
country was reported in the capital, Hanoi. The case involved a 42-year-old
man whose 45-year-old brother died of respiratory illness on 9 Jan 2005.
Results of a final test to confirm what the man was suffering from were due
on Thursday, the Health Ministry said. The World Health Organisation said
it was awaiting confirmation from Vietnam's health authorities on the
case." The Vietnamese authorities are rechecking all the test results," WHO
epidemiologist Peter Horby told AFP. "They are undertaking investigation on
possible sources of infection," he said, adding that the WHO had asked Viet
Nam about the possibility of obtaining samples and sending them to WHO
laboratories abroad. Viet Nam was criticised in 2004 for its slow response
to the epidemic. This year, though the government seems to have been
speedier in taking action, it has not able to contain the disease.
In Hanoi, local authorities say they have applied tough measures to stop
the spread of the virus. According to state media, 20 checkpoints have been
established at city borders and on highways and 30 at markets. "Our policy
is to establish checkpoints at city borders to control the transportation
of poultry into the city," an agricultural expert from Hanoi's People's
Committee told AFP. "We allow only quarantined chickens to be sold in the
capital," said the unnamed expert. However, in several of the capital's
markets, live chickens with no quarantine certification could be found
easily. "I don't need a quarantine certification as I sell only healthy
chickens," a seller in Dinh Cong's market told AFP. Demand for poultry is
expected to boom during February's Lunar New Year holidays, risking the
further spread of the virus to humans.
