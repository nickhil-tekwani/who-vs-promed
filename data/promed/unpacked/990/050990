On 19 Oct 2022, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed an unvaccinated 3-year-old Thoroughbred gelding in Ionia County is recovering from strangles. He began showing signs of nasal discharge on 2 Oct 2022. This is the 2nd confirmed case of strangles on the premises, with the original case occurring in August [2022].

Strangles in horses is an infection caused by _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi _and spread through direct contact with other equids or contaminated surfaces. Horses which aren't showing clinical signs can harbor and spread the bacteria. Recovered horses remain contagious for at least 6 weeks, with the potential to cause outbreaks long-term.

Infected horses can exhibit a variety of clinical signs:

- Fever
- Swollen and/or abscessed lymph nodes
- Nasal discharge
- Coughing or wheezing
- Muscle swelling
- Difficulty swallowing

Veterinarians diagnose horses using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with either a nasal swab, wash or an abscess sample. They treat most cases based on clinical signs, implementing antibiotics for severe cases. Overuse of antibiotics can prevent an infected horse from developing immunity. Most horses make a full recovery in 3 to 4 weeks.

A vaccine is available but not always effective. Biosecurity measures of quarantining new horses at a facility and maintaining high standards of hygiene and disinfecting surfaces can help lower the risk of outbreak or contain one when it occurs.

On 23 Sep 2022, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed a Quarter Horse cross yearling filly in Lake County positive for strangles. She presented with nasal discharge and coughing starting on 1 Sep 2022, and is recovering. Within the previous month [August 2022], a new horse had been purchased and added to the herd. Two other horses on the property have been exposed and are suspected positive.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection confirmed 2 horses in Walworth and Dane counties positive for strangles.

On 29 Sep 2022, a 15-year-old Quarter Horse mare at a private facility in Dane County tested positive. She presented with a cough, fever, and nasal discharge beginning on 21 Sep 2022. She did not have a fever and is currently alive.

A 19-year-old Quarter Horse mare in Walworth County also tested positive. Voluntary quarantines are in place at both facilities.

The following _Streptococcus equi_ (strangles) fact sheet is from the Equine Disease Communication Center (https://tinyurl.com/46w9m3pc):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Disease name: _Streptococcus equi_ equi is also known as "Strep equi" or strangles.

"Disease type: Bacterial infection.

"Transmission: _S. equi_ is spread from horse to horse through direct contact. Horses can also contract the disease by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces. The disease is highly infectious.

"Frequency: _S. equi_ is extremely common. Most horses are exposed and/or infected at a young age.

"Incubation period: 3-14 days.

"Carrier status: Horses who have been infected but are clinically healthy can continue to incubate and shed the bacteria. A recovered horse may be a potential source of infection for at least 6 weeks after the clinical signs of strangles have resolved. Some horses that have recovered from the disease can become long-term, periodic shedders and can cause outbreaks when introduced to new herds.

"Shedding period: Horses infected with _S. equi_ are a source of infection to others and often continue to shed for up to 6 weeks post recovery.

"Latency: _Streptococcus equi_ is present during the incubation period, and the horse can be a carrier without any clinical signs.

"Severity: Low.

"Clinical signs:

- Fever, usually preceding other clinical signs by 24-48 hours
- Abscesses in the mandibular lymph nodes (in the throatlatch and below the jaw)
- Nasal discharge: often thick white and yellow mucus
- Inflammation of the throat
- Difficulty swallowing
- Wheezing
- Cough
- Purpura hemorrhagica: bleeding from the capillaries, which causes red spots on the mucous membranes and swelling of the limbs and head (rare; only in cases with complications)
- Swelling of the muscles (rare: only in cases with complications)

"Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made through culture of nasal wash, nasal swab, or pus aspirated from abscesses or through PCR testing.

"Treatment: Supportive care is the primary treatment. Use of antibiotics in infected horses is restricted to those with severe clinical signs such as respiratory difficulty, as most horses recover without antibiotic treatment. Horses treated with antibiotics early in the course of infection may avoid lymph node abscesses but may not develop immunity to the disease. Treatment decisions should be made by a veterinarian.

"Prognosis: Good. Strangles is rarely fatal and horses usually make a full recovery in 3-4 weeks with few complications. Horses who have been infected with strangles can maintain long-term immunity to that bacterial strain.

"Prevention: An intranasal vaccine is available but is not effective against all infections. Any surfaces that are contaminated with mucus or other nasal discharge from infected horses pose a threat of infection to healthy horses. After an outbreak, cleaning should involve removal of all organic material from surfaces and subsequent disinfection of water containers, feeders, fences, stalls, tack, and trailers.

"Biosecurity: _S. equi_ outbreaks can be hard to prevent because of the prevalence of subclinical carriers (clinically healthy horses who shed the bacteria for weeks or even years after recovery). Outbreaks are common, especially in facilities with high horse traffic where new horses are frequently moved between stables or herds. Whenever possible, new horses should be quarantined for up to 3 weeks when being introduced to a new facility. High standards of hygiene should be maintained in facilities to decrease chance of horses contacting contaminated surfaces. To prevent indirect infection during an outbreak, handlers should avoid coming in contact with susceptible animals after handling infected animals. Handlers should wear protective clothing, avoid using the same equipment on multiple animals, and disinfect hands and equipment when moving between animals." - Mod.TG]
