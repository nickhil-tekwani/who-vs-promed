According to the state health secretary, 13 people have now died of yellow
fever (YF) in the Serro region [one more since last report. - Mod.JW.].
Mass vaccination is being carried out. The last campaign against YF in the
region was 2 years ago, but only reached 60 per cent of the population, so
now vaccination is being carried out house-to-house, principally in the
rural areas. So far 1400 people have been vaccinated. Since Carnaval begins
in 10 days [when many outsiders flock to the affected region. - Mod.JW],
the Minas Gerais state government is carrying out a public information
campaign in bus terminals and airports in the state on the dangers of YF.
