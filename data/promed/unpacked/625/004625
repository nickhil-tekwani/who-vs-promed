Thank you for providing this valuable resource which allows me to stay
current on events related to arboviruses, particularly West Nile virus.
You provide an up-to-date, accurate and sometimes entertaining service to
those involved in mosquito control and other related activities.
In your posting in (cited above) there are a few items that appear to be
improperly reported, which frequently happens when interpreted by the
media. It was stated, "City officials will not be spraying insecticide
unless there is a confirmed case
of West Nile in New York." As mentioned earlier in this posting,
larvicides will be applied to targeted sites. I believe they intended to
say adulticides will not applied unless there is a confirmed case of WNV.
Also mentioned, "New Yorkers are being advised to wear long sleeves, apply
insecticides, and avoid areas of standing water during the coming months."
I hope they meant repellents rather than insecticides.
Keep up the good work.
