Belgium, new case of BSE
------------------------
Belgium (Thursday) said that it had found one more case of mad cow disease,
the 12th this year, after the implementation of the European Union-wide
screening tests. The country's French-speaking television network RTBF said
the new case was found in a farm near Ciney and the entire herd in which
the diseased cow was found was slaughtered and destroyed Thursday.
It was Belgium's 31st case of mad cow disease, scientifically known as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Belgium reported its first BSE case
in October 1997.

German ostriches may have mad cow disease
-----------------------------------------
Ostriches are thought to be dying of mad cow disease in Germany. The birds
have developed BSE-type symptoms after being fed animal bonemeal, which is
blamed for causing the disease in cows.
German newspaper Die Zeit reports that the symptoms were seen in ostriches
in various zoos. The paper says Britain's Ministry of Agriculture has
ordered research into the possible transmission of BSE from cattle to birds.
Vets at a Hanover college who examined the brains of the affected animals
reported that they found the same kind of holes as were found in
BSE-infected cattle. Other experts have dismissed any transmission of BSE
to birds. No BSE cases have been reported from commercial ostrich farms,
because their animals are slaughtered before they are old enough to develop
the illness.
Ostriches in zoos can live for 20 years or so, while those bred for their
meat are killed when they reach about 15 months.

[At one time Narang claimed that some British chickens were affected with
BSE. It turned out to be Newcastle disease, when Weybridge finally got
samples for examination. If anyone were to see avian BSE it would likely be
in British zoos. It has yet to be reported. Clarification is being sought
from German sources. - Mod.MHJ
