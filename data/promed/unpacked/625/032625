The number of patients suffering from an unidentified fever in
Embilipitiya in Ratnapura District has now risen to 700.

Director of the Sabaragamuwa Health Services, Dr. Kapila Kannangara,
said the patients' blood samples had already been sent to the Medical
Research Institute in Colombo as the health officials in Ratnapura
district are unable to verify the exact cause of this mystery fever.

The disease is associated with high fever and shows symptoms similar
to both chikungunya and dengue.
