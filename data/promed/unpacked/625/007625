Avian flu has infected Iranian chicken farms, posing a challenge to chicken breeders and the country's meat output, Financial Tribune daily reported [Tue 23 Jan 2018].

Since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year [Tue 21 Mar 2017], about 30 percent of egg-laying hens, or 20 million, and 10 percent of broiler chickens, amounting to one million, in the Iranian farms have been culled for the infection with the disease.

"If the virus spreads further among broiler chickens, the whole country's meat production will be affected, as chicken has an important share in Iranians' meat consumption," said Mehdi Masoumi-Esfehani, the deputy head of Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture's Agriculture, Water and Food Industries Commission.

Masoumi-Esfehani also said 300 egg-laying hen units have shuttered because of the outbreak and the remaining ones are operating below capacity and risk being shut down.

Nasser Nabipour, the head of the board of directors at Tehran's Union of Producers of Egg-Laying Chicken, said the 1st strains of avian flu hit Iran in the fiscal year 2010-11.

"The more deadly strain of the virus emerged in the 2015-16, infecting over 1500 egg-laying hen farms," he said.

According to Nabipour, most of the egg-laying units in Iran are located in the provinces of Tehran, Alborz, Qazvin, East Azarbaijan and Qom that produce 80 percent of Iran's total egg output.

"For every culling of 100 000 hens, around 150 workers lose their jobs," he said.

The operating units are now working at only 15 percent of their capacity, he said, adding that the virus might change in form and pose new challenges.

Iran produces over 2 million tons of chicken annually and is among the biggest producers of chicken in the world, according to Deputy Agriculture Minister Hassan Rokni.

Iran's per capita chicken consumption stands at 26-27 kg [57.3-59.5 pounds] per year, while the global average is 13-15 kg [28.6-33 pounds].

[It has been assumed (see 20171225.552266 and 20171231.5530508 ) that the current AI outbreaks in Iran are caused by the same strain, namely HPAI H5N8, which, according to official OIE reports, had started 11 Nov 2016. In the 6th follow-up ("final") report of the said event, submitted to the OIE [Mon 1 May 2017], the reporting authority included the following epidemiological comment:

"No further cases/outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been identified by [Mon 1 May 2017] in the whole territory of Iran. Final cleaning and disinfection of the last outbreak was completed on [Mon 30 Jan 2017] and the event was closed based on the surveillance that was carried out in accordance with Articles 10.4.27 to 10.4.33 during a 3-month period. Therefore, Iran complies with Article 10.4.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2016) and declares itself free from infection with avian influenza viruses with effect from [Mon 1 May 2017]." (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21618).

The lab-confirmed identity of the current causative agent which, according to media reports has already caused heavy losses in most if not all of Iran's provinces, is yet to be published. Alternately, the recent media reports, including the ones repeatedly posted by ProMED-mail, deserve to be confirmed or officially denied. No report on avian influenza from Iranian authorities has been published since [Mon 1 May 2017].

In its most recent monthly reports to the OIE covering Nov 2017 to Jan 2018, avian influenza outbreaks, caused by HPAI H5N8, was reported in Nov 2017 (5 outbreaks), Dec 2017 (9) and Jan 2018 (17 outbreaks). No later information has become officially available since.
