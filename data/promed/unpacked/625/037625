U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigators finally have
some details on the location of [the] _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Tennessee outbreak that shut down the Sylvester ConAgra Foods plant 5
weeks ago. On Thu 22 Mar 2007, ConAgra Foods blamed a USD 48 million
loss this quarter on its recall of Peter Pan and Great Value Peanut
Butter and there still is no timetable of when production will start again.
It's been 5 weeks since the lines at ConAgra Foods looked like this
and it could be the end of May 2007 before production resumes. The
clean up can begin now that the FDA has pinpointed the cause.
"The 2 environmental positives that we did find were, one of them was
in relation to the roaster and the other was on some cleaning
equipment," said Dr. David Acheson.
Because it was found twice in the environment, the FDA investigators
assume it is in other places and recommend a complete cleanup.
ConAgra is working with microbiologists on a plan to resume
operations, but doesn't have an exact date.
"It's taking a look at how do we start up production? How do we get
back up to inventory necessary to meet customer demand and bring it
back to the shelves in a timely fashion?" questioned Stephanie
Childs, spokeswoman for ConAgra.
While the company won't release specific answers to those questions,
they say employees continue the clean up effort. "They are working on
non-production related projects such as cleaning up, maintenance,
training to ensure we are working in the best way possible," said Childs.
"The precise way to clean up is up to them to decide; the
recommendation we make is pretty general and that is that the company
needs to do a thorough clean up to ensure the absence of _Salmonella_
in any future product that's produced in the facility, said Acheson.
FDA inspectors are gone from the plant now, but will return once the
cleanup is complete to make sure there are no future problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has stopped updating the
number of reported cases after reporting 425 people in 44 states were
sickened by the peanut butter. Twenty percent of those illnesses were
serious enough to require hospitalization.

[It is not clear from this posting exactly where the isolates were
found, by what mechanism the organism was introduced into the plant,
and how the peanut butter was contaminated. - Mod.LL]
[I would have thought that the roaster would be too hot in normal
operation for bacteria to survive on it long enough to be
sampled. But contaminated cleaning equipment is a good way to
spread bacteria around. - Mod.JW]
