Event started on 23 Nov 2021. A total of 1 outbreak (submitted) reported to date [26 Nov 2021]. HPAI H5N1 was detected in a backyard in Huntwangen, Bulach, Zurich.

Epidemiological comments: Two backyard chicken were found dead at the sanctuary and a sample was sent to the National Reference Center for Poultry and Rabbit Diseases (NRGK, Zurich, Switzerland), where it tested positive for avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 by RT-qPCR. Confirmation of the pathogenicity and further sequencing analyses are currently being carried out at the Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI, Mittelh√§usern, Switzerland). The animal sanctuary provides shelter for chicken, wild ducks, breeding ducks, pigeons, ornamental birds and other non-avian animals. Until Wednesday noon [24 Nov 2021], 22 of 30 symptomatic poultry have died. The remaining 8 will be culled immediately. The establishment has been put under movement restriction and further measures such as establishing protection and surveillance zones are foreseen for the coming days. Today, we have provided an alert to all holdings to implement biosafety measures.
