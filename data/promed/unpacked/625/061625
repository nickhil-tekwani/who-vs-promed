Tamiflu-resistant swine flu spreads between patients
----------------------------------------------------
Health officials say a Tamiflu-resistant strain of swine flu has
spread between hospital patients. A total of 5 patients on a unit
treating people with severe underlying health conditions at the
University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff were infected. Of those, 3
appear to have acquired the infection in hospital.

They are thought to be the 1st confirmed cases of person-to-person
transmission of a Tamiflu-resistant strain in the world. There have
been several dozen reports around the world of people developing
resistance to Tamiflu while taking the drug -- but they have not
passed on the strain to others. Just one possible cases of
person-to-person transmission of a resistant strain has been recorded
-- between 2 people at a US summer camp -- and this has never been confirmed.

Two of the University Hospital Wales patients have recovered and have
been discharged from hospital; one is in critical care and 2 are
being treated on the ward. The health officials stressed there was no
risk to anyone else. They said tests were being carried out to
confirm exactly what happened.

The UK has bought enough doses of Tamiflu, which can shorten the
duration of swine flu and reduce the risk of complications, for half
the population. So any spread of a Tamiflu-resistant strain of the
illness is a serious public health concern. The [pandemic] H1N1 virus
has been remarkably stable since it emerged in April [2009], but
virologists had been half expecting new resistant strains to emerge.

Dr Roland Salmon, Director of the National Public Health Service for
Wale's Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, said: "The emergence
of influenza A viruses that are resistant to Tamiflu is not
unexpected in patients with serious underlying conditions and
suppressed immune systems, who still test positive for the virus
despite treatment. "In this case, the resistant strain of swine flu
does not appear to be any more severe than the swine flu virus that
has been circulating since April [2009]."

Dr Tony Jewell, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, said: "We know that
people with suppressed immune systems are more susceptible to the
swine flu virus, which is why they are a priority group under the 1st
phase of the vaccination programme in Wales which is progressing at
pace. "We have stringent processes in place for monitoring for
antiviral resistance in the UK so that we can spot resistance early
and the causes can be investigated and the cases managed.
"Identifying these cases shows that our systems are working so
patients should be reassured. "Treatment with Tamiflu is still
appropriate for swine flu and people should continue to take Tamiflu
when they are prescribed it. "It's also important that good hygiene
practices are followed to further prevent the spread of the virus."

On Thursday [19 Nov 2009] it was announced that more than 3 million
healthy children under 5 across the UK will be offered the swine flu
jab. Figures released on Thursday [19 Nov 2009] showed an estimated
53 000 new cases of swine flu in England in the last week, down from
64 000 in the week before. In Scotland, the figure was 21 200, down
from about 21 500 in the previous 7 days. The rate of flu-like
illnesses diagnosed by general practitioners (GPs) in Wales dropped
to 36 cases for every 100 000 people from 65.8 the previous week.

[This appears to be the 1st unequivocal occurrence of transmission of
Tamiflu-resistant influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus from person to
person. However the circumstances of transmission are not revealed in
this report and this observation may have little relevance to the
situation in the general community. - Mod.CP]
