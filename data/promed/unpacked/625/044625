Mr Onyema Nwodo, Enugu State Agricultural Development Programme, says the government is tackling cocoa-yam [taro] disease in the state. The disease withers cocoa-yam plants. [It] manifested 2 years ago and made the farmers lose a lot of the crop.

Samples from the area [were] sent to the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI). Nwodo explained that they had to involve NRCRI to look into the disease and when the report was released, it was [to be] made public. He urged the department of agriculture to ensure that the disease was controlled.

[Cultivated taro is classified as _Colocasia esculenta_ (family Araceae), but the species is considered to be polymorphic with several variants grown in different regions. It is an important tropical crop worldwide and a staple food in many poor areas. Corms are used for starch, but processing is required due to the presence of oxalates, and leaves can be eaten as a vegetable. Other crops in the family include giant swamp taro (_Cyrtosperma_ species) in the Pacific and dasheen (_Xanthosoma_ species) in southern America. These crops are often regarded as a food "bank" since they can continue to grow in the ground for many years and be available when other crops may have failed.

Several fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens have been reported from Africa, as well as Asia and Oceania. Leaf blight caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora colocasiae_ (for more information see links below) is one of the most serious diseases of the crops and was reported in West Africa, including Nigeria, for the 1st time in 2010 (ProMED-mail posts 20101216.4451 and 20110422.1253). Another outbreak of the disease occurred in northern Nigeria in 2015 (ProMED-mail post 20151119.3805332). Molecular diagnosis of the samples that were sent off can be expected to clarify if the disease mentioned above is indeed due to the southward spread of leaf blight in the country, or caused by a different pathogen. Only when the causal pathogen is known can specific control measures be devised for the area.
