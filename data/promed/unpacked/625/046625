Just an FYI, I am not a subject expert, but the moderators should be
informed on the WHO workshop from last year:
Joint FAO/WHO Workshop on Enterobacter Sakazakii and Other Microorganisms
in Powdered Infant Formula,
Geneva, 2-5 Feb 2004

-.In situations where infants are not to be breastfed, caregivers,
particularly of infants of high risk, should be regularly alerted that
powdered infant formula is not a sterile product and can be contaminated
with pathogens that cause serious illness. Such caregivers should be
provided with information that can reduce risk.
- In situations where infants are not to be breastfed, caregivers of
high-risk infants should be encouraged to use, wherever possible and
feasible, commercially sterile liquid formula or formula which has
undergone an effective point-of-use decontamination procedure (e.g., use of
boiling water to reconstitute or heating reconstituted formula).
- Guidelines should be developed for the preparation, use, and handling of
infant formula to minimize risk.
- The infant food industry should be encouraged to develop a greater range
of commercially sterile alternative formula products for high-risk groups.
- The infant food industry should be encouraged to reduce the concentration
and prevalence of _E. sakazakii_ in both the manufacturing environment and
powdered infant formula. To this end, the industry should consider
implementing an effective environmental monitoring programme and the use of
_Enterobacteriaceae_ rather than coliform testing as an indicator of
hygiene control in factory production lines.
- In revising its Code of Practice, the Codex Committee on Food Hygiene
(CCFH) should better address the microbiological risks of powdered infant
formula and, if deemed necessary, include the establishment of appropriate
microbiological specifications for _E. sakazakii_ in powdered infant formula.
- FAO/WHO should address the particular needs of some developing countries
in establishing effective measures to minimize risk in situations where
breast milk substitutes may be used in exceptionally difficult
circumstances, e. g. feeding infants of HIV-positive mothers, or infants of
low birth weight.
- The use of internationally validated detection and molecular typing
methods for _E. sakazakii_ and other relevant microorganisms should be
promoted.
- Investigation and reporting of sources and vehicles (including powdered
infant formula) of infection by _E. sakazakii_ and other
_Enterobacteriaceae_ should be encouraged. This could include the
establishment of a laboratory-based network.
- Research should be promoted to gain a better understanding of the
ecology, taxonomy, virulence and other characteristics of _E. sakazakii_
and on ways to reduce its levels in reconstituted powdered infant formulas.
