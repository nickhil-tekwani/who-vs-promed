The outbreak of a banana disease may engulf the whole country if
local farmers won't change their attitude over precautionary
measures. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives
confirmed that Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) has already knocked
doors in Mara, Mwanza and Kigoma Region and that immediate measures
must be taken to ensure the disease doesn't spread further.

Dr Hussein Mansoor, Division of Research and Development, said that
farmers were not heeding experts' advice resulting in fast spreading
of the disease. "We have been cautioning farmers since the 1st
outbreak was reported in Uganda [see ProMED-mail post 20020105.3162],
but they have not stopped importing diseased crops from the
neighbouring country. Now the situation is getting out of control."

It is feared that if the affected crops will be moved, the outbreak
will spread like a bush fire. Overall, about 30 percent of the people
in rural Tanzania principally derive their carbohydrates from bananas.

The Ministry advises farmers to uproot their diseased crops and
cultivate cassava or maize. Steps are underway to replace the
diseased bananas, introducing about 93 nurseries of clean planting
materials. "The new crops will be planted with conditions that the
farms are thoroughly cleaned and remain bare for not less that 6
months," Mansoor said. Research [is being undertaken] where 10 new
banana cultivars from Belgium are being studied to see if they can
resist the disease.

The Ministry has also planned by March 2011 to deploy a delegation
for evaluation of economic and social costs that will be involved in
an elimination exercise of BXM. "That will definitely require serious
commitment from Local Government and Regional Administration," Mansoor said.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of
banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to
_Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana
types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence
of 70-80 percent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90
percent have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread
via infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and
contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management,
including cultural methods (such as crop rotation), use of certified
clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce
inoculum and prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen.

BXW 1st appeared in Uganda in 2001 (ProMED-mail post 20020105.3162)
and has been spreading in the region since then. In Tanzania, BXW was
1st reported in the Kagera region in 2007 (ProMED-mail posts
20070418.1277 and 20100416.1234).
