Leishmaniasis is a silent epidemic disease, warns Dr Julio Manzur, director
of the Vector-Borne Diseases Control Service (SENEPA). Manzur said that so
far this year [2010], there have been some 127 cases of cutaneous
leishmaniasis (skin), and 81 cases of the visceral type, which has caused
an estimated 5 deaths. "Leishmaniasis is a silent epidemic disease, not all
its effects are felt," said the doctor.

He also said that there are many difficulties in combating the disease,
since generally the owners of infected dogs do not want to sacrifice their
pets. "The treatment in dogs is not effective. If there is a clinical and
laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis (the pet dogs) have to be
slaughtered, a difficult job with the community because people love their
pets, they do not understand, and do not help us by accepting (that their
pets ) have to be culled," he added.

Manzur also said that owners of dogs that tested positive for the disease
must call SENEPA at (021) 215-167/9, for the implementation of transmission
control activities. Infected dogs may show signs including listlessness,
hair loss, poor appetite, and nail growth.

[Both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis are known in Paraguay (see WHO
map of world distribution at
<http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/leishmaniasis_maps/en/index.html>).

Leishmaniases are caused by 20 _Leishmania_ species transmitted by the
phlebotomine sandfly. A study from 2009 (Salomon OD, et al Distribution of
vectors of visceral leishmaniasis in the Province of Corrientes. Medicina
(B Aires). 2009; 69(6): 625-30; in Spanish, abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20053601>) suggests that increasing
urbanization is a driving force behind an expansion of the vector
_Lutzomyia longipalpis_. A study of the vector in the Iguazu Falls area
found that the risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis is associated with
deforestation, rural settlements, fishing, hunting, and ecotourism (Salomon
OD, et al Epidemiological aspects of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Iguazu
falls area of Argentina. Acta Trop. 2009; 109(1): 5-11; abstract available
at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983809>). - Mod.EP
