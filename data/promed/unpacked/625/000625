The Ministry of Public Health has warned campers of scrub typhus while in the forest. The infectious disease has so far killed 5 people, and 8000 more have come down with it in 2014.

According to permanent secretary general to the Ministry of Public Health Dr Narong Sahamethapat, as people usually go camping in winter, they should be mindful of their trips to the woods, given that as many as 8000 people have fallen ill after they were bitten by mites in the forests in 2014.

Anyone bitten by the infected mite usually develops scrub typhus symptoms after 10 days, which include shivering, headache, muscle pains, pink eyes, high fever, and exhaustion. Nearly 50 percent of those coming in contact with the disease reportedly have bite marks similar to cigarette burns [an eschar at the bite site is seen in several rickettsial diseases - Mod.LL].

In serious cases, patients would develop complications, while other people may feel better after a period of time. Although no vaccine has been developed to prevent the disease, it is curable, said the Department of Disease Control.

[The following is from a previous post by my colleague ML:

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

Illness in humans develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf).

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.
