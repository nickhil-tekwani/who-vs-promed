USA: Death of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Patient in New Hampshire
-----------------------------------------------
State health officials say a 20-year-old Newton woman died on Friday [9 Sep
2005] of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). This marks the 5th confirmed
case of EEE in the state this year but the 1st time someone has died.
Health officials said the woman was taken to a Boston hospital on Sat 3 Sep
2005 with symptoms of the disease. An initial test was inconclusive,
according to Dr. Jose Montero, the state epidemiologist. A subsequent test
confirmed yesterday [10 Sep 2005] that she had the disease, he said.
"The death of this young woman is terrible tragedy," Health Commissioner
John Stephen said in a statement. "Our thoughts and prayers are with her
family and loved ones at this difficult time. We are currently working to
determine where she might have been during the past few weeks to understand
where she acquired EEE," the commissioner said.
Montero says testing of mosquitoes in the Kingston-Newton-Plaistow area
have made it clear the [virus] has a foothold there. "That is clearly an
area where there's a lot of endemic activity, and people clearly have to be
careful," he said. 4 other confirmed cases of the disease in New Hampshire
involved people in Londonderry, Goffstown, Manchester, and Concord. All 4
were treated at area hospitals and have since been released.
State health officials continue to advise people to wear bug repellant
along with long sleeves and long pants and to empty any standing water on
their property where mosquitoes could breed.
Statistically, about 1/3rd of patients who contract the illness die from
it. 2 of 3 patients with the illness in Massachusetts have died this year
