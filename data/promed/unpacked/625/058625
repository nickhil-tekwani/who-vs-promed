More than 100 people have been infected by chikungunya [virus] in Singapore this year [2013], a steep rise from just 3-6 annually for the past 3 years.

Most of the cases are in the Kranji-Sungei Kadut area, but a growing cluster has emerged in the Bukit Timah area.

This painful mosquito-borne disease is not endemic [in Singapore], unlike dengue, which is raging in the eastern part of Singapore.

In the past 3 years, there were between 12 and 26 cases of chikungunya a year, of which only 3-6 each year were contracted in Singapore.

Both dengue and chikungunya are spread by the _Aedes_ mosquito, although the _Aedes aegypti_ is more likely to spread dengue and the _Aedes albopictus_ the chikungunya virus.

[In the past, Singapore was one of the few countries able to control _Aedes aegypti_ through effective community participation in elimination of breeding sites in and around houses and other buildings, and perhaps with larvicide treatment. However, these community-based control efforts are difficult to sustain over a long period of time, even with fines for property owners with mosquito breeding sites.

The statement above about dengue virus being transmitted by _Ae. aegypti_ and chikungunya virus by _Ae. albopictus_ is not correct. Both mosquitoes can transmit both viruses. Unless there is something unusual going on in Singapore, it is very likely that both mosquito vectors, and especially _Ae. aegypti_, are involved in transmission of chikungunya virus there. If that is not the case, ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information from the Singapore health authorities.
