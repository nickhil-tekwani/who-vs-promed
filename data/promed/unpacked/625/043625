Situation Report Summary -- up to the end of 19 Oct 2014
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Begins with a histogram of cases in the 3 countries.]

A total of 9936 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 5 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal) up to the end of 19 Oct [2014]. A total of 4877 deaths have been reported.

The outbreaks of EVD in Senegal and Nigeria were declared over on 17 and 19 Oct 2014, respectively.

EVD transmission remains persistent and widespread in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. All but one administrative district in Liberia and all administrative districts in Sierra Leone have now reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the outbreak began. Cases of EVD transmission remain lowest in Guinea, but case numbers are still very high in absolute terms. Transmission remains intense in the capital cities of the 3 most affected countries. Case numbers continue to be under-reported, especially from the Liberian capital Monrovia.

Of the countries with localized transmission, both Spain and the United States continue to monitor potential contacts. On 21 Oct [2014], the single patient with EVD in Spain tested negative for the disease for a 2nd time. Spain will be declared free of EVD 42 days after the date of the 2nd negative test unless a new case arises during that period.

On 22 Oct 2014, WHO convened the 3rd Emergency Committee on Ebola under the International Health Regulations (2005)...

Table 1: Confirmed, probable, and suspected cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone

Footnotes:

* For Liberia, 276 more confirmed deaths have been reported than have confirmed cases.
** For Sierra Leone, 127 more probable deaths have been reported than have probable cases.

Data are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results...

[This table has a column for reported cases in the past 7 days [13-19 Oct 2014:
- Guinea: 109 [avg. 16/day]
- Liberia: 413 [avg. 59/day]
- Sierra Leone: 454 [avg. 65/day]

Liberia and Sierra Leone must have run out of beds by now. They look on track to reach 100/day before the new 100-bed hospitals are finished and staffed. - Mod.JW]

Mali becomes 6th West African nation hit by Ebola
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mali confirmed its 1st case of Ebola on Thu [23 Oct 2014], becoming the 6th West African country to be touched by the worst outbreak on record of the hemorrhagic fever, which has killed nearly 4900 people. Mali's Health Minister Ousmane Kone told state television that the patient in the western town of Kayes was a 2-year-old girl who had recently arrived from neighboring Guinea, where the outbreak began. "The condition of the girl, according to our services, is improving thanks to her rapid treatment," the minister told state television.

A health ministry official, who asked not to be identified, said the girl's mother died in Guinea a few weeks ago and the baby was brought by relatives to the Malian capital Bamako, where she stayed for 10 days in the Bagadadji neighborhood before heading to Kayes. A ministry statement said the girl, who came from the Guinean town of Kissidougou, was admitted at the Fousseyni Daou hospital in Kayes on Wednesday night [22 Oct 2014], where she was promptly tested for Ebola. People who came into contact with the patient in Kayes have been identified and placed under watch, the minister said, but he appealed to any person who believed they may have had contact with the girl to step forward.

[3] Liberia: fewer new cases

Liberia: Ebola cases dropping from 10 to 3 daily
----------------------------------------------------------------
Cases of Ebola are said to be dropping from 10 to 3 per day at various Ebola Treatment Units in the country. For ELWA 2, it is reported that in September [2014] the Center received over 520 Ebola patients with over 142 survivals and approximately 290 deaths, and currently there are 54 patients and 41 have been confirmed at that unit, while the Island Clinic ETU received 384 patients with 103 survivors.

Doctors Jerry Brown of ELWA-2 and Atai Omoruto of the Island Clinic ETU have both admitted that the troops of patients taken at their various Centers have decreased numerically. Speaking at the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism regular Ebola press briefing yesterday [20 Oct 2014], Dr. Brown said the ELWA holding unit -- now converted to a treatment unit -- has been receiving between 2--3 patients in the past few weeks as compared to the past 2 months where they had to admit over 9--10 persons per day.

Dr. Omoruto, a Ugandan, also confirmed that the cases of Ebola have reduced as well but is not sure if it is the reality in the communities or people are just not reporting to the ETUs. According to Dr. Omoruto, several patients have been discharged from the Island Clinic ETU while more patients currently undergoing treatment are expected to be discharged anytime soon because they are responding to treatment.

However, in relation to the death of one of the 4 doctors who joined in the Ebola fight from its onset at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center, Dr. Omoruto described it as unfortunate and a regrettable situation.

She said Dr. Scotland's early departure [death] due to Ebola could be attributed to the walk-out protest by health workers at the Island Clinic ETU where he was being kept, treated and monitored before being transferred to Bomi County. According to Dr. Omoruto, Dr. Scotland could have survived if the health workers who were assigned at the Island Clinic didn't leave their work in protest which led the deceased to request his transfer to Dr. Logan in Tubmanburg. She said Dr. Scotland was later brought back to the Island Clinic ETU but by then his breathing system was deteriorating and his organs were all mal-functioning and there was barely anything they could do to save his life.

[4] WHO: extended incubation period
Date: 14 Oct 2014

http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/14-october-2014/en


[I missed this WHO statement when we posted the 1st paragraph and link on ProMED in Ebola virus disease - West Africa (192): 20141016.2870865, [2] WHO: Are the Ebola outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal over?]

Here is the excerpt from WHO's link above:

Incubation period
------------------------
The period of 42 days, with active case-finding in place, is twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus disease and is considered by WHO as sufficient to generate confidence in a declaration that an Ebola outbreak has ended.

"Recent studies conducted in West Africa have demonstrated that 95 percent of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the range of 1-21 days; 98 percent have an incubation period that falls within the 1-42 day interval. WHO is, therefore, confident that detection of no new cases with active surveillance in place throughout this 42-day period means that an Ebola outbreak is indeed over.

[Yet contacts are being released in the USA after only 21 days. But most of the so-called contacts have not actually had any skin contact with a case. However, maybe the quarantine period for all real contacts, including those who shared an apartment with D. when he was ill, should be re-evaluated.
