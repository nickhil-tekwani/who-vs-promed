Public hospitals in the capital, Bujumbura, are overcrowded, with more than
100% occupation of beds. Sick persons are admitted only if [other]
patients have recovered [sufficiently to allow them to] leave. According
to the director of the Prince Louis Rwagasore Clinic, Dr. Tharcisse
Nzeyimana, beds in all services are full up. He explained that the malaria
epidemic is behind the new situation, which won't be permanent. Dr.
Nzeyimana said the malaria epidemic broke out with the beginning of the
rainy season last October.

[If we knew how many cases make an epidemic we might have a better
perspective on the immediacy of this situation. Perhaps Steve Berger
(GIDEON) would provide us with some comparative numbers? - Mod.CHC]
