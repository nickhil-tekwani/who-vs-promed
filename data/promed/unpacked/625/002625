South Carolina officials reported 9 new counties infected with Asian
soybean rust today, saying they are finding ASR on a semi-regular basis now.
"Obviously we are well past the time when any control measures are
warranted," said John Mueller, Extension soybean pathologist at
Clemson University, in an e-mail today. "But, I think it is important
for everyone to see how extensive the distribution of ASR has been in
spite of our drought."
"We are now finding ASR on a semi-regular basis as we examine leaves
from fields that are anywhere from beginning to defoliate to greater
than 50-percent defoliated," he said. Until today's report, South
Carolina had 5 positive counties, including the farthest-northeastern
such county in the United States: Horry County. Now, the following 9
South Carolina counties join that list: Allendale, Anderson, Bamberg,
Darlington, Georgetown, Lexington, Oconee, Orangeburg and Saluda.
Mueller's list of new findings -- often multiple -- by county:
Allendale - John Mueller, Extension Soybean Pathologist, found ASR in
6 of 8 soybean fields south of Allendale and in 2 of 3 fields east of
Allendale.
Anderson - Meg Williamson at the Plant Problem Clinic confirmed that
ASR-infected leaves from experimental plots, submitted by Emerson
Shipe, Clemson University Soybean Breeder, were infected with ASR.
Bamberg - ASR was found on kudzu within the city limits of Bamberg by
Joe Varn, Bamberg County Ag agent; also found ASR on Highway 601
south of Earhardt and in eastern Bamberg County. (2 commercial fields
and 1 kudzu patch).
Darlington - David Gunter, Darlington County Ag Agent, found ASR on
his variety strip test at the Pee Dee Research and Education Center.
Georgetown - Carlin Munnerlyn, Georgetown County Ag Agent, found ASR
in 2 commercial soybean fields near the Pleasant Hill Community.
Lexington - David Gunter, Darlington County Ag Agent and John Oxner,
Lexington County Ag Agent found a commercial field infested with ASR
near Pelion.
Oconee - Meg Williamson at the Plant Problem Clinic confirmed that
leaves collected from a commercial soybean field by Howard Hiller,
Oconee County Ag Agent, were infected with ASR.
Orangeburg - ASR was found in 3 commercial fields by Lewis Beckham,
Orangeburg County Ag Agent in the Cope/Cordova area; Charles Davis
provided a ASR sample from a nearby area, and on a survey, John
Mueller found 3 commercial fields with ASR in the same general area.
Saluda - Jay Crouch, Newberry County Ag Agent, found ASR in his
monitoring plots in Saluda County.

For the 1st time ever, North Carolina officials have found Asian
soybean [ASR] in the state. 5 counties were confirmed to have soybean
rust based on samples collected Tuesday and Wednesday this week.
According to the map and the Chronology of Positive Detections on
<http://www.sbrusa.net>, the counties are Brunswick, Columbus and
Robeson* in extreme southwest North Carolina, and Beaufort and Craven
counties in the east-central part of the state. Beaufort County, NC,
is now the new northeastern-most positive county in the country.
[*Editor's note: State commentary below lists Sampson instead of
Robeson County. We will update the story when we get clarification.]
In the NC state commentary, Steve Koenning with the Department of
Plant Pathology at North Carolina State University posted the
following: "As a result of monitoring activities conducted by North
Carolina State University, ASR was identified on soybean leaf samples
collected from Brunswick, Columbus and Sampson (or Robeson?)
Counties, NC, on 10 Oct 2005.
According to Koenning, additional survey samples detected ASR on
soybean in Beaufort and Craven Counties on 10 Oct. 2005 and he made a
tentative diagnosis of ASR.
"Subsequently, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) confirmed the presence of Asiatic soybean rust (_Phakospora
pachyrizi_) [ASR] on these samples.
Koenning said that ASR was found in Mississippi, Florida, Alabama,
Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and South Carolina in 2004. This is the
1st report of this disease in North Carolina, although it has been
found in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina in 2005.
"Soybean rust will not impact North Carolina soybean production in
the 2005 growing season, because over 80 percent of the crop is
mature. The impact on the remaining soybeans will be minimal because
of the late entry of this pathogen into the state. Soybean rust does
not infect seed and will not contribute to seed rots."
With this report, plus 9 counties in South Carolina and 3 in Alabama
announced today, the 2005 U.S. total for ASR-infected counties has
risen to 104.

[104 counties listed as ASR-infected is an impressive expression of
ASR epidemiology. The detection of ASR in North Carolina will
probably represent the last state to report ASR in the 2005 soybean
crop year. - Mod.DH]

The 1st Asian soybean rust [ASR] of 2005 found in Louisiana was
discovered on Friday [28 Oct 2005] in East Baton Rouge Parish.
Raymond Schneider, the LSU AgCenter plant pathologist who discovered
ASR for the 1st time in North America in 2004 in a soybean field near
Baton Rouge, confirmed the finding as ASR. There was no word in the
state commentary of whether this year's find was on soybean rust or
on kudzu, or if it was in or near the same field as in 2004.
With this finding, reported just 11 days before the anniversary of
the 1st U.S. ASR, there are now 108 U.S. rust-positive counties in 7
states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina and South Carolina.
The map shows the 1 county (parish) with ASR in Louisiana and the 2
counties in Mississippi where ASR was found earlier this year.

to soybeans at this stage is of no consequence for producers. ASR
