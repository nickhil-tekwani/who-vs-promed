I do not believe the antigen change in pertactin (69kD protein) observed in
the _Bordetella pertussis_ strains recovered during the recent outbreak in
The Netherlands are a significant cause of that outbreak. Given the
success of a mono-component pertussis vaccine used in the Goteburg trial
in Sweden, namely the pertussis toxoid (PT) vaccine, combined with DT, it
is not yet clear that pertactin has a major role in inducing protective
immunity. [In the Swedish trial, the efficacy of the mono-component PT
vaccine was somewhat less than with 3 and 5-component acellular pertussis
vaccine in Italy and Swedish trials, but not significantly different.
A much more probable explanation of the outbreak in the Netherlands in
waning immunity
in children immunized with whole cell pertussis vaccine leading to the
accumulation of a large population of susceptibles among older children and
young adults. Immunity after whole cell vaccine has been shown to wane 3-5
years after the most recent booster. The age distribution of cases in the
Netherlands is similar to that observed in many other recent outbreaks,
such as in Vermont, Massachusetts, Chicago, Cincinnati, namely peaks in
unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants less than 6 months of age and
also in children over 10 years of age. The extent of pertussis in older
children, adolescents and young adults is significantly underestimated
because most physicians consider pertussis to be a disease of infants and
young children. During the Massachusetts outbreaks, serologic surveys of
school children demonstrated that the highest attack rate and bulk of all
disease was in older children, exactly what would be expected with waning
immunity after whole cell pertussis vaccine.

[Ron Gold has revisited our prior discussion of the relationship between
vaccine efficacy and the ongoing outbreak in The Netherlands, and this was
not really my intention when I suggested that isolates from the Australian
outbreak might be examined for antigenic shift in the pertactin antigen.
Ron's interpretation of the data that he cites may well be correct, but at
least one major pharmaceutical company has concluded that it is wise to
include the pertactin antigen in subunit vaccine preparations. We could
argue about the probable outcome of the experiments that I have suggested
for a long time, but it would be far better to just do them and examine the
data. - Mod.ES
