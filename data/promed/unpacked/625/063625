Avian influenza situation in Indonesia - WHO update 2
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a confirmed case of
human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. The case is a
2-year-old female from Bekasi City, West Java Province. She developed
symptoms on 2 Mar 2011, was admitted to a health care facility on 3
Mar 2011 and referred to a hospital on 9 Mar 2011. She has fully
recovered from her illness.

The case's mother [see ProMED-mail archived report -- Avian
influenza, human (24): Indonesia (WJ) WHO 20110314.0821] died of
confirmed avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection one day prior to
onset of illness in the new case.

The child accompanied her mother to the traditional market where live
poultry were sold, but investigations into the source of infection are
ongoing.

Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with avian influenza
A(H5N1) virus. Of the 175 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 144
have been fatal.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the provisionally confirmed
case described in the ProMED-mail archived report:
Avian influenza, human (30): Indonesia (WJ) 20110323.0921. The
infected child has now fully recovered although her mother did not
survive.

A question still to be resolved is whether the infection was
transmitted from mother to child or was contracted by each separately
from a common source.
