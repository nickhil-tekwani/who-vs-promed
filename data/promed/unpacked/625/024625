Emergence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanism MCR-1 in animals and human beings in China: a microbiological and molecular biological study. Liu Y-Y, Yang Wang Y, Walsh TR, et al.
-------------------------------
Summary
------------
Background
---------------
Until now, polymyxin resistance has involved chromosomal mutations but has never been reported via horizontal gene transfer. During a routine surveillance project on antimicrobial resistance in commensal _Escherichia coli_ from food animals in China, a major increase of colistin resistance was observed. When an _E. coli_ strain, SHP45, possessing colistin resistance that could be transferred to another strain, was isolated from a pig, we conducted further analysis of possible plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance. Herein, we report the emergence of the 1st plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance mechanism, MCR-1, in Enterobacteriaceae.

Methods
-----------
The mcr-1 gene in _E. coli_ strain SHP45 was identified by whole plasmid sequencing and subcloning. MCR-1 mechanistic studies were done with sequence comparisons, homology modelling, and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The prevalence of mcr-1 was investigated in _E. coli_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ strains collected from five provinces between April, 2011, and November, 2014. The ability of MCR-1 to confer polymyxin resistance in vivo was examined in a murine thigh model.

Findings
-----------
Polymyxin resistance was shown to be singularly due to the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene. The plasmid carrying mcr-1 was mobilised to an _E. coli_ recipient at a frequency of 10 '1 to 10 '3 cells per recipient cell by conjugation, and maintained in _K. pneumoniae_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. In an in-vivo model, production of MCR-1 negated the efficacy of colistin. MCR-1 is a member of the phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family, with expression in _E. coli_ resulting in the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A. We observed mcr-1 carriage in _E. coli_ isolates collected from 78 (15 percent) of 523 samples of raw meat and 166 (21 percent) of 804 animals during 2011-14, and 16 (1 percent) of 1322 samples from inpatients with infection.

Interpretation
---------
The emergence of MCR-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, polymyxins, by plasmid-mediated resistance. Although currently confined to China, MCR-1 is likely to emulate other global resistance mechanisms such as NDM-1. Our findings emphasise the urgent need for coordinated global action in the fight against pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

Experts have been warning for a while that the bell is tolling for the end of the antibiotic era, presaging a time when infections won't be treatable with the drugs that have changed modern medicine. On Wednesday [18 Nov 2015], that ominous knell got a little bit louder.

Chinese and British scientists reported that they have found a strain of _Escherichia coli_ that is resistant to colistin, the antibiotic of last resort for gram-negative bacteria such as _E. coli_. The resistant bacteria were found in pigs, raw pork meat, and in a small number of people in China.

It's not the 1st time colistin resistance has been spotted, but this time the phenomenon comes with a nasty twist. The resistance is conferred by a gene found on a plasmid, a portable piece of DNA. That's alarming because plasmids can both transfer within a family of bugs and to other families of bacteria as well.

If the resistance spreads, it will seriously limit the treatment options available to doctors facing antibiotic-resistant infections, said Dr. Jean Patel, acting director of the office of antimicrobial resistance at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Patel was not involved in the study.

The scientists -- from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, the China Agricultural University in Beijing, and other institutions -- called the resistance gene mcr-1. Reporting in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases, they described the emergence of mcr-1 as "the breach of the last group of antibiotics" by plasmid-mediated resistance [see item 1 above].

The mcr-1 gene can move among _E. coli_ bacteria, the scientists reported, but it can also go into other bacteria -- _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ -- and give those bugs the capacity to resist colistin, too.

A member of the polymyxin class of antibiotics, colistin is an old drug that was rarely used for decades because there were other antibiotic options that have fewer side effects.

But as antibiotic resistance has increased, the drug has become a critical part of the armamentarium; in 2012 the World Health Organization designated it as critically important for human medicine.

Experts have insisted it should be preserved for people and should not be employed in agricultural operations, where vast quantities of antibiotics are fed to animals as growth promoters. And yet, in China, the drug is used more in animal production than it is on people, said Timothy Walsh, a medical microbiologist from Cardiff University in Wales, and one of the authors of this paper.

"We needed to have definitive borders between antibiotics that are used in human medicine and those that are used in the veterinary sector," said Walsh, who was also involved in the discovery of another dangerous plasmid-mediated resistance gene, NDM-1. "That mantra should be universal and strictly adhered to."

Walsh told STAT in an interview that he and his co-authors will meet next week with government officials to try to persuade China to ban agricultural use of colistin.

After finding the mcr-1 gene in one pig, the authors of the new study conducted a survey, finding the gene in 166 of 804 pigs tested at slaughterhouses and in 78 of 523 samples of raw meat. They also found it in _E. coli_ bacteria isolated from a small number of hospitalized people in China; it was present in 1 percent of 1322 samples they tested.

Dr. Amesh Adalja is a Pittsburgh-based infectious diseases physician who has seen one of his patients die because of a completely drug-resistant lung infection. He thinks doctors will have to get used to that sense of helplessness going forward. Adalja, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said the plasmid-mediated nature of mcr-1 is "particularly scary" because of the potential for spread.

But the CDC's Patel cautioned that just because something has the potential to spread doesn't always mean that it will. She noted that a few years ago, _Staphylococcus aureus_ strains emerged that were resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin. In that case, too, the resistance was plasmid-mediated. Vancomycin is a mainstay in the treatment of staph infections, which are among the most common infections around. The discovery led to dire predictions. And they proved to be wrong.

"That's our classic example where we were very, very concerned and then it didn't spread," said Patel. Nonetheless, she noted, the CDC will need to ramp up surveillance for mcr-1.

[Colistin (also called polymyxin E) belongs to the polymyxin group of polypeptide antibiotics that are active against Gram-negative bacilli by disrupting the outer cell membrane, leading to leakage of intracellular contents and bacterial death. It is available for IV administration as colistin methanesulfonate (CMS), which undergoes rapid hydrolysis in vivo to colistin, the bioactive drug. CMS has been used for more than 40 years, but fell out of favor because of its nephrotoxicity. However, emergence of multidrug resistance has led to its revival. CMS is now used frequently when dealing with infection due multidrug resistant _Acinetobacter_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Acquired resistance to colistin has been rare and mainly due to mutations in chromosomal genes that lead to modifications in lipopolysaccharide, the site of action of colistin.

In China, however, pig farmers fed the drug to pigs to fatten them (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/11/19/a-superbug-emerges-in-china-to-remind-us-that-antibiotics-wont-last-forever/). Now, researchers (see item #1 above) report that a new gene (mcr-1) that confers resistance to colistin has been found: in a growing number of bacteria from pork meat collected from five provinces in China between April, 2011 (when 5 percent of _Escherichia coli coli_ tested positive for mcr-1) and November, 2014 (when 25 percent of _E. coli_ tested positive); from _E. coli_ isolated from 166 (21%) of 804 animals; and from 16 (1%) of the 1322 samples from inpatients with infection in 2014.

The mcr-1 gene is located on a plasmid, unlike the previously known gene that encodes colistin resistance, which is located on the chromosome. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes in commensal gut _E. coli_ is not necessarily innocuous (http://www.microbemagazine.org/index.php/05-2009-home/336-commensals-underappreciated-reservoir-of-antibiotic-resistance) and may constitute an important reservoir of resistance genes
(http://www.aseanbiotechnology.info/abstract/21018065.pdf). Genes that encode for antibiotic resistance are often located on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids that can move between bacteria of the same species and even can move across species and genus boundaries. Resistance can then be transferred in a horizontal fashion from non-pathogens to a variety of pathogenic species. Because genes that encode antibiotic resistance are often linked together, gene transfer can result in resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics.

Spread of mcr-1 beyond China is possible and needs to be monitored closely in human and veterinary medicine. Use of polymyxins in animal husbandry in China undoubtedly has provided the pressure for emergence of plasmid-located colistin resistance and use of colistin in animal husbandry will need to be re-evaluated. - Mod.ML
