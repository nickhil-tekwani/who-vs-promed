Researchers are worried about the effects of global warming after a loon in Umbagog Lake tested positive for avian malaria.

The loon was found last summer [2015] in the lake, which straddles northern Maine and New Hampshire. Necropsy showed that the bird died of avian malaria, the 1st confirmed case of the disease among loons in either state.

The finding was a wake-up call, according to Mark Pokras, a retired Tufts University professor who specialized in loon research for 35 years and now works as a wildlife consultant based in Maine.

"One of the things we know about malaria parasites is that they are moving north," he said. "We see other tropical and southern disease, like Lyme disease, move up here."

Pokras said the vector-borne disease -- one caused by the bite of an insect, such as a mosquito -- is not a threat to humans, but the finding raises concerns about the welfare of loons in northern New England. Maine has an estimated 4100 adult common loons during the spring and summer, and New Hampshire has 500. In the fall, the birds typically migrate from their nesting spots on inland lakes to the northern Atlantic coast.

"This parasite was not here 20 years ago," Pokras said. "We've been studying loons for a long time. So this problem has arrived recently."

Maine Audubon loon specialist Susan Gallo, who runs the state's annual loon count, echoed his concern.

"I think what is interesting about it is we didn't see it here 25 years ago. It's a really big question for the future," Gallo said. "It's a good teaching tool to illustrate the impact of climate change and the changes in vector-borne disease."

Malaria has been found in songbirds, Gallo said, but this is the 1st evidence of it in loons in New England.

Pokras said it's difficult to detect avian malaria, because the parasite can only be found in birds that have died recently. He said biologists at the Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge acted quickly and brought the loon to a wildlife pathologist at the University of New Hampshire, who found malaria in its body tissue.

Michelle Kneeland, director of the wildlife health program at the Biodiversity Research Institute in Gorham, hopes to learn more about avian malaria in the coming years through a new study, which tests the blood of live loons.

"We are currently conducting a large-scale study on adult loons, sampling a ton of live loons from across the country," she said.

The 3-year study sampled 100 live loons from across the country in 2014, another 100 in 2015, and 100 this year [2016], Kneeland said. The preliminary results are not expected until later this year, she said, but it will be the 1st study shedding light on the prevalence of the disease.

Maine bird biologist Danielle D'Auria at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said she is not concerned about the disease in loons, given that there has been just one confirmed case.

D'Auria recently attended the Northeast Loon Study Working Group at the Loon Preservation Committee in Moultonborough, New Hampshire, and the Umbagog loon was mentioned, but not a topic of discussion.

"It's definitely an interesting finding in the sense it could be something more prevalent that we haven't been aware of. It could be affecting our loons. I don't think it's necessarily a concern," D'Auria said.

D'Auria said the leading causes of death for loons in Maine are from lead poisoning found in fishing tackles and blunt trauma caused by boats.

Jeannette Lovitch, co-director of the Bradbury Mountain Hawk Watch, said the news of last summer's [2015] finding is not a concern in the general birding community.

"I certainly wouldn't be concerned at this point, not having other cases," said Lovitch, co-owner of Freeport Wild Bird Supply, in Freeport ME. "I have not heard of it spreading. I can't say I've heard of it being a concern in the general birding community."

[There are a few things that are concerning here. The article states, "Pokras said it's difficult to detect avian malaria, because the parasite can only be found in birds that have died recently." So how do we really know that avian malaria has not been there before? That the birds may have been deceased too long to find the organism does not mean the organism has not been there for some time. Furthermore, improvements to tests are constantly being made, and tests are generally becoming more sensitive. So this is another situation regarding testing sensitivity and specificity that may have improved to a point of allowing the organism to be found.

The article uses the analogy of Lyme disease. However, it should be remembered that Lyme disease was named after Lyme, Connecticut, where the organism for the malady was discovered as the cause of an illness existing in that area since the 60's, but it was not classified and named until 1981. So I am not sure that blaming global warming as the cause of these diseases is necessarily accurate. Our awareness, our tools for diagnosing, and enhanced testing has made things possible in today's world that were not possible even 10 years ago.

While malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes, it seems highly unlikely that mosquitoes have only recently been found in the area.

"Avian malaria is caused by a microscopic parasite called a protozoan. The specific name of the protozoan that causes avian malaria is _Plasmodium relictum_. _P. relictum_ affects only birds. Mosquitoes move the parasite around by biting an infected bird and transmitting it to an uninfected bird. The parasite cannot be transmitted directly from one bird to another and requires the mosquito to reproduce and move from one bird to another. In Hawaii, the mosquito that transmits the parasite is the common house mosquito, _Culex quinquefasciatus_.

In birds, _P. relictum_ reproduces in red blood cells. If the parasite load is sufficiently high, the bird begins losing red blood cells (anemia). Because red blood cells are critical for moving oxygen about the body, loss of these cells can lead to progressive weakness and, eventually, death.

Unusual mortalities of birds are often the only indication that avian malaria is a problem. At necropsy, birds may not show lesions or may have enlarged livers or spleens.

Because of its ecology (mosquito transmission), malaria is very hard to eradicate or manage. To effectively eliminate malaria from a habitat, you need to eliminate the mosquito or prevent the mosquito from feeding on the bird. This is a tall order, particularly in remote areas in wet forests..."
