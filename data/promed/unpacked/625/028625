Michigan's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services have identified 10 pigs at the Jackson County Fair testing positive for swine influenza.

The fair started 4 Aug 2019 and will conclude on 10 Aug 2019.

Pigs showing signs were tested, and results were positive for swine influenza. The ill pigs were removed from the fairgrounds after testing, and there are currently no reported human illnesses. All healthy pigs have also been removed from the fairgrounds, and the pig barns have been closed for the remainder of the fair.

The Jackson County Health Department in coordination with the Jackson County Fair Board and the MSU Extension Office are reaching out to exhibitors and their families with more detailed information. The Jackson County Health Department is also urging health care providers in the area to watch for patients presenting with respiratory signs who also report exposure to swine or who visited the fair.

Pigs may be infected with swine influenza viruses different from human flu viruses.

[Novel influenza viruses can arise among humans either by direct transmission from mammalian or avian sources or through genetic reassortment. The segmented nature of the influenza viral genome allows reassortment to occur in a host that is simultaneously infected with more than 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses. Although influenza viruses exhibit some host specificity, swine are susceptible to infection with viruses of avian and mammalian lineages, facilitated by the presence of receptors for both lineages in the respiratory tract. Swine can, therefore, serve as "mixing vessels" for different lineages, providing an opportunity for novel re-assortants to arise. The reassortant viruses may acquire mammalian adaption characteristics, thereby allowing infection of humans to occur [Webster RG, Bean WJ, Gorman OT, et al. Evolution and ecology of influenza A viruses. Microbiol Rev. 1992; 56(1): 152-79; http://mmbr.asm.org/content/56/1/152.full.pdf].

A(H1N2) viruses have been described among avian, swine, and human populations. Like A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses, A(H1N2) viruses have become established in swine herds in many regions. During 2012, in addition to over 300 human cases of swine-origin influenza A(H3N2) variant (v) viruses, a lesser known swine-origin influenza subtype variant, A(H1N2)v, infected 4 persons attending agricultural shows during the final days of the agricultural show season (see ProMED-mail Influenza (85): United States of America (Minnesota) swine H1N2 Influenza, human cases 20120911.1290389). Although there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, there was concern that the presence of the matrix protein derived from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which had been circulating widely in the human population since 2009, could potentially confer the A(H1N2)v virus with increased transmissibility among humans.

The specific strain of virus has not yet been reported. However, last year (2018), there were similar cases to these cases, which were among the 1st influenza A (H1N2)v virus infections identified in 2018 in the United States, and also from this particular Michigan fair. Since reporting of novel influenza A viruses began nationally in 2005, only 17 human infections of influenza A (H1N2)v (including the 2 Michigan cases) have been reported to CDC. We must wait to see which strain of virus this one is.

Studies at the animal-human interface are needed to determine seroprevalence, and active surveillance is needed to uncover infection rates to better determine the risk for zoonotic transmission of swine-origin H1N2 to human health. - Mod.TG with assistance from Mod.UBA
