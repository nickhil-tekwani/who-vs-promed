The discovery in Mauritius of 3 cows which died due to tuberculosis
causes concern among the officers of the Ministry of Health.

Samples were sent on 7 Oct 2011 for analysis to the Edgar Lawrent
laboratory in Port Louis, where tests confirmed the presence of the
bacteria responsible for tuberculosis.

So far, authorities have made no official statement but, according to
an official interviewed by Xinhua, the risk of contamination of the
population is there. "Anyone who has been in contact with these
animals is at risk of being contaminated and being able to infect
others," said the officer, who requested anonymity.

What is worrying, says this officer, is the fact that the samples
analyzed were classified as 2+, an infection that goes back in time.

At the level of the Veterinary Service of the Ministry of
Agro-Industry, it is apparent that the animals had been infected prior
to their deaths. They claim that the animals are of local origin,
excluding the possibility of imported tuberculosis infection.

The source of the disease remains to be determined. The source
contacted by Xinhua said that cattle could be infected by a sick
person who had contact with them or by a container that had been
touched by that person.

TB is spread mainly through saliva. The bacteria that cause the
disease can survive several days out of a body, in the damp earth or
dung, for example.

[According to the above newswire, the 3 cattle "died of tuberculosis";
such a statement is in need of confirmation, including detailed
pathological findings and final identification of the causative
pathogen as _Mycobacterium bovis_, or otherwise. The human bacterium
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ may infect cattle without causing typical
lesions.

In many cases, the course of the infection is chronic, and signs may
be lacking, even in advanced cases when many organs may be involved.
When present, clinical signs vary; lung involvement may be manifested
by a cough, which can be induced by changes in temperature or manual
pressure on the trachea. Dyspnoea and other signs of low-grade
pneumonia are also evidence of lung involvement.

In advanced cases, lymph nodes are often greatly enlarged and may
obstruct air passages, the alimentary tract, or blood vessels. Lymph
nodes of the head and neck may become visibly affected and sometimes
rupture and drain. Involvement of the digestive tract is manifested by
intermittent diarrhoea and constipation in some instances. Extreme
emaciation and acute respiratory distress may occur during the
terminal stages of tuberculosis. Lesions involving the female
genitalia may occur. Male genitalia are seldom involved.

At necropsy, tubercles are most frequently seen in bronchial,
mediastinal, retropharyngeal, and portal lymph nodes and may be the
only tissue affected. In addition, the lung, liver, spleen, and the
surfaces of body cavities are commonly affected. Early nodular
pulmonary lesions can often be detected by palpation. The lesions are
usually non-odoriferous. Other anatomical sites can be infected and
should be examined. Further details and guidelines for the laboratory
procedures are available online at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf.

According to the most recent periodic OIE report from Mauritius
(January-June 2010), bovine tuberculosis is included among the
OIE-listed animal diseases absent in Mauritius during the reporting
period; its last reported occurrence in Mauritius dates back to 2000.
