Since [1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 1562 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [1 Aug 2017], primarily among homeless people and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of Sat 25 Aug 2018:

- Total outbreak: 1562
- Hospitalizations: 881
- Deaths: 12

Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. This increase in cases has primarily been among injection and non-injection drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

These are weekly numbers similar to what is currently occurring in Kentucky. West Virginia has passed California and Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. With the 1031 number in West Virginia and Kentucky's 1425, these 2 states have reported 2456 cases. In the entire year of 2016 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm), CDC reported only 2007 cases from all 50 states.

Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (CA) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population, such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers, will continue. It is not clear how many of these rapidly increasing cases are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

Kentucky remains in 1st place in cases. West Virginia has roared passed California and Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. With the 1109 number in West Virginia and Kentucky's 1572, these 2 states have reported 2681 cases. In the entire year of 2016 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm), CDC reported only 2007 cases from all 50 states. Based on weekly numbers, there is no sign of decreasing numbers. It is not entirely clear what public-health responses are occurring in these two states. - Mod.LL]
