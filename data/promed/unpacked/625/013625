Varicella (chickenpox) is prominent every year in the winter and spring, and this April [2015] shows signs of high activity. After 3 consecutive weeks of increase, France has an average of 44 cases per 100 000 population as reported by the Sentinels health surveillance network. The most important are located in Pays de la Loire, Champagne-Ardenne, Corsica, Haute-Normandie, Ile-de-France, Franche-Comte, Brittany, Lower Normandy and Midi-Pyrenees, and to a lesser extent, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, Rhone-Alpes and Lorraine.

Varicella is an almost obligatory event in early childhood: at age 14, 90 percent of children have contracted the virus. Highly contagious, it is most often benign for the child. The virus is spread by the respiratory route, via saliva droplets emitted by a sick person or by contact with skin lesions. A person is contagious from 24 to 48 hours before the rash appears and for about a week, that is to say, until the blisters dry up and form a scab.

In case of exposure of a susceptible person, there is a 10-21 day incubation period before the onset of symptoms. In children, these are not very serious: mild fever with possible headaches, red spots which appear quickly with vesicles (bubbles filled with clear liquid) and are highly itchy. The number of vesicles is very variable: some patients have only a handful, others have the body covered in crops. After 6-7 days, the dried vesicles are crusted over.

Although there are vaccines to prevent varicella, French health authorities have not registered it in the vaccination schedule for children. However, vaccination is recommended for adolescents and adults from 12 or higher who have never contracted the disease (or who have a doubt about it). While the risk of complications is low in children over 1 year of age, it is important for adults, who can develop a varicella pneumonia, generally between 1 and 7 days after the onset of skin rash. It is manifested by a cough, pain in the chest or difficulty breathing. In pregnant women, the risk is added to that of miscarriage, premature delivery, or abnormalities in the fetus if acquired in the 1st 20 weeks. There is also a risk of varying severity to the unborn child if the mother contracted the disease a few days before birth. If acquired before 1 year, a baby usually receives antiviral treatment.

[Prior to the availability of varicella vaccine, there were approximately 4 million cases of varicella a year in the USA. Though usually a mild disease in healthy children, an estimated 150 000 to 200 000 people developed complications, about 11 000 people required hospitalization and 100 people died each year from varicella. Although the viral infection tends to be more severe in adolescents and adults than in young children, complications can occur in children, especially those who are immunocompromised. Routine immunization in children would prevent this by minimizing varicella in non-immunocompromised children, who would potentially function as a reservoir for the immunodeficient pediatric cohort. A similar logic was used for routine rubella immunization regardless of gender, as although only pregnant females can transmit the rubella infection to a fetus and produce congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), immune males produce an extra safety net to prevent CRS. - Mod.LL
