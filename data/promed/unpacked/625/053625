In Hudur, Bakool region, there are reports of an unclassified disease
that has affected over 90 people with 53 deaths. Signs and symptoms of
the cases include fever for one to 2 months, a high pulse rate,
occasionally sore throat, and progressive swelling of joints and limbs
including pain. It is observed that patients either recover slowly or
die.

Retrospective data collected indicates that the case fatality rate is
a major concern. WHO has dispatched additional supplies including
antibiotic syrups and tablets to Hudur to support the mobile clinic in
the affected villages for a period of one month.

[This may be the same cluster described in an earlier report (archive
number 20110521.1534) reporting 64 deaths in the same region due to an
undefined illness. Those deaths were reported to be mainly in women
and children. It is hard to fit the clinical syndrome into any one
disease entity, and one wonders whether there are multiple
contributing etiologies: respiratory viruses, arboviruses
(chikungunya?), malaria, enteric infections (including typhoid), and
hepatitis, all in the setting of more chronic maladies such as
malnutrition, HIV and tuberculosis. Any additional information would
be welcomed. - Mod.LM]
