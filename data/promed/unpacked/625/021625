Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus] has struck Gaya and its surrounding
areas, claiming the lives of 16 children over the last 3 weeks. The
children were admitted to Gaya's Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical
College and Hospital (ANMMCH), where dozens of others are under
treatment.

"On Friday night [9 Sep 2011], 8 of the children succumbed to the
disease, 3 of them within an hour," said Dr Sitaram Prasad,
superintendent, ANMMCH. "Till today [11 Sep 2011], the hospital has
admitted 56 children. Children in the 11-12-year age group are the
worst hit, Prasad said. The symptoms of the disease include
inflammation of the brain, high fever, headaches, rheumatic pains, a
stiff neck, convulsions, and nausea.

Doctors say the disease is not limited to Gaya district. A few of the
patients have come from Bihar's Aurangabad and Jharkhand's Chatra as
well.

The ANMMCH and the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) are running
short of diagnostic kits. The ANMMCH authorities have already
requested the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, to send kits
at the earliest. "I have also contacted the in-charge of JE at the
Union health ministry to arrange for the direct supply of kits to the
medical college hospitals," said head of department of microbiology,
PMCH, Dr Shankar Prakash.

Principal secretary (health) Amarjeet Sinha who visited ANMMCH to
assess the situation, has promised all help. Gaya civil surgeon Dr
Dileep Kumar said a team comprising four specialists from PMCH, 4
doctors from the Gaya district hospital and five from ANMMCH has been
constituted to tackle the situation. "Fogging and other preventive
measures to control mosquito breeding have been intensified," Kumar
said.

has been mentioned in previous reports this year from northeastern
India. Neither is there mention of JE vaccination status in the
affected population in the report above.
