Facing its worst avian influenza outbreak, South Korea has culled more than 33 million poultry since the 1st reported case last November [2016], officials said [Sat 11 Feb 2017] while observers noted local resources to deal with the deadliest outbreak may have already been stretched too thin.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the country has culled 33.12 million animals as of [Fri 10 Feb 2017]. The number is already more than double the previous record of 13.96 million destroyed in a 2014 outbreak.

The 1st case in the latest outbreak was reported at a chicken farm in Haenam, about 420 kilometers south of Seoul, on [Wed 16 Nov 2016]. It was caused by the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu strain.

After ravaging some 340 poultry farms nationwide, the outbreak appeared to subside around early February [2017].

But it resurfaced on [Mon 6 Feb 2017] at a poultry farm in Gimje, North Jeolla Province, some 260 kilometers [161.556 m] southwest of Seoul.

Government compensation towards the 340 AI-hit farms is expected to total 261.2 billion won (USD 227.1 million), 2.6 times larger than the amount from 2014.

By law, the central government shoulders 80 percent of the cost, with local governments responsible for the remaining 20 percent.

Despite this arrangement, local governments are asking the central government to increase its share of costs, citing additional burdens from the [recently recurred; see separate post] FMD outbreak.

"The situation is dire to the point where talks are floating on whether we should announce a moratorium as our budget might run out after paying for preventive measures and providing compensation," a local government official, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

"The central government should shoulder more. Sticking to the current cost-sharing arrangement in light of a nationwide disaster would add a big burden to local governments' financial health," the official added.

[S. Korea's most recent (No 2) follow-up report addressing the described HPAI H5N6 outbreak was submitted to the OIE on [Fri 2 Dec 2016]. As of the said date, the epidemiological statistics were summarized as follows:

Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 20 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Birds/ 240 624/ 4790/ 4790/ 235 834/ 0
(http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000021771_20161202_191509.pdf).

According to the current media report, the spread of the epizootic since has been, reportedly, extensive, causing strikingly high losses. An official follow-up report with updated information is warranted.

It will be of importance to obtain the data pertaining to the newly introduced AI strain, HPAI H5N6, separately from those pertaining to the AI strain which has been circulating longer in S. Korea, namely HPAI H5N8. Could the described losses be attributed to both combined? - Mod.AS
