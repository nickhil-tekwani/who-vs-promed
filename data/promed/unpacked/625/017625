From: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The following background information on Kyasanur Forest disease [KFD in
India was extracted from the GIDEON software program.
Kyasanur Forest disease was first described in 1957 [T.H. Work, Harold
Trapido, K. Shah, et al. of the Rockefeller Foundation. - Mod CHC in the
Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka State. Most cases are reported from Karnataka
(Shimoga, northern and southern Kanara and Chikmagalur districts). Rates
peak during January to February.
Epidemics were reported during 1982 to 1983, with 326 cases (29 fatal) in
1983. 88,152 persons in an endemic area were vaccinated during 1990 to 1992.
Local reservoirs include black-faced langurs (_Presbytis entellus_),
macaques (_Macaca radiata_), shrews (_Suncus murinus_), rats (_Rattus
wroughtoni_), birds, squirrels and bats.
The appearance of dead monkeys in the endemic area may herald an epidemic.

[We still have no information to confirm the guess that this is KFD. Steve
Berger also asked whether we had ever received additional information about
reports of "Fakeeh virus" outbreak in Saudi Arabia during 1994. This virus
was identified as a close relative of KFD virus. If someone at CDC (DVBID,
Fort Collins) would provide an update for us, we would appreciate it. -
