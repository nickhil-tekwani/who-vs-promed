In Cologne [Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia], 68 people are suffering from measles [the largest outbreak since] 16 years ago. The highly contagious disease affects all age groups.

In 2001 there were 500 measles cases in Cologne. Thereafter, the number ebbed away; in 2002, according to the Robert Koch Institute, 78 people were affected by the infectious disease. In between, the numbers were about 43 cases. 2018 is not even halfway over and the city is already reporting 68 measles patients. "One can speak of a worrying situation," said professor Gerhard Wiesm√ºller of the infection and environmental hygiene of the Cologne health department to RP-Online. "There is no group that is particularly affected."

The districts of Ehrenfeld and Neuehrenfeld are especially affected, according to the health authorities. But in other cities in North Rhine-Westphalia -- apart from Cologne -- there are measles cases:
Duisburg: 34 cases
Dusseldorf: 1 case
Hagen: 4 cases
Rhein-Erft-Kreis: 6 cases

In North Rhine-Westphalia, 126 people suffer from measles. However, there are also cases throughout Europe in Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, France, and the Czech Republic.

Punjab is at a potential risk of the measles outbreak as an alarmingly high number of cases of the disease have been reported in recent weeks, according to a report in the local newspaper. The situation is said to be more disturbing in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Gujranwala as most of the cases have been reported from there compared to other districts of Punjab.

The official figures pertaining to the measles cases show that a sharp increase has been witnessed during the last 4 weeks or so, calling into question the health experts dealing with the prevention of the diseases.

Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) Punjab director Munir Ahmad said the health teams had responded to emergencies in 73 union councils of the province, which had recently reported measles outbreaks. "We are facing an extraordinary situation in the current peak season of the measles in Punjab as a good number of cases are being reported these days," he said.

The EPI Punjab surveillance bulletin continued reporting a sharp increase in the cases surfacing in most parts of the province. According to the official statistics, 31 children in the province have succumbed to the disease in the last 4 months or so. This death toll is said to be alarmingly high in recent years since the Punjab province started reporting the measles cases.

Most cases were reported from Lahore where total 1412 suspected measles cases were reported during last four months or so, followed by 786 in Rawalpindi and 307 in Gujranwala. The Union Council 135 of Lahore alone has 3 confirmed measles outbreaks in recent times.

According to the EPI performance indicators, total 5178 suspected and 258 confirmed measles cases have been reported in Punjab since January 2018. During the last one week, 735 measles suspected cases were reported.

Of the total 31 child deaths caused by the measles, 3 were reported in Lahore, 2 in Okara, one each in Sahiwal, Jaranwala, Chakwal, Chiniot, Kasur, etc.

The EPI performance indicators further shared statistics about the 12 high-risk districts, stating Attock reported 140 suspected measles cases, Faisalabad 260, Kasur 139, Okara 180, Rahim Yar Khan 115, Rajanpur 128, Sahiwal 136, Sheikhupura 210, Sialkot 115, and Toba Take Singh reported 126 suspected measles cases.

Of the total 38 [?39] outbreaks of the disease, Lahore reported 27, 5 each in Rawalpindi and Rajanpur and one each in Attock and Sheikhupura.

Of the total 258 confirmed cases in high-reporting districts, Lahore reported 158, Rawalpindi 31, Sheikhupura 20, Rajanpur 15 while Attock reported 6 confirmed cases, say the EPI-Punjab performance indicators.

According to Dr Munir, if 5 or more cases were reported in any union council, it is considered an outbreak. "However, we can't declare the measles outbreak in Punjab on the basis of the present reported number of suspected and confirmed cases across the province so far," he said. However, Dr Munir termed the situation as disturbing and said the health teams had been alerted to curtail the number of cases by reaching out to the maximum number of children to vaccinate them against the measles.

A case of measles has been confirmed in Brisbane's south, Queensland Health says. A child later diagnosed with measles travelled from Delhi to Brisbane, via Bangkok, on Tue 22 May 2018. [See source URL above for locations and flights where individuals may have been exposed.]

Metro South Health [MSH] staff have been contacting people who were in close contact with the child. MSH public health physician Bhakti Vasant said it was likely more cases of measles would appear in the following weeks due to the high number of people exposed. "If people are adequately vaccinated with 2 recorded doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, they are very unlikely to get the disease. People who are unsure or have concerns about their immunity to measles should contact their doctor to check whether they have had both vaccines," Dr Vasant said.

The Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) has been tasked to conduct a massive campaign to contain the rise of measles cases in this province. Gov Wilter Palma issued the order on [Mon 28 May 2018] after his office received the IPHO report indicating a high number of recorded measles cases since January this year [2018].

IPHO recorded 133 cases of measles for the 1st quarter of this year [2018], up by 20 cases from 113 registered in the same period of last year [2017]. An additional 23 cases have been recorded for the month of April until 18 May 2018, making a total of 156 measles cases registered since January.

Palma said the alarming spike of measles cases since January [2018] requires "a pro-active response from the provincial government. In order to protect our children and save lives, it is mandatory that the provincial health office must conduct a massive anti-measles vaccination whenever applicable," he said.

The IPHO has set a goal to immunize 75 000 children aged 6-59 months throughout this province. "We would like to assure our people that the provincial government is committed in keeping our children free from a preventable disease like measles through timely intervention," Palma said. Last week [week of 21 May 2018], the Department of Health launched the "Ligtas Tigdas" campaign providing free measles vaccination to young children.

South Korean health officials are reporting strengthened control measures in response to 3 confirmed measles cases at Hanlim Arts School in [Songpa district] Seoul to prevent further spread of the disease. Following initial reports of a suspected case on [8 May 2018], there have been reports of 6 subsequent suspected cases, 3 of which have been confirmed as of 27 May [2018].

An emergency planning meeting was held on 7 May [2018] to strengthen monitoring of suspected and confirmed cases, as well as possible contacts. Temporary vaccinations are to be administered to 80 students and faculty whose measles vaccination history could not be confirmed.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) is working with city officials to keep the spread of the disease under control. Together they have established a rapid response system for district public health centers and schools, and are conducting joint epidemiological investigations to monitor the situation.

Symptomatic individuals are being advised to refrain from going to school, and parents are being informed if their children are suspected of measles infection, along with instructions for isolation and other measures to prevent further spread.

KCDC has advised medical and healthcare professionals to isolate and immediately report patients who show symptoms of fever and rash and are suspected of measles infection.
