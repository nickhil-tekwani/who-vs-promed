With regard to the hantavirus outbreak in Turkey, _Apodemus agrarius_ is
found only on the European side of the Bosporus Strait, and, therefore,
Saaremaa virus, the hantavirus carried by this host species in Europe,
could hardly be responsible for the outbreak reported on the northern,
Black Sea coast of Turkey.

There are several other _Apodemus_ mouse species in Turkey that could carry
hantaviruses. Dobrava virus in _A. flavicollis_ is a well-known severe
pathogen in the Balkan region, and this rodent species is common in Turkey.
The severity of disease may suggest Dobrava virus or a Dobrava-like virus.

Other _Apodemus_ species on the Anatolian side of Turkey include e.g. _A.
mystacinus_, _A. uralensis_, _A. witherbyi_, _A. hermonensis_, _A.
fulvipectus_, _A. ponticus_, and possibly _A. hyrcacinus_ and _A. arianus_,
several of which can occur on the northern coast. It is good to know that
the taxonomy of _Apodemus_ in the region is not completely settled, but
_Apodemus_ diversity potential for new hantaviruses surely exists. In our
screening in northeastern and western Turkey (referred to by moderator TY),
we had samples from _A. flavicollis_, _A. uralensis_ (mentioned by us as
_A. sylvatics s._l.) and _A. mystacinus_, but no hantaviruses were found.

_Myodes glareolus_, the host of Puumala virus, is found on the northern
Black Sea coast in Turkey, and, therefore, this virus is also a potential
cause of the outbreak, but our samplings were not in the range of this vole
species in Turkey. Hantaviruses in _Microtus voles_ are usually considered
nonpathogenic to humans.

[ProMED-mail welcomes the opportunity to post this comment from Professor
Henttonen based his extensive experience of European hantaviruses and their
vectors, which is directly relevant to the question of the precise identity
of the agent responsible for the current outbreak in Turkey. - Mod.CP]
