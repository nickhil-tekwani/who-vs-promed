[The data above pertain to the results of PCR tests applied between 31 Mar and 11 Apr 2016, in 4 separate, distant locations spread over the territory of Saudi Arabia (see map at the source URL above). According to the epidemiological comments, these tests were "associated with human confirmed cases" probably involving primary MERS-CoV cases in persons who had been in contact with camels. One of the "outbreaks" was reported from an animal market, one from "a village", 2 from "farms". These results are not surprising, confirming the circulation of the virus within Saudi Arabia's camel population (here, about 36 percent PCR-positive). Some detail on the age distribution of the tested animals would be helpful; the shedding of the virus, challenging human health, is mainly related to young camelids.

The official reporting of these lab test results to the OIE may be indicative of the authorities' intention to consider preventive measures. Their reported "applied measures" however, deserve to be explained. What "movement control" (inside the country) may be applied, when the virus seems to be widely circulating within the camel population, throughout? In case applied, is it restricted to farms involved in human infection or to specific husbandry methods/age groups?

In particular: what is meant by "vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists)"? Is an (animal) MERS-CoV vaccine being developed/tested?

According to the most recent information (17 Jun 2016; see 20160617.4294117) the accumulated total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans in Saudi Arabia is 1404, including 593 deaths (reported case fatality rate 42.2 percent), 790 recoveries, 21 currently active cases (including 13 asymptomatic infections). An updated number of primary human cases, attributed to contact with camels, within the said figures, will be helpful. - Mod.AS

[2] Primary human cases, recombinant clade

Saudi Arabia reported 2 new MERS-CoV cases today [15 Jun 2016], one of them involving camel exposure, as new details emerged about a Saudi link to a recent case in Qatar and a new recombinant clade of the virus that was implicated in a surge of illnesses in early 2015, many of them tied to health facilities in Riyadh.

A steady stream of Saudi MERS-CoV cases in March [2016] has slowed to just a few sporadic cases every few days in recent months, most of them reflecting primary exposure, often from camels.

In a statement today [15 Jun 2016] the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) said one of the 2 newly confirmed patients is a 68-year-old man from Medina who is in stable condition. An investigation into the source of his MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection revealed indirect contact with camels. [An additional primary case has been reported on 17 Jun 2016, involving a 48-year-old Saudi male from Taif, non-healthcare worker, reported to be in stable condition. Classified as a primary case with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of symptoms].

The other illness involves a 49-year-old woman in Riyadh who is hospitalized in critical condition. She isn't listed as a healthcare worker, and the source of her infection is listed as primary --meaning she had no known contact with other sick people.

Their infections lift Saudi Arabia's MERS-CoV total to 1388, which includes 593 deaths, according to the MOH. 5 patients are still being treated for their illnesses.

Qatar's health ministry on Jun 12, meanwhile, reported a new MERS-CoV case in a 23-year-old man who hadn't been in contact with other confirmed cases and didn't have any underlying health conditions. The announcement prompted ProMED Mail, the e-mail list of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, to ask members in Qatar for more information.

In response, Qatar members of EpiCore Surveillance Project, an online infectious disease reporting system, said the man was from Bangladesh and had traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he had contact with camels. His MERS-CoV infection was detected when he was hospitalized after a 4-day history of cough and fever. They said the man is stable and under observation.

The man's illness is Qatar's 3rd of the year [2016]and its 18th case overall.

The identification of a novel recombinant MERS-CoV clade came through the emergency public health response to a gush of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia during the 1st half of 2015, especially in February when Riyadh experienced some substantial hospital outbreaks. The sharp rise in cases last February triggered a joint World Health Organization (WHO) mission to Saudi Arabia to assist with the investigation.

Researchers from Saudi Arabia and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published their findings yesterday [14 Jun 2016] in the Journal of Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

Their investigation included epidemiologic and molecular testing information from 216 cases reported to the MOH from 1 Jan to 30 Jun 2015. They did a more in-depth analysis of cases reported in February, when the biggest spike in cases was reported. Of 87 cases reported during that month, 13 case-patients didn't have any risk factors for secondary infection and 12 reported no camel contact, which raised questions about whether the virus had changed.

Spike gene or full genome analysis of MERS viruses from 99 patients found that 72 formed a new recombinant clade that the group dubbed NRC-2015. Viruses in the new clade were detected from 6 of Saudi Arabia's regions and became the predominant strain by June 2015. 8 of the 9 viruses from the group of patients with no known risk factors belonged to the NRC-2015 clade.

When the researchers compared the viruses in the new clade with previous strains, they found that NRC-2015 persisted longer than earlier clades and that it gained a wide geographic distribution in a relatively short time, which hinted at greater epidemiologic fitness. However, they didn't find any clinical differences between it and earlier clades. The team said implications for virus replication and transmission need further study, and the lack of epidemiologic links in some cases shows the need for more intensive surveillance to better understand MERS-CoV transmission.

The authors wrote that studies documented the NRC-2015 MERS-CoV features in recent camel samples from Oman and Saudi Arabia, first detected in July 2014 and becoming predominant in Saudi Arabia at a time that overlaps the new findings in humans. Taken together, the pattern might reflect multiple introductions from camels with similar strains, the team noted.

NRC-2015 probably emerged in mid to late 2014 and, based on camel sequences, likely diverged between December 2013 and June 2014, according to the study.

Other clues from the study included closely similar viruses in patients without risk factors, which could suggest limited transmission from those with unrecognized MERS illnesses. The researchers also noted that 16 (18 percent) of the patients sickened during the February surge were hospital visitors, similar to the 17 percent figure for hospital visitors in the 2014 outbreak in Jeddah.

"Recommendations to limit visitation in facilities with ongoing MERS-CoV transmission should be reinforced to limit these exposures," the group wrote.

Abstract
--------
Background. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory illness in humans. Fundamental questions about circulating viruses and transmission routes remain.

Methods. We assessed routinely collected epidemiologic data for MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during 1 Jan-30 Jun 2015, and conducted a more detailed investigation of cases reported during February 2015. Available respiratory specimens were obtained for sequencing.

Results. During the study period, 216 MERS-CoV cases were reported. Spike gene or full genome sequences (n=17) were obtained from 99 individuals. Most (72 of 99, 73 percent) sequences formed a discrete, novel recombinant clade (NRC-2015), which was detected in 6 regions and became predominant by June, 2015. No clinical differences were noted between clades. Among 87 cases reported during February 2015, 13 had no recognized risks for secondary acquisition; 12 of these 13 also denied camel contact. Most viruses (8 of 9) from these 13 individuals belonged to NRC-2015.

Discussion. Our findings document the spread and eventual predominance of NRC-2015 in humans in Saudi Arabia during the 1st half of 2015. Our identification of cases without recognized risk factors but with similar virus sequences suggests that additional study is needed to better understand risk factors for MERS-CoV infection. - Mod.AS
