"There are at least 2 different lineages of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N6) circulating in poultry. The Asian lineage strains of HPAI H5N6 have been responsible for outbreaks in poultry in China and South East Asia since 2014 and are associated with severe human disease.

"During 2017, a 2nd lineage of HPAI H5N6, a reassortant of H5N8 was identified in birds in Korea, Japan, and across Europe. The reassortant strain is considered unrelated to the Asian lineage and has not been associated with human cases.

"Since 2014, HPAI A(H5N6) has been responsible for widespread outbreaks in birds across China, Japan, and South East Asia and in 2018 significant outbreaks [were] reported from Mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Viet Nam. The Philippines has also reported H5N6 in poultry. The virus is highly pathogenic in birds and has been isolated from both poultry and wild birds.

"In April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) first reported a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) from China. As of 14 Jan 2019, a total of 23 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported from 10 different provinces across mainland China. 4 of these cases were in children, 2 of whom had only mild illness. Of the remaining 19 adult cases, all had a severe illness and at least 15 were fatal.

"The majority of human cases of HPAI A(H5N6) in mainland China are known to have had contact with birds or their environments prior to becoming ill and there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. WHO considers that the H5 avian influenza viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans and therefore the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low at present".
