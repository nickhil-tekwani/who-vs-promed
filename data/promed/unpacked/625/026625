A drug used to euthanize animals has been found in canned dog food, prompting a recall.

Low levels of the drug pentobarbital were detected in cans of Gravy Train dog food produced by the J.M. Smucker Company, the FDA said in a statement Friday [16 Feb 2018].

Pentobarbital is most commonly used as a sedative, anesthetic or to euthanize animals, it said.

"Pets that eat pet food containing pentobarbital can experience drowsiness, dizziness, excitement, loss of balance, nausea, nystagmus (eyes moving back and forth in a jerky manner) and inability to stand. Consuming high levels of pentobarbital can cause coma and death," it said.

The FDA said its preliminary evaluation of the testing results of Gravy Train samples indicated that the low levels found were unlikely to pose a health risk to pets.

"However, any detection of pentobarbital in pet food is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&CA). Simply put, pentobarbital should not be in pet food," it said.

The J.M. Smucker Company said it had initiated a voluntary recall of specific shipments of Gravy Train, Kibbles 'N Bits, Ol' Roy and Skippy canned dog food after pentobarbital was found.

"The company has identified the root cause to be a single supplier and a single, minor ingredient, used at one manufacturing facility," it said in a statement. It said it took the issue "very seriously" and was "extremely disappointed" at the contamination.

"Above all, we are a company that loves pets and understand the responsibility we have in providing high quality food for the pets our consumers love."

Customers who purchased the product could call with any concerns or for a refund or replacement product, the company said.

[It is sad this has happened to another supplier.

While any level of this drug in pet food is a violation of FFD&CA, they did note it is in very low levels and unlikely to harm an animal. The company has put out a recall. Before it hit the news, I noticed it was on my grocery store receipt, although I had not purchased pet food.

It appears from the FDA website that it is all canned food being recalled. This means the dry food is not a problem.

Likely, the supplier of meat picked up a beef animal which was euthanized. The person having the deceased animal should notify the person picking up the animal if it has been euthanized instead of dying by natural causes. It has happened before with other pet food brands.

The risk of this type of situation may increase, especially with no grain diets, as they are meat based, and any animals used in the processing could be suspects of being euthanized. The challenge for regulatory bodies is to construct a regulation allowing food producers to keep producing pet food while providing regulations for safe food. - Mod.TG
