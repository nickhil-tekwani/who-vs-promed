The number of mumps cases reported in Central Ohio has reached 404 cases as of today, according to a Columbus Public Health (CPH) press release Monday [2 Jun 2014]. 220 of the cases are linked to the Ohio State University outbreak that began in early March [2014]. How bad is the mumps outbreak in Ohio? CPH officials say that last year [2013], there were 438 cases recorded nationwide.

Although mumps is typically a mild infection, there are complications that are possible with the viral infection. CPH reports that 13 people required hospitalization from their illness; a dozen males suffered with orchitis while 4 women have faced oophoritis. One patient has suffered either partial or complete hearing loss.

[When the status of this mumps outbreak was last posted by ProMED-mail, there was a total of 361 cases (Mumps - USA (03): (OH) update 20140409.2391429), with 208 cases in Franklin County where the Ohio State University [OSU] campus is located. Now there are 404 cases, with 220 of the cases linked to Ohio State University (OSU).

The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrollment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). However, OSU does not mandate immunization against mumps before matriculation.

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students, where the intensity of exposure among students presumably overcomes vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine virus are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full). - Mod.ML
