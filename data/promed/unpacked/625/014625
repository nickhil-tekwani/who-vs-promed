A Novel Pneumovirus Isolated from Children with Respiratory Tract Disease
-------------------------------------------
In the current issue of "Nature Medicine," Bernadette G, van den Hoogen,
Jan C. de Jong, Jan Goen, Thijs Kuiken, Ronald de Groot, Ron A.M. Fouchier
and Albert D.M.E.
Osterhaus describe the isolation and characterisation of a novel
paramyxovirus from 28 children in the Netherlands. On the basis of
virological data, sequence homology and
genome organisation, this virus was identified tentatively as a new member
of the genus _Metapneumovirus_. The only other known member of this genus
is the avian virus known as turkey rhinotracheitis virus [or avian
pneumovirus]. Bernadette et al. have proposed the provisional name, human
metapneumovirus, for this newly discovered human pathogen.
The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were
similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection,
ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and
pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by the age of 5 years, virtually
all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus
and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.

[Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), a paramyxovirus which belongs to
the genus _Pneumovirus_, is a universal respiratory pathogen which in
temperate climates is the principal cause of hospitalisation of children in
their first year of life, and which is now also considered to be a major
cause of death in the elderly, rivalling influenza virus in this respect.
The isolation of a metapneumovirus (a related but distinct virus previously
only thought to exist in birds) from children with bronchiolitis is a
significant and surprising discovery. A great deal of effort has gone into
development of a vaccine to control HRSV infection in children, and the
discovery of another apparently equally ubiquitous and serologically
unrelated virus causing similar disease is unwelcome news.
It should be noted that turkey rhinotracheitis virus, the founder member of
the genus _Metapneumovirus_, was considered for many years to be restricted
to the Old World, because the immunological reagents used for diagnosis did
not react with strains of the virus now known to be present in the New
World. It may be that the widespread use of highly specific monoclonal
antibodies for diagnosis of HRSV infection in children is one of the
reasons why this human metapneumovirus was not detected sooner. - Mod.CP]
