Zimbabwe is reporting up to 50 cases of typhoid per day and has treated more than 1500 people in an outbreak blamed on poor water and sanitation facilities, the health minister said Tue 31 Jan 2012.

"By the end of December 2011, more than 1500 cases had been seen and treated," Henry Madzorera told a news conference in the capital Harare. "An average of 30 to 50 cases are reported on a daily basis."

The bacterial disease is transmitted by contaminated food and water. Since the current outbreak started last October 2011, 350 suspected cases and 16 confirmations were reported in the 1st 3 weeks of 2012. No deaths have been reported up to now.

"The progressive deterioration of public health infrastructure has seen such rare diseases like typhoid becoming more commonly encountered within our population," Madzorera said, in reference to water and sewerage pipes. "The same poor water and sanitation conditions in Harare prevail in most of our urban areas and other parts of the country."

Some suburbs go for weeks without running water as Zimbabwean municipalities battle to keep up services. Harare city authorities said they can't supply water to all the city's residents. Dams and water treatment facilities date back to before Zimbabwe's 1980 independence and cannot sustain demands from the ever-increasing population in the capital.
