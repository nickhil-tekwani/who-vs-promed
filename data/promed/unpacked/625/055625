Japan's Shionogi & Co Ltd and Swiss drugmaker Roche won US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for their flu treatment, the 1st new flu drug approved by the agency in nearly 20 years.

Xofluza was approved to treat acute uncomplicated influenza, a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, in patients 12 years of age and older who have had symptoms for no more than 2 days, the FDA said.

"This is the 1st new antiviral flu treatment with a novel mechanism of action approved by the FDA in nearly 20 years," FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.

"While there are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs to treat flu, they're not a substitute for yearly vaccination."

An exceptionally harsh US flu season last year [2017-18] resulted in more than 900 000 people getting hospitalized and more than 80 000 deaths, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Xofluza will be marketed outside Japan and Taiwan by Roche, which also makes commonly prescribed flu medication Tamiflu. Shionogi will retain co-promotion rights in the United States.

The drug could help bolster Roche's position in the influenza drug market as it faces competition from generic medicines.

Sales of Roche's Tamiflu tumbled 33 percent to 535 million Swiss francs (USD 537 million) in 2017, as cheaper generics muscled in.

Xofluza was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan for the treatment of influenza strains early this year [2018].

[Baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza) is a medication developed by Shionogi Co, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, and (Swiss multinational) Roche AG for treatment of influenza A and influenza B. The medication is given as a single dose and may reduce the duration of flu symptoms by about a day. It is an influenza therapeutic agent (cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor), characterized by only taking one dose.

Unlike neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) that inhibit the action of neuraminidase, which liberates viruses from the infected cells surface, baloxavir marboxil may prevent replication by inhibiting the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the viral polymerase. It achieves this by inhibiting the process known as cap snatching, which is a mechanism exploited by viruses to hijack the host mRNA transcription system to allow synthesis of viral RNAs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloxavir_marboxil).

Xofluza (pronounced "ZOH-FLU-ZAH") will give doctors a new option for fighting the flu once it is diagnosed in people ages 12 and up. Baloxavir is also associated with fewer side effects. Oseltamivir has been associated with upset stomachs and headaches, and even some psychiatric effects, like delirium and hallucinations. By comparison, baloxavir was shown to only cause mild side effects in clinical trials, such as cold-like symptoms and headaches.

Furthermore, baloxavir has been shown to be effective in non-clinical studies against a wide range of flu viruses, including Tamiflu-resistant and avian strains, such as H7N9 and H5N1 (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/xofluza-questions-flu-drug-answers/story?id=58739987).

However, it is important to emphasize that antiviral therapy is not the 1st option, it is preferable to protect against getting influenza infections through annual vaccination, particularly in individuals at high risk for developing complications. - Mod.UBA]
