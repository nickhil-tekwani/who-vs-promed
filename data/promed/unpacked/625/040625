A 31-year-old policeman in Shizuoka fell unconscious Sunday [6 Sep 1998
after eating a sandwich, in what police suspect is the latest in a rash of
indiscriminate food-tampering cases.
He fell ill shortly after eating a sandwich he had bought the night before.
After being listed in critical condition, he regained consciousness by
evening.
Preliminary analysis of the sandwich did not reveal any evidence of arsenic
or cyanide.
A 30-year-old housewife in Shizuoka received hospital treatment Sunday
morning after she complained she had burned her mouth while drinking
bottled orange juice bought Friday at a supermarket. The bottom of the 1.5
liter bottle had been pierced & resealed. No cyanide was detected in the
drink.
In Otsu, a 19-year-old woman was taken to hospital around 1:30am Sunday
after drinking canned tea she had bought an hour earlier at a convenience
store. She was released after receiving treatment. The bottom of the can
had been pierced and resealed with adhesive. Neither arsenic nor cyanide
was detected in the can's contents, and police believe that the substance
added to the tea was a synthetic detergent.
