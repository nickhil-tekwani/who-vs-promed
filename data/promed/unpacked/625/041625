Japan to cull 80 000 chickens
-----------------------------
Authorities have detected bird flu at a poultry farm in northern Japan but
don't suspect it to be the deadly H5N1 strain that has killed at least 64
people and ravaged poultry stocks in Asia, officials said on Monday.
Officials have extracted and identified an H5 virus in chickens at a
poultry farm in Ibaraki prefecture (state), the prefectural government said
in a statement.
Officials have yet to determine what strain of the H5 family the virus is,
but authorities believe it to be the H5N2 strain, which is less virulent
than the H5N1 variety, according to wildlife official Nobuhito Kuriyama.
About 80 000 birds from one of the 9 poultry houses at the farm will be
culled and the movement of their eggs banned as a precautionary measure,
the prefectural government said. The remainder of the farm's 710 000 birds
will not be culled, it said. Earlier tests in August 2005 showed that
chickens at the farm had antibodies for a virus from the H5 family, meaning
that they were infected in the past but had survived, Kuriyama said.
Authorities have been repeating tests on the birds every 2 weeks, he said.
Ibaraki is about 100 kilometers (64 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
Bird flu hit Japan in 2004 for the first time in decades, with several
outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain. The country confirmed a human case of
bird flu last December but nobody has died. In late October, Japan set up a
task force to plan against a possible outbreak of bird flu among humans,
reports the AP.

[The previous OIE report identified a low-pathogenicity H5N2 virus on more
than 31 farms involving millions of birds. We would expect the same virus
in this case because both involve commercial poultry. In an unrelated
incident, Japanese authorities identified an H4 virus on a duck farm late
in October 2005.
The low-path viruses are difficult economically, and there is always a
danger that if left to circulate, they can evolve into "high path"
varieties. It is unfortunate that after such a large outbreak earlier and a
period of quiet, that a new outbreak is now reported. Let's hope it is an
isolated "mopping up" outbreak at the end of a disease eradication
campaign. - Mod.PC]
