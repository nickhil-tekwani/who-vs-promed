Return of the bird flu threat
-----------------------------------------
Avian flu has re-emerged in Bangladesh after 4 months, with 5
reported new outbreaks in poultry farms across the country since
October [2007]. The contagious viral disease was 1st detected in
Bangladesh in March 2007. Since then there have been 55 outbreaks in
19 of the country's 64 districts.

To halt a further spread of the virus, more than 250 000 chickens
have been culled since the original outbreak.

"But indirect losses to farmers far surpass the direct loss,"
veterinarian Abul Kalam Azad of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) told IRIN in Dhaka, the capital.

Many farms have downsized operations, resulting in significant
layoffs and the suspension of business, while producers of poultry
feed and farm equipment have also been hard hit.

"The whole USD 2 billion industry is in a very nervous state," Azad explained.

A fresh influx of migratory birds is raising further concerns.
Hundreds of thousands of Siberian water fowl arrive in Bangladesh
from mid-November, taking refuge in the country's vast rivers, lakes
and marshlands.

"The winter months are likely to see more outbreaks," ASM Alamgir, a
virologist at the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and
Research, warned.

And though a permanent relationship between migratory birds and bird
flu has yet to be proven beyond a doubt, according to the World
Health Organization (WHO), "scientists are increasingly convinced
that some migratory waterfowl are now carrying the H5N1 virus in its
highly pathogenic form, sometimes over long distances, and
introducing the virus to poultry flocks in areas that lie along their
migratory routes" -- all of which worries health officials in
Bangladesh.

"At 795 persons per square km, Bangladesh has the highest population
density in the world. This close proximity of human beings is a risk
element for transmission of any contagious disease like flu," Nazrul
Haq, a member of the government's technical working group on avian
influenza risk, said, adding that the hot and humid environment helps
pathogens spread quickly.

Further compounding the problem is the prominent role of poultry
farming. Almost all rural households keep chickens as a source of
cheap protein, with about 2.4 million rural women depending on
backyard chicken farming as their only source of livelihood. Even
well-off families in Bangladesh raise a few chickens to supplement
their income.

As a result, communicating appropriate bio-security practices such as
separating domestic flocks from wild ones, hygienic slaughtering and
waste disposal, use of masks while cleaning chicken coops,
disinfection before and after working in poultry farms, as well as
the use of personal protective equipment is already proving difficult.

"Behaviours don't change overnight," Habibur Rahman of the Bangladesh
Agricultural University told IRIN. "Most of these farms do not
maintain necessary sanitary and preventive measures essential for
keeping chicken safe from infection," he added, estimating that there
were well over 100 000 small and medium-sized farms in the country.

In July [2007], the Bangladesh government signed an agreement worth
USD 16 million with the International Development Association, the
World Bank's concessionary arm, to minimise a possible bird flu
threat.

The Avian Influenza Preparedness and Response Project supports the
government's National Avian Influenza and Pandemic Influenza
Preparedness and Response Plan and is designed to control infections
in domestic poultry, while at the same time formulating plans to
control and respond to possible human infections, especially an
influenza epidemic and related emergencies.

Meanwhile, officials in Bangladesh have also taken measures,
including a ban on the import of poultry-related products from
affected countries, monitoring of imported day-old chicks from
non-affected countries, the control of illegal poultry product
trading, an improvement of laboratory facilities, as well as forming
a national task force representing relevant stakeholders -- including
the private sector.

The government has imposed a 1km [0.62-mile] restricted area around
any confirmed infection point and all poultry within the area is
culled, while strict controls are imposed on the movement of poultry
and poultry products within a 10km [6.2-mile] radius.

According to Abdul Motaleb, director of the government's department
of livestock, the proper disposal of dead birds and contaminated
materials such as eggs and faeces is also now ensured, while
surveillance and monitoring have been strengthened.

"We have trained 320 000 community volunteers on bird flu prevention.
They are going from door-to-door in rural Bangladesh to communicate
and train women on safe and sanitary practices that can prevent bird
flu," Motaleb added.

According to WHO, as of 12 Nov 2007, 335 humans have been infected
with the virus globally, of whom 206 died. That means 61 out of every
100 human cases are fatal. Of the 12 countries where bird to human
transmission took place, 9 are in Asia.

There have been no cases of human infection in Bangladesh.

[2] UK - England (Suffolk), turkeys: Defra update

H5N1 Avian influenza update
---------------------------
Defra has today made available general licences to address immediate
issues relating to the movement of bird by-products and mammals in
the zones in place for Avian influenza.

Bird by-products may now be moved freely between zones and to the
unrestricted parts of the country. Mammals may move direct to or from
premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept in the
Protection or Surveillance Zones. Movements of hatching eggs may also
be permitted under specific licence available from Animal Health.

All movements are subject to strict adherence to licence conditions,
including biosecurity measures. The national ban on bird gatherings
and movement restrictions in the zones remain firmly in place. It is
essential that poultry keepers are vigilant in checking their birds
and report signs of notifiable disease immediately.

Also today, the decision has been taken to reclassify the cull at one
of the 4 dangerous contacts premises identified yesterday [14 Nov
2007] to a slaughter on suspicion of Avian Influenza.

During preparation for the cull at this premises, which is in the
existing Protection Zone, avian notifiable disease could not be ruled
out. Samples have been taken for laboratory testing. There is no
timetable for when these results will be received.

The strain of Avian influenza present at the Infected Premises near
Diss is similar to that found in Germany, France and the Czech
Republic during the summer [2007]. A full epidemiological
investigation is underway and all avenues into the origin of this
outbreak are being investigated.

Surveillance of poultry premises in the Protection Zone is underway,
surveillance of wild birds has been increased in Norfolk and Suffolk
and the national targeted wild bird surveillance programme is ongoing.

Turkeys culled in fears that avian flu may have spread to a 2nd farm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Turkeys suspected of being infected with avian flu were being culled
at a 2nd farm in Suffolk yesterday [15 Nov 2007].

Test results today will confirm whether 30 turkeys found dead at
Grove Farm, Botesdale, were infected with the lethal virus. Some 5500
birds were culled there. Grove Farm is within the 3km [1.86-mile]
exclusion zone around Redgrave Park Farm where suspected bird flu was
confirmed as the H5N1 strain on Monday [12 Nov 2007]. Government
veterinary experts are also anxious to learn if ducks and geese at
the organic Redgrave Park Farm were infected as well.

The next day or 2 are critical to find out whether the virus is
spreading to other farms and if it is now circulating in the local
wild bird population.

Fred Landeg, the acting chief veterinary officer, has asked all
poultry keepers and hobby farmers to be vigilant and to keep check on
their birds. All poultry are supposed to be kept indoors while the
threat of the virus remains in East Anglia, one of the biggest
poultry production regions in the country with some 25 million farmed
birds, 5 million of which are sold for the Christmas market.

Veterinary epidemiologists are still uncertain how the virus was
brought to Redgrave Park Farm but the focus is to ensure that it is
not spreading.

Investigations are continuing into whether there is any connection
with outbreaks in southern Germany and the Czech Republic this summer
[2007]. The Suffolk strain of H5N1 is almost identical to that found
on the continent.

As The Times reported yesterday [15 Nov 2007] the investigation is
also focusing on imported one-day-old ducklings from the Netherlands.
Even though these chicks were not reared at Redgrave Park Farm, it is
possible that the virus was transported in the vehicles or crates
transporting the ducks. Animal health officers are meticulously
scouring paperwork to find any possible link to the virus outbreaks
on the continent.

Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative rural affairs spokesman, last night
tabled a series of questions asking the Government to disclose
whether any poultry meat had been imported to the UK from Germany and
the Czech Republic in recent months.

He told The Times: "It looks increasingly doubtful that wild birds
are to blame for this outbreak and we must therefore look at other
options."

The virus can live in faeces that can be transferred by vehicles,
drivers, farm staff, bird crates, packaging, feathers or live birds.
It can travel on footwear and on tyres. The virus in faeces can
survive from a few days to several weeks depending on conditions such
as temperature and humidity.

Meanwhile, ornithological experts remain baffled and are sceptical
whether the disease was brought by wild birds. After the German
outbreak, not a single infected wild bird was found.

Poultry farmers are incensed by what they perceive as lax biosecurity
at the farm which allowed turkeys, geese and ducks to mingle with
wild birds near an ornamental lake. Many are now demanding new rules
for free-range and organic birds and for the Government to regulate
rather than offer guidance about the need to keep outdoor farmed
birds away from places where wild birds congregate.

Heavyweight problem
--------------------
UK sales of poultry are worth BP 3.5 billion [USD 7 167 651 365] at retail

Fresh chicken sales are worth BP 2.1 billion [USD 4 300 590 819]

UK turkey market worth BP 375 million [USD 767 962 646] to BP 400
million [USD 819 160 156]

Fresh turkey sales account for BP 240 million [USD 491 496 093]

There are 860 million chickens a produced a year, giving 1.3 million
tonnes of poultry meat

There are 17 million turkeys reared in Britain producing 185 000 tonnes of meat

There are 19 million ducks reared producing 44 000 tonnes of meat

About 100 000 geese are reared for the Christmas market East Anglia
accounts for a 3rd of the UK poultry production

There are 1200 poultry farmers and 25 million birds of which 5
million are turkeys in the restricted area of Suffolk and parts of
Norfolk

In the 10km [6.2-mile] surveillance zone there are 90 poultry keepers
with 3 million birds

The incubation period for avian flu in turkeys is 3 to 5 days though
it can be 5 to 7 days in other species

The survival rate of the virus in faeces can vary from days to week
depending on temperature and humidity

Up to 27 000 turkeys, 1200 ducks and 500 geese have been culled or
are awaiting slaughter

Possible bird flu outbreak feared
-----------------------------
With the arrival of winter, the Public Health Ministry is worried
about the possible outbreak of bird flu.

Some 800,000 health volunteers spread throughout the country have
been assigned to monitor sick poultry and people.

Permanent Secretary Prat Boonyawongvirot said Saturday he had urged
volunteers to inform health officials immediately if any poultry
perished.

"Then they'll be checked for the virus," he said.

The ministry also stressed that children should stay away from
chickens or birds that fell ill or died under inexplicable
circumstances.

Nakhon Sawan has witnessed suspicious mass deaths of fighting cocks
in Nong-pangpuay village of Kaoliew district. Their symptoms were
similar to bird flu.

Headman Yongyuth Thongchoop said officials are trying to investigate
the cause of the mass deaths of chickens in the area and will destroy
the carcasses.

However, villagers protested against officials who tried to get
samples of dead chickens to test in the lab, because they do not want
their prized possessions to be culled, he said.

Phin Khanjiek, a villager, said he wants authorities to confirm the
virus infection before sacrificing his fighting cock because he had
bought it at a high price.

Dr Thawat Suntrajarn, director-general of the Disease Control
Department, said the Bureau of Epidemiology was monitoring 2,036
patients suffering from general flu and pneumonia admitted to
hospitals across country. As of Thursday, no bird-flu cases have been
reported in those patients.

And the ministry has not received any news of bird-flu infections in
humans for the past 14 months, he said.

According to the latest release from the World Health Organisation,
the bird-flu virus has struck people in seven countries this year -
Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Laos, Nigeria and Vietnam.

WHO reported that 72 patients had come down with bird flu and 48 of
them did not survive.

The highest rate of mortality and morbidity is in Indonesia, where 38
people have caught the virus and 33 have died. Egypt is second with
20 cases, of which five were fatal.

Prat said the ministry had equipped district and provincial hospitals
with sterile rooms to treat bird-flu patients.
