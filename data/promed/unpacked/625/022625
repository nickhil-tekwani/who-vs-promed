A total of 276 people died of dengue fever in the Philippines in the first
nine months of 1998, while the number of dengue cases reached a 10-year
high of more than 15,000 during the period, health authorities said
Wednesday. The Department of Health said that with dengue fever yet to
peak in October, the reported dengue cases nationwide from January to
September totaled 15,650, the 1996 figure was 14,648.
However, the Department declared that the number of dengue hot spot areas
in the country has been reduced to two from a high of 18 early this month.
An area is declared as a "hot spot" when an increasing number of cases is
observed for at least two consecutive weeks. "Dengue cases continue to
rise but they are sporadic," Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez explained.
The health chief said that not all dengue fever cases reported were from
outbreak sites. Dengue outbreaks are still occurring in Dumaguete City in
southern Negros Oriental province and in the towns of San Antonio and Jaen
in central Nueva Ecija province. The Secretary said that dengue control
lies in the hands of the people and stressed that the key to dengue control
is the elimination of mosquito breeding sites.
