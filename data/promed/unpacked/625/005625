Venezuela Confirms Foot-And-Mouth Disease (FMD)
-------------------------------------
CARACAS, Venezuela ­ Wednesday [13 Jun 2001], officials quarantined a ranch
in western Venezuela after confirming 240 head of cattle were infected with
foot-and-mouth disease. Government laboratory tests confirmed the
infections at the 1300-head private ranch in the town of Panamericana in
Tachira state, said Manuel Cipriano of the National Foot-and-Mouth Disease
Eradication Commission.
All animals at the ranch and at neighboring ranches will be vaccinated,
Cipriano said. He also said a small outbreak in the southwestern state of
Apure had been contained. Venezuela has been vaccinating animals nationwide
since outbreaks occurred in Europe and elsewhere in South America.
FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals such as sheep, pigs, and cows. It is
highly contagious and reduces the production of milk and meat, but is not
dangerous to humans. Farmers often slaughter animals to keep the disease
from spreading, but Cipriano said no slaughter was being considered in the
Tachira cases.
Venezuela's cattle industry generates $797 million a year, according to the
National Cattlemen's Association.
