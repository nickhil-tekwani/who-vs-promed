Re: "Downy & powdery mildews, grapevine - France" moderator's comment:
"Both mildews may be present in the affected areas, however, there
may also still be uncertainty about which one is doing the damage.
The source of diagnostic identification of the fungi is not reported
and its level of reliability is unclear."
Downy mildew ("mildiou" in French, pronounced "mildew") is the cause
of the current situation in the Bordeaux area. Powdery mildew
("oidium" in French, and clearly distinguished from downy mildew in
the field) generally prefers conditions drier than those encountered
in our region this year [2007].
