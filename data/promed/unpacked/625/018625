More bird flu cases found in Russia
---------------------------------------
Russian vets have found bird flu in a village in the southern Urals
and suspected an outbreak of the disease in a neighboring region, the
emergency ministry said on Saturday [22 Oct 2005].
In the village of Sunaly in the Chelyabinsk region in the southern
Urals, 31 chickens died, and local authorities found bird flu in 6
samples out of 12, an emergency ministry official in Moscow told
Reuters. [See map
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/13/Sunaly.html>].
A Chelyabinsk emergency ministry official said vets had found the
H5N1 strain and suspected that the infection came with migrating birds.
"There are 1060 birds in the village," the official said. "They will
all be killed. A quarantine was imposed from today. Vaccination of
all 89 people in the village will start on Monday [24 Oct 2005]."
Authorities are also investigating another suspected outbreak in
Russia's Altai region.
The Moscow emergency ministry official said bird flu was suspected in
a village in the Altai region, close to the Kazakh border, where 59
birds died in the village of Pokrovka on Friday [21 Oct 2005]. [See map
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/4/Pokrovka8.html>].
"A quarantine zone has been imposed, although we have only found
antibodies for bird flu in the preliminary tests. The final decision
on whether it is bird flu and what will be done will only be taken on
Monday [24 Oct 2005]," the official said.
Moscow confirmed on Wednesday [19 Oct 2005] an outbreak of H5N1 in
the Tula region, some 200 km (125 miles) south of the Russian capital.
Russia has been fighting bird flu since mid-July 2005 and has killed
more than 600 000 domestic fowl.

[Another newswire on the same date by Interfax included additional
details on the outbreak in Sunaly: "33 birds, among them turkeys,
ducks, and chickens, have died at 2 individual farms in the village
of Sunaly. There are a total of 26 individual farms in the village." - Mod.AS]

[2] Cross reactive immunity
Date: Sun 23 Oct 2005

Re: Archive Number 20051016.3018
-----------------------------------------
ProMED-mail posting 20051016.3018, Avian influenza - Eurasia (13):
H5N1, item [2] "Agriculture ministry buys 8 million doses of avian
flu vaccine," included the following statement from Israel:
"Officials believe that a dose of the regular seasonal flu vaccine
may reduce the incidence of sickness in case of an avian flu epidemic."
Given all the studies done about cross-reactive immunity, the
question needs to be answered whether a regular flu vaccination might
provide some small degree of protection.

[We guess the citing might reflect a misunderstanding between
officials and the press. No cross protection against H5N1 is known to
be conferred by vaccination with the regular human vaccine. For the
composition of the trivalent vaccine recommended for use during the
2005-2006 influenza season (northern hemisphere winter), see 20050915.2726.
Additional or different views are welcome.
Propagating human vaccination with the regular influenza vaccine in
areas affected by avian influenza is based upon the Dutch experience
during the H7N7 outbreak of 2003. They vaccinated with the regular
influenza vaccine persons exposed to infected poultry. Their
reasoning was the wish to prevent mixed, simultaneous infections of
humans by both human and avian influenza viruses, a constellation
which might lead to virus reassortment; see 20030501.1092. - Mod.AS]

Scientists were conducting tests yesterday [22 Oct 2005] to determine
whether bird flu cases discovered in Britain, Sweden and Croatia are
the lethal strain that has killed more than 60 people, as countries
around the world scrambled to halt the spread of the virus.
Congo joined a growing list of African countries to ban imports of
livestock and poultry from countries affected by bird flu, and Russia
recorded a new outbreak of the disease in a region of the Ural mountains.
In Croatia, the Agriculture Ministry said the country's 1st cases of
avian flu were confirmed Friday [21 Oct 2005] in 6 swans found dead
in a national park in the east of the country. British officials said
a parrot from the South American country Suriname died of the disease
while in quarantine. It was Britain's 1st confirmed case of bird flu
since 1992.
In both cases, tests were underway at a British lab to determine
whether the birds had the deadly H5N1 strain, which has devastated
poultry stocks across Asia and killed 61 people in 2 years. The
strain was recently found in birds in Russia, Turkey and Romania.
Sweden's National Veterinary Institute said yesterday [22 Oct 2005] a
case of bird flu had been confirmed in one of 4 ducks found dead
Friday [21 Oct 2005] in Eskilstuna, about 100 km west of the capital,
Stockholm. Officials said it would take days to determine whether it
was the H5N1 strain.
The European Union, which has ordered restrictions on bird markets
and urged countries to present a program of vaccination for zoo
birds, said Friday [21 Oct 2005] it was preparing to ban poultry
imports from Croatia.
In Britain, chief veterinarian Debby Reynolds said the country's
disease-free status was not affected by the case of bird flu, because
the parrot died while in quarantine. She said the incident
demonstrated the importance of Britain's tough quarantine system.
Reynolds said the parrot, which died last week [3rd week October
2005], arrived in Britain in September 2005 and was being held in a
biosecure quarantine unit along with a consignment of birds from Taiwan.
Britain said it was in contact with officials in Suriname and Taiwan
as it sought to determine where the bird contacted the virus. If the
parrot was infected in Suriname, it would be the 1st confirmed case
of serious bird flu in the Western Hemisphere. Mild forms that do not
threaten people have been found in Colombia and Brazil.
Congo's Health Minister, Emil Bongeli, said Friday [21 Oct 2005] his
government had banned the import of live birds, pigs and livestock
from countries affected by H5N1. Other African countries have also
banned poultry imports, including Senegal, Uganda and neighboring
Congo-Brazzaville.

Duck in Sweden had bird flu
----------------------------
Sweden's National Veterinary Institute confirmed that a wild duck
which had been found dead in the Swedish countryside (Eskilstuna) had
bird flu (avian influenza). 7 dead ducks were found, 4 were tested
and one came up positive for bird flu. It will be a few days before
we know whether the duck died from the more virulent bird flu strain
H5N1. [See map <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/18/Eskilstuna.html>].
Several European countries have now reported cases of bird flu: The
United Kingdom (a quarantined parrot from Suriname; see commentary),
Romania, Greece, Croatia (6 swans), Russia and Turkey.
The infected birds in Russia, Turkey, Greece and Romania were
carrying the H5N1 strain. Lab tests have not been completed on the
other countries to see whether their birds had the lethal strain.
The United Kingdom government is calling for a ban on all wild bird
imports into the EU. The EU only bans the imports of live birds from
countries that have had cases of bird flu.
Many countries around the world are banning the imports of live birds
from infected countries

H5N1 AVIAN INFLUENZA CONFIRMED IN QUARANTINE IN THE UK
------------------
The highly pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza virus found in a parrot from
a quarantine facility in Essex has now been confirmed as H5N1, Defra
announced today.
The closest match is a strain identified in ducks in China earlier
this year. It is not so similar to the strains from Romania and
Turkey.. It is not a strain that the Veterinary Laboratory Agency has
seen before.
Further investigations have now established that the tissues from 2
bird samples were pooled in a single sample. It is not possible to
say whether both or only one of the birds was infected with the virus
at this stage.
Instructions to the State Veterinary Service issued by Defra today
say that for the time being no birds currently held in quarantine
will be released until a case by case risk assessment is carried out.
Release of birds following assessment will depend upon a further
review of laboratory results and checks on import documentation.
Defra has reviewed its overall risk assessment of the threat posed by
highly pathogenic Avian Influenza. In light of the recent cases in
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Turkey, and Romania it concludes
that there is a high risk of further global dispersion. The UK, like
other countries, need to increase its vigilance to mach this
increased global risk. Ministers have also pressed the European
Commission for a EU-wide ban on the importation of wild birds.
Chief Vet Debby Reynolds said:
"We are now closer to reaching a conclusion on this investigation. We
have established that the strain of the virus is H5N1. This does not
affect the UK's official Avian Influenza disease-free status.
"Our working hypothesis is that any infection in the birds from
Surinam is likely to have arisen in the quarantine system, most
likely in the facility in Essex where the Surinam birds shared
airspace with the birds from Taiwan. There are more tests underway on
the birds from Taiwan because we have established that some of them
died before 16 Oct [2005].
"Defra has issued instructions to the State Veterinary Service to
ensure that a case by case risk assessment is carried out on all
birds currently being held in quarantine. We will also be talking
urgently to stakeholders about restricting bird markets, fairs and shows."

Notes for editors
1. Avian Flu is a highly infectious viral disease which affects
poultry, pigeons and other birds. It is a notifiable disease, which
was last confirmed in Great Britain in 1992.
2. Avian Flu viruses can vary according to their ability to cause
severe disease. Highly pathogenic avian influenza can cause severe
disease in susceptible birds and low pathogenic avian influenza can
cause mild disease or no disease at all.
3. Infected birds with high path avian influenza may die suddenly or
show a range of clinical signs including respiratory signs, swollen
heads, dullness, drop in egg production, loss of appetite. Some birds
infected with low path avian influenza do not show any signs of the disease.
4. Avian influenza is spread by movement of infected birds or contact
with their secretions, particularly faeces, either directly or
through contaminated objects.
5. The confirmed case does not affect the UK's official disease free
status because the disease has only been identified in imported birds
during quarantine. The birds were in approved quarantine premises and
were not in general circulation. All the birds in the consignment
have been killed at the quarantine centre. Under EU rules this must
be at the expense of the importer.
6. EU legislation requires that birds imported into member states
from outside the European Union must remain in quarantine for at
least 30 days post-import.
7. In the past Newcastle Disease has been found in imported bird
consignments in quarantine on five occasions.
8. A Question and Answer brief on Avian Flu is available and can be
found on the Defra web -
www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/
9. Members of the public should not handle dead birds. If multiple
bird deaths are found the public should report this to the Defra
helpline 08459 335577.

[Interestingly, H5N1 was detected last week in pet birds smuggled
from China to Taiwan. This has happened before as well, and is a
clear indication of significant disease risk related to contacts with
pet-birds originating or passing through that part of the world. In
this context, the current call of the UK government for a ban on all
wild bird imports into the EU, echoed in European press, makes sense.
If such policy is applied, it must go hand-in-hand with severe
measures to prevent smuggling which is expected to increase.
International trade in pet-birds is a multi-billion global industry;
veterinary inspection upon this trade is a complex, laborious and
expensive task. Consignments, sometimes, pass through intermediate
stations where contacts with other consignments might occur.
The parrot died more than 30 days after arrival; the incubation of
avian influenza is considered to be not longer than 7 days. It is
thus unlikely that it came to the UK infected. We are looking forward
to the outcome of the UK investigation into the origin of infection
in this case.
Besides the legal trade in wild animals, there is a huge illegal
trade. National inspection authorities are obliged to deal with
smuggling attempts, from single travelers hiding one or several pets
in their personal luggage up to organized crime dealing with
large-scale smuggled consignments applying sophisticated methods.
There are daily confiscations everywhere, but -- unfortunately --
most illegal consignments are considered to reach their destinations
undetected. The black market in illegal animal products, estimated by
Interpol to be worth USD 6 to 10 billion annually (2nd only to the
illegal drug trade), threatens the health of humans and may lead to
the extinction of many species of animals. - Mod.AS]
