More British Troops Struck By Illness
-------------------------------------
Twenty more British troops have contracted a mystery illness in
Afghanistan, bringing the total number struck down to 38. One of the new
sufferers is believed to be a Royal Marine of 45 Commando, the first case
of the unidentified fever in the fighting force. He is seriously ill and
was being flown back to the UK on Fri 17 May 2002. The marines are
currently taking part in their first combat of the war in Afghanistan,
joining US and Australian troops battling al-Qaeda fighters in the eastern
mountains.
Two of the other new cases, all medical personnel, were said to have
stabilized after responding to treatment for the stomach illness at their
base. The remainder have shown symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea but were
said to be less seriously ill. The marine is thought to be the first case
from outside the 34 Field Hospital at Bagram Airbase, where the outbreak
started. That has raised concerns that the disease could spread through the
rest of the camp.
Tests are under way to try to discover the nature of the illness affecting
the troops. It was first reported on Mon 13 May 2002, and 18 medical
personnel at the hospital had been stuck drown by Wed 15 May 2002. Eight
were so ill they were evacuated to Europe and the UK. The remainder were
treated at the hospital, which was closed as a precautionary measure except
to further suspected cases of the illness. The 60 or so staff based there
were quarantined, while almost 300 other troops were confined to their
quarters for fear of spreading the fever. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) was
on Thu 16 May 2002 working on the theory that contaminated food was to
blame for the outbreak. All troops have been put on sterilised food rations
and bottled water.
Defence minister Dr Lewis Moonie said that it was "most unlikely" that the
illness was the result of a biological attack. Microbiologist Dr Mahmoud
Halablab, of King's College, London, said gastroenteritis seemed the most
likely cause.

Local may have been carrier at Bagram
------------------------------------
AN act of military charity two weeks ago may have triggered the outbreak of
suspected enteric fever which has struck down 18 medical personnel and
closed the UK's only field hospital in Afghanistan. Medics at the
quarantined 34 Field Hospital at Bagram airbase were concentrating on the
possibility that an Afghan civilian male admitted briefly for treatment may
have been the carrier.
Enteric fever is a form of paratyphoid rife in the region. Caused by poor
hygiene, it is spread by droplet infection from coughing, sneezing or
spitting, or by contamination from faeces [Paratyphoid fever is primarily
transmitted by the fecal-oral route most commonly in contaminated food or
water. Transmission by droplet infection is not the usual route.
Mod.MPP] Incubation time is between 10 and 14 days and matches the gap
between the admission of the civilian and the outbreak.
Eight of the soldiers have been flown out of the country, seven back to the
UK and one to a US army hospital in Germany for emergency treatment. Two
were described yesterday as "serious but stable".
The victims reported symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever four
days ago in what was feared to be meningitis. The hospital was immediately
placed under armed guard and the 333 staff, patients, and support units on
site isolated. The remaining victims at the base are receiving nursing
from staff wearing masks, gloves and disposable gowns.
Colonel Ben Curry, Royal Marine spokesman at the base, said "the symptoms
are congruent with enteric febrile illness".

[Many thanks to all of our readers who have submitted newswire reports on
this ongoing outbreak of an unexplained illness among British troops in
Afghanistan. We have been awaiting further information that might shed
light on the etiology of the current outbreak but at present we have
nothing further than what is contained in newswire reports. We have
selected 2 reports for this posting, updating on the increase in cases,
with 20 additional cases being reported. It is unclear how many of the
additional 20 cases reported have had onset in the preceding 24 hours as
the reports mention that these additional cases were identified after
conducting active surveillance (personnel who had not presented for medical
care were questioned if they currently had or previously had symptoms
compatible with the clinical picture seen in this outbreak).
The second article is shown to present some of the theories currently
abounding as to the etiology of this outbreak. The presence of a patient
with similar symptoms in the hospital 10-14 days prior to this outbreak
suggests that whatever the etiologic agent is, it was present in the area
prior to the outbreak. If this outbreak is shown to be a food-borne
outbreak, it is possible that a food handler was ill with the causative
organism (either bacterial or viral) and thereby contaminated the food
served to the affected individuals.
It is noteworthy that we are now 48 hours into the identification of this
outbreak and the etiologic agent has not been identified as yet. Or better
stated, the media have not been privy to information on the etiologic
agent. If there are any informed readers out there with official
information, we would gratefully appreciate receiving it so that we could
stop speculating and assist in the dissemination of accurate information. -
