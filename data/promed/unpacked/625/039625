Epidemiology

Epidemiological comments: Before this event the disease was detected in Israel, only in the south of the country in 1989, 2006 and 2007. The herds are located in the north of the country, near the Syrian and Lebanese borders. One [herd] is located in the Golan Heights, and the second in the upper Galilee. The 2 herds are less than 10 km far one of each other. Stomoxys flies have been seen in the area.

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Control Measures

Applied: Quarantine, Movement control inside the country, Modified stamping out.

To be applied: Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)

Country or zone: the whole country

[From the description of the lesions in both foci, and taking into consideration an incubation period (in the field) of 2 - 5 weeks, it may be assumed that the LSD virus (LSDV) may have penetrated the Mas'ade herd earlier, and had been circulating in the region for at least 2 months. Tracing back possible contacts, during recent months, between the 2 herds and other cattle holdings in Israel is of utmost importance, combined with regional surveillance activities. This, both for search of the source of infection and particularly for the prevention of further spread, countrywide. A map showing the 2 reported outbreaks is included in the above report at the source URL.

By "modified stamping out" the report refers to the exclusive destruction of animals with clinical disease signs. The vital collaboration of animal owners will depend upon immediate and realistic compensations for the culled animals.

Appearance of new cases in the remaining animals in the affected herds increases the risk of virus spread, which may cause serious losses especially if dairy cattle is affected. LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be transmitted primarily by biting insects. It has been found in mosquitoes in the genera Aedes and Culex during some outbreaks. Flies (e.g. _Stomoxys calcitrans_) and other insects might also be involved in transmission, but this remains unproven. Arthropod control definitely deserves to be included among the applied measures. Direct contact, though a minor source of infection, is not excluded; iatrogenic transmission is also to be considered.

LSDV virus is very resistant to inactivation, surviving in desiccated crusts for up to 35 days, and can remain viable for long periods in the environment.
