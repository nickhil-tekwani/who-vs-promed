Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) origin and animal reservoir
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Abstract
-----------
Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus discovered in 2012 and is responsible for acute respiratory syndrome in humans. Though not confirmed yet, multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. The disease is heavily endemic in dromedary camel populations of East Africa and the Middle East. It is unclear as to when the virus was introduced to dromedary camels, but data from studies that investigated stored dromedary camel sera and geographical distribution of involved dromedary camel populations suggested that the virus was present in dromedary camels several decades ago. Though bats and alpacas can serve as potential reservoirs for MERS-CoV, dromedary camels seem to be the only animal host responsible for the spill over human infections.

2. Are there other domestic animal reservoirs for MERS-CoV?
-----------------------------------------------------------
In an attempt to investigate the possibility of other reservoirs, multiple domestic animal populations were screened. In a serological study, conducted in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2013, sera from 100 sheep, 45 goats, 50 cattle and 240 chickens representing different geographical areas within the country were collected. All samples tested negative for MERS-CoV. In another study, serum samples from 36 goats and 102 sheep from central Saudi Arabia tested negative for MERS-CoV antibodies as well. In 2013 a similar study was conducted in Jordan. None of the 150 goats, 126 sheep and 91 cows tested was found positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. Sera from European sheep, goats, and cattle had no evidence of MERS-CoV antibodies as well. Equids were also screened for MERS-CoV antibodies: 192 adult horse samples from UAE and 861 samples from Spain (697 horses, 82 donkeys, and 82 mules) were screened. All were seronegative for MERS-CoV.

Dromedary camels seemed to be the only domestic animal reservoir for MERS-CoV up until a recent study conducted in Qatar in April 2015 investigated the MERS-CoV infection status of 15 healthy alpacas (_Vicugna pacos_) in a herd of 20 that shared a barn complex with dromedaries. All tested alpacas were seropositive to MERS-CoV (100 per cent). Of note, MERS-CoV is endemic in Qatar's dromedaries, and 9 out of 10 dromedary camels that shared the same barn complex were seropositive for MERS-CoV. This indicates the susceptibility of alpacas for natural MERS-CoV infection and the potential for a new MERS-CoV animal reservoir.

Of note, a previous study found no evidence for MERS-CoV infection in alpacas from regions where MERS-CoV is not endemic. In another study 3 alpacas were experimentally infected through intranasal insulation of MERS-CoV viruses. All got infected and shed the virus; they also transmitted the infection to 2 out of 3 other alpacas that shared the same room. Similar to dromedary camels, infected alpacas didn't develop fever, but unlike dromedary camels, none of the alpacas had any observable nasal discharge over the course of infection. All infected animals were able to mount neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. Those studies indicate that alpacas, similar to dromedary camels, can be infected and potentially serve as a reservoir.

3. Conclusion
-------------
Our experience with MERS-CoV is of zoonotic nature, transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. The origin of MERS-CoV viral infection is not very well understood. It could have originated in bats and transmitted to dromedary camels at some unknown time in the past. The virus seems to be well maintained in dromedaries, which serve as a reservoir with spill over human infections. Sporadic human cases in areas where MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary camels are likely to continue to happen.

The awareness of the disease and the easy access to a more developed health care system could explain the higher incidence of MERS-CoV diagnosis in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries in Africa where the disease is likely to be overlooked.

Larger scale serological screening of human populations in areas where MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary camels should be considered. More extensive screening of bats in Saudi Arabia and East Africa, especially the Egyptian tomb bat, needs to be considered. Screening dromedary camel populations in Africa (Sahara desert and surrounding areas), and East Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran) will help better delineate the geographical distribution of dromedaries' involvement.

Experimental MERS-CoV inoculation of other domestic animals will help define predisposed groups and should be considered so as to guide screening efforts for other potential reservoirs.

[The review includes 40 references. Table 1 includes a summary of important studies that screened bats for beta-coronaviruses and MERS-CoV.

Subscribers are reminded that according to official sources, between October 2013 and March 2016, MERS-CoV was detected in camels in Kuwait (5), Qatar (3), Iran (3), Oman (1), Saudi Arabia (1) and UAE (1) and in October 2012 in a bat in Saudi Arabia. It was detected also in milk samples in Qatar.

In regard to human health, from September 2012 to 24 May 2016, there have been 1738 reported cases of MERS, including 674 deaths.

ProMED-mail's previous posting on MERS-CoV in animals (20160316.4097730) included a media report derived from Egyptian press, describing the veterinary investigations conducted on a camel consignment coming from Sudan, which included 12 camels "found positive" for MERS-CoV; the consignment was, reportedly, placed in a quarantine station. According to the report, the Egyptian authorities announced the need "to preserve the health and safety of people from any infectious or contagious diseases" and "the need to raise the degree of readiness at all land and river ports and take all necessary precautions with positive cases".

In response, the following response (edited) was received from Professor U Wernery, scientific director of the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai (United Arab Emirates), an international authority on camel diseases:

"There are thousands, may be 100 000s of MERS-CoV-positive dromedaries in Africa and the Middle East. They have antibodies! It should be explained if these camels are virus shedders or not." We are grateful for the said comment, reminding subscribers that the presence of antibodies against MERS-CoV does not mean that the positive animal is necessarily infective. In this context, subscribers are encouraged to refer to the following (ahead of print) scientific dispatch:
