Even as the country celebrated a startling fall in wild polio cases
in 2010 on [24 Oct 2010] -- polio eradication day -- a new, rare
strain of the virus, one of the 3 cases of which was reported in
Tamil Nadu this year [2010], has the medical community worried.

A 9-year-old girl from Tirupattur, in Vellore district, who had taken
the oral polio vaccine (OPV) as an infant, developed paralysis.
Doctors diagnosed her with vaccine-derived polio virus (VDPV),
type-2, which mutates from the weakened live virus found in the OPV.
As many as 21 cases of VDPV were detected last year [2009].

"This child from Tamil Nadu had a weak immune system, and hence
developed VDPV. If OPV is given to a child who is immunodeficient,
the body will not be able to clear the virus for months, and even
years," says Dr Vipin Vashishtha, convener, polio eradication
committee of the Indian Academy of Paediatricians.

The only way to prevent VDPV is to replace the oral polio vaccination
with the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) that comprises dead viruses.
"Several developed countries in the world have shifted to IPV," he says.

However, there is no reason to press the panic button in Tamil Nadu,
which has a track record for being polio-free since 2005. "Both
children and adults in the girl's village were tested for the
contagion and found to be negative. We followed the case for 3 months
and found no cause for alarm," said an official associated with the
national polio surveillance project.

There is also no rationale to shift to IPV at present, when the
country is yet to eradicate type-1 and type-3 of the wild polio
virus, says Dr P. Ramachandran, director of the institute for child
health in Egmore. The need of the hour was to monitor the stray cases
of VDPV closely, he says.

[The above newswire serves as a reminder of the challenges associated
with the use of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in areas where there has
been interruption of WPV transmission. If the newswire is providing
adequate, correct information, the involved case is an immune
deficient child who has had a known chronic infection with the
vaccine virus following receipt of the OPV in early childhood. If
this is the case, at the time of infection, this child was living in
an area with WPV circulation and the child's risk of infection with a
WPV far outweighed the child's risk from the OPV. During the
following 8-9 years, this situation has changed, and Tamil Nadu has
been polio free. Historically, there have been concerns about these
chronically infected individuals serving as sources for cVDPV in
areas where vaccination coverages are suboptimal. It awaits to be
seen whether there will be more cases associated with this particular
virus or whether it will remain an isolated case in an !
immunodeficient individual.

Unfortunately, cVDPVs have been associated with outbreaks of
paralytic disease in Egypt, Niger, DR Congo, Nigeria, Hispanola, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Romania, China, Jamaica and Madagascar (see
references below and the table presented in [2] above). Note that in
the situation where disease eradication is the target, the definition
of an outbreak is a single case. With respect to polio, we know that
for each paralytic case, there are between 50 and 1000 others who are
infected but do not have paralytic disease. This figure is the figure
cited routinely for WPV, but we do not have an estimate of the ration
of paralytic to non-paralytic infections with respect to cVDPV. In a
recent article in NEJM, Jenkins et al (see ref. 13 below) concluded
that "the attack rate and severity of disease associated with the
recent cVDPV identified in Nigeria are similar to those associated
with WPV." (The authors estimated average annual clinical attack
rates associated with infections with WP!
V-1 (6.8 with 95 percent [confidence intervals] CI 5.9 to 7.7), cVDPV
2 (2.7 with 95 percent CI 1.9 to 3.6), WPV 3 ( 4.0 with 95 percent CI
3.4 to 4.7).

As the end game of polio eradication draws near and there are fewer
cases of polio caused by wild poliovirus (WPV), there is a shift in
the proportion of paralytic cases identified that are associated with
vaccine derived polioviruses (VDPVs), and more countries have been
identifying outbreaks associated with the circulation of these VDPVs.
In the 2005 WHO document giving a framework for national policy
makers in OPV-using countries for cessation of OPV use after polio
eradication is declared, there is a quote from the Geneva 21-22 Sep
2004 meeting of the Advisory Committee on Poliomyelitis Eradication
(ACPE) that is relevant here: "After eradication of wild poliovirus,
continued use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) would compromise the goal
of a polio-free world." See
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/publications/OPVCessationFrameworkEnglish.pdf>.

Unfortunately, many countries have seen decreases in their polio
vaccination coverages as they get further and further away from
having identified circulating WPV in their country, and the National
Immunization Days (NIDs), where extensive social mobilization efforts
were conducted leading to high vaccination coverages at the time,
become events of historical significance. This seems to be the
fertile background for the occurrence of outbreaks of paralytic polio
associated with cVDPV's, where there are significant pockets of
inadequately immunized individuals into which these reverted viruses
find environments for significant transmission (see refs 3, 8,10, 11).

To further complicate the situation, we have arrived at a time where
we truly live in a global village, and microbial organisms can (and
do) travel from one part of the world, where there may be high
vaccination coverages, to another part of the world, where there are
significant pockets of inadequately immunized individuals, in hours
rather than weeks as in the past (See ref. 2 - the VDPV involved in
this community was found to be older than the infected infant,
suggesting it had come from another country. MMWR Dispatch.
Poliovirus Infections in Four Unvaccinated Children -- Minnesota,
August-October 2005. 14 Oct 2005; 54
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm54d1014.pdf>.). So, while these
immune compromised hosts who are chronic shedders of VDPVs may live
for many years, the viruses they are shedding may enter healthy hosts
who are en route back to areas where vaccination coverages are suboptimal.
