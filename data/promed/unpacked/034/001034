Re: "MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (58): Saudi Arabia, new cases and deaths, global 20130822.1895978," in part [1], the following statement appears: "The MOH is also announcing the death of a previously reported case, a 51-year-old Saudi male in Riyadh who was also suffering from cancer and other chronic illnesses."

The MOH.sa website did not mention this case, as the case was previously reported.

[3] Global case count - CIDRAP report
Date: 23 Aug 2013

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/08/global-mers-count-tops-100-latest-saudi-arabia


In a brief statement, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported 3 more cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), apparently pushing the global case count over 100.

The agency said 2 of the cases involve a 31-year-old male citizen who has several chronic diseases and is in stable condition in intensive care and a 55-year-old male citizen who has no symptoms. The older man had contact with a confirmed case-patient. Both cases are in the Asir province in the country's southwest.

In addition, the ministry said a 51-year-old man in Riyadh who had chronic illnesses has died of a coronavirus infection, but it didn't specify whether or not his case was reported previously. The statement apparently was issued late yesterday [22 Aug 2013].

The MOH's English-language media page for MERS-CoV today [23 Aug 2013] listed a total of 82 cases with 41 deaths in the country. That amounts to 3 more cases and one more death than the page showed yesterday [22 Aug 2013], suggesting that all 3 cases are new.

Meanwhile, the MOH still has not issued an English-language statement about 2 new cases and the death of a previously announced case-patient that were described in an MOH Arabic statement yesterday [22 Aug 2013]. A machine-translated version of the statement was posted yesterday by FluTrackers, an online infectious-disease message board.

Yesterday's [22 Aug 2013] new cases involved a 50-year-old and a 70-year-old in Riyadh region, and the person who died was a 54-year-old in the same area, the translated statement said.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [23 Aug 2013] updated its MERS-CoV page to reflect the new Saudi cases. It lists a global total of 103 cases and 49 deaths, including the 82 cases and 41 deaths in Saudi Arabia. The 103 cases are 4 more than the CDC listed yesterday; it wasn't immediately clear where the extra case came from.

The World Health Organization has not yet issued statements noting any of the Saudi Arabian cases announced in the past week.

[This moderator and ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Shaikh Saif Uddin for pointing out errors in the previous post. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by these errors in reporting.

As the CIDRAP article in [3] points out, it has become very challenging to figure out what the actual case counts are. The multiple sources of information include the Ministry of Health (MOH) website of Saudi Arabia English page, the MOH website of Saudi Arabia Arabic page (which tends to report new cases 24-48 hours before they appear on the English website), and WHO updates (the most recent being 13 Aug 2013) http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/archive_updates/en/index.html. Additional websites that aggregate and maintain case counts include the CDC website http://www.cdc.gov/features/novelcoronavirus/ and the FluTrackers blog site (http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=205075). - Mod.MPP]

The Supreme Council of Health (SCH) has announced that a new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was reported in Qatar.

The patient is a 59-year-old Qatari citizen who felt the symptoms while abroad, and upon his arrival he was checked up and diagnosed with the disease in the National Influenza Laboratory, said the SCH in a press release issued here on Tuesday [20 Aug 2013].

The SCH stressed that the patient is receiving the appropriate medical treatment, and he is now in a stable condition.

The SCH emphasized that surveillance and monitoring procedures are always being tightened up, and infection control for all cases of acute respiratory infections, especially for those traveling, are also being tightened up, said the press release. It pointed out that all the samples are being examined at the National Influenza Laboratory in coordination with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC).

The Supreme Council is keen to inform citizens and residents alike about the new information on health and epidemiology of infectious diseases and provide them with the latest related developments and appropriate support when needed through the hotline for coronavirus, or on any other contagious disease, 24/7 on the number (66 740 948).
