[1] Challenges of false negative PCR testing results

As communities across the US have struggled to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have focused on the lack of widespread testing as a major barrier to safely reopening the country. As progress has been made on this front, concern has shifted to testing accuracy, predominantly with antibody tests, which are designed to identify prior infection.

But according to a new Dartmouth-led paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine, more emphasis should be placed on addressing the inaccuracy of diagnostic tests, which play a key role in containing the pandemic.

"Diagnostic tests, typically involving a nasopharyngeal swab, can be inaccurate in 2 ways," explains lead author Steven Woloshin, MD, MS, a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine, and of The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. "A false-positive result mistakenly labels a person infected, with consequences including unnecessary quarantine and contact tracing. False-negative results are far more consequential because infected persons who might be asymptomatic may not be isolated and can infect others."

In their paper, Woloshin and his colleagues discuss factors contributing to the current limitations of diagnostic tests -- including variability in test sensitivity and the lack of a standard process for validating test accuracy -- and also cite several large studies whose frequent false-negative results are cause for concern.

The researchers draw several conclusions from their work. "Diagnostic testing will help to safely open the country, but only if the tests are highly sensitive and validated against a clinically meaningful reference standard -- otherwise we cannot confidently declare people uninfected," says Woloshin.

The FDA should also ensure that test manufacturers provide details of their tests' clinical sensitivity and specificity at the time of market authorization. Tests without such information will have less relevance to patient care.

"Measuring the sensitivity of tests in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority," says Woloshin. "A negative result on even a highly sensitive test cannot rule out infection if the pretest probability -- an estimate before testing of a person's chance of being infected -- is high, so clinicians shouldn't trust unexpected negative results."

This estimate might depend on how common COVID-19 is where a person lives, their exposure history, and symptoms, he says.

Woloshin S, Patel N, Kesselheim AS. False negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection - challenges and implications [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jun 5]. N Engl J Med. 2020; 10.1056/NEJMp2015897. doi:10.1056/NEJMp2015897; https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMp2015897 and is definitely worth reading in its entirety.

The authors review several pre-print articles with data showing unacceptably high false negatives in clinically proven cases of COVID-19 and the serious concerns of false negatives in asymptomatic infections where individuals who are infectious can be out and about and transmitting the virus having been given an "all clear" from a negative PCR test. Putting aside the point of care issues for the PCR testing such as adequate specimen collection, there are intrinsic issues with the current tests available that the authors address in their paper.

The authors conclude: 1st, diagnostic testing will help in safely opening the country, but only if the tests are highly sensitive and validated under realistic conditions against a clinically meaningful reference standard.

'2nd, the FDA should ensure that manufacturers provide details of tests' clinical sensitivity and specificity at the time of market authorization; tests without such information will have less relevance to patient care.

"3rd, measuring test sensitivity in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority. It will also be important to develop methods (such as prediction rules) for estimating the pretest probability of infection (for asymptomatic and symptomatic people) to allow calculation of post-test probabilities after positive or negative results.

"4th, negative results even on a highly sensitive test cannot rule out infection if the pretest probability is high, so clinicians should not trust unexpected negative results (that is, assume a negative result is a "false negative" in a person with typical symptoms and known exposure). It's possible that performing several simultaneous or repeated tests could overcome an individual test's limited sensitivity; however, such strategies need validation.

"Finally, thresholds for ruling out infection need to be developed for a variety of clinical situations. Since defining these thresholds is a value judgement, public input will be crucial."

The FDA granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to commercial test manufacturers and issued guidance on test validation. We are now into the 6th month of experience with testing and perhaps the time has come to review the EUA criteria and call for more accurate testing criteria. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 7 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- A joint task force has been established by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the Central European Initiative to strengthen regional coordination for the COVID-19 response and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The task force will serve as a strategic platform for updating member states, exchanging information, and sharing experiences, best practices and training.

- This year on World Food Safety Day on [7 Jun 2020], the WHO Regional Office for Europe has reminded everyone of the Five Keys to Safer Food, which are basic principles that each individual should know to prevent foodborne diseases, some of which (such as handwashing) also offer protection from COVID-19. The WHO Regional Office for the Americas stated that traditional markets, particularly those which sell live animals, may represent a risk of transmission of diseases between animals and humans (zoonotic diseases), and that appropriate regulations and inspections for the production and sale of live animals are needed to prevent the spread of emerging diseases.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 58.3% of the global newly reported cases and 70.4% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 38.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA 36.4%, Chile 6.6%, Mexico 5.5%, and Peru 5.3%.

The European region reported 13.4% of the global newly reported cases and 13.2% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 49.1% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 8.5%, Sweden 5.2%, Turkey 4.8%, and Armenia 4.6%. (Belarus did not report any new cases -- weekend reporting artifact?)

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13.7% of the global newly reported cases and 6.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 12.2%, Saudi Arabia 16.7%, Qatar 9.1%, Egypt 8.0%, and Iraq 6.7%.

The African region reported 3.5% of the global newly reported cases and 1.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 53.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 8.2%, Ghana 6.2%, Cameroon at 4.3%, and Ethiopia at 2.7%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.88% of the global newly reported cases and 0.24% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 59.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 28.5%, South Korea 4.7%, Japan 3.2%, and Malaysia 3.1%.

The South East Asia region reported 10.2 % of the global newly reported cases and 7.8% of global fatalities. India reported 71.4% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 18.9%, Indonesia 7.1%, and Nepal 2.3%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 7 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, who are both approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region greatly outnumbers all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]
