First cholera case in 2003 reported in HK
-----------------------------------------
The Department of Health of Hong Kong on Sat, 21 Jun 2003 urged the public
to be on guard against foodborne infections following the confirmation of a
case of co-infection with _Vibrio cholerae_ and _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_.

The case, which is the first reported cholera case in Hong Kong in 2003,
involved a 39-year-old woman who suffered from watery diarrhea, abdominal
pain, and fever. She is now in stable condition in a hospital, according to
the health department. In addition to bacteria causing cholera, _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_, a type of bacteria causing fever and diarrhea, was also
found in the same specimen from the patient, the department said, adding
the source of infection has not been identified yet.

A spokesman for the department said the best way to prevent cholera and
other foodborne diseases is to observe good personal, food, and
environmental hygiene at all times. 4 confirmed cholera cases were
reported in 2002, among which 2 were imported and 2 were local cases.

Cholera in Iraq - Update 3
---------------------------
From 28 Apr to 4 Jun 2003, a total of 73 laboratory-confirmed cholera
cases have been reported in Iraq: 68 in Basra governorate, 4 in Missan
governorate, and 1 in Muthana governorate. No deaths have been reported.

From 17 May to 4 Jun 2003, the daily surveillance system of diarrhoeal
disease cases in the 4 main hospitals of Basra reported a total of 1549
cases of acute watery diarrhea. Among these cases, 25.6 percent occurred in
patients aged 5 years and above.

The water supply situation is critical. Short-term measures have been
undertaken by UNICEF and local authorities to improve accessibility to safe
drinking water and to limit the spread of water-borne epidemics.

WHO is supporting local authorities in implementing an early warning
communicable disease surveillance system, in strengthening laboratory
capacity, and in coordinating the cholera outbreak response.

The surveillance system is being expanded to the whole Lower South (all 4
governorates), and weekly reports from all facilities have begun.

UNICEF is also supporting the initiative by providing health education
material in Arabic and chlorine tablets to all health directorates.

Cholera in Mozambique Update
----------------------------
As of 15 Jun 2003, a total of 11 796 cases and 87 deaths (case fatality
rate 0.74 percent) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health in
Mozambique. (see previous report: <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_05_21/en/>)

From 1 Jan to 15 Jun 2003, Maputo province registered 4124 cases with 31
deaths, with the number of cases now declining. The peak of the outbreak in
Maputo province and Maputo city occurred at the same time as a cholera
outbreak began in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. During the same
period, cholera cases were also reported in Northern Hohho, Swaziland which
borders on Mpumalanga province, South Africa. WHO is therefore proposing
cross-border initiatives to control these cholera outbreaks.

From 1 Jan to 15 Jun 2003 a total of 2004 cases including 29 deaths have
been reported in Gaza province and 2812 cases including 14 deaths in Sofala
province. WHO is assisting the national health authorities in Sofala and
Gaza provinces to control the cholera outbreaks.

As of 8 Jun 2003, the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of the Congo
has reported a total of 13 452 cases of cholera including 380 deaths (case
fatality rate, 2.82 percent) in the country. The most affected provinces
are Sud Kivu (1387 cases including 26 deaths, case fatality rate, 1.87
percent), Katanga (7557 cases with 221 deaths, case fatality rate, 2.92
percent), and Kasai Oriental (3098 cases and 89 deaths, case fatality rate,
2.87 percent), with most of the cases occurring in the Tsilingue area. The
epidemic seems to be spreading in Kasai Oriental, as 3 new health areas
were affected during the week of 1-8 Jun 2003. There is also a high risk
of spread to the neighboring province, Kasai Occidental.

The Governor of Kasai Oriental province has organized a cholera task force
meeting with partners including WHO to look at how to increase capacity in
the cholera treatment centres and how to provide supplies for patients with
severe dehydration.

Typhiod in Haiti - Update
-------------------------
As of 30 May 2003, 200 cases of typhoid and 40 deaths have been reported by
the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO) and the Ministry of Health,
Haiti. 3 cases have been laboratory-confirmed.

The outbreak started in Apr 2003 during the dry season and affected remote
villages in the Grand Bois Area, bordering the Dominican Republic. These
villages lack access to health care facilities and to safe water; all water
points in the area showed a maximum level of _E. coli_ pollution. Most of
the deaths occurred in persons who had no access to health care facilities.

In May 2003, PAHO and the Ministry of Health sent a team to investigate and
control the epidemic, including: sampling water points, establishing mobile
clinics, laboratory testing of cases, providing health education, and
organizing the response at the local level.

Chinhoyi Diarrhoea Death Toll Hits 5
-------------------------------------------
One more person died from diarrhea in Chinhoyi yesterday, bringing to 5 the
number of people who have succumbed to the water-borne disease in the
Mashonaland West provincial capital since last week.

There have been allegations that the town's water is unfit for human
consumption, but town officials have dismissed the claims. But officials
at the provincial medical directorate in Chinhoyi yesterday confirmed the
town's water had indeed tested unfit for human consumption.

"That we can confirm, recent tests proved the water was not fit for human
consumption," said Mashonaland West provincial medical director, Dr
Wenceslas Nyamayaro. 4 people died last week after allegedly
drinking contaminated water.

More than 500 cases of diarrhea, mostly affecting under-5-year-olds, were
reported in Chinhoyi last week, and Dr Nyamayaro attributed these to
contaminated water.

He also said there was a possibility that sewerage water might have leaked
into a river, which feeds into the dam which supplies the town with
water. The Chinhoyi municipality is said to have only 4 out of the 14
chemicals required for water treatment. But council officials dismissed
the allegations, saying they were doing all what was required to treat
water. "We have enough water treatment chemicals and the stocks are here,"
said an official.
