On 29 Mar 2006 a 36-year-old German woman died of falciparum malaria
in Berlin. She had returned to Germany from a 6-month visit to
Thailand on 19 Mar 2006, and had soon after developed fever, chills,
diarrhoea, cough, and difficulty breathing. Although her condition
worsened, she did not seek medical care and died at home. German
authorities do not recommend antimalarial prophylaxis for travellers
visiting Thailand, and so she had not taken any chemoprophylaxis [1].
This case was described in a posting on the internet-based reporting
system ProMED-mail, which led to a posting that reported 2 falciparum
malaria infections in Israel that had been imported from Thailand.
Both Israeli patients were 25-year-old men who had travelled in
Thailand. Although they had not travelled together, the 2 men had
visited the same places, at slightly different times. They were
admitted to hospital in Israel in November 2005, and both have since
recovered [2]. Since malaria chemoprophylaxis is generally not
recommended for travel to Thailand, these cases may initiate
discussion about the current malaria risk for travellers to South
East Asia and possible implications for current malaria
recommendations.
Malaria continues to be a health hazard for Europeans travelling to
endemic areas worldwide. Malaria cases in European travellers are
steadily increasing due both to an increase in the volume of
international tourism to endemic areas, and to migration of people
from these areas to Europe. In the 1990s, between 10 000 and 12 000
cases of imported malaria cases were notified annually in the
European Union -- which is about 2-3 cases per 100 000 population
[3]. In 2000, 15 528 cases of imported malaria were reported to the
World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, with the
largest numbers from France and the United Kingdom, which together
accounted for about 65 percent of all cases [4].
Several factors influence the incidence of imported malaria,
including endemicity in the areas visited, intensity of exposure, and
compliance with and success of prophylactic measures. Data derived
from Swedish travellers between 1997 and 2003 showed geographic
differences in the crude risk of acquiring malaria ranging from 1
case per 100 000 travellers to Central America and the Caribbean and
5 per 100 000 in travellers to East and South East Asia, to 357 per
100 000 in central Africa [5]. Among those travellers, children below
6 years of age had a risk 4.8 times greater than adults. Of 1659
cases of falciparum malaria infection reported to the European
Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance (TropNetEurop) in
1999 and 2000, only a minority of patients reported having taken
chemoprophylaxis appropriate to the resistance situation at their
travel destination [6].
Within this group, west Africa contributed by far the greatest number
of imported _Plasmodium falciparum_ infections, with 68 percent
(534/1659) of all cases in people migrating from the area and 59
percent (511/1659) of cases in shorter-term travellers. South East
Asia in general, and Thailand in particular, have not been important
contributors of imported malaria cases to the European region.
Studies have identified a low incidence of falciparum malaria in
travellers returning from Thailand [7,8]. This risk is considered to
be so low that for those visiting Bangkok and the main tourist areas
of Thailand, the risk of potential serious side effects from malaria
chemoprophylaxis far outweigh the risk of malaria infection, and, for
example, chemoprophylaxis is advised for UK travellers only if they
plan to visit areas of Thailand bordering Burma and Cambodia [9]. The
TropNetEurop archives show an average of 1-4 cases of falciparum
malaria reported annually since 1999, with an additional 1-3 patients
annually with _P. vivax_ malaria (unpublished data, TropNetEurop). An
increase in the number of imported cases is not apparent. The current
TropNetEurop surveillance map for imported malaria to Europe shows an
increased signal from Laos caused by a single case [Figure - see URL
link above]. Thailand is not highlighted.
There is currently no reason to assume that the cases described
reflect an increased risk of European tourists acquiring malaria in
Thailand.
However, the recent death of the German patient demonstrates once
again the importance of adequate information for travellers. If
travellers do not take chemoprophylaxis when visiting low-risk
malaria areas, they need to be aware of important mosquito avoidance
measures, the signs and symptoms of malaria and the importance of
seeking medical help in the event of an illness with fever.
Occasionally, as in this case, a non-immune person will acquire
falciparum malaria in a low-risk area, and will require fast and
effective treatment. Appropriate pre-travel counselling is the most
effective tool healthcare professionals can give travellers in order
to deal with this situation.

[The key message in the report from Eurosurveillance is, "There is
currently no reason to assume that the cases described reflect an
increased risk of European tourists acquiring malaria in Thailand."
Few studies include the numbers of travellers at risk, but a recent
study by Askling et al. (reference 5 above) found a risk of malaria
in Swedish travellers of 5.6 per 100 000 travelling to Southeast
Asia. This is very close to the figures fond by Hill et al. 1996
(reference 7 above) and Kofoed & Petersen 2003 (reference 8. above).
Most studies found that no matter which antimalarial is used for
prophylaxis, 2-5 percent of travellers experience symptoms they
perceive as serious side effects. This is the rationale for the
current recommendations from most European countries against malaria
prophylaxis for travel to countries in Southeast Asia like Thailand.
The first problem with this approach is that some travellers will
believe that because prophylaxis has not been recommended, there is
no risk. This can only be addressed by better information. The second
problem is that a local increase in risk -- like what we probably see
here from Koh Phangan, Phuket Province -- is not noted by the
Ministry of Health and is not reported, but is picked up by national
and international surveillance systems like TropNetEurop. This
situation would benefit from improved rapid reporting by the national
authorities. - Mod.EP]
