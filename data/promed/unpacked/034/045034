YERSINIOSIS, LETTUCE - NORWAY

Since February 2011, the Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health has identified identical strains of
_Yersinia enterocolitica_ O:9 in 20 patients living in Norway.
Interviews with the patients with yersiniosis led to suspicion of a
particular pre-packaged lettuce mix that was withdrawn from the
market.

Further investigation led to suspicion of several pre-packaged
lettuce mixes purchased in grocery stores. Preliminary investigations
conducted at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute strengthened this
suspicion. The manufacturer has therefore withdrawn a further 9
lettuce mixes from the market. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority
recommends that consumers should not eat these lettuce mixes. The
Norwegian Institute of Public Health is continuing the investigation
in co-operation with the Food Safety Authority and Veterinary
Institute.

Each year, 50-100 cases of yersiniosis are reported to the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health. Most cases occur sporadically and several
cases with a common source rarely occur in Norway.

Yersiniosis is transmitted primarily through food but can transmit
between people in rare cases. The most common symptoms are diarrhea,
fever and abdominal pain, usually lasting for 1-3 weeks. In most
cases, the disease clears up without treatment.

[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with food-borne disease are
_pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_. The latter species, as
noted in the posting, can be associated with abdominal pain as a
hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic
appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites such as
wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book"
(http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap5.html), "Strains of _Y.
enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.),
oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination
is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in the soil and
water and in animals such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers
ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation
and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including
improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to
contamination." Additionally, some strains of these organisms can be
associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an
ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL]
