----------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to update the information presented in the posting referenced above regarding the status of TB among elephants in the US. The comment following the report on TB in the Oregon Zoo elephants stated that it has been reported that 3 percent of the elephants in the US are infected. This figure is out dated and no longer accurate. Between 1994-2011, the number of known culture positive TB cases among elephants in the US was 51 among a population of 480 for an apparent prevalence of 10.6 percent; 45 of 274 Asian elephants were positive (16.4 percent) and 6 of 206 African elephants (2.9 percent). Almost all cases were due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (50); one case was caused by _M. bovis_ (Orloski 2011).

By 2013 the number of culture-confirmed cases had increased to 57 and there are now over 60.

The use of the term "prevalence" has been controversial within the elephant community as technically the term means the proportion of a population that currently has a condition which can be difficult to ascertain. I suggest that for elephants, it is more useful to use the term "life-time prevalence" which is the proportion of a population that at some point in their life have experienced the condition. Between 1994 and 2013, 57 culture-confirmed cases of TB were diagnosed among a captive population of about 446 elephants in the US for an estimated life-time prevalence of 12.4 percent for both elephant species. For the period 1994-2011, the life-time prevalence for Asian elephants, which account for almost all of the cases, is estimated at 16.4 percent (45/274).

Given the low TB burden among humans in the US the occurrence of TB in elephants is surprisingly high.
