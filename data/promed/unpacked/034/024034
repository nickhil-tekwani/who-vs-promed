More people infected with measles
---------------------------------------
The 2nd stage [of] preventive measures were not completed in
Primorsky kray [region] last year [?referring to a 2nd round of
vaccination activities?- Mod.MPP]. As a result, an epidemic zone was
formed in 2007 that led to 11 cases of measles: 10 among adults (from
Vladivostok and Ussuriysk cities) and one in teenager from Ussuriysk,
of whom 8 were laboratory confirmed.
It is assumed that infection was imported from China, since the 1st 3
people to develop measles were part of a tourist group returning from
China. That was the conclusion made by the chief sanitary doctor of
Primorye, Dr. Dmitriy Maslov, who also added that "Measles cases
occurred among those adults that did not have a history of
vaccination.. The infection spread among those adults with inadequate
measles vaccination: by January 2007, only 93.3 percent of adults
aged 18-35 had some immunity against measles, out of them 2.6 percent
already had measles, 39 percent had a history of 2 doses of measles
containing vaccine [i.e., were adequately vaccinated - Mod.MPP], and
51.8 percent were vaccinated once [i.e., inadequately vaccinated -
Mod.MPP].
According to a physician those individuals that had never been
vaccinated or had only received one dose of measles containing
vaccine are considered to be at risk of measles infection. According
to an analysis conducted in 2006 - 13.8 percent of adults aged 23-25
were not protected against measles (permissible level is 7 percent
[this suggests that the recommended vaccination coverage at the
community level is 93 percent who should have a history of 2 doses of
measles vaccine - Mod.MPP]). This 13.8 percent of inadequately
vaccinated adults are at high risk of measles infection.
In 2004-2006, supplementary immunization of adults up through age 35
was conducted. As of 1 January 2007, 38 293 adults aged 18-35 years
in the Primorsky Krai were not vaccinated against measles and were
susceptible and 295 987 individuals had a history of one dose of
vaccine. The plan for vaccination activities in 2007 is to vaccinate
only 388 adults. Right now there are insufficient funds to cover the
whole adult population, thus, the chief sanitary physician of
Primorsky kray has issued a local decree to conduct a supplementary
vaccination among adults up through age 35 who had inadequate
vaccination histories [having received less than 2 doses of vaccine
-- either one dose or no prior doses. - Mod.MPP]

ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
[It appears as though the vaccination program in the affected region
(Primorsky) was unable to complete catch-up vaccinations of the
entire adult population but plans to conduct vaccination activities
among the identified high risk adult population, defined as those
individuals less than 35 years of age (born after 1972) without a
documented history of prior measles infection, and not having
received 2 doses of measles containing vaccine. According to the
coverages cited, only 41.6 percent of this population was considered
immune and not at risk of measles (immune defined as having had
measles infection or having a history of 2 doses of measles
containing vaccine).
Of note is that this outbreak began as a probable importation of
measles from China as the 1st 3 cases recorded in this outbreak had
just returned from a trip to China. As can be seen from the
ProMED-mail prior postings below, the ongoing measles activity in one
country carries with it the possibility (and probability) for
importation to other countries. In prior ProMED-mail posting (see
Measles - USA (NM) ex India (02): importations background
20070522.1633), Dr. Steve Berger from shared data on importation
related measles outbreaks from the Global Infectious Disease &
Epidemiology Network
(<http://www.gideononline.net>). These importation related outbreaks
serve as a reminder that we do live in a global village, and events
happening in countries geographically distant from us are important
and may affect us in a short amount of time (the incubation period
between exposure and onset of illness in a traveller.
Also of note is that the Primorsky region (kray) is located in the
Far East of Asian Russia, sharing a border with China to the west,
and on the Japanese Sea on the east. For a map of the Primorsky Kray,
