Situation of rural anthrax in Argentina 2021
--------------------------------------------

Summary
------
1. Rural Anthrax Evaluation Area in the Province of Buenos Aires: Having completed 45 years of epidemiological evaluation, the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ continues to be present (Map 1 [see source URL for all figures]). In the period 1977-2021, 4553 samples were evaluated, 470 (10%) were positive. During the year 2021 (Graph 1), 45 samples were evaluated, resulting in one (2%) positive, originating from the Saladillo Party. The anthrax is in decline if we compare the 2012-16 five-year period, 6% positivity, against the 2017-21 five-year period of 1%. This was achieved by the entry into force of Law No.: 6703-61.Res.115/14.

2. Blue (Azul) Party Alert and Response Zone: The 67 bovine "anthrax outbreaks" (2004-2013) were related to the runoff routes of its waters, originating alerts and rigorous responses. A total of 414 231 bovines were vaccinated, 27 768 more than their category. Since 2013, there have been no outbreaks of bovine or human anthrax.

3. Isolation in Other Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories: 5 laboratories participated, applying similar techniques, in the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa and Rio Negro, processing a total of 77 samples, managing to isolate 2 (2%) strains of _Bacillus anthracis_, located in the provinces of La Pampa (Department of Utracan) and Rio Negro (Department of General Conesa), demonstrating the endemicity of this zoonosis.

4. Districts of the Province of Buenos Aires Involved with Outbreaks of Anthrax: During the year 2021, there was one isolation of _Bacillus anthracis_ from a sporadic bovine outbreak in the District of Saladillo, the last one had occurred in 2015, demonstrating that the spores persist for years in hydro-halomorphic soils, waiting to complete their natural cycle.

5. Production of Anthrax Vaccine for Veterinary Use: There were 9 laboratories that produced Sterne strain anthrax vaccines that produced 36 755 070 bovine doses, some 7 260 030 doses more than those produced in 2020, being one of the most important productions that have reference.

6. Compulsory Bovine Vaccination:
a. Alert and Response Area Partido de Azul/Buenos Aires: 414 231 bovines were vaccinated in the susceptible category.
b. Province of Buenos Aires: Since 1 Jan 2021, Law 6703/61-Resolution MAA115/14 has been in full force, which prevents the movement of unvaccinated cattle annually in its territory. In the period 3 Mar 2021 to 31 Dec 2021, a total of 11 787 396 bovines were vaccinated.
c. Province of Santa Fe: Ministerial Resolution 1007/2014 is in force, which requires the vaccination of cattle. It was not possible to obtain the information on the 2021 vaccination.

7. Cases of Human Anthrax at the National Level: Since 2018, the Integrated Bulletin of National Surveillance/SINAVE stopped publishing "Cases of Human Anthrax."

Conclusions
-----------
a. Isolates of _Bacillus anthracis_ continue to be observed at the systematized monitoring points in the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and Rio Negro.
b. The said provinces should carry out interprovincial sanitary agreements in order to control this zoonosis.
c. An official monitoring of "suddenly dead cattle" should be established in the areas involved to maintain sensitive and current epidemiological alerts and responses.
d. The production and annual application of the Sterne strain anti-anthrax vaccine should continue to grow and thus generate promising health prospects for the control of _Bacillus anthracis_ in Argentina.

[The Argentines are working hard to eradicate this disease and with marked success. The disease has become truly sporadic, and a common history is a failure to wholly or completely vaccinate the herds. When the owners fail to vaccinate or leave out a bunch, it becomes public knowledge when the latter come down with anthrax.

This brings back memories of the problems in the US Dakotas, which are now effectively clear of this disease despite the procrastinators. Our thanks to Ramon for his annual report, and he has our full support and appreciation for his hard work. - Mod.MHJ
