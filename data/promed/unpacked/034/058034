According to the Chitradurga district Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, nearly 5% of the total sheep in the district are suffering from the deadly bluetongue disease. Chitradurga is one of the largest sheep-rearing districts in the state with more than 14 lakh [1.4 million] sheep.

The disease is caused by the biting of _Culicoides_ midges, and it damages the immune system, resulting in slow death.

Deputy director, Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, Dr Krishnappa said, "There is an outbreak of the bluetongue disease in the district owing to the recent heavy rains." He said the mortality rate was 20-30% and can be reduced if the infected animals are properly treated.

[Bluetongue (BT) is an OIE-listed, infectious, non-contagious, _Culicoides_-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, most species of African antelope, and various other Artiodactyla as vertebrate hosts. Infection with bluetongue virus (BTV) is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in a proportion of infected sheep, particularly in European breeds, as well as in deer and wild ruminants. Infection of cattle with BTV does not usually result in clinical signs, with the exception of BTV-8 infection in Europe. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to the prolonged viraemia in the absence of clinical disease. Clinical signs of BT are mainly attributable to vascular permeability and include fever, hyperaemia and congestion, facial oedema and haemorrhages, and erosion of the mucous membranes. At least 26 serotypes of BTV have been identified.

BT is endemic in India. At least 13 different serotypes (BTV-1-4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 16-18, 21, and 23) have been isolated under All-India Network Program on Bluetongue (AINP-BT) and by other research laboratories in the country. In Karnataka, BTV-23 has reportedly been isolated in the past. Recently, in India, an inactivated pentavalent vaccine (BTV-1, 2, 10, 16, and 23) was developed and commercialized, but no information of its application in the field has become available. The above and additional information on BT in India is available in Ref 1. The paper includes Fig 1, a map presenting the prevalence of different BTV serotypes in India's states based on their isolation.
