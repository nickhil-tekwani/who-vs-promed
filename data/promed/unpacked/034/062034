An outbreak of the deadly West Nile virus is spreading across Europe and more mosquitoes known to spread the disease have been found in Essex.
The World Health Organisation has warned of a spike in cases of the mosquito-borne infection, which has killed 3 people in Italy in recent days.

Some 401 cases of West Nile virus have been diagnosed across Europe so far this year [2018], with the majority occurring in Serbia, Italy and Greece. 22 people have died as a result of infection.

While around 80 per cent of people infected do not have any symptoms, others may show flu-like signs or develop a more serious, possibly deadly, illness.

The World Health Organisation says the insects started transmitting the infection earlier this year [2018], and high temperatures and rainy spells followed by dry weather have encouraged mosquitoes to breed more.

[Countries most affected include:
Serbia: 126 cases;
Italy: 123 cases;
Greece: 75 cases;
Hungary: 39 cases;
Romania: 31 cases]

Two people, aged 69 and 86, died in the Ferrara region of Italy earlier in August [2018] after being treated in hospital for 10 days. The other victim, who also lived in the area, died of the virus in late July.

Greek health authorities revealed 3 people had died in Athens of West Nile fever, and the virus has affected 60 people in the area this year [2018].

Most people infected by West Nile virus do not have symptoms, but some may experience flu-like signs such as a fever and headache. In extreme cases, it can result in tremors, fever, comas and a lethal swelling of the brain tissue known as encephalitis. It can also cause meningitis.

Healthy people are usually able to recover quickly, though in older adults and those with weakened immune systems the disease may progress to be more serious.

No cases have been reported in the UK but Government advice updated this week [week of 20 Aug 2018] shows the _Culex modestus_ which is known to spread West Nile virus -- has been found in the Thames Estuary for the 1st time on [11 Jul 2018]. The area around Southend-on-Sea is the 1st new known UK location of the bugs since 2016.

It has been found elsewhere in the country in past years but the new information suggests the insects have spread across the country.

Public Health England (PHE) insists, however, the risk of getting West Nile virus from mosquitoes in the UK is low.

The insects must bite infected prey -- usually birds -- in order to carry the disease and, as West Nile virus has not been found in animals in this country, it is unlikely the mosquitoes will pick it up.

Dr Jolyon Medlock, PHE's head of medical entomology said: 'While we have detected this mosquito species in areas around the Thames Estuary, we have not detected the virus itself.

"The few cases of West Nile virus diagnosed in the UK have been due to insect bites abroad and the risk of contracting the infection in this country is low."

Public Health England monitors mosquito populations around the UK and regularly checks for new species. It says the _C.
modestus_ species has not been found outside of the south east.

Dr Medlock added: 'The majority of people infected with West Nile virus do not develop symptoms but those that do will experience a mild, flu like illness, and rash lasting up to 6 days.

"Those over 50 and with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of more severe disease.

"People can avoid insect bites by using insect repellent and wearing tops with long sleeves."

West Nile virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes. It was first diagnosed in Uganda in 1937, but no cases were reported in the US until 1999 in New York. The virus gradually spread across the country.

Only about one in 5 infected people report feeling unwell. Early symptoms can include fever, headache, and body aches. Some recover in a matter of days. But 1 in 150 infected people will develop severe symptoms including neck stiffness, disorientation, coma and paralysis.

[West Nile virus activity is on the rise, with a higher number of cases being reported this year (2018) with multiple outbreaks across Europe. This is largely due to the early start of the 2018 transmission season in the WHO European Region, which normally lasts from July to October. This year's season has been characterized by high temperatures and extended rainy spells, followed by dry weather. Such weather conditions have been conducive to mosquito breeding and propagation. - Mod.UBA]

A 5th victim of the deadly West Nile virus has died in the Italian city of Padua bringing the total number of deaths to 9 in Italy and 43 across Europe, sparking panic among tourists. Italian officials confirmed the virus has so far infected 105 Italians since figures were updated on Wednesday night [22 Aug 2018] following the death of the 91-year-old man who has not been named.

On [14 Aug 2018], the figure was 84, meaning the total number of those infected has spiked by 21 in a week.

Though it is not known how many Europeans are currently infected with the virus, transmitted through mosquitos, the majority of cases are in Veneto, north western Italy.

Regional Councillor for Health, Luca Coletto, told Italian publication Il Messaggero: "We are facing a challenging situation, but it is not alarming, a hundred confirmed cases on a population of about 5 million inhabitants.

"The scientists point out that it is actually a virus with limited consequences, asymptomatic in 80 percent of cases and only in less than 1 percent able to evolve to the neuroinvasive form." The neuroinvasive form is the final stage of the virus before death. The latest victim was elderly and said to have been suffering from other unrelated illnesses, the publication reports.

Other victims have been from Treviso, Padua, and Verona and across Italy there are 34 patents seeking treatment in the most dangerous neuroinvasive stage of the illness. The 4 other victims that died of the disease were also pensioners and are yet to be named.

The 1st death caused by the disease in Treviso was recorded on the 31 Jul 2018, when an 86-year-old pensioner passed away in Legnago hospital. A week later, on 8 Aug 2018, the 2nd victim, an 89-year-old man from Este, the province of Padua, lost his life. After that, 2 others lost their lives in Verona.

The disease is transmitted by mosquitos with symptoms including fever, headache, tiredness, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally a skin rash and swollen lymph glands.

While the number of people infected with the virus has continued to grow in Veneto, some of the victims have not required medical intervention.

If victims do require medical attention then they are often given intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention for secondary infections but there is currently no vaccine available for humans, the World Health Organisation notes.

[According to ECDC data of last week (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc), in 2018, as of 16 Aug 2018, 123 cases have been reported from Italy. However, the report in [2] above mentions 105 cases reported from Italy, with 5 deaths and majority of cases located in northwestern Italy.

Currently, there is no human vaccine against WNV. According to WHO guidance, in order to prevent infection, people in affected areas should follow the "4 Ds" of WNV prevention (http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/italy/news/news/2018/8/west-nile-virus-infections-spike-in-southern-and-central-europe):
- Dusk: this is the prime feeding time for mosquitos and therefore when people are most likely to get bitten. Avoid outdoor activity at peak biting times.
- Dress: wear light-coloured long-sleeved shirts and trousers.
- DEET: use insect repellent that contains DEET (diethyltoluamide), strictly following the user instructions on the package.
- Drainage: make sure mosquito breeding sites (flower pots, water dishes, bird baths, and children's swimming pools) are drained so that they do not become breeding grounds for mosquitos.

In addition, people are advised to wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during slaughtering and culling procedures. - Mod.UBA]
