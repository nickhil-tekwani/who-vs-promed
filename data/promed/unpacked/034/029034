Danish officials are investigating an _E. coli_ outbreak that has 26 cases with 3 out of 4 being children. Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the agency responsible for the preparedness against infectious diseases in Denmark, said the source of infection is not yet known but an investigation is under way.

SSI told Food Safety News that the 26 confirmed patients' ages are between less than 1 year old to 95 years old, with 19 being children younger than 5 years of age. One person has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Cases with a specific type of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) have been reported to SSI in the past few weeks. _E. coli_ O26:H11 illnesses are spread across the country, but are primarily in the cities of Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Odense. Illness onset dates range from 23 Aug 2018 to 10 Oct 2018. From 2015-17, this O-group of _E. coli_ was usually among the top 4 in terms of number of episodes in the country. The other _E. coli_ bacteria in the top spots were O157, O103, and O146.

Interviews to find the source of infection with cases or their parents are ongoing with Fødevarestyrelsen (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration) and DTU Fødevareinstituttet (DTU Food - National Food Institute). SSI said it had shared information with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). No other countries have confirmed cases related to the outbreak in Denmark. The outbreak strain causes relatively mild symptoms in most patients. It harbors the Shiga toxin (stx) 1a gene while hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is more often associated with strains that produce Stx2a. HUS is a severe complication of _E. coli_ infection that can lead to kidney failure.

EHEC is destroyed by cooking food until all parts reach a temperature of 70 deg C [158 deg F] or higher. Symptoms include abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The incubation period can range from 3 to 8 days and most patients recover within 10 days. People at higher risk of severe infections, life-threatening complications and death include young children, frail and elderly people, pregnant women, and people such as cancer patients and pregnant because they have mature or weakened immune systems

[The source of this outbreak has not yet be determined.

The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) serotype is identified as O26, one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include O121, O104, and O111. Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5).
