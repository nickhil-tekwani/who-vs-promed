A patient is slouched in a chair at the Victory Rehabilitation Center
on the outskirts of Kampala, recalling his time as a maker of
homemade banana gin. "I knew it could be dangerous, but I didn't know
it could kill so many people," says the 34-year-old former primary
school teacher.

This patient is referring to the more than 100 people who have died
in western Uganda since early April [2010] after ingesting a
methanol-laced version of a homemade gin known as waragi. The popular
drink, easy to make and cheap to buy, has been blamed for causing
blindness and death before, but never so many in such a short span of
time. Illegal production of hard liquor is a problem across much of
Africa, but it may be worst in Uganda.

Unregulated waragi accounts for nearly 80 percent of the liquor
produced in the country, according to the Uganda National Bureau of
Standards (UNBS), which oversees production of legal products in the
country. It doesn't help that the alcohol is inexpensive and that the
penalties for producing or selling it are ineffective. A tall glass
of homemade waragi "usually made from bananas or cassava, millet or
sugarcane" goes for about 25 cents, one-sixth the cost of the leading
regulated brand. Illegal production carries a fine of only about
[USD] 1.50 and a jail term not to exceed 6 months, while offenders'
cases are often dropped before they reach a courtroom.

The drink is packaged in cheap sachets sometimes as small as 100 ml
and costing as little as 10 cents, making them accessible to the
destitute and children. Another outpatient at Victory Rehabilitation
Center, recalls being initiated to alcohol through the sachets, which
some students snuck into his secondary school to sell. "In Uganda
it's as if drinking has no restrictions," he says.

Which, in many ways, is true. Uganda still has no national alcohol
policy nor an effective regulatory body, while the tax on
domestically produced alcohol was lowered 2 years ago, boosting both
production and consumption. Alcohol was the country's 6th-highest
revenue earner in 2008, accounting for 10 percent of national
revenue, according to Uganda Youth Development Link (UYDEL), one of
the country's leading voices against alcohol abuse. "Drinking has
been made way too easy," says Mutaawe Rogers, UYDEL's Program
Officer. "Business interests are winning out over national interests."

[Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the
developing world, where methanol is often a component of bootleg
alcohol, which is made in rural regions. Because of its low cost, it
is often consumed by those in lower socioeconomic classes. Methanol
has a relatively low toxicity, hence the adverse effects are thought
to result from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of
methanol metabolism. Formic acid metabolism is very slow, therefore
it accumulates in the body, leading to metabolic acidosis.

Initial symptoms occur 12-24 hours after ingestion and in general
correlate with the volume of methanol ingested and the amount of
ethanol concomitantly ingested. The minimal lethal dose is believed
to be 1 mg/kg body weight. Initial symptoms include disinhibition and
ataxia followed by headache, nausea, and vomiting or epigastric pain.
These are then followed by drowsiness, seizures, and eventually coma.
Visual symptoms like flashes of light, blurring, scotomas, and
scintillations occur and may progress to complete visual loss. Prompt
medical care is vital to avoid complications secondary to methanol
intoxication. Supportive therapy is aimed at initiating airway
management, correcting electrolyte disturbances, and providing
adequate hydration. The metabolic acidosis may necessitate
administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate
potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may
help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism
until the methanol is eliminated from the system, either naturally or
via dialysis, often accomplished in 2 ways: ethanol or fomepizole.
Ethanol is also metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and the
enzyme has 10-20 times higher affinity for ethanol compared with
methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is
limited because of high costs and lack of availability.
