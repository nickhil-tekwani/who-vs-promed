RED TIDE, SHELLFISH - USA (WASHINGTON)

The worst red tide in perhaps a decade has shut down shellfish beds all
along Puget Sound and prompted serious public health worries, state
officials said Wednesday. But industry officials worried that more bad news
could further damage businesses already reeling from a separate bacterial
outbreak.
The eastern Kitsap Peninsula also has been affected, along with areas near
Port Gamble, Port Ludlow and along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, said Frank
Cox, a Health Department marine biotoxin coordinator.
Scientists were particularly worried by very high levels of the toxic
organisms called _Alexandrium_ sp., which produce powerful neurotoxins that
cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans.
The state closes shellfish-growing areas when measurements of the toxins
reach 80 micrograms [per 100 grams of shellfish meat]. But many areas are
showing levels of 1000 micrograms or more, with mussels at Port Ludlow in
Jefferson County containing nearly 10 000 micrograms.
Paralytic shellfish poisoning can be fatal, but Washington state hasn't
recorded a death since 3 people were killed in 1942. The latest serious
illnesses were recorded in 2000, when several people were sickened -- some
even paralyzed -- after eating contaminated shellfish near Gig Harbor, Cox
said.
The large bloom of toxic algae also was worrisome for the state's shellfish
farmers, who battled a recall of raw oysters [in July 2006] after a
separate outbreak of vibriosis, an bacterial illness.
Shelton-based Taylor Shellfish, the West Coast's largest farmed shellfish
producer, lost about $150 000 a week in live oyster sales because of the
bacterial outbreak, spokesman Bill Dewey said.
"It'd be a shame if we just got relief from the vibrio to get shut down for
red tide," Dewey said.

[_Alexandrium_ sp. is one of many members of this genera. Some members may
not be toxic. However, generally, the genera is found in costal waters high
in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the
organisms capable of causing Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). The
neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish
and may be dangerous to humans and animals who swim in waters that are
'blooming' with the organism. Ocean spray containing the organism may also
cause illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some
species of this genera are capable of causing 'red tide' that may be
visible for long distances along a coast line.
Certainly, with levels as high as this article indicates are being found in
the waters and the shellfish, this represents a public health hazard. It is
sad that the harvesters are suffering an economic loss, but it would be
worse should someone die of this toxin from shellfish they consumed. - Mod.TG]
