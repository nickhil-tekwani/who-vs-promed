Sanitary alert for Rickettsia cases in Durango, Mexico
---------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in the state of Durango have declared a "sanitary alert"
in the municipality of Rodeo, community of Linares del Rio, after the
detection of an outbreak of rickettsiosis, a disease relatively common in
California, USA. A 14-year-old girl died and 2 other victims remain
hospitalized.
Gerardo Perez Ibarra, president of Rodeo, informed that the minor was taken
to the general hospital of the municipality, where she died. Another
patient, also a minor, was taken to the emergency department of a hospital
in California, where he has been reported to be out of danger. 2 other
children contracted the disease and were referred to the general hospital
of the city of Durango.

[Given the statement that this rickettsial infection is relatively common
in California, it is likely that murine typhus is the disease here, caused
by _R. typhi_. The disease is distributed worldwide, particularly in
temperate and subtropical areas where rat reservoirs and their flea vector
exist. In some areas, however, such as southern California and south
Texas, opossums have been described as a reservoir and the cat flea
_Ctenocephalides felis_ may be a vector. The infection is transmitted by
the inoculation of flea feces containing the organism into a pruritic wound
caused by a flea bite.
Unlike the spotted fevers, epidemic typhus, and rickettsial pox, the rash
is not a classic manifestation of the disease, occurring in only 18 percent
at presentation and 50 percent at any time during the illness. Symptoms
are mostly nonspecific, including fever, severe headache, chills, and
myalgia. Case fatality rates are reported to be low (1-4 percent) and are
associated with extensive damage to the vascular endothelium by the
organism, with multisystem involvement including kidney, lung, and central
nervous system.
Since more severe complications occur with other rickettsial infections
when the patient is treated with sulfonamide antimicrobials, it would be of
interest to know whether this occurred in the fatal case described.
