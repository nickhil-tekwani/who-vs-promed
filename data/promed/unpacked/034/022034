On an Aberdeen Angus cattle breeding estancia in the partido of Azul, 4
adult cattle died suddenly and without prior signs. The mother of the owner
handled the carcasses without gloves and developed a cutaneous lesion on
her hand. Since 2004, the partido has had an integrated awareness and
response program for all anthrax events. The integrated public health
response was rapid, and within 12 hours, all exposed persons received
antibiotics, and the carcasses were processed in the standard fashion and
covered with lime and a thick plastic tarpaulin.

[The last outbreak in the partido of Azul was on 26 Jul 2007.

As trees are essentially absent in the Argentine pampas, they have
developed this singular system of covering the carcass with lime and a
weighted down thick plastic tarpaulin. This is left in place for some 9
months, after which the bones and any other pieces are removed and buried.
It works. The only problem is foxes, who will on occasion burrow in, so one
has to keep an eye on the site for such activities. They encourage and
carefully monitor the vaccination on the various estancias in the province
because of the ongoing risk. The incidence is truly sporadic, but outbreaks
occur when vaccination is forgotten. 2008 was fairly typical, with 6
outbreaks in Buenos Aires Province, 3 in La Pampas, and one in Santa Fe.
Other provinces with occasional outbreaks are Cordoba and Entre Rios, both
latterly in 2006. - Mod.MHJ
