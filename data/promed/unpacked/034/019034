Anthrax breaks out among farming community in western Zambia
------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has broken out in western Zambia and authorities have since called for co-operation from livestock farmers to tackle the disease, state-run news agency reported on Wednesday [8 Apr 2015].

Anthrax, a serious disease that attacks cattle and other livestock and is sometimes caught from them by human beings, has broken out in 3 districts of the province [Western Province], namely Luampa, Kaoma and Nkeyema, according to the Zambia News and Information Service (ZANIS).

Western Province Permanent Secretary Mwangala Liomba expressed concern over the outbreak of the disease in the 3 districts and urged health authorities to put in place measures to ensure that the disease does not spread to other districts. According to the official, 18 people have so far been diagnosed and treated for anthrax after they ate suspected anthrax infected meat; but [the official] could not reveal the number of animals affected because getting information from the farmers was still difficult.

Meanwhile, Provincial Medical Officer Andrew Silumesi said health authorities have started seizing meats from butcheries as a way to contain the disease. The health authorities have also started sensitizing food retailers, market traders and food handlers from restaurants and butcheries on issues related to food safety and hygiene following the outbreak of anthrax.

The official, however, said national regulatory bodies should strengthen protection measures that encourage prevention, early detection and response to food-borne disease outbreaks in line with international food standards, guidelines and code of practices.

[Bovine anthrax is a constant problem in Western Province, for example with outbreaks recorded every year from 2014 back to 2006, and further back. And with sporadic human cases reported; probably it is more common in humans, but not everyone survives long enough to be seen live by a medical doctor. Clearly an argument may be made for a provincial proactive veterinary control programme. This would have both social benefits as well as economic benefits.
