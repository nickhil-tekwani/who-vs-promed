After ten years, leptospirosis reappeared in Tarija, in the community of Canadon Buena Vista, in the municipality of Bermejo. This disease claimed the life of a minor under 14 years of age and to date [Wed 8 Sep 2021] there have been 18 infected, according to the report of the Departmental Health Service (Headquarters), which supports the need for more control and monitoring actions.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with epidemic potential. It develops mainly in humid places or after heavy rains. Humans generally acquire it through direct contact with the urine of infected animals or with an environment contaminated by urine, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

Claudia Montenegro, an epidemiologist at Headquarters, explained that since [9 Sep 2021] activities are taking place to monitor and control the disease, and that Bermejo staff have already started actions to block this pathology. The work that remains to be done is trapping to capture rodents, taking samples from these animals, prophylaxis of the entire area and the elimination of rats in the affected areas.

All these actions will be carried out with the technical part of the Headquarters and the municipality of Bermejo; however, Montenegro is aware that the number of cases would have decreased, since the prophylaxis was carried out and the first infected patients have already tested negative, but it remains to continue with the control actions.

"It is a pathology that is generally asymptomatic; it does not cause major health problems in people; however, it can cause death. The outbreak that occurred in Bermejo began with the death of a 14-year-old girl" - said the epidemiologist -. "When there are symptoms, they mainly consist of fever, muscle pain that can be accentuated, also a yellow coloration may appear on the skin or eyes, and can also cause bleeding."

Montenegro explained that of the 18 cases detected, only 2 had symptoms, one of whom died. All patients belong to the municipality of Bermejo.

"Last year there were patients with this disease in Carapari, but they were isolated cases. A regrowth as such is returning after 10 years" - assured the specialist -. "It is a frequent pathology where there is a lot of humidity, such as dairies or farms where there is water, because the carrier animal, whether it is a mammal or a rodent, urinates in some places and then can come into contact with humans."

The Comunidad Campesina Canadon Buena Vista (https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8528795030#map=9/-22.5573/-64.3210), the small community in which the leptospirosis outbreak is said to be occurring, is located in the town of Bermejo, which has a population of 35 411 residents and is located in a broad, open valley that extends southward into Argentina, on the Bermejo River, the border between Bolivia and Argentina, in the Tarija Department in southern Bolivia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarija). A map showing the location of Bermejo can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bermejo,+Bolivia.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Each geographic locale may be characterized by a set of _Leptospira_ serovars. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar-specific.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other watersports, gardening, or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr. Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis. - Mod.ML
