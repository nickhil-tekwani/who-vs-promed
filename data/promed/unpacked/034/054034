Citrus black spot (_Guignardia citricarpa_ - EPPO A1 quarantine pest) had
been reported in the past in Argentina, but these records were not
confirmed. However, in the last few years, the disease has become
important and has been recorded in the two major citrus-producing regions:
Tucuman, Misiones and Corrientes. The disease also occurs in the region of
Entre Rios where the first symptoms were observed on Valencia Late oranges
in 1986/87. In this region, the pycnidial form (_Phyllostictina
citricarpa_) was readily isolated from most symptomatic fruits, but the
sexual stage, _G. citricarpa_ has not yet been detected (no details are
given for the other regions of Argentina mentioned above). All commercial
cultivars are susceptible to _G. citricarpa_ to a varying extent (except
sour orange, _Citrus aurantium_). _G. citricarpa_ can cause significant
losses due to premature fruit drop, and refusal of fruits for fresh market
(as they are disfigured by the presence of black spots).
