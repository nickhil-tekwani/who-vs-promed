There are no parenteral rabies vaccines licensed for use in wild
animals--period. Since the efficacy of rabies vaccines for wild animals
has not been measured or tested, the choice of a product is a moot point.
Because of the high risk of rabies in wild animals (especially raccoons,
skunks, coyotes, foxes and bats) the AVMA strongly suggests that these
animals not be managed, distributed or kept as pets.

The killed vaccine won't harm the raccoons. The most extensively tested
vaccine for raccoons is a vaccinia rabies glycoprotein (VRG) recombinant
that is being used for wild-life immunization. This vaccine is USDA
approved but can not be bought by individuals but rather by state officials.
