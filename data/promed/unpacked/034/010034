Wildlife officials have determined that a sick female Hawaiian monk seal, Pohaku, under its care is suffering from toxoplasmosis. Following test results, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) officials determined that Pohaku is suffering from the parasitic infection often spread into the environment via feral cat feces. "Despite aggressive treatment, she is very lethargic, a sign that the infection is causing pain and severe inflammation throughout her internal organs," said NOAA in the latest update on its website.

Officials picked up Pohaku from Ko Olina and brought her to NOAA's headquarters on 22 Jan [2020] for monitoring after reports that she was "logging", or lethargically floating on the water, a sign of possible illness.

"Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by infection with _Toxoplasma gondii_, a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats and spreads oocysts (a kind of egg) into the environment via cat feces," said NOAA officials in the post. "Feral cats, of which there are an estimated 50 000 to 300 000 on the island of Oahu alone, are the primary source of _T. gondii_ oocysts in Hawaii." Hawaiian monk seals are exposed to these oocysts when they consume contaminated prey or water.

The parasite destroys vital tissues, such as muscle, liver, heart, and brain tissues, officials said, which can lead to organ failure. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine for toxoplasmosis, and treatment options for infected seals are extremely limited.

So far, Pohaku has done better than most monk seals with toxoplasmosis, who are often found dead without warning. Two seals that were rescued prior to death succumbed to the disease within 48 hours. "However, we are very guarded in our optimism," NOAA officials said. "Pohaku's prognosis is still poor given the aggressive nature of this disease and [her] lethargic condition in intensive care."

To date, 11 Hawaiian monk seals are known to have died as a direct result of toxoplasmosis, but the number is likely to be higher due to unreported cases. Toxoplasmosis also affects other marine animals, including spinner dolphins, and native birds, including alala, or Hawaiian crows.

NOAA officials say the public can help reduce the transmission of toxoplasmosis by keeping pet cats indoors and making them indoor cats.

[Toxoplasma is a significant cause of mortality in another marine mammal, the threatened southern sea otter. As wild and domestic felids are the only recognized hosts capable of shedding toxoplasma oocysts into the environment, infection of sea mammals suggests land-to-sea pathogen transmission.

The Hawaiian monk seal, _Neomonachus schauinslandi_, is an endangered species of earless seal in the family Phocidae that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. The seals nearly disappeared from the main Hawaiian Islands, but the population has begun to recover. The growing population there was approximately 150 as of 2004 and 300 as of 2016. Toxoplasmosis can become an important obstacle to achieve recovery. Infection by _Toxoplasma gondii_ was 1st reported in this species in 2004 (J Parasitol. 2005; 91: 695-697).
