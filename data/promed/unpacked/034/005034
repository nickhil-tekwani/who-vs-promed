Dengue fever in Petaling Jaya is under control and efforts are being
intensified by the Ministry of Health and the Petaling Jaya Municipal
Council (MPPJ) to prevent the spread of the disease. A ministry spokesman
said confirmed dengue cases this year had dropped drastically compared to
last year.
In 1997 about 1,000 dengue cases were reported to have occurred during the
rainy season in August. However, this year the situation was under control
because of the daily efforts on the part of health authorities. Additional
precautions are being taken at the Commonwealth Games venues and the
surroundings to eradicate sites that are considered 'ideal breeding
grounds" for the _Aedes_ mosquito [which _Aedes_ species? - Mod.CHC. A
government spokesperson is quoted as saying that daily checks [of water
containers and [insecticide fogging have been successful in keeping the
dengue outbreak under control despite continuous rains in the past week.
The spokesperson added that public education through pamphlets, flyers and
talks in schools have been successful. A spokesman at the vector unit for
the council said an increase in dengue cases was expected during the La
Nina phenomenon during which heavy rains are expected for several months.
