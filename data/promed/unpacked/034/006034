PPR [peste des petits ruminants] in Bulgaria is very worrying. The moderator's comment about looking for PPR circulation in Turkish Thrace is valid. PPR has occurred in the past in Turkish Thrace. Small ruminants are (or were up to 2014 to my knowledge) vaccinated against PPR in Turkish Thrace and in the past serosurveillance for circulation of PPRV has been suggested by using samples taken from cattle for FMD surveillance, but I do not know if this was done nor would it perhaps be sensitive enough to detect PPRV circulation in a vaccinated SR [small ruminant] population. A more specific design would be needed and I do not know if this has been done. A design was suggested for this in 2014 via EUFMD [European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease].

It is also possible that a goat was brought from Turkey by a less obvious route such as a boat returning from Turkey to Bulgaria. That is a route which has been suggested in outbreaks of other diseases in Bulgaria, such as FMD where no definite route of entry from Turkey was found.

[PPR vaccination of sheep and goats has been discontinued in Thrace since the beginning of 2017, following the absence of new cases in Thrace since (including) 2014. This was decided by the Turkish authorities wishing to obtain from the OIE the status of "PPR free zone" for Thrace according to the provisions of Chapter 14.7. of OIE's Terrestrial Code (see http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_ppr.htm). This allows serological surveillance in young animals which have lost their maternal immunity.

For a list of OIE's PPR-free countries, including one country of which a PPR-free zone was recognised (Namibia), see
http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/peste-des-petits-ruminants/list-of-member-countries-free-from-ppr/.

Turkey published specific regulations to safeguard the health of animals introduced into non-vaccinated Thrace from other, potentially PPR-infected parts of Turkey. See https://tinyurl.com/y7fjt3aw (website of Batman Directorate of Provincial Food Agriculture and Livestock, Republic of Turkey Ministry of Food Agriculture and Livestock, Ankara; in Turkish).

The history of PPR in Turkey was reviewed in a paper addressing the threat of PPR entering Europe (ref 1). According to the authors,
"In Thrace, PPRV infection was reported in Istanbul for the 1st time in 2000 and Istanbul was followed by Edirne (on the border with Greece) in 2004 and K覺rklareli (on the border with Bulgaria) in 2006. Since then, outbreaks have been reported annually in K覺rklareli except during 2009 and 2014.

There were a total of 12 outbreaks recorded in the Thrace region during 2011 and 3 during 2012. During 2013 only one outbreak was reported in K覺rklareli in the Thrace region."

The distance between K覺rklareli and Bolyarovo is 60 km (about 37 mi; map at https://goo.gl/maps/wCkWGWNS6g42).
