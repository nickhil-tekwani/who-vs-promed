JJ Fuds in Valparaiso, Indiana is recalling a select lot and product of JJ Fuds Chicken Tender Chunks Pet Food (A BARD or biologically appropriate raw diet) because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, _Listeria_ infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. Animals ill with _Listeria_ will display signs similar to the symptoms listed above for humans. People who have concerns about whether their pet has _Listeria_ should contact their veterinarian.

The recalled product was distributed regionally in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois to wholesale and retail customers. The product can be identified by the batch ID code (manufactured date) and UPC code printed on the back of the individual plastic bag or on the master case label. It is a frozen raw poultry product (see Safe Handling Instructions on package) and has a shelf life of 1 year if kept frozen.

The recalled product is as follows:
JJ Fuds Premium Natural Blends, Chicken Tender Chunks
All 5 lb bags with:
Product UPC Number: 654592-345935
Manufacture/Lot Code Date: 5/5/14

The recall was a result of a routine sampling program by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development resulting in a positive test for _Listeria monocytogenes_. The company has not received any reports of dogs experiencing nausea and diarrhea that may be associated with these specific products. The company has received no reports of human illness as a result of these products.

JJ Fuds, Inc will immediately start working with distributors and retailers to properly dispose of any affected product left on freezer shelves. The company will also be working with distributors and retailers to recall this product from pet owners to ensure the proper disposal of any affected product that has been purchased.

[Interesting, while this is a raw meat product, the company speaks of working with distributors and retailers but what about correcting the situation within the plant that allowed for this contamination to occur? Surely the quality managers are trying to solve why it happened and how to prevent it from happening again.

We sincerely hope that no human beings or pets become ill from this food. - Mod.TG

Toddlers will pick up and eat pet food out of dishes on the floor. Homeless people have been known to eat canned pet food, but are likely to find
frozen chicken packaged for human consumption a better deal per pound than a 30 pound bag for pets -- quite apart from not having a freezer to store it in. - Mod.JW.
