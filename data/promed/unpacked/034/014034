An outbreak of an unknown respiratory illness has left dozens of dogs
sick in the Durango area and veterinarians expect more dogs will
become infected.

Riverview Animal Hospital veterinarian Stacee Santi said the mystery
virus is infecting dogs throughout the area. The animal hospital she
works at has seen 40 cases in the past few weeks. She said each dog is
coughing, wheezing, and at times is left gasping for air.

"It's getting bad quick," Santi said. "These animals are acting sick,
they don't want to eat, they don't want to play, and they have a very
bad deep cough."

The 1st case was reported in February [2011]. Santi said since then
the number of sick dogs in the city has skyrocketed. "In the whole
community there have probably been at least 100 cases" Santi said.

The sick dogs are put on 2 powerful antibiotics for 2 weeks. Santi
said it appears to be helping. However, she said for some the virus
has proven to be too strong. "We've had to hospitalize a few of those
for intensive treatment," Santi said. "It's been life threatening for
some."

Santi said she typically sees around 1 or 2 cases of dogs suffering
from pneumonia in a year. However, her animal hospital has already
seen 8 cases in the past few weeks. She said there have been more than
20 cases throughout the city.

"When the lungs become so infected they can't breathe well and we
have to support with oxygen, IV fluids," Santi said.

Santi said what worries her most is they don't know what's causing
the outbreak. So for the past few weeks, veterinarians in the Durango
area have been collecting swabs from the infected dogs' throats and
eyelids and sending the samples to specialists.

It's something Santi said she has never had to do in her 15 years of
practice. Until Durango veterinarians get this outbreak under control
they are being extra careful about what doges they send out of town
for specialized treatments.

this would have already been diagnosed if that there were the case.
