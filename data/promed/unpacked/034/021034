BSE/SCRAPIE LABORATORY TEST: COLLABORATORS SOUGHT
*************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Sun, 25 Jan 1998 10:07:26 -0400
From: Paul Eduard Schenker <pesch@ibm.net> (by way of Dorothy Preslar
<dpreslar@fas.org>)

Prionics is a small R&D oriented biotech company which has developed a
reliable and sensitive BSE/Scrapie post-mortem test and which is
developing a live test as well.
As board member I am looking to establish contact with local laboratories
or companies also in less developed countries to establish local know-how
in BSE and scrapie testing. Would you know of people who could guide us to
interested local partners?
