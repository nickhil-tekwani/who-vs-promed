The dog days of summer poses a new threat for cats in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota]: experts are seeing a spike in a rare disease typically contracted by cats that hunt.

According to veterinarians at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center, they've treated 8 confirmed or suspected cases of tularemia. Officials typically see only a few cases each year. "5 of those cats did not make it and 3 did, including one that we treated here," said Dr Jennifer Granick, who works in the Small Animal Internal Medicine Department at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center.

Granick said the disease is caused by a bacterial infection often carried by rabbits, which means hunting cats are at the greatest risk of catching the disease. But ticks and flies can also transmit the disease through bites.

Granick notes pet owners should look out for the classic signs, including high fevers and disinterest in eating. If caught early enough, the disease can be cured with a combination of antibiotics.

As for dogs and people, both can also contract the disease. However, dogs rarely show signs of the disease, and only a couple people are diagnosed with the disease every year. Experts recommend people beware any signs of the disease in their cats and get medical attention if they see those signs in themselves.

Final recommendation from experts: try to keep your cats indoors. But veterinarians also recognize that's not possible for all cats. Given that, they encourage owners to monitor their cats' outdoor activity -- to try to curb hunting -- and also use flea and tick preventions.

[Tularemia (caused by a bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_) is a rare but potentially fatal disease that occurs in wild and domestic animals. Rabbits and wild rodents are the primary species affected (hence the nickname) but other species, including humans, can also contract the disease.

Dogs do become infected with the causative organism, but it appears that resulting illness, if it occurs, does not produce clinical signs or is mild. On the other hand, domestic cats are very susceptible to tularemia and have been known to transmit the bacteria to humans. It's also important to note that cats don't need to be clinically sick in order to transmit the disease.

The bacterium that causes tularemia can be found in the organs or body fluids of infected animals. Once in the environment, the organisms can survive for weeks to months in the soil, vegetation, or water and then serve as a source of infection for other animals or humans. Animals typically get tularemia by ingesting contaminated food (raw meat from infected animals) or by drinking contaminated water. They can also inhale the aerosolized bacteria, have it enter their bodies through mucus membranes or breaks/cuts in skin, or become infected by biting flies or ticks.

Clinical signs in cats
----------------------
The signs of a tularemia infection can vary remarkably; they range from no signs at all, to mild fever and enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) to death. When they're sick, cats may also be anorexic, dehydrated, or listless with ulcers, abscesses, jaundice, pneumonia, and/or enlargement of their livers or spleens. Outdoor cats may be particularly good at not showing clinical signs until the disease is quite advanced.

Diagnosis and treatment
-----------------------
If your veterinarian is suspicious your cat might have tularemia, then special serologic blood tests looking for antibodies against the bacteria are likely to be run. Unfortunately, because it takes time for your cat's immune system to mount a detectable response, these tests may not be diagnostic during the 1st few weeks of illness. A definitive diagnosis can also be made if the organism can be cultured from tissue specimens on special culture media.

Once infection with tularemia is diagnosed or suspected, antibiotics are usually effective in treating the illness -- especially when given early in the disease. Recovery from the infection does produce long-lasting immunity.

Efforts are underway to develop safe and effective vaccines for pets and people.

Prevention of tularemia
-----------------------
The only way to completely protect your cat from infection is to keep your animal free of ticks and other biting insects. Also, keep your animal indoors away from the opportunity to hunt or to encounter the organism in the environment. It is important, however, to remember that you are also at risk. The most common source of infection for people is the bite of an infected tick, so take care when gardening, clearing weeds/brush, or even mowing lawns.
