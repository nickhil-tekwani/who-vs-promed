A 37-year-old builder in Singaraja, North Bali, died on Friday, 3 Jan 2014, from rabies linked to a bite he suffered on 17 Dec 2013. The deceased worked as a farmer and builder who died at the Buleleng General Hospital. The man's brother-in-law told Nusa Balithat the dog bite came from a 3-month-old dog that [the victim] engaged in play at a construction site that resulted in a bite to the man's thumb. The man thought nothing of the wound, continued his work and never sought anti-rabies vaccine. The dog soon disappeared from the project site, giving no clue that the animal was suffering from the deadly virus.

Initial symptoms of joint pain and fever sent the builder to a local masseur who, alarmed at the man's declining health, recommended he see a doctor. The victim sought medical help at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 Jan 2014, when he was immediately hospitalized for 2 days prior to his death at 2:00 p.m. on the following Friday [3 Jan 2014]. His wife survives the man together with 2 children aged 6 and 1.5 years. Had [the victim] sought medical treatment for the bite, including VAR anti-rabies shots, he would most probably have survived the illness.

[This unfortunate death is probably one consequence of the Bali administration prematurely claiming the abolition of the disease from the island. Travellers and inhabitants should be made aware that canine rabies has been diminished but not eradicated, and take precautions accordingly. - Mod.CP
