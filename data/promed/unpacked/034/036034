The End of the Trail for Smallpox?
In June 1999, the world's last remaining [declared] stocks of variola
[smallpox] virus, held for the World Health Organization at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [Atlanta, Georgia, USA] and in Novosibirsk,
Russia, are slated for the autoclave. There they will be pressure-cooked
for a half-hour longer than the 15 minutes needed to destroy them.
Smallpox was eradicated from the wild in 1980. But in a series of recent
articles and interviews, Dr. Ken Alibek, a former Soviet biowarfare expert
who defected in 1992, discloses what U.S. intelligence has long known:
Destruction of the virus may not be so easy. The Soviet biowarfare
apparatus considered smallpox their No. 1 strategic weapon. They
aerosolized it, weaponized it, grew it by the ton. Despite Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin's 1992 declaration that he would shut down the
Russian biological warfare program, ambitious, double-edged research with
smallpox continues today [Alibek alleges].
Two [US] intelligence officers independently confirmed that the Russians
have not kept the virus to themselves. In defiance of the Biological and
Toxin Weapons Convention, which the Soviets signed in 1972, stocks of
variola [smallpox] virus have been passed to North Korea and, perhaps, to
other states as well.
There are powerful medical and scientific reasons for keeping the virus.
Nobel laureate Dr. Joshua Lederberg of Rockefeller University and Dr. Alan
P. Zelicoff of Sandia National Laboratories [both in the USA] insist that
the live virus has a great deal to teach us about the workings of the human
immune system, which it can outmaneuver in singular ways. Merely knowing
the sequence of viral genes cannot teach us how the virus operates in the
human body, or why it appears to have incorporated genes from our immune
system into its genetic makeup.
A U.S. researcher who visited the Biopreparat laboratory at Novosibirsk in
Siberia in the mid-1980s learned that scientists there were working with
the virus. A later observer, Dr. Frank J. Malinoski, places smallpox at
Novosibirsk by 1991. But the World Health Organization did not grant Russia
permission to move the stocks from Moscow until 1994.
Moreover, Alibek says the Soviet weaponization of smallpox long predated
its arrival in Novosibirsk. Researchers at a secret military laboratory,
known as Sergiyev Posad in Zagorsk, began weaponizing smallpox in the 1960s
and continued at least through the '80s. This means the supply of virus has
never been contained in Russia.
Dr. Lev S. Sandakchiev (who once ran the Soviet viral biowarfare program at
Novosibirsk) and his colleague Sergei N. Shchelkunov, in particular, tried
to ferret out the "virulence factors" from the smallpox virus, to determine
why the human vaccine virus, vaccinia, gives you a little pustule and 10
years of\immunity, while smallpox kills you or disfigures you for life.
This isn't necessarily malignant -- such research can teach us a great
deal about human immune function. But other work is less ambiguous. A
senior U.S. government analyst reports that ... based on eyewitness
accounts, Russians have produced, weaponized and tested on prisoners
vaccine-resistant strains.
Alibek's recent revelations on smallpox are no surprise to the
intelligence community, which has known about smallpox weaponization
before the destruction debates began in 1993. The mystery is why the public
has been led to believe that something that's been weaponized, proliferated
and cultivated can be wiped out by decision, edict or ceremonial burning.
An official [US] government decision, set for April 30, was postponed until
the National Academy of Sciences holds a symposium on destruction, probably
in the fall.
