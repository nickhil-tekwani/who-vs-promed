Farm infected with foot-and-mouth
-----------------
Cattle at a farm in Surrey have been found to be
infected with foot-and-mouth disease.
Some 60 animals on the farm near Guildford have
tested positive for the disease which wreaked havoc in 2001.
A 3km protection zone has been put in place
around the premises and a UK ban imposed on movement of all livestock.
Gordon Brown has cancelled his holiday in Dorset
and taken part in a meeting of the government's
Cobra emergency committee by telephone about the issue.
Very few human cases of foot-and-mouth disease
have ever been recorded. The last human case
reported in the UK occurred in 1966.
In accordance with legislation, all cattle on the
Surrey premises will be culled, said a government spokesman.
The farm has been under restrictions since late
on Thursday [2 Aug 2007] when symptoms were reported.
Debby Reynolds, UK Chief Veterinary Officer,
confirmed the outbreak after samples were taken from the farm.
She said: "We are trying to form a picture of
where the infection may have come from but at the
moment it's very early stages."
Gordon Brown is returning to London on Saturday
and Environment Secretary Hilary Benn is to break
off from his holiday in Italy.
Ms Reynolds advised farmers across the UK to
examine their animals carefully and immediately report anything suspicious.
As well as the 3km protection zone, there is also
a 10km surveillance zone where nearby animals are monitored.
National Farmers' Union President Peter Kendall
said: "This is a matter of grave concern. We have
an industry still depressed from low prices.

"We have to ensure this is a small isolated
incident. We are working with the government to
ensure the right steps are taken."
Tim Bonner, from the Countryside Alliance, said:
"Even the words 'foot-and-mouth' will send a
chill through the spine of every farmer in the country.
"We hope for a better response this time from the
government - the last time it was chaos."

Foot and mouth outbreak confirmed
----------------------
Cattle in southern England have been found to be
infected with foot and mouth [disease ](FMD).
A spokesman for Defra said animals on a farm near
Guildford in Surrey had tested positive for the disease.
He said: "Following an investigation of suspected
vesicular disease by Animal Health on a holding
near Guildford in Surrey, laboratory results have
indicated that the foot and mouth disease virus
is present in samples from cattle on the premises."
The spokesman said: "On the basis of initial
laboratory results, Debby Reynolds, UK Chief
Veterinary Officer, has confirmed foot and mouth disease."
In accordance with the legislation, all the
cattle on the premises will be culled, he said.
A protection zone, 3 kilometres in radius, and a
surveillance zone of 10 kilometres has been placed around the premises.
A national movement ban of all ruminants and pigs has been imposed, Defra said.
A meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency
contingencies committee has been held to discuss
the outbreak, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown
taking part by telephone from his holiday in Dorset.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr. Brown will
return on Saturday [4 Aug 2007] in order to chair
another Cobra meeting at the Cabinet Office in the morning.
"Our top priority is to prevent the spread of
this disease in order to protect farmers' stock," said the spokeswoman.

[It is most unfortunate that the disease was
confirmed. Certainly they will be on the look out
for other affected populations and hopefully will
contain the spread of the disease quite quickly - Mod.TG]
[My memory is poor on the actual year, but back
in the early 1960s there was an escape of foot &
mouth disease virus (FMDV) from the Pirbright
Institute for Animal Health (IAH) which afflicted
some dairy cows at the other end of Pirbright
Common, a fair distance away from the institute.
They were certainly not next to the institute.
This outbreak is some 5-6 kms due south of the
IAH. Obviously the Defra vets on the ground will
be actively investigating any and all possible
sources. It should be noted that Surrey is not a
major livestock area and pigs are not, at this
time, reported as affected. Cows do not normally
have access to kitchen waste. - Mod MHJ]
