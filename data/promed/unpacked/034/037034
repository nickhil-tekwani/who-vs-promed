Fujairah dispels fears of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak in United
Arab Emirates (UAE)
---------------------------------------------
The 300 sheep at Sakumkum died earlier this week of a disease that is
common in the UAE. Mohammed Rashid Al Yamahi, Head of the Public Health and
Environment Department at Fujairah, said yesterday that fears the sheep
might have been victims of FMD were unfounded.
People in Fujairah should not panic, he said. "Our vets at the Fujairah
Municipality's Abbattoir have assured us the disease of which the Sakumkum
sheep died is not related to any other sheep disease, such as FMD, or viral
hemorrhagic fever, or Rift Valley fever, although some of the signs are the
same in all these diseases," said Al Yamahi. "This disease is very common
among sheep in the UAE and it is not infectious or contagious to man. The
sheep that died in Sakumkum suffered from acute diarrhea, which is common
at this time of the year, because they are not cared for properly by their
owners. They might also have died because of the polluted grass they ate in
the area, or the fodder which might have been bad," said Al Yamahi.
He pointed out all farm animals in the emirate were periodically examined
by the vets working either for the Fujairah Municipality, or for the
Eastern Agricultural Zone.
"We urge people, particularly Muslims who have sheep slaughtered during Eid
Al Adha as a religious ritual, not to buy sheep from unknown sources but to
buy from the local livestock market located beside the Fujairah
slaughterhouse. The animals there will be 100 percent safe and free of any
disease."
He said most of the sheep sold in the local livestock market in Fujairah
come from Australia and the municipal vets examine imported animals
periodically.
"We spray any ship coming from abroad and carrying sheep with insecticides
before the vessel docks, especially if the shipment was coming from one of
the countries which had sheep previously infected with one of the deadly
animal diseases. We do the same spraying of sheep coming by plane while
they are still on the airport runway," Al Yemahi said. The municipal vets
have been given strict orders to intensify their veterinary examinations of
the sheep and cows at the Fujairah livestock market in the time up to the
Eid Al Adha holiday.
"We examine the sheep before and after slaughtering at the Fujairah
Abattoir to ensure the sheep and the meat do not have any diseases, but are
suitable for human consumption," Al Yemahi said.
The Fujairah Abattoir is expected to slaughter between 500 and 600 sheep
each day during the Eid holidays. Al Yemahi urged Fujairah residents not to
have their sheep slaughtered by butchers outside the Fujairah
slaughterhouse to ensure hygienic standards were met and the meat was fit
for human consumption.

[Acute diarrhea may be the early signs of a number of diseases. It would be
nice to know what lesions the sheep had, or indeed, was a necropsy done and
what tests were performed. - Mod.TG
