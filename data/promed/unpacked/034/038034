The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India, displacing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and other pre-existing lineages. Mathematical modelling indicates that the growth advantage is most likely explained by a combination of increased transmissibility and immune evasion. Indeed in vitro, the delta variant is less sensitive to neutralising antibodies in sera from recovered individuals, with higher replication efficiency as compared to the Alpha variant. In an analysis of vaccine breakthrough in over 100 healthcare workers across 3 centres in India, the Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-delta infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generates greater transmission between HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (p=0.02). In vitro, the Delta variant shows approximately an 8 fold reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant were significantly lower in participants vaccinated with ChadOx-1 as compared to BNT162b2 (GMT 3372 versus 654, p under 0001). These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that the dominance of the Delta variant in India has been most likely driven by a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected individuals and increased virus infectivity. Whilst severe disease in fully vaccinated HCW was rare, breakthrough transmission clusters in hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate that infection control measures need continue in the post-vaccination era.

Discussion
----------
Here we have combined modelling, molecular epidemiology and in vitro experimentation to propose that increased replication fitness and reduced sensitivity of B.1.617.2 Delta Variant to neutralising antibodies from past infection contributed to the devastating epidemic wave in India during the first quarter of 2021, where background infection to the Wuhan-1 D614G in 2020 was between 20-50% (19) .

The modelling results relate to a population for which the vast majority of immunity has arisen from prior infection rather than vaccination. Previous work has shown differences in the breadth and quality of immunity elicited by natural infection compared to immunity (6), and so the degree to which these results generalise to vaccine-derived immunity is likely limited.

Consistent with immune evasion by the Delta Variant, we also show significant numbers of vaccine breakthrough infections in health care workers at 3 Delhi hospitals, most of whom were fully vaccinated.

Our work also shows that that the Delta variant virus had a fitness advantage compared to the Alpha variant in a validated 3D respiratory organoid system.

The B.1.617.2 Delta variant appears more transmissible than B.1.1.7 in the UK based on recent data and the dominance of new infections by this variant. In the absence of published data on transmissibility of the Delta variant we predict that this variant will have a transmission advantage relative to Wuhan-1 with D614G in individuals with pre-existing immunity from vaccines/natural infection as well as in settings where there is low vaccine coverage and low prior exposure.

At population scale, extensive vaccination will likely protect against moderate to severe disease and will reduce transmission of the Delta variant. However, vaccine breakthrough clusters amongst HCW is of concern given that hospitals frequently treat individuals who may have suboptimal immune responses to vaccination due to comorbidity. Such patients could be at risk for severe disease following infection from HCW or other staff within hospital environments. Therefore, strategies to boost vaccine responses against variants are warranted in HCW and attention to infection control procedures should be continued even in the post vaccine era.

[2] Olympics
Date: Sun 4 July 2021

Ensuring 11 000 athletes from more than 200 countries descend on one chosen city over the course of 16 days is a logistical challenge at the best of times. Now consider doing it at the tail end of a global pandemic that's upended airlines' flight schedules, closed international borders and made any movement without jabs and multiple COVID tests impossible.

For hundreds of Olympic organizing officials eyeing the start of the Tokyo Games in just 18 days it's a major headache. Forget about medal tallies and post-race parties (to the limited extent they're permitted at all), just getting to Japan on time is half the battle.

"Travel is definitely a major challenge," said Lorraine Mar, head of the Fiji Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee. "Fiji Airways isn't doing any commercial flights at the current time so we're going up on a cargo run." Mar said Fiji was trying to coordinate with other South Pacific nations to "do a milk run around the other islands to collect everyone, but it wasn't commercially viable."

Other teams are finding they have to travel thousands of miles in the wrong direction before making their way to Japan. Under normal circumstances, the Sri Lankan team would have taken a flight to Singapore and from there onto Tokyo. But with COVID cases still averaging almost 2000 a day, Sri Lanka, an island to the south of India, is on many countries' banned lists. Singapore doesn't allow anyone with a recent travel history to even transit through the city-state.

As a result, the 10-strong team across disciplines including badminton, judo and archery, is booked on Qatar Airways via Doha, according to National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka President Suresh Subramaniam. They've got a back-up flight on SriLankan Airlines in case the situation changes. "I hope and pray nobody falls ill once we go to Japan," Subramaniam said. "We've got an extra doctor flying with us this time to look after any COVID issues. We're taking every precaution."

Although most athletes have been fully vaccinated and Games organizers require negative COVID tests prior to arrival, there have already been some upsets. A member of Uganda's Olympic squad tested positive in Japan last month [June 2021], despite having been inoculated earlier.

Even the fastest woman alive can't avoid all the logistical hurdles along the road to this year's extraordinary Olympics, which will be held with no international spectators and strict social-distancing measures that include rules around how many hours after their race athletes must leave the Village. Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the odds-on favorite for the women's 100 meters [109 yards], faces a labyrinth of connecting flights, layovers and paperwork just to get to Tokyo. "I have a Jamaican passport so it's even more difficult for me to travel," the 2-time Olympic champion said. For the 34-old-sprinter, the trip is a more than 8000 mile [12 875 km] journey. Fraser-Pryce anticipates she will travel from her home in Kingston to Miami, then on to London to catch a connecting flight bound for Tokyo. Because the pandemic has elevated fares, the cheapest flight from Kingston to Tokyo on economy runs to nearly USD 5000 on Expedia.com.

The Brazilian delegation, meanwhile -- a large group of almost 300 athletes competing in events from fencing to skateboarding, shooting, swimming and gymnastics - had to scramble to get flights on Deutsche Lufthansa AG after its original carrier Air Canada canceled flights that would have taken the team via Toronto. "Due to the pandemic, we had to make some necessary changes that demanded creativity," Brazilian Olympic Committee President Paulo Wanderley Teixeira said, adding that even getting the sporting equipment to Tokyo has been a "true war operation."

Another particular logistics problem of holding the Games during a pandemic has been that many athletes haven't been able to train in locations they would have normally otherwise. Difficulty traveling internationally has also made getting to the necessary qualifying events extremely tricky. Jamaica's track team would typically have trained and competed in Europe for a few weeks before the Games. An earlier plan to train in Tottori, about 400 miles [approx. 633 km] west of Tokyo, was also scrapped, according to Fraser-Pryce. That means she'll get less time to work out the passing of the baton to other teammates in the relay.

Argentine sailor Santiago Lange, who won gold at Rio in 2016, is one of the luckier ones, having escaped South America to Sicily in Italy, where the wind and weather conditions are similar to Japan. He and his crew mate Cecilia Carranza Saroli are now in Barcelona, waiting for their flight to Tokyo later this week.

"We normally have at least 90 days to get to know the conditions, and now we'll have only 8. Those 8 days for our particular sport are not enough," said Lange, who wasn't able to sail in Argentina for several months due to COVID restrictions last year [2020]. In the pair's rented house in Sicily, they put up pictures of Mount Fuji to stay mentally connected. "In normal circumstances, we'd compete in at least 10 competitions a year. We did only 2 last year [2020]," he said.

And of course, as athletes in far-flung places that aren't international hubs check their luggage and boarding passes one last time, the virus that has laid waste to so many lives, hopes and dreams is never far from their thoughts.

"We usually think of the race," said Selemon Barega, an Ethiopian long-distance runner who competes primarily in the 5000 meters. "But now the fear of the virus is also running in our minds."

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp2108567 [abridged, edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2108567#article_citing_articles

"In late July [2021], approximately 11 000 athletes and 4000 athletic-support staff from more than 200 countries will gather for more than 2 weeks of competition at the Tokyo Olympics. One month later, another 5000 athletes and additional staff will attend the Paralympics. According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tokyo 2020 playbooks (1), which are intended to protect both participants and the people of Japan from SARS-CoV-2 infection, Olympic athletes are instructed to supply their own face coverings, are encouraged (but not required) to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and will undergo testing at unspecified intervals after they arrive in Japan.

When the IOC postponed the Tokyo Olympics in March 2020, Japan had 865 active cases of COVID-19 against a global backdrop of 385 000 active cases. It was assumed that the pandemic would be controlled in 2021 or that vaccination would be widespread by then. Fourteen months later, Japan is in a state of emergency, with 70 000 active cases. Globally, there are 19 million active cases. Variants of concern, which may be more transmissible and more virulent than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, are circulating widely. Vaccines are available in some countries, but less than 5% of Japan's population is vaccinated, the lowest rate among all Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries.

Pfizer and BioNTech have offered to donate vaccines for all Olympic athletes, but this offer does not ensure that all athletes will receive vaccines before the Olympics, since vaccine authorization and availability are lacking in more than 100 countries. Moreover, some athletes may choose not to be vaccinated because of worries about the effects of vaccination on their performance or ethical concerns about being prioritized ahead of health care workers and vulnerable people. Although several countries have vaccinated their athletes, adolescents between 15 and 17 years of age cannot be vaccinated in most countries, and children younger than 15 can be vaccinated in even fewer countries. As a result, few teenage athletes, including gymnasts, swimmers, and divers as young as 12, will be vaccinated. In the absence of regular testing, participants may become infected during the Olympics and pose a risk when they return home to more than 200 countries.

We believe the IOC's determination to proceed with the Olympic Games is not informed by the best scientific evidence.

We recommend that the WHO immediately convene an emergency committee that includes experts in occupational safety and health, building and ventilation engineering, and infectious-disease epidemiology, as well as athlete representatives, to consider these factors and advise on a risk-management approach for the Tokyo Olympics (see table in publication). There is precedent for such an approach: the WHO convened an emergency committee to provide guidance ahead of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil during the Zika virus Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016. (5)

A global health security strategy relies on understanding the interconnectedness among countries. If our experience facing COVID-19 represents a moment of truth, it also provides an unrivaled opportunity for the realization of human values and collective human interests -- the world's new contract -- and for preparing to defeat future threats. With less than 2 months until the Olympic torch is lit, canceling the Games may be the safest option. But the Olympic Games are one of the few events that could connect us at a time of global disconnect. The Olympic spirit is unparalleled in its power to inspire and mobilize. We rally around the torch because we recognize the value of the things that connect us over the value of the things that separate us. For us to connect safely, we believe urgent action is needed for these Olympic Games to proceed.

Cuba's Ministry of Health has reported 3475 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the highest daily rate for the republic since the start of the pandemic. In total, 200 728 cases have been registered in the country, according to the data published on [Sat 3 Jul 2021] on the department's website.

On [Fri 2 Jul 2021], 3308 cases were recorded. According to the ministry, 15 people have died in Cuba in 24 hours from the complications of coronavirus, with a total of 1337 deaths registered in the country. The majority of cases over the day were reported in the province of Matanzas, east of Havana.

The first 3 coronavirus cases were recorded in Cuba on [12 Mar 2020]. The country's authorities plan to conduct a full vaccination of the population this year [2021]. At the moment, 1.25 million out of 11 million country's citizens have undergone a full course of vaccination with local vaccines Abdala and Soberana 02.

[The Abdala vaccine, which has passed all 3 phases of human trials, has yet to undergo clinical trials in any other country, Cuban Minister of Public Health Jose Angel Portal Miranda said last month (June 2021). The vaccine requires 3 shots, spaced 14 days apart. It could be stored at between 2-8 deg C (35 to 46 deg F), he added.

Initial trial results showed the vaccine is effective against certain coronavirus variants (Beta and Gamma), safe to use, and immunogenic.

Soberana 02, entered phase III trials in people in March (2021). The jab is a 'conjugate' vaccine, one that links a weaker antigen with a stronger one to ensure a vigorous immune response. To make Soberana 02, Finlay scientists coupled fragments of the coronavirus spike protein to a deactivated form of tetanus toxin, a powerful antigen that can boost production of immune cells and antibodies.

A total of 2 doses of Soberana 02 generated an antibody response in about 80% of vaccinated people. But applying a 3rd, booster dose of Soberana Plus raised that percentage to 100%, all of them with neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus from entering cells.

[In the past 24 hours, 8 countries including India (40 387), Brazil (27 783), Indonesia (27 233), Colombia (26 265), Russia (25 142), UK (24 170), South Africa (16 585), and Iran (13 781), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6164 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 2 Jul 2021 to late 3 Jul 2021). A total of 44 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 18 of the 44 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 3.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.2 %. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 10.1 % increase in daily reported cases and 17.2 % decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 300 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 184.56 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.99 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA
