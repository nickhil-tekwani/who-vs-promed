As of 24 May 2000, Louisiana has four confirmed cases of eastern equine
encephalitis in horses. The earliest onset, on 19 March, was in a horse in
Vernon parish, in the west-central part of the state. The other three
horses, with onsets ranging from 25 Apr 2000 to 11 May 2000, lived in
Tangipahoa, Livingston and East Baton Rouge parishes, in the southern part
of the state, north of Lake Ponchartrain. One horse had last been
vaccinated one year ago, one had never been vaccinated, and two were
vaccinated two to three days prior to onset. Cases were confirmed by either
IFA or plaque reduction assay.
