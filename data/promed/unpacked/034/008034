Toxins from one particular strain of toxic algae, Cylindrospermopsis, have
been linked to the deaths of about 380 adult Lake Griffin alligators. The
algae were discovered 3 years ago in the lake, about the same time the
gators [alligators] started dying mysteriously.
The Lake County Water Authority hopes to know by October whether algae in
the Harris Chain of Lakes are producing dangerous toxins and whether the
problem is widespread. While officials have known since 1998 that toxic
algae are present in Lake Griffin, they have never regularly monitored or
done extensive testing. Now, the authority has commissioned a landmark
study to monitor toxic algae and the toxins they produce in the 5 lakes of
the chain -- Dora, Eustis, Harris, Little Lake Harris and Griffin.
Cylindrospermopsis, Microcystis and other strains of toxic alga have been
linked to animal deaths and human health problem worldwide. The algae
produce a wide variety of toxins that can destroy the liver, affect
breathing, attack the nervous system, and cause cancer, in addition to
milder health effects such as diarrhea, skin rashes, and eye irritation.
The World Health Organization has guidelines for exposure to toxic algae in
both recreational and drinking water, but neither the United States nor
Florida has adopted standards on toxic algae. Perry said if the study finds
toxins in the water, the next step would be to have health officials
determine the toxins' effects on human health and set limits on exposure or
establish alert levels for swimmers and boaters.
"We know there are algae cells in the lakes, but we don't know if they are
producing toxins or to what level," said water authority Director Mike
Perry. "Right now researchers are assuming there are toxins, but no one is
sure.
Florida Department of Health officials say they have no documented cases of
people being harmed by algal toxins in this state. Around the world, a
growing number of countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa,
China, and Germany have toxic algae monitoring programs. Some, such as
Australia and Brazil, have adopted the World Health Organization's limits
on toxic algae exposure.
