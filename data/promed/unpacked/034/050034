Monsoon fuels diarrhea in Nepal, 80 dead
---------------------------------------------
The onset of the monsoon in Nepal has triggered an outbreak of acute
diarrheal diseases (ADD) that have killed over 80 people, and infected 10
000, in remote rural areas with meager medical facilities. Since telephone
connections with most of the 24 affected districts have been disrupted,
following the destruction of communication infrastructure and health posts
by Maoist guerrillas, ministry of health officials fear the death toll from
ADDs could be higher.
Dr. Mahendra Bahadur Bista, the director of the epidemiology and disease
control division of the ministry, says that "compared to the previous 2
years, the situation now is alarming." He feels an early monsoon, and the
lack of safe drinking water, is fueling the spread of the disease. Since 40
percent of Nepal's population lacks access to drinking water, and over 70
percent does not have safe drinking water, the rainy season is usually
accompanied by an outbreak of diarrhea. Even Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, is
not spared from contaminated drinking water, and a subsequent diarrhea
outbreak, every year.
A recent study, by the epidemiology and disease control division, disclosed
that water supplied to Kathmandu contained several pollutants, including
coliform bacteria.
In 2001, there were 8836 cases of diarrhea and 247 fatalities. According to
the division, there were 7300 cases, with 150 deaths, recorded in 2002. In
2004, the toll is likely to rise, with 80 deaths already recorded by the
middle of the monsoon season.
Nepal saw one of the worst outbreaks of diarrhea in 1991, when 91 584 cases
were reported, with 1795 deaths. The outbreak season ranges from April to
the end of September each year.
ADDs hit Kathmandu at the end of May in 2004, affecting over 5000 persons
in a week's time. With the extension of the monsoon, the epidemic is
gradually moving to rural areas. Officials at the ministry expect the toll
will rise, since over a dozen districts, in Nepal's eastern and central
regions, have been badly affected by the floods, with people ingesting
contaminated drinking water there.
Although the disease is spreading to other parts of the country, most of
the fatalities occurred in 5 remote districts of far-western and
mid-western Nepal.
Predictably, the worst affected districts of Achham, Baitadi, Kalikot,
Dang, and Jajarkot are also the most poverty-stricken. According to the
National Planning Commission, over 72 percent of the population in these
areas lives below poverty line, or, has a daily income of USD 1.
Both the Sukraraj Hospital and Kanti Children Hospital, Nepal's only
children's hospital, are overflowing with diarrhea patients. A spokesman
for Kanti reveals, "we, daily, admit 10-15 children suffering from
diarrhea-related diseases. Our past experiences have shown the pressure
will continue till the end of September 2004."

[2] Diarrhea & Cholera - Philippines (Pangasinan)

After SARS scare, cholera outbreak stalks Pangasinan
-----------------------------------------------
After the scare caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) almost 2
years ago [2003] (referring to an incident in April 2003, when an Overseas
Filipino Worker (OFW) from Canada, vacationing in Barangay, died of SARS,
which she contracted in Toronto), Pangasinan is in trouble again, as
another disease, cholera, stalks the province, said Department of Health
(DoH) Region One Director Eduardo Janairo, in a talk to newsmen last Thu 15
Jul 2004. But Janairo quickly said that it seems that not only Pangasinan
is in trouble with cholera, but, also, the whole Philippines "as we are now
noted internationally to have cholera."
Janairo said that the World Health Organization (WHO) demanded the
reporting of cholera cases in the Philippines, adding that WHO is now
helping the Philippines stop cholera through donations of some equipment
and facilities. "This is a bad, very bad impression again on the
Philippines. Now, it [has] affected our lives, not only as a person.
Politically and economically, it has affected us," he said.
Janairo recalled that the cholera outbreak started on 31 May 2004, in
Malasiqui, then spread to Calasiao, Basista, Urbiztondo, Sta. Barbara,
Binmaley, Bugallon, Mangaldan, San Fabian, and San Carlos City. To date, of
the 2055 reported cases of gastroenteritis in all of the affected towns and
cities of Pangasinan, 81 were confirmed cholera cases.
San Carlos appeared to be the worst affected, accounting for 654 cases and
7 deaths. Of the cases, some 45 were confirmed to be cholera. Janairo said
Pangasinan was a potential area for cholera, because, in a survey conducted
in early 2000 by the DoH, only 75 percent of the population had been found
using water-sealed toilets, and, only 75 percent had been using a potable
water supply.
Last year's [2003] statistics showed 85 percent were found utilizing
potable water and 85 percent utilizing water-sealed toilets

[3] Cholera - Pakistan (Khuzdar)

Death toll from dirty water reaches 12 in Khuzdar
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll from contaminated water has risen to 12 in Wadh, in Khuzdar
district.
Patients complaining of gastroenteritis have been admitted to district
headquarters hospital. Many of them were reported to be in critical
condition. It is feared that the toll might rise, because the hospital is
inadequately equipped, with both medicines and staff, to treat the patients.
Wadh residents said they were forced to drink contaminated water from
ponds, because the area is facing a severe drought this summer [2004]. They
complained about a lack of medicines in the hospital, and, alleged that the
district government had not taken any steps to help the victims.
Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Muhammad Yousaf has directed the district
administration to ensure that patients were treated properly. The Khuzdar
district coordination officer, and the Health Department officials, visited
the area, and, directed the local administration to provide prompt medical
treatment to the victims. Officials said potable water was being supplied
to the people of the area and samples of contaminated water had been taken
to laboratories. They said food was also being supplied to drought-affected
people.
Mr. Yousaf has expressed concern about deaths from contaminated water and
warned the authorities to not be lax in helping the victims.
