The number of measles cases in the United States is nearing the modern yearly record of 220 which was set in 2011. The measles outbreak in Ohio continues to grow with the Ohio Department of Health reporting a total of 44 cases for 2014 through 7 May 2014. This outbreak is 2nd only to the now ended outbreak in southern California, which reached 59 cases.

The latest national totals were released by the Centers for Disease Control yesterday [7 May 2014]. Through 2 May 2014, the CDC has received reports of 168 measles cases from 15 states. Since that cutoff date, news reports have added singular cases in Minnesota, Pennsylvania and in Virginia. The Ohio outbreak has also nearly doubled its case count. Through 7 May 2014, using news reports and public health agency sources, it appears that the number of measles cases in the United States has reached 189.

Measles in an imported illness in the United States. It is common overseas, and travelers are bringing the highly contagious respiratory illness to this country because they have not received the measles vaccine. In Washington State, 6 of the 12 measles cases this year [2014] are linked to a massive outbreak in British Columbia. In southern California, 13 patients brought measles to the U.S., which resulted in a total of 54 of the 59 measles cases that state has reported. The Ohio outbreak is tied to 5 unvaccinated Amish men who went to the Philippines for a humanitarian mission and returned in March 2014.

In Europe, the Netherlands, Denmark, Latvia and Ireland are experiencing measles outbreaks. In Asia, the Philippines are in the midst of a measles epidemic that has produced over 20 000 measles cases and 69 measles deaths in 2014. Viet Nam is also experiencing a measles epidemic and has reported over 130 measles related deaths, the Viet Nam News reports.

There have been no deaths from measles in the United States in 2014. The Ohio outbreak continues to grow and shows little sign of slowing in the immediate future. With 8 months left in 2014, it seems clear that the annual total number of measles cases will approach or pass the 2011 record of 220.

There has been a spike in measles cases in Singapore. Jabs are being urged as this year's [2014] figure exceeds the 2012-13 totals.

More people here have been infected with measles this year [2014] than over the past 2 years. Although every child has to be protected against measles by the age of 18 months, close to half of the 99 people infected since January 2014 were children.

Last week alone, 7 people were diagnosed with measles virus infection. Four were children. Two were too young to get the vaccination, and the other 2 had missed theirs. There were 46 cases of measles in total last year [2013] and 38 in 2012.
