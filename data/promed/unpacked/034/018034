Anthrax in Ethiopia
WHO has received reports of clusters of cases of suspected anthrax in the
Afar region of Ethiopia. This area is inhabited by pastoralists who depend
on livestock and cases of anthrax are known to occur. Reports from
organizations (e.g. United Nations Development Programme, Medecins Sans
Frontieres) working in the area indicate clusters of cases and increased
numbers of cases of a clinical syndrome consistent with anthrax. No
systematic epidemiological investigation has been carried out thus far.

WHO, in collaboration with MSF/Epicentre and the Ministry of Health in
Ethiopia, have planned to carry out an investigation in the region in order
to confirm the diagnosis, assess the true extent and impact of the disease
and plan and implement control measures.
