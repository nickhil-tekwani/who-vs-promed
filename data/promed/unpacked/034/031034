Singhara flour rotis cause food poisoning
-----------------------------------------
More than 1000 persons suffered food poisoning after consuming "rotis" made
from Singhara flour in Bairagarh and nearby villages on Wednesday. The
specially made rotis were eaten by people who were on fast on the occasion
of janmasthmi.
The first case was reported at around 6:30 PM and panic spread in the area
by 7PM as the number of sick people [increased. They complained of
vomiting, partial blindness, dehydration and giddiness. Though police put
the number of sick at around 300, Bairagarh hospital authorities said more
than 300 people had already been admitted to the hospital. Rough estimates
put the number of patients at more than 1000. Hospital staff and residents
of the area however said the number of people suffering were more than
2000. "Most of the people living in the area were on fast". Almost everyone
consumes the Singhara flour rotis hence the large number of Sick people".
***********
First of all let it be clear that the "flour is of neither rice nor wheat.
It is of Water Chestnut (_Trapa bispinosa_) called Singhara in vernacular
language in India. People have eaten rotis or baked bread made of such
flour. Flour is kneaded into a dough with water, and small portions of such
dough is baked over a thick pan of iron. The water activity of such a roti
is not greater than .50. Rotis are never stored for more then 24 hrs
because then they become so dry that they can not be eaten. Now [the
important thing here is to know that such rotis of Singhara are eaten very
rarely, on some religious occasion like this one called Janmasthmi that is
birthday of Lord Krishna. So [the first suspicion goes on the stored flour
as [the grocer might have stored such a flour from a long time [ago to
sell it at such an occasion. But interestingly, [the number of people
reporting with disease is very high so the flour must come from a single
supplier.
Wherever [the flour came from, a bacterial etiology like _Bacillus cereus_
[is unlikely, so suspicion may go first [to some chemical, like
insecticide or rodenticide. Second, and less likely, but [a possibility
which cannot be outrightly rejected is some fungal toxicosis. In any case,
these wild attempts to even hypothesize the possible causal factors will go
in vain [without information from the authorities.
