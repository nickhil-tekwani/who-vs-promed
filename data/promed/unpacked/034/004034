Federal job-safety investigators will visit a south suburban postal
distribution center in Bedford Park, Illinois today after it was determined
that three workers at the facility were exposed to the bacterium that
causes Legionnaires' disease. Media report that the Office of Safety and
Health Administration officials will investigate medical records, interview
employees and conduct an inspection of the facility.
Blood tests determined at least three employees had been exposed to the
_Legionella_ bacterium. Legionnaires' disease can cause chills, fever,
cough, pneumonia and possibly death. Investigators have not determined if
the infected workers were exposed to the bacteria while on the job, but an
industrial hygienist who was hired by the U.S. Postal Service has already
removed a water cooler from the facility for testing. The facility employs
about 1,350 and more than 3.5 million pieces of mail reportedly pass
through it. Health officials said that the bacteria can not be transmitted
through the mail. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate
that about 15,000 people contract Legionnaires' disease nationwide. It is
named after a deadly outbreak of pneumonia at an American Legion convention
in Philadelphia in 1976 that was linked to the bacteria.
