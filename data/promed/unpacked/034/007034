From: Ian Brown <i.h.brown@vla.defra.gsi.gov.uk>

I would like to make it clear that the International Reference Laboratory
at VLA-Weybridge provides confirmatory testing services 7 days a week and
has been [doing so] since the European outbreaks began.
It is [often the case] that countries advise [the media] that they have
sent samples to Weybridge, when in fact the shipment has not even been
prepared. It is of further concern that on occasion, information on when
results may be expected is provided without consulting this office.
Therefore I would be grateful if you could treat with caution any claims on
when samples arrived/were tested at VLA-Weybridge without verification from
ourselves.
This is especially important when suspicions of infection are being
reported in new areas/countries.
