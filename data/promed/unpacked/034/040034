A total of 7 people have been diagnosed with hepatitis A after eating frozen pomegranate purchased at Coles supermarkets, prompting NSW Health to warn anyone who bought the product to throw it out immediately. Dr Vicky Sheppeard, director of communicable diseases at NSW Health, said it was working with the state's Food Authority to determine whether the infection could be definitively linked to the Coles frozen pomegranates, despite the fact that each person affected had eaten the product.

The company behind the frozen pomegranate, Entyce Food Ingredients, said it was "exercising abundant caution" by recalling what it described as "a relatively small batch" of its 180 gram packets of Creative Gourmet Frozen Pomegranate which it said was sold only through Coles supermarkets.

This is not the 1st time the company's products have been linked to hepatitis A. It recalled its nationally sold Creative Gourmet mixed berries in February 2015 and again in June 2017, to test whether the imported berries had caused separate hepatitis A outbreaks.

Genetic testing on some of the cases has identified a unique strain of hepatitis A. Those affected are from Sydney, Wollongong and the Central Coast.

"People who have eaten frozen pomegranate from Coles should consult their local doctor as early as possible should symptoms appear," Dr Sheppeard said. Symptoms of hepatitis A take from 15 to 50 days to develop and are caused by a virus that spreads in contaminated food or through poor hygiene.

Dr Sheppeard said those who had consumed frozen pomegranate from Coles in the past 2 weeks could benefit from a hepatitis A vaccination, if they were not already protected.

NSW Food Authority chief executive Lisa Szabo said the outbreak appeared to be linked to imported frozen pomegranate. "Fresh pomegranate has not been implicated, nor have Australian-grown frozen pomegranate products," she said.

So far in 2018 there have only been 9 locally acquired cases of hepatitis A in NSW.

Entyce Food Ingredients said the recall was isolated to the one product. "All product tested to date has been cleared and has not revealed a link to Hepatitis A, but the health and safety of our consumers is of paramount importance," it said in a statement. However NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said there was a need to issue a health warning against eating the fruit.

"Based on epidemiological information we think there's sufficient level of evidence to go out with a precautionary advice around to not consume the pomegranates. We acknowledge the work of the company and the NSW food authority and other regulators are working with the company. The investigation is ongoing."

All of the product's best-before dates up to and including 20 Mar 2020, are being recalled. "The recall affects less than 1 per cent of the Creative Gourmet fruit sold annually in Australia," the company said.

[Imported fruit, particularly berries, have been implicated in hepatitis A transmission in Australia in the past as well as in the USA and Europe.

The fruit of the pomegranates (_Punica granatum_) when split open reveals clusters of juicy, gem-like seeds (nails) on the inside and can be seen in a picture at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomegranate.
