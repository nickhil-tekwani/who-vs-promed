Konzo, an unusual disease or disorder of the legs, has broken out in Kaote village in Mongu, Western Province. Konzo is characterised by abnormal walking, stiffness of the legs and paralysis.

Briefing the press in Lusaka yesterday, Ministry of Health spokesperson Reuben Kamoto Mbewe said reports from Kaote village showed that a total of 25 suspected cases had been recorded to date with 23 suspected cases in 2013. "Since then, only 2 more cases have been reported; 1 case in 2014 and the latest 1 in 2015. The disease known as Konzo or spastic paraparesis has previously been reported in some parts of Africa, with some of them reported as being of unknown origin, while other reports have found an association with high cassava consumption and high thiocyanate blood levels. Thiocyanate is a product of cyanide, a naturally occurring toxin found in cassava, that is neutralised by appropriate cassava processing," he explained.

Dr Mbewe said an epidemic of spastic paraparesis associated with chronic cyanide intoxication in cassava was reported in Mozambique and that it appeared to be similar to the cases seen in Kaote village in Mongu. He said as part of the response to the disease, the Ministry of Health dispatched a team to conduct an epidemiological investigation to ascertain the situation on the ground.

"We recognise that prevention is cardinal and the government will continue to take measures to ensure that diseases such as Konzo are prevented," said Dr Mbewe.

[The main toxic source present in varying amounts in all parts of the cassava plant is a chemical compound called linamarin (Nartey, 1981). It often coexists with its methyl homologue called methyl-linamarin or lotaustralin. Linamarin is a cyanogenic glycoside which is converted to toxic hydrocyanic acid or prussic acid when it comes into contact with linamarase, an enzyme that is released when the cells of cassava roots are ruptured. Otherwise linamarin is a rather stable compound which is not changed by boiling the cassava. If it is absorbed from the gut to the blood as the intact glycoside it is probably excreted unchanged in the urine without causing any harm to the organism (Philbrick, 1977). However, ingested linamarin can liberate cyanide in the gut during digestion.

Hydrocyanic acid or HCN is a volatile compound. It evaporates rapidly in the air at temperatures over 28 deg C (82.4 deg F) and dissolves readily in water. It may easily be lost during transport, storage and analysis of specimens. The normal range of cyanogen content of cassava tubers falls between 15 and 400 mg HCN/kg fresh weight (Coursey, 1973). The concentration varies greatly between varieties and also with environmental and cultural conditions. The concentration of the cyanogenic glycosides increases from the centre of the tuber outwards (Bruijn, 1973). Generally the cyanide content is substantially higher in the cassava peel. Bitterness is not necessarily a reliable indicator of cyanide content.

Traditional processing and cooking methods for cassava can, if efficiently carried out, reduce the cyanide content to non-toxic levels. An efficient processing method will release the enzyme linamarase by disintegrating the microstructure of the cassava root. On bringing this enzyme into contact with linamarin the glucoside is converted into hydrogen cyanide. The liberated cyanide will dissolve in the water when fermentation is effected by prolonged soaking, and will evaporate when the fermented cassava is dried. Sun-drying fresh cassava pieces for short periods is an inefficient detoxification process. Cyanide will not be completely liberated and the enzyme will be destroyed during drying. Sun-drying processing techniques reduce only 60 to 70 percent of the total cyanide content in the 1st 2 months of preservation. Cyanide residues can be quite high in the dry tubers, from 30 to 100 mg/kg (Casadei, 1988). Simple boiling of fresh root pieces is not always reliable since the cyanide may be only partially liberated, and only part of the linamarin may be extracted in the cooking water. The reduction of cyanides depends on whether the product is placed in cold water (27 deg C/81 deg F) or directly into boiling water (100 deg C/212 deg F). After 30 minutes cooking, the remaining cyanides are, in the 1st case, 8 percent of the initial value, and in the 2nd case about 30 per cent (Easers, 1986).

Symptoms appear 4 hours to hours after consumption of raw or insufficiently processed cassava and consist of vertigo, vomiting, collapse, and in some cases death within 1 or 2 hours. Treatment is quite effective and cheap. The principle is to increase the detoxicating capacity of the patient by giving an intravenous injection of thiosulphate, thereby making more sulphur available for conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate.

Please note there is no mention of diarrhea occurring almost immediately after ingestion with cassava poisoning. So it is possible this may be some other toxin associated with the meal or some bacterial contamination. Most cassava poisoning patients report tingling in the extremities and this article does not mention that as a clinical sign.

More information on the possible etiology of this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.
