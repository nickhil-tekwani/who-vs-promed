A Doylestown Township [Bucks County] farm was placed under quarantine [Wed 23 Dec 2015] following the death of 3 horses, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. "They had developed severe neurological signs and reached a point where euthanasia was the only recourse," said Craig Shultz, the agency's director of the Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services.

The horses from Mile View Farm on Ferry Road were euthanized after contracting an aggressive neurological form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) that's called equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The virus does not pose a health hazard to humans, but the farm will remain under quarantine for a minimum of 21 days provided the remaining 40 horses on the farm do not demonstrate clinical signs of EHM. Additional testing for the virus will also be conducted as a condition of the quarantine.

"We're fully cooperating at the cooperation of all of our borders, and staff is observing all precautions and the investigation continues," said Douglas Raymond, who co-owns the farm.

EHV-1 commonly circulates in horse populations, and it can produce a variety of clinical signs that indicate a horse has been infected, such as abortion in pregnant mares and respiratory disease. The EHM form of the virus, according to Shultz, can cause horses to suffer varying degrees of paralysis and ataxia; it's not usual for horses to be euthanized because of an EHM infection.

The state agency is unsure where or how the horses came into contact with the debilitating disease, but Shultz said one of the horses recently attended a horse show 12 Dec 2015 in New Jersey. That horse presented with EHM on 23 Dec 2015. "That's a rather long incubation period, but certainly we have contacted the New Jersey animal health authorities and they are actively engaged in tracing all potential contacts from that event as well."

Shultz went on to say the disease poses the greatest threat to the premises in which EHM is detected. The disease's ability to go airborne is minimized to a small geographic area, but it can be contracted by other horses from contaminated equipment or by horse handlers who go from horse to horse. The state department has yet to find additional EHM cases at other locations but, according to Shultz, the agency will continue to monitor and trace horse activity that could "start this whole process again."

[This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

"Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease, EHM, has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may last longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM-positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

It should be noted that to date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. 3 of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV- 4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts.

EHV-1 can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.

EHV-3 causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.

EHV-4 causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus."
