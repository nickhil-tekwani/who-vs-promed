[As of Sat 17 Nov 2012, the Ministry of Health of Uganda reported an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever [Ebola virus disease] in Luwero district in Central Uganda. 4 cases, including 3 fatal cases were reported. The number of cases has now risen to 10 (6 confirmed and 4 probable), and the number of deaths has increased from 3 to 5. Deaths have occurred in Kampala, the capital city, as well as in Luweero, the site of the outbreak.

Unlike the outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurring in the districts of Kabale, Ibanda, Mbarara, and Kampala. which appears to have been contained, the Ebola virus disease outbreak appears to be developing. The Marburg and Ebola outbreaks are occurring in geographically separate regions of the country. But an alarming aspect is that affected individuals in both cases have travelled to, or been taken to, Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.

The location of Luwero district can be found in the map of the districts of Uganda (no. 48, in the Central Region) at
