To limit the spread of cases [of Rift Valley fever (RVF)], the prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) reminds all of the importance of prevention measures for protect from the disease [figure: Map of households as of 22 May 2019. New geographic areas affected.]

Epidemiological situation as of 24 May 2019:
In total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November [2018]):
- samples taken by veterinarians on sick animals or during abortions have identified 121 outbreaks of sick animals (including 97 cattle and 24 small ruminants);
- the CHM laboratory reported 134 human cases of RVF at the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte.

Although the vast majority of human cases of RVF do not show signs of severity, 2 serious forms have been reported.

The Mahoran population is called to be vigilant at the end of Ramadan.

The rainy season, favoring the proliferation of mosquitoes, is coming to an end and should be accompanied by a reduction of animal cases. However, in the run-up to Eid el Fitr and the big wedding season, the health authorities remind the population to be vigilant in case of slaughter of animals, consumption of meat, and consumption of curdled milk. It is strongly recommended to follow the recommendations to protect yourself from the disease.

Recommendations:
It is recommended to protect yourself when cutting zebu [cattle] carcasses.

In ruminants: Monitoring of Rift Valley fever includes monitoring of abortions. Thus, farmers are required to report promptly to veterinarians any abortions or stillbirths occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples in search of the disease.

An order prohibiting the marketing of untreated milk has been in force since 27 Feb 2019. A decree prohibiting the export of live animals, raw meat, and milk produced by the ruminant farms of the country has been in force since 20 Mar 2019.

In humans: The disease is usually manifested by an influenza-like illness: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, and tiredness. In the vast majority of cases, recovery occurs within a few days. It is recommended to consult a doctor as soon as the signs appear so that samples can be taken to see whether they are positive for the disease.

Recommendations to protect yourself from the disease:

For farmers and people in contact with animals:
- wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats);
- do not handle sick or aborted animals without protection, or abortion products;
- do not handle animal carcasses without protection;
- wear gloves, goggles, and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Indeed, infected animals may not present any signs, whereas they can transmit the virus.

For food:
- boil the milk;
- do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and then curdled with ferment of lactic acid;
- wash hands after cutting meat;
- cook the meat well;
- never eat the meat of a sick animal.

To protect yourself from mosquito bites:
- eliminate breeding sites; empty all containers that may contain water;
- use mosquito nets and repellents.

In case of appearance of symptoms:
- consult your doctor immediately.

[Since the 12 May 2019 report, the number of animal cases has increased from 119 to 121 cases, and human cases currently number 134. Observation of the recommendations and requirements listed above should help to reduce the number of human and animal cases. As Mod.AS noted in an earlier post, a French delegation included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019: "What about vaccination? To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU." Such authorization deserves early consideration. It would be of interest to know what role, if any, mosquito vectors are playing in transmission of RVF virus during the current outbreak. If aedes mosquitoes are involved, there is a risk of transovarial transmission of the virus that can persist for months in mosquito eggs with resumption of transmission when those eggs hatch and infected adult female mosquitoes emerge. - Mod.TY
