With ducks dying in large numbers in Kuttanad and upper Kuttanad, samples of affected birds will be sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, for analysis. According to authorities, around 22 000 ducks died in the past week or so. The majority of the dead ducks belonged to 2 farmers in Thalavady and Pallippad grama panchayats.

The decision to send samples to NIHSAD was taken after tests conducted at a virology lab in Thiruvananthapuram [were] inconclusive. Officials said that necropsy had found bacterial and fungal infections, ascites, and liver, heart and lung diseases in ducks.

"The exact cause of mass deaths of ducks is yet to be ascertained. The initial tests came back inconclusive. Tests have revealed mixed infections in ducks. Bacterial/fungal infections or other diseases found in the dead ducks could be secondary infections caused as a result of a primary virus infection. Tests to be conducted at the lab in Bhopal will help identify the primary cause of deaths," said an official with the Animal Husbandry Department. Santhosh Kumar, district animal husbandry officer, said that they expected to receive the results from NIHSAD in a couple of days.

"Medicines remain ineffective. But the disease is largely confined to 2 places, and there are no signs of it being spread to more areas. At present, we cannot say it is a highly pathogenic strain. We will have to wait for results from Bhopal for any confirmation," Dr Santhosh Kumar said.

On Monday [28 Dec 2020], a team led by Priya PM, associate professor, Department of Veterinary Microbiology, College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Mannuthy, visited Kuttanad and collected samples for testing. The test results are expected in the coming days.

In February [2020], a large number of ducks died at Pavukkaram, near Mannar, due to a bacterial infection. Samples examined at the Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Thiruvalla then revealed that the ducks had been infected with _Riemerella [previously, _Pasteurella_] anatipestifer_, an antibiotic-resistant [bacterium].

In September 2018, a large number of ducks succumbed to bacterial infection in upper Kuttanad. Before that, bird flu (avian influenza), caused by the H5N8 virus, was detected among ducks in Kuttanad in 2016. In 2014, thousands of ducks died/[were] culled in the region following a highly infectious bird flu outbreak caused by H5N1 virus.

[The key statement in the above media report is "Bacterial/fungal infections or other diseases found in the dead ducks could be secondary infections caused as a result of a primary virus infection". We hope the current tests in India's NIHSAD (Bhopal) laboratories will discover the virus behind the undiagnosed deaths of ducks, described above. One of the main candidate suspects is HPAI H5N8, spreading into multiple Eurasian countries during the seasonal migration of wild birds. In case confirmed, the apparent absence of disease in other poultry species will have to be clarified. - Mod.AS
