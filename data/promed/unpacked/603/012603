[1] Long COVID
Date: Tue 31 May 2022

A recent report from the CDC said that nearly 60% of Americans, including 75% of children and adolescents, have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of February [2022] (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7117e3). As the virus continues to linger and mutate, that number will continue to rise, leading to higher rates of long COVID: a wide range of symptoms that can last more than 4 weeks or longer after the initial infection.

Issues like breathing difficulties, fatigue, high blood pressure, memory difficulties, mental health diagnoses (depression and anxiety), blood clotting, and kidney injury can now become a new, ongoing health battle -- possibly worse than the virus itself. Older Americans are once again left at high risk for potentially fatal complications.

In a recent study that included nearly 90 000 adults ages 65 and older who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32% reported symptoms of long COVID up to 4 months after infection (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-068414). These striking findings imply that millions of older adults could be suffering from debilitating symptoms of long COVID. With these staggering numbers, and what we are seeing in our patients in hospitals and primary care facilities, we -- as clinicians -- need to reframe how we view and address long COVID in this population. We need to improve our approach to and management of long COVID.

The 1st step is to redefine long COVID in older adults as a geriatric syndrome. A geriatric syndrome is defined as a multifactorial condition that develops and impairs multiple systems. More simply, the term is used to capture the unique features of a health condition in older persons and often describes a set of signs and symptoms that do not fit into a discrete disease category. Common geriatric syndromes include delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty. These syndromes are associated with poor outcomes and reduced quality of life. Redefining long COVID as a geriatric syndrome will allow us to approach it with the unique lens needed for older adults, a particularly vulnerable population.

Long COVID has many similarities to other geriatric syndromes in that the exact mechanism that leads to the symptoms is complex and not clearly understood. For example, a study that colleagues and I published at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research this March [2022] found that 13% of older adults had evidence of new dementia within one year of COVID-19 hospitalization. Given the unique characteristics that are more common with older age (increased comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, reduced reserve, physiological changes), it is not surprising that older adults are more likely to develop long COVID and should be monitored accordingly.

Unlike other geriatric syndromes, which have a more unified manifestation (e.g., falls, urinary incontinence), long COVID has been more elusive, partly because of its novelty and the vast symptomatology that makes up the diagnosis. Some of the most commonly described symptoms, such as fatigue or brain fog, are hard to objectively measure through clinical examination or blood tests and it is challenging to quantify symptoms that can sometimes be easier to disregard as "normal aging" or "old age." Even once diagnosed, these symptoms have no simple treatment. The absence of a definitive diagnosis, along with the lack of a clear management strategy, can leave patients and families frustrated and can even lead to a sense of abandonment. We hear it first hand from these often scared and confused patients and caregivers; we get questions like "What now? Can mom get better?" or "What's the treatment?" And at this point, we really don't have many answers.

Therefore, like with other geriatric syndromes, the diagnosis and management of long COVID requires a comprehensive approach.

- New symptoms in older adults should not be dismissed and instead should signal the need for a detailed history (including a complete medication review) and physical examination.

- Ensuring comorbid conditions -- such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure, which may have received less attention during the pandemic -- are well-managed is essential.

- We must ensure a stronger focus on the preservation of function, cognition, and socialization. Containment and mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing), which were necessary during the pandemic, led many older adults to reduce their daily activities, resulting in functional and cognitive decline as well as social isolation.

- The COVID pandemic further brought to light health inequities for disadvantaged and underserved populations. Long COVID is just as likely to exacerbate existing disparities. We cannot ignore the health implications of social determinants of health (e.g., food and housing security), which must be incorporated into daily practice.

- Caregivers are an essential part of the care team and must be included and supported.

At the heart of this discussion is research on post-COVID conditions. My colleagues at Northwell Health and across the nation continue to investigate the COVID impact on older adults. And as new research comes to light, we will be able to better categorize the condition beyond the umbrella term of long COVID, which will lead to better diagnosis and management strategies of this complex syndrome.

In the meantime, we must remain vigilant when seeing our patients who fall into this high-risk category for long COVID, refrain from dismissing symptoms as just "old age," and listen to the caregivers and loved ones who are on the front lines of helping care for these patients.

[2] Cardiac care
Date: Tue 31 May 2022
Source: CIDRAP [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/covid-severely-disrupted-global-cardiac-care-increasing-deaths


A meta-analysis of 158 observational studies from 49 countries on 6 continents reveals severe disruptions in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, diagnostic and interventional procedures, and outpatient visits during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study, the 1st global evaluation of cardiac-services delivery amid the pandemic of its kind, was published yesterday [30 May 2022] in the European Heart Journal (https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac227).

A team led by University of Leeds researchers in England analyzed studies on global cardiac services published from January 2019 to December 2021, most of them from high-income countries (HICs). When health systems were overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, elective surgeries were canceled, they noted, and many patients needing even emergency care feared the infection risks of hospital admission.

Regardless of CV disease type and geographic area, fewer hospitalizations, diagnostic and interventional procedures, and outpatient visits occurred during the pandemic. Across all countries, there was a 22% decline in hospitalizations for severe ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and a 34% drop in less serious non-STEMI heart attacks. The researchers said the declines were the result of fewer people seeking medical care rather than a drop in heart attacks.

The investigators also observed a global 34% drop in cardiac surgeries, a 49% decline in the placement of electronic implantable devices such as pacemakers, and an increase of 17% in all-cause deaths, driven primarily by CV deaths in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

In-person cardiac visits declined overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.75). Five studies showed an increase in telemedicine appointments in all countries. But 3 multicenter studies from the United States and Germany found declines of 61%, 33%, and 5% in outpatient visits, even when including telemedicine appointments. According to survey studies, half of all exercise-based heart rehabilitation programs closed amid the pandemic, and many of the ones that continued provided only virtual visits.

Relative to HICs, LMICs saw more severe disruptions in STEMI hospitalizations (risk ratio [RR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.94) and revascularization procedures (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.87).

When patients did seek medical help, they experienced an average of a 69-minute delay in reaching the hospital or having contact with paramedics -- a significant factor in outcomes after heart attack or cardiac arrest. And when they did receive hospital treatment, they sometimes were given substandard heart-attack care with clot-dissolving drugs rather than interventional procedures such as placing a stent into a blocked artery.

This resulted in an elevated death rate among hospitalized patients in LMICs and more people dying at home from CV disease relative to before the pandemic in the United Kingdom (31% actual vs 24% expected). In UK nursing homes, those figures were 16% vs 14%, respectively.

LMICs, but not HICs, saw increases in in-hospital death for STEMI (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37) and heart failure (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12), and the degree of decline in hospitalizations for CV indications was similar in the 1st and 2nd pandemic waves.

In many LMICs, just 73% of patients having a major heart attack and 69% of those having a less severe heart attack received treatment.

The findings reveal "substantial global collateral CV damage during the COVID-19 pandemic with disparity in severity by country income classification," the researchers wrote, adding that data are insufficient to fully describe the effects in LMICs.

Cardiac health will "continue to accrue unless mitigation strategies are speedily implemented. The deferral of interventional procedures, especially for structural heart disease, leaves many patients at high risk of adverse outcomes," they added.

In a University of Leeds news release, lead author Ramesh Nadarajah, MBBS, said the disruptions in cardiac-service delivery will have ramifications well into the future (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/954044). "The longer people wait for treatment for a heart attack, the greater the damage to their heart muscle, causing complications that can be fatal or cause chronic ill health," he said. "Health systems need to reinforce systems to help support and treat people whose heart conditions will inevitably be worse because of the pandemic."

Coauthor Samira Asma, DMD, MPH, assistant director-general for data, analytics and delivery for impact at the World Health Organization, noted that 80% of the world's population live in disproportionately burdened LMICs. "This underscores the need for universal health coverage and access to quality care, even more so during the pandemic," she said in the release.

Re: ProMED post COVID-19 update (130): surveill., cardiac eff., long COVID subtypes, WHO, global 20220601.8703606 [2] Cardiac complications


The news that messenger RNA vaccines are prone to cause cardiac inflammatory diseases only less than half as frequently as after SARS-CoV-2 infection is very good news. We all had believed so, but having quantitative data with convincing evidence is very comforting.

For vaccines that carry some risk of worrisome adverse reactions, benefit-risk balance will guide their ethical use. Benefit-risk balance depends not only on the basic property of vaccine-safety but also on the frequency of infection. When risk of infection is high, as during epidemic (or wave), vaccination with messenger RNA vaccine is certainly highly beneficial with positive benefit-risk balance. But after the pandemic transitions into endemic stage, and frequency of infection becomes very low, we will reach a stage when population-based risk from vaccination may equal or surpass that from natural infection. We need to watch out for benefit-risk balance during endemic infection.

The absence of risk of cardiac inflammatory disease in 5- to 11-year-old children may be related to reduced dose potency. If so, it is worth investigating a schedule in older individuals with such a low dose but given a greater number of times than at present. The purpose is to explore if positive benefit-risk balance can be maintained during endemic phase by reducing the risk from vaccine. Alternatively, vaccines without such risk (vaccines other than mRNA) may be preferred during endemic infection.

A similar assessment will apply also to adenovirus vectored vaccines with rare adverse reactions leading to clotting/bleeding. It is likely that vaccination with safe vaccines will be necessary during endemic prevalence of infection, and that is going to be the new norm for the long term.
