Some 59 additional students of 3 schools in 3 districts of Bangladesh
were reported falling unconscious Wednesday [18 Jul 2007], bringing
the total number of such affected people to 275. Local media, quoting
physicians said, the ailing students were affected by mass hysteria,
a form of psychological disorder. It is not a disease and will have
no long-term effect.
According to reports by the private news agency UNB, in western
Natore, 165 km (102.5 mi) northwest of the capital Dhaka, 42 students
of a high school fell unconscious and 38 of them were admitted to
local hospitals.
In western Jhenidah district, 130 km (80.8 mi) southwest of the
capital Dhaka, 15 female students of 3 high schools fainted in the
morning [18 Jul 2007]. They were admitted to a nearby hospital. The
schools will be closed for 3 days.
In eastern Narsingdi, 45 km (28 mi) northeast of the capital Dhaka, 2
female students of a high school fainted with convulsions on
Wednesday [18 Jul 2007]. They were admitted to a local hospital.
Earlier reports said, 36 students and 2 teachers from a high school
fainted with convulsions, one after another from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00
noon Wednesday [18 Jul 2007] in central Narayanganj district. [In
addition], 11 female students fell unconscious in the morning in
another central district of Gazipur, while 19 students fainted at
noon in southern Bagerhat district.
Some 43 students fell unconscious in 4 districts on Tuesday [17 Jul
2007], and 35 students fainted on Monday [16 Jul 2007] in Savar, 25
km (15.5 mi) west of the capital Dhaka.
Earlier on [14 Jul 2007], at least 70 students from a high school in
eastern Narsingdi district fell unconscious in their classrooms with
a similar syndrome.
At present, some of the affected students are still undergoing
treatment in hospitals. Students who regained consciousness said,
they had headache, chest pain, breathing problem, and vomiting before
losing [consciousness].

[Alas, from the further evolution of this "outbreak" of 'fainting' it
now seems abundantly clear that this is a case of mass hysteria. In a
prior ProMED-mail posting from 2002, when there was a multistate
outbreak of rash illness (see Unexplained rash illness - USA
(multistate) (06) 20020605.4409), a reporter in a New York Times
article, Margaret Talbot, had the following background material:
"Well-documented outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness do occur.
Between 1973 and 1993, there were 70 reports of mass hysteria in
medical journals; most took place in self-contained communities, like
schools, barracks, and factories.
"Symptoms spread by "line of sight" -- people get sick as they see
other people getting sick --, which is quite different from what
happens with a viral illness. Adolescents and preadolescents are
particularly susceptible, and girls are more likely to fall ill than
boys. Girls' heightened susceptibility to mass psychogenic illness
need not be seen as due to their more "hysterical" nature, but to
their propensity to talk among themselves about their health.
Additionally, women are more likely to seek medical attention, and
presumably therefore to take note of their own symptoms, than men."
One does wonder if now that the Internet age has arrived worldwide,
there was increased communication among the school attendees (both
students and teachers) that resulted in the "line of contact" being
further facilitated by the Internet (a query 1st proposed by Mod.JW
in his discussion accompanying the outbreak in 2002).
