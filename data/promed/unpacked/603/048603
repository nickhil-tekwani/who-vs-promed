There is no threat of anthrax in the animal burial site in Arys, says the press service of the akim [mayor] of the Turkistan region. "No threat has been found in the animal burial site located on the territory of Arys connected with anthrax. There are 2 animal burial sites in Arys. One is located in Dermen; another one [is] in Kozhatogay rural county. Both of them are under control," said Omirkul Omaroc, head of Arys city territorial inspection.

He said the burial sites have not been damaged. "Soil samples are regularly taken there. The [research has] not revealed any threat. No information about anthrax in the animal burial sites has been reported," he added.

[This is an old Soviet custom to regularly check anthrax cattle graves. And it was from their doing this that my friend Benyamin Cherkasskyi discovered that they would typically go apathogenic after 5 or 6 years. The reason is that they would lose their pX02 plasmids for the bacterial capsule. pX02 encodes a 5-gene operon (capBCADE) that synthesizes a poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid (polyglutamate) capsule. This capsule allows _Bacillus anthracis_ to evade the host immune system by protecting itself from phagocytosis. The more pX02, the thicker the capsule, the more virulent the strain. This was 1st described by my grad student Pamala Coker (see Coker PR, Smith KL, Fellows PF, et al. _Bacillus anthracis_ virulence in guinea pigs vaccinated with anthrax vaccine adsorbed is linked to plasmid quantities and clonality. J Clin Microbiol. 2003;41(3):1212-8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC150325/). But if the spores are away from the soil surface and environmental stress, this plasmid loss will probably will not happen.

Also a negative soil culture by itself proves little, as sensitivity depends on circumstances and the skill of the laboratory that day. I have known outstanding laboratories to come up with the occasional false-negative finding. It happens. But to reduce this risk, use Antonio Fasanella's GABRI method for isolation. Believe me, it is very good (see Fasanella A, di Taranto P, Garofolo G, et al. Ground Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (GABRI) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination. BMC Microbiol. 2013;13:167. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728113/).

Arys is a town in the south-central province of Turkestin in Kazakhstan. Arys is the junction of 2 important rail lines: Trans-Aral Railway (Orenburg-Arys-Tashkent) and Turkestan-Siberia Railway (Arys-Almaty-Barnaul). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arys,_Kazakhstan. - Mod.MHJ
