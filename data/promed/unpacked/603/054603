Outbreak location: Sagbado, Golfe (Lome), Maritime
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 Jul 2021

Affected population: laying hen farm with 2 flocks in production.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the traceability investigation revealed that the bags used to transport the litter when it was changed had already been used several times and in other farms. The application of biosafety measures was not satisfactory. The affected locality is not very far from the border with Ghana, which also reported the disease ten days earlier. According to the investigation, this new outbreak does not appear to be epidemiologically linked to the outbreaks reported in the previous months in the localities of Djagblé and Klobatème (some 30 km [18.6 mi] away from the new outbreak), which have not yet been closed.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: stamping out; disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animal products; quarantine; movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability
Domestic control measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone
