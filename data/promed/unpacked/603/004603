Family brings measles to Dunedin
--------------------------------
A family that chose not to have its children vaccinated has brought Dunedin
its 1st cases of measles for 8 years. The potentially fatal disease has all
but disappeared from New Zealand, with just 12 cases notified last year
[2008]. Medical officer of health for the Otago District Health Board, Dr
John Holmes, would not provide details except that 4 children (of preschool
to high school age) had travelled to Viet Nam in January [2009]. The 5th
affected child was a family friend who contracted the disease after the
family returned. "There are possibly other people who have been in contact.
They have told their friends they've got measles . . . There may be some
other cases."

Confirmed cases of the acute viral illness were unusual because of New
Zealand's vaccination programme. The last major outbreak was in 1996 and
the last confirmed case in Otago was in 2001. Dr Holmes believed there was
a danger of people becoming complacent because the disease was rarely seen
here. "They go to areas where there is measles, they get infected, and they
come back and infect other people."

Measles causes fever, coughing, running nose, conjunctivitis, and a red
blotchy rash, which appears on the 2nd to 7th day of the illness and
normally lasts 4 to 7 days. WHO notes that measles is "a leading cause of
death" among young children although immunisation programmes have reduced
deaths globally to about 197 000 in 2007. Measles can also leave serious
long term effects.

Dr Holmes said measles [or rubeola] was a "different disease entirely" from
rubella, or German measles, which was particularly dangerous for unborn
children. The immunisation for both diseases, as well as mumps, requires a
single injection for children at age 15 months and another at 4 years.

What to do
----------
- parents should check their children's immunisations are up to date;
- anyone with symptoms, who wants medical advice, should phone ahead before
turning up at a doctor's surgery. It is important to isolate potentially
infectious people to prevent others in waiting rooms becoming infected;
- people born after 1969, who have not already been immunised, should
consider immunisation before travelling overseas.

[This report provides some additional details of the in-flight and
subsequent exposure of those in contact with a family of 4 unvaccinated
children travelling home from Viet Nam. So far infection has been
transmitted to one [presumably unvaccinated] family friend, the 1st case of
measles contracted in Otago District for 8 years.
