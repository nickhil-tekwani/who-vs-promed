One person and 25 cattle died last week following an outbreak of the
deadly anthrax disease in Chegutu [Mashonaland West] and Seke
[Mashonaland East].

As part of measures to curb the spread of the disease, the Veterinary
Field Services in the Ministry of Agriculture promptly launched a
programme to vaccinate more than 100 000 head of cattle in the
affected areas, which also include Selous and Mhondoro.

The department's deputy director, Dr Chenjerai Jagu, confirmed the
outbreak to ZBC News on Christmas Day. He warned people against
consuming meat from "suspicious" sources and slaughtering cattle
which appear sick.

[One should suspect that this outbreak in 2 adjoining districts in
adjoining provinces is probably far worse than this brief report
indicates. One can only hope that they have the vaccine (and money)
to vaccinate 100 000 cattle.
