Dead seals found along the Caspian coast of Kazakhstan
-------------------------------------------------------
The number of dead seals found at the coast of the Caspian sea in the
territory of Mangistauskaya region, Kazakhstan has increased to 435.
A total of 50 were adults and there were 385 young. Bodies of the
dead animals were initially found on 30 Mar 2007; and by 14 Apr 2007
the number had increased to 388. [Mangistauskaya region (Mangghystau)

According to preliminary data from the Research Institute for
Biological Safety, National Biotechnology Centre, Ministry of
Education and Science of Kazakhstan, the massive mortality in seals
could have been caused by canine distemper. This was based upon
immuno-fluorescence assay, confirmed by electron microscopy.
Influenza H5N1 has been excluded.
During an interview with Interfax, the deputy head of the Agency for
Environmental Protection of Mangistauskaya region, Marat Orinbasarov,
said that these results are preliminary and that additional
infections might be found during further investigations. Any
additional findings will be published, and a final conclusion about
the cause of death in seals will be announced when the results from
other laboratories become available.
Meanwhile, last week, the Ministry of Environment, referring to the
preliminary data from a special commission investigating the die-off,
said that the cause of the mass mortality of seals in the Caspian Sea
could be related to adverse weather conditions, reports Interfax.

[More details on post mortem findings, and estimations on the size of
the affected seal population, will be helpful. Final laboratory
results are anticipated.
During 2000, thousands of Caspian seals (_Phoca caspica_) reportedly
died in the Caspian Sea. An international team of scientists
concluded canine distemper virus (CDV) infection was the primary
cause of this die-off. Canine distemper virus is a morbillivirus
which, in 1987-1988, caused high mortality in Baikal seals (_Phoca
siberica_) in Lake Baikal in Siberia and was suspected of having
caused a die-off of crabeater seals in Antarctica in 1955. Other
morbilliviruses (phocine and cetacean morbilliviruses) have caused
several major epizootics among aquatic mammal populations in various
regions of the world in recent years.
Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) caused 2 massive epizootics in the
North Sea, affecting seal populations in several north-European
countries, in 1988 and 2002. During the last outbreak, in 2002, the
total mortality exceeded 18 000 seals. - Mod.AS].
