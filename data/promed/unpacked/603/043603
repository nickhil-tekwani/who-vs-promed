[From submitter: A bird die-off in Livingston, Zambia around Victoria
Falls has been reported in the press (see below). Any additional
information, such as involvement of wild vs domestic birds, bird
species and where samples have been sent for diagnosis would be
greatly appreciated.]
The Zambian government is looking into cases of bird death in the
southern tourist capital Livingstone for fear of an outbreak of avian
flu, which has already hit 8 African countries, said a senior health
official Tuesday. "We are investigating the matter but so far there
has been no confirmation of an outbreak," Health Ministry permanent
secretary Simon Miti said.
Livingstone's chief veterinary officer Jack Shoko said in a statement
that experts are carrying out tests on the dead birds discovered over
the past 2 days. "Samples were sent to Lusaka for testing. We are
still awaiting results of the laboratory test on the dead birds," Shoko said.
More than 40 wild birds were found dead in Livingstone near the
famous Victoria Falls shared by Zambia and Health authorities in the
region have appealed to local people who ate the dead wild birds to
report to health center for medical examinations.
The 8 African countries where bird flu has been found are Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Djibouti, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Niger, Nigeria and
Sudan. Human cases have been reported in Djibouti and Egypt. Zambia,
though spared of the disease so far, banned poultry imports in March this year.
