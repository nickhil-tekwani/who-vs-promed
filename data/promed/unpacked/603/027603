There has been a squirrel pox virus outbreak among red squirrels at Tollymore Forest Park in County Down. The Department of the Environment (DoE) said it had been 5 years since the 1st recorded death due to the virus in Northern Ireland [see ProMED ref. below].

The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) said there appeared to be "little natural resistance to the virus within the local population."

NIEA Wildlife Inspector Declan Looney said red squirrels in Tollymore Forest had "recovered well" following the outbreak of the virus 5 years ago, but this was a "further blow."

"Sick red squirrels will appear lethargic, approachable, with painful sores on their faces and paws," he said. "Unfortunately, there appears to be little natural resistance to the virus within the local population, and sick animals tend to die within 10 days to 2 weeks. If you have squirrels entering your garden to feed at bird feeders, please either remove or clean them daily to reduce the spread of the virus."

The DoE said the disease "does not affect people or their domestic pets."

A spokesperson from the Forest Service said it was "not unusual for the virus to re-emerge some years after the initial outbreak. The fact that the red squirrel population recovered in the intervening years gives us great encouragement that working in partnership with the NIEA and the Tollymore Red Squirrel Group on the implementation of control measures will once again produce a successful outcome," they added.

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease that only affects squirrels. It is caused by a parapoxvirus that circulates naturally in gray and fox squirrel populations in eastern North America. Infection with this virus results in fatal disease in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_), and it has resulted in extensive die-offs in the UK after its introduction in the island by grey squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_) from North America, which rarely die from the disease. This virus was the main contributor to the red squirrel decline observed in Britain in the last 2 decades. Dispersal of grey squirrels in Ireland has been slower than that experienced in England and Wales. Until now, the disease was mainly found in England and Wales, sporadically in Scotland, and only a few years ago in Northern Ireland and Ireland, and not elsewhere in the red squirrel's European range.
