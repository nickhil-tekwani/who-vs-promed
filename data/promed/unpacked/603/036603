At least 7681 head of livestock of 85 herders have been infected with the deadly foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the central Mongolian province of Uvurkhangai [Ovorhangay, Ovorkhangai], the provincial veterinary department said on Monday [4 Oct 2021]. The viral infectious disease has spread in the province via livestock of herders who have returned home from the east of the country.

Due to a drought in Uvurkhangai this summer, many herders in the province have moved to the east, which has rich grass, to fatten their livestock.

High-risk animals are being vaccinated against the FMD to curb and prevent its spread. So far this year [2021], the highly contagious disease, which spreads among cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, and pigs, has broken out in more than half of Mongolia's 21 provinces, according to the country's General Authority for Veterinary Services.

The livestock sector, with around 70 million head, is a main pillar of the Mongolian economy. The landlocked country, with a population of some 3.4 million, is striving to develop its livestock sector by raising meat exports in a bid to diversify its mining-dependent economy, while frequent outbreaks of livestock diseases such as FMD are impeding the process.

The country's meat exports have been suspended since June [2021] due to infectious animal diseases, according to the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

[The above information is indicative of a considerable and wide spread of the FMD (serotype O) epizootic in Mongolia, which, according to the OIE notification, started (recurred) on 6 Aug 2021 (confirmed 9 Aug, reported 7 Sep 2021; see OIE data in ProMED post 20210908.8654984).

According to the Mongolian digital media source 'updown.mn', the 7681 FMD-infected animals, kept in 85 holdings, were involved in 11 outbreaks located in 9 soums (districts) in the aimag (province) Uvurkhangai. The source indicated that the provincial veterinary service collected 70 000 doses of vaccine and distributed it to 7 soums to vaccinate livestock.

According to Mongolia's page on the website of WRLFMD [FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease], the most recent samples from Mongolia were received there in 2018. Of the 6 genotyped samples, 5 were serotype O, topotype 'ME-SA,' lineage 'Ind-2001', sublineage 'e', and one was serotype O, topotype 'SEA', lineage 'Mya-98'. The genotyping results and relations of the Mongolian 2018 strain to other FMDV O strains are available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2019-00003-MON-GTR-O-O_002.pdf.

Data on the genotyping profile of the current strain and the efficacy (matching rate) of the vaccines used will be helpful. The matching strain differentiation report of 3 vaccines to the strains circulating in Mongolia during 2018 is available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2019-00003-MON-VMR-O-O_001.pdf. - Mod.AS
