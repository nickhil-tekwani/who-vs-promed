Lumpy skin [LSD], a deadly [see commentary] cattle disease, has
broken out in Mbarara, the district veterinary officer, Dr John Lewis
Barigye, has said.
The viral infectious disease, locally known as 'ekyifuruuto,' has
mainly attacked cattle in the sub-counties of Kashari, Rubindi,
Nyakayojo, and Ndaija [see administrative map of Uganda at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/uganda.pdf>. -

Speaking to The New Vision last week [6-12 AUG 2007], Barigye said
infected cattle usually get small lumps known as 'obutojo' and they
do not eat. Their milk production also [diminishes]. "Some infected
animals may die. Others miscarry if the disease is not treated," he
added. However, there have not been any deaths reported yet.
He said vaccination is going on in Kashari and Rubindi sub-counties,
and encouraged farmers in Nyakayojo and Ndaija to check for
vaccination programmes from their sub-county veterinary officers. "A
vaccine dose for one cow costs UGX 1300 [USD 0.76]," Barigye said.
Farmers whose cattle are vaccinated get certificates. "Animals that
are not vaccinated should not be moved to other areas." Barigye
warned that anyone found moving cattle without a vaccination
certificate, would be fined UGX 2m [USD 1163.22] or imprisoned for 2
years.

[The morbidity rate of LSD can vary from 3 to 85 percent, depending
on the presence of insect vectors and host susceptibility. Mortality
is low in most cases (1-3 percent) but, in exceptional cases, can be
as high as 20-85 percent.
Pictures of clinical cases and gross pathology of LSD are available at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/DiseaseInfo/ImageDB/imagesLSD.htm>.
Two live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus have been used as
vaccines specifically for the control of LSD: a South African
homologous attenuated virus vaccine produced from the Neethling
strain of LSD, and a Kenyan heterologous attenuated virus vaccine
produced from a Kenyan strain of sheep and goat pox virus (SGPV).
Both vaccines can produce a local reaction at the site of inoculation
in _Bos taurus_ breeds, which some stock owners find unacceptable.
However, the consequences of an outbreak of LSD are invariably more
severe.
Some _Bos taurus_ breeds (such as Holstein-Friesians) have shown
lymphadenitis with signs of mild, generalized but transient LSD-like
lesions following vaccination with the Kenyan SGPV vaccine. Such
reactions may be accompanied by a drop in the milk yield of the
vaccinated animals. No such reactions have been observed in _Bos
indicus_ cattle. - Mod.AS]
