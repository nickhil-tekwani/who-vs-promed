Typhoid fever outbreak in eastern Tajik mountain region
-----------------
The Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) [nongovernment] international
organization has reported an outbreak of typhoid fever in the area of
Murghob of Tajikistan [in eastern Mountainous Badakhshon Autonomous
Region].
A total of 1350 people live in this mountainous area, situated in
eastern Tajikistan. The nidus of the outbreak of typhoid fever was
the village of Sarikinjar. So far, 51 cases of typhoid fever have
been reported. A week ago, following a blood test, a republican
laboratory confirmed that 22 people had contracted typhoid fever.
Doctors report that typhoid fever is rapidly breaking out in this
cold area.
Doctors say that the main reason for the spread of the disease is
muddy drinking water. Supplying [the people] with clear water and
medicaments, MSF are doing their utmost to prevent the spread of the
lethal disease in mountainous Murghob.

[_Salmonella enterica_ serotype typhi is an exclusively human
pathogen that is generally spread by contaminated water or food.
With this in mind, the muddy water was contaminated with more than
just mud. An excellent review article on typhoid fever was just
published in the New England Journal of Medicine:
