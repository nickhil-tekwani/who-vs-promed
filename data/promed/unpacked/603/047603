A second case of what was thought to be a unique imported infection in
France is prompting an alert to doctors not just in that country but
elsewhere, too.
_Rickettsia mongolotimonae_ may be a new clinical entity and, moreover, may
have a broader geographic distribution -- possibly via migratory birds --
than has hitherto been documented, a case study suggests.
Although two cases do not describe a new disease, doctors should
nonetheless consider it in differential diagnosis of atypical
rickettsioses, especially rashless fevers and lymphangitis and
lymphadenopathy, the report urges.
_Rickettsia conorii_, which is responsible for Mediterranean spotted fever,
has long been considered the only tick-transmitted European rickettsia in
the Mediterranean area.
A _R. mongolotimonae_ isolate was first obtained in 1991 from a tick
collected in Inner Mongolia. Its pathogenicity in humans was detected first
in 1996 in a French woman with atypical tick-transmitted disease.
This new French case was unexpected, largely because symptoms differed
markedly from those of the first and any other rickettsioses cases. The
patient was a 49-year-old gardener living in a rural area. He had contact
with animals but had not noticed any tick bites.
Eight new rickettsioses, three of them now described in Europe, have been
identified in the past 13 years.
