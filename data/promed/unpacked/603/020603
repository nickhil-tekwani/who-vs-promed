The Ventura County Public Health Department announced a _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi outbreak on Monday. 18 cases have already been confirmed in Southern California with 1 case in Santa Barbara County and 4 in Ventura County. 7 other cases are from out of state, most of whom had travel to Southern California. In a statement released to the media, the Ventura County Health Department said the cause of the outbreak remains under investigation. "As of 17 Apr 2015, 10 out of 10 people who completed detailed food questionnaires stated they had consumed sushi, and over 80 per cent [ie, 8/10? Rather small numbers to convert to percentages. - Mod.SH] reported having eaten raw tuna," said the Health Department. 20 per cent [2/10] of affected patients have been hospitalized.

This particular strain had never been seen before March 2015, but the Health Department said that a closely related strain was responsible for a salmonellosis outbreak that occurred in California and Hawaii back in 2010. That outbreak was found to be linked to raw tuna imported from Indonesia. "This strain is genetically different from the 2010 strain, so it appears at this time that the 2 strains are unrelated," noted the Health Department.

Salmonellosis is most commonly acquired from undercooked poultry, eggs, and meat. Unpasteurized milk, juices and cheeses, nuts, nut butters, and sprouts have also been sources of outbreaks. The Health Department notes that salmonellosis can also be transmitted by pets with diarrhea or by birds and reptiles. Thorough handwashing with soap and water before eating and preparing food can prevent salmonellosis from being transmitted to food.

[Although not specifically stated, the serotype here is likely the d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java). This organism has well-characterized animal reservoirs and has been involved in several recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail as noted below.

The organism has been linked to human salmonellosis acquired from ornamental aquaria (Levings RS, Lightfoot D, Hall RM, et al. Aquariums as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12: 507-10 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-1085.htm).

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. - Mod.LL
