Eastern equine encephalitis is confirmed as the cause for horse mortality
in northwestern Wisconsin.
----------------------------------------------------
Background: Higher then normal horse mortality ["a dozen horses on 5 Rusk
County farms" - Mod.MHJ was reported to the Wisconsin Dept. of
Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) on 27 Jul 2001 from Rusk
county in northwestern Wisconsin. A preliminary diagnosis of equine
encephalitis was made by an on-site DATCP field veterinarian. A joint press
release issued by the DATCP and Wisconsin Divison of Public Health on 1 Aug
2001 urged precautionary measures to be taken for horses and people based
on the clinical case diagnosis and a high probability of a mosquito-borne
viral cause for the outbreak.
On 30 Jul 2001, 2 horses, one from Barron county and one from Rusk county,
were submitted for diagnostic evaluation. The USDA National Veterinary
Services Laboratories in Ames, IA confirmed eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE) in one horse on 7 Aug with a virus isolated from brain tissue
identified as EEE by complement fixation. The other horse tested positive
for EEE by Taqman RT-PCR of brain tissue at the Minnesota Dept. of Health
laboratory. Tests for West Nile virus in both horses are negative.
A second joint press release issued on 7 Aug included information
indicating EEE as the likely cause for the outbreak. The outbreak area
includes parts of Rusk, Barron, and Chippewa counties. Medical alerts and
information for health care providers were sent to those 3 counties and the
7 surrounding counties. Public service announcements on the personal
protective measures people should take to prevent mosquito bites and reduce
mosquito breeding habitat on their property also went out to the same
10-county area at the same time.
Active surveillance for human infections has been initiated. To date, there
have been no reported human cases of EEE. Enhanced passive surveillance for
additional horse cases is underway. Diagnostic tests on blood samples
submitted from 6 additional horses with encephalitis are pending.
