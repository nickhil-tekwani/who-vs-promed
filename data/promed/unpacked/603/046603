New cases of bird flu have been registered in 8 villages in 3 Siberian
regions, the agriculture ministry said Friday [26 May 2006].
"Fowl infected with avian influenza have been registered in 3 villages in
Novosibirsk Region, 4 villages in Omsk Region, and one village in Altai
Territory," the ministry said in a statement.
None of the infected birds had been vaccinated against the disease, the
ministry said.
The Emergency Situations Ministry said in April 2006 that around 1.1
million birds had died of the disease in Russia, and that 300 000 had been
culled in measures to control the spread of the virus since the beginning
of February.
No human cases of bird flu have yet been diagnosed in Russia.

[Altai has joined Novosibirsk and Omsk within this year's epizootic in
southwestern Siberia.
Subscribers are referred to the map, published by the OIE on 26 Aug 2005,
showing the regions affected by HPAI H5N1 along its initial westward spread
in Siberia. The affected oblasts were Novosibirsk, Altai, Omsk, Tiumen,
Kurgan and Chelyabinsk; see <http://www.oie.int/cartes/RUS050826.jpg>.
It will be interesting to follow up this year's spread, while comparing it
to that of 2005. - Mod.AS]

The Nigerian Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) on Thursday [25 May 2006]
confirmed another outbreak of bird flu at a poultry farm in Kakara village
in the northern state of Kano.
Timothy Obi, leader of the Avian Influenza task force team of the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO), told reporters that the institute said it
had diagnosed samples of dead chickens from the farm and found them to be
infected with the deadly H5N1 virus.
An official at the Avian Influenza Crisis Management Center who preferred
anonymity also confirmed the outbreak.
"The virus was detected on Monday among the over 16 000 chickens on the
farm," he said, adding that 11 samples of the dead chickens from the farm
were taken to the NVRI for laboratory analysis which later confirmed the virus.
Malam Mohammed Aminu Adamu, chairman of Kano Branch of the Poultry
Association of Nigeria (PAN), said that already all birds at Omatiga farm
where the outbreak occurred have been culled while the farm had been
decontaminated to curtail possible spread.
According to a source at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, the government is worried at the resurgence of the disease in
Kano, a month after it was declared free of the virus was worrisome.
The source said the government, the Nigeria Veterinary Council and the FAO
officials were intensifying their surveillance, while the NVRI was
continuing with the task of finding ways to stamp out the deadly disease.
The outbreak of avian influenza, otherwise known as bird flu, was first
confirmed in the country on 7 Feb 2006. But so far no human being has been
infected.
