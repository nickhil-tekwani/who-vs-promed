A recent study (Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1998;91:426-31) suggests that
hepatitis C (hep-C) can be transmitted through sexual contact.
- previous studies of the possibility that the liver infection could be
sexually transmitted have been inconclusive.
- researchers at the University Al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates
[tested] 224 family members of 65 pregnant hep-C infected women and 218
family members of 65 pregnant women who were not infected.
- [they] found that 27% of family members overall and 74% of husbands of
hep-C infected women also tested positive for the infection, compared to 4%
of family members overall and 5% of husbands of non-hep-C infected women.
- the study also found that 80% of the children of hep-C infected women
tested positive, compared to 3% of the children of uninfected women.
- authors say the findings suggest both that hep-C may be transmitted
through sexual contact, as evidenced by the high spousal infection rate,
and through childbirth, as evidenced by the high infection rate among
children of infected women.

[This is an intriguing correlation but it would be useful to know whether
the spouses and other family members had risk factors similar to those of
the patients. - Mod.CHC]
