Bob Lewis and I have been attempting to get some background
information on these sick orangutangs and the related circumstances.
A number of sanctuaries in Indonesia were contacted; they
acknowledged the communication but have not otherwise replied.
As a result I am thrown back to the following simple hypothesis,
triggered by the following article:
Lost in the Jungle, by Linda Spalding
http://outside.starwave.com:80/magazine/0598/9805ape.html
In which, quite apart from the job done on the senior faculty member
of Simon Fraser University, the things that struck me as an
epidemiologist were:
[1 one heck of a lot of "orphan" orangutangs are being and have been
"looked after" in Indonesia, with numbers in the hundreds, and they
don't take to the wild again with great enthusiasm;
[2 truly wild orangutangs stay the hell away from humans if they can
and are therefore not available for "medical care and diagnosis".
So what I think we are seeing in Kalimantan is a number of sick
semi-domesticated & probably stressed orangutangs, some subject to
various levels of home, veterinary and medical treatments, at
different levels of medical hygiene.
>From what folks have mentioned in the past, you can have a
legitimate field station ... gathering data by observing behavior
objectively ... next thing you know villagers are bringing sick,
injured, and neglected animals to the biological field station and
PRESTO ... you now have a sanctuary. It progresses like cancer until
the purpose of the field station becomes running a home for battered
animals. Because there is little funding, one must rely on
ecotourists and volunteers with no primate experience to handle
day-to-day activities. Humans, being anthropomorphic creatures, feel
a need to bond emotionally with these animals which progresses to
hugging, grooming, and mouth-to-mouth kissing... This occurs at some
South American field stations but to a much lesser degree.
And as in all such things the quality of the stations varies from
outstanding to the gorblimey, and a measure of dirty laundry, which
is not discussed in public as it would affect funding.
If under these circumstances we are getting human infections being
transfered to orangutangs through less than optimal medical hygiene
conditions, as may well be the case, then we can equally expect that
orangutang infections are being transfered to humans.
