Regulatory action no longer required for orange rust of sugarcane,
_Puccinia kuehnii_, in Florida, USA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As communicated in the 27 Jul 2007 US Official Pest Report, the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the
detection of orange rust of sugarcane, _Puccinia kuehnii_, in
commercial sugarcane fields in Palm Beach County, Florida. Since the
initial detection in Palm Beach County, additional detections of
orange rust have been confirmed in fields located in at least 3 other
Florida counties: Hendry, Glades, and Martin.
A team of subject matter experts from APHIS, the Florida Department
of Agriculture and Consumer Services [FDACS] Department of Plant
Industry, and the sugarcane industry has assessed the situation.
Based upon survey results indicating a widespread distribution of
orange rust throughout the sugarcane growing areas in Florida and
because this rust is an airborne disease, the team of subject matter
experts have determined that regulatory action will be ineffective in
preventing the spread of the disease. Accordingly, APHIS and State
Regulatory Officials have decided that no regulatory actions will be
taken. APHIS and Federal and State cooperators plan to support the
sugarcane industry in the development of short-term and long-term
control strategies, including the planting of resistant varieties of sugarcane.
The initial symptoms of orange rust are minute, elongated yellow
lesions, which take on a pale yellow-green halo as they increase in
size. As the lesions grow, an orange to orange-brown color develops.
Unlike common brown rust, orange rust lesions are never dark brown.
Pustules of orange rust tend to occur in groups on the affected leaf
surface with most pustules on the lower surface and more lesions
toward the leaf base. Wind and large air masses can rapidly spread
the pathogen.
Under IPPC [International Plant Protection Convention] standards, the
status of _Puccinia kuehnii_ in the United States has changed from
'transient, actionable, and under surveillance' to 'present, only in
some areas'.

[The outbreak reported in July 2007 (see ProMED-mail post
20070731.2457) was the 1st record of _P. kuehnii_ in the western
hemisphere. Two possible explanations for the emergence of orange
rust in Florida are:
a. A less virulent strain of the pathogen has been present
previously, but has recently mutated into a more aggressive strain;
this scenario occurred in Australia where the pathogen had been
present for 100 years without causing significant losses until in
2000 a much more virulent strain emerged; it devastated the most
widely grown sugarcane cultivar in Queensland causing yield losses of
over 150 million Australian dollars (US dollars 128 million) and
demonstrated once again the dangers of monoculture.
b. The pathogen was introduced recently; a possible origin, pathway,
and timing of this incursion remain to be clarified. This discovery
is potentially very serious for sugarcane farmers in the Americas.
Unfortunately, it seems that the pathogen was discovered too late for
local containment and eradication to be feasible. Initially, the
disease may be controlled with fungicides. However, planting of
resistant sugarcane varieties appears to be the only long-term
management option. In Australia, resistant varieties have been
developed and these may be tested for their suitability to Florida
conditions and requirements.
Sugarcane brown (common) rust is caused by _Puccinia melanocephala_,
which occurs in the USA, Ecuador, Colombia, Australia, Mauritius, and
possibly elsewhere. Yield losses of up to 20 percent in Australia and
up to 40 percent in the USA have been reported. Disease management
includes fungicides and the use of resistant varieties. Rain favours
the development of orange rust but inhibits the development of brown rust.
