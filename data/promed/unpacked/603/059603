A correspondent has pointed out that there are discrepancies in the identification of the patient whose condition and treatment were described in the ProMED-mail post entitled: Avian influenza, human (105): China (XJ) H7N9, severe illness 20140917.2781676.

The correspondent commented that the ProMED-mail report is incorrect in that the latest WHO update released on 4 Sep 2014 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_09_04_avian_influenza/en/) states the following:

"Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus -- update
-------------------------------------------------------------
On 2 Sep 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Details of the cases are as given follows:
- A 66-year-old woman from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. She had onset of symptoms on 14 Jul 2014, was admitted to a hospital on 17 Jul 2014, and died on 3 Aug 2014. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.
- A 53-year-old male from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. He had onset of symptoms on 5 Aug 2014 and was admitted to a hospital on 9 Aug 2014. He is currently in a mild condition. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry."

[Neither of these cases corresponds precisely with the patient described in Avian influenza, human (105): China (XJ) H7N9, severe illness 20140917.2781676. At present, ProMED-mail is unable to resolve this discrepancy. Further information will be posted when available. - Mod.CP]
