Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Kazakhstan
Follow-up report No. 1
See also: 5 Aug 2005
Translation of information received on 9 Aug 2005 from Dr Marat Mynzhanov,
Director, Veterinary Surveillance Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Astana:
End of previous report period: 2 Aug 2005 (see Disease Information, 18 [31],
231, dated 5 Aug 2005).
End of this report period: 9 Aug 2005.
Precise identification of agent: influenza virus type A, subtype H5N1, highly
pathogenic.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 29 Jul 2005.
Date of start of the event: 22 Jul 2005.
Additional tests were carried out on pathological material and sera taken from
wildfowl and poultry from the infected farm.
Laboratories where diagnosis was made:
Pavlodar region branch of the Kazakhstan National Veterinary Laboratory
Species examined: avi (geese)
Diagnostic tests used
- virus isolation test on different cell cultures;
- virus isolation test on embryonated chicken eggs;
- inoculation of pathological material into birds of different species;
- haemagglutination inhibition test;
- neuraminidase activity inhibition test;
- post-mortem examination of poultry which died following inoculation of
pathological material;
- electron microscopy examination of material after several passages;
- real-time PCR(1), with the participation of international experts;

[This report is based on samples taken from farmed, not wild geese*. However,
both this report and previous report indicate concern about wild birds as a
source of the virus. Given recent reports on migratory bird infection with
H5N1 in the surrounding countries, it would not be surprising to find H5N1
spilling over into a farm setting as this epidemiological investigation
unfolds. - Mod.PC]
*[Note that although the report mentions "Additional tests were carried out on
pathological material and sera taken from wildfowl and poultry from the
infected farm", it says "Species examined: avi (geese)". It is not clear
whether this means that tests on other species were negative, or merely that
the results are not yet available. - Mod.JW]
