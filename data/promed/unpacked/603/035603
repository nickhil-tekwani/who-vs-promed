Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in Gabon/The Republic of the Congo: WHO
Update 21
----------------------------------------------------------------------
GABON: On Wed 20 Mar 2002, the Gabonese Ministry of Health reported 60
confirmed cases, including 50 deaths. Suspected cases continue to be
investigated.
REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO: As of Fri 22 Mar 2002, 32 confirmed cases,
including 19 deaths, have been reported in villages in Cuvette region,
Republic of the Congo. 18 contacts are being followed in the Republic
of the Congo.
Ebola haemorrhagic fever has now been laboratory confirmed in the
Kelle area [see: Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Gabon/Congo Rep (24)
20020315.3748. WHO, Medecins sans Frontieres, International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and other partners
in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are responding.

[The figures for confirmed cases and deaths in Gabon are unchanged
from the previous WHO Update released on Fri 15 Mar 2002, and the
figures for confirmed cases and deaths in the Cuvette region of the
Republic of Congo are increased by one. The total number of confirmed
cases, therefore, becomes 92 with 69 deaths.
Unofficially, an additional 25 suspected cases with 19 deaths have
occurred to the northwest of Kelle (see: Ebola hemorrhagic fever -
Gabon/Congo Rep (23) 20020314.3745), bringing the probable total
number of confirmed plus suspected cases to 117 with 88 deaths.
ProMED-mail has learned from a usually reliable source that there have
been another 5 suspected cases with 4 deaths in 2 villages in the
vicinity of Mekambo in Gabon, which have been associated with the
butchering of gorilla, perhaps signifying a new introduction of virus.
Also that the number of suspected cases in the vicinity of Kelle in
the Republic of Congo has risen to 27 with 20 deaths. These additional
cases would bring the overall total to 124 confirmed plus suspected
cases with 93 deaths.
The remoteness and inhospitable nature of the border region between
Gabon and the Republic of Congo, together with the suspicion of the
local population, continues to thwart efforts to contain this outbreak
of Ebola fever. - Mod.CP
