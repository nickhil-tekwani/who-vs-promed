Concerned over reports of sudden goat deaths in certain pockets of Chatra, the district administration husbandry department on Wednesday [4 Jan 2023] said that they have issued a PPR (peste des petits ruminants) disease alert in the region, asking people to get their cattle [sic; see comment] vaccinated. The department is also planning to set up special vaccination camps soon in the affected villages.

According to reports, about 150 goats have died at Shankarpur village, under Tandwa panchayat in Pratapapur block, in the last one week. Following a probe, animal husbandry department officials said that the deaths could be due to PPR disease and urged villagers to get their cattle [sic; see comment] vaccinated.

"Some of my goats became unwell and suddenly died. Government must do something to save our cattle," [KD], a villager, said. Locals said that the sudden spurt in goat deaths had also occurred in neighbouring Chandri village.

"PPR is a severe, fast spreading disease, primarily affecting domestic animals. Other than fever, the other symptoms are discharge from eyes and nose, sore mouth, disturbed breathing and diarrhoea, leading to subsequent death of the animal," said an official of the animal husbandry department.

Block animal husbandry officer Sanjiv Kumar Ojha said sheeps and goats were usually more vulnerable to PPR during winter. "We will organise camps to educate villagers about PPR and encourage them for vaccination. We advise people to get their cattle vaccinated," he said.

[PPR affects small ruminants, as reflected in its (French-origin) name. PPR vaccination does not involve cattle.

The authorities' statement that "the deaths could be due to PPR disease," combined with the description included in the media report ("becoming unwell and suddenly dying"), indicates peracute cases. Peracute PPR, manifested by high fever, severe depression and early death, is expected when PPRV first infects na√Øve populations of sheep or goats. India is regarded as endemically infected, with the 1st outbreaks reported in 1986.

The location of Chatra district, in the Indian state of Jharkhand, northeast India, can be seen at https://tinyurl.com/5eea8ms5. According to data published in 2021, Jharkhand is included among the 10 states of India which "fall under the highly endemic and hyperendemic risk areas categories" (https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/3/480). In endemically infected countries, most PPR illness is subacute or acute. Acute cases are clinically manifested by high fever, inappetence, marked depression and somnolence. Serous nasal and ocular discharges, during the initial stage, become mucopurulent from secondary bacterial infections. Many animals also develop profuse diarrhea. The clinical signs of subacute or mild cases are variable, but often include respiratory signs; they last up to 2 weeks. Complementary details of PPR's clinical signs are available at https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/peste_des_petits_ruminants.pdf.

According to FAO's data (https://www.fao.org/ppr/current-situation/country-detail/en/?country_iso3=IND), the small ruminant population of India is about 135 million goats and 65 million sheep. "PPR-Control Programme is being implemented throughout the country as one of the components of the 'Livestock Health and Disease Control' envisaging mass vaccination of eligible sheep and goat population. A total of Rs 535.7 million (about USD 6.5 million), Central and State share, is allocated in 2018-19 to do onetime vaccination for PPR. Subsequently, the newborn population will be vaccinated till 2022 aiming to eradicate the disease by 2025."

Information about the performance rate of the said ambitious mass vaccination plan and details on the investigation applied, including morbidity/mortality rates, clinical signs, duration until death, gross pathology, and detailed laboratory tests performed, are requested. - Mod.AS
