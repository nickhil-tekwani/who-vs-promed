The Florida Department of Health (FDOH) has identified the first
*presumptive* human case of West Nile virus (WNV) in Florida. The
patient developed acute encephalitis in mid-July. Analysis of the
patient's serum showed a positive IgM antibody test to WNV. FDOH
expects to have results of additional laboratory tests later this
week. The patient lives in Madison County, Florida. Madison County has
reported 4 birds which tested positive for WNV. Madison County is
adjacent to Jefferson County, where WNV has been found in 5 birds and
in 1 horse.
Because of the increased activity of Eastern equine encephalitis and
the WNV activity, a medical alert that was issued last month for
Holmes, Washington and Jackson counties has been extended to include
Bay, Calhoun, Gulf, Franklin, Liberty, Gadsden, Wakulla, Leon,
Jefferson, Madison and Taylor counties.

Florida Man Tests Positive for West Nile
---------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida man has tested positive for West
Nile virus, the state's first known case of a human contracting the
potentially deadly disease. Officials at the Department of Health said
Monday they believe the patient has the virus, although federal
officials are also testing him. The man, more than 50 years old, is
hospitalized in intensive care.
The disease usually causes only flu-like symptoms, although it can
kill older people or those with weakened immune systems. It has killed
9 people in New York and New Jersey in the last 2 years.
The virus has been found in birds in 7 north Florida counties since it
was first detected in early July [2001. A horse died from the
disease.
