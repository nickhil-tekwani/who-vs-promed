Plague in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------------------------------
As of Tue, 15 Feb 2005, WHO has received reports of 61 deaths from pneumonic
plague in the district of Ituri, Oriental province, in the northern part of
the country. The total number of cases is still not known. [Note this was
posted to the WHO website on 18 Feb 2005. - Mod.JW]
Preliminary results from rapid diagnostic tests in the area confirm
pneumonic plague, and the cases had clinical features compatible with
this disease. 40 samples have been taken and will be tested by
culture and serology at the Institut de la Recherche Biomedicale,
Kinshasa [Congo Rep.]. No cases of bubonic plague have been reported to date.
The cases have occurred in workers in a diamond mine in Zobia where
about 7000 people work. The mine was re-opened on 16 Dec 2004 and the
1st case occurred on 20 Dec 2004.
A team from Medecins sans Frontieres (Belgium and Switzerland),
Medair, WHO and Ministry of Health have been in the area to assess
the situation. An additional multi-disciplinary team will be leaving
for the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 19 Feb 2005.
If humanitarian access is possible given the security concerns in the
area, the team will go to the affected area to provide technical
support in case management and treatment of cases, intensive
surveillance and tracing of possible contacts and further
epidemiological investigations.

WHO: Thousands flee as plague kills 61 in Congo
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of plague in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo has killed
61 diamond miners and infected hundreds more, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said Friday [18 Feb 2005].
Many of the 7000 miners working in Zobia, north of the city of Kisangani,
have fled since the outbreak began 2 months ago, and could have spread the
highly contagious disease, the United Nations agency said. "The
epidemiological data is still incomplete but we are sure there are at least
61 deaths. The main problem is that due to panic, maybe two thirds of the
population, ran away from the mine," Eric Bertherat, head of the WHO team,
told reporters. "There is a risk that some patients in [the] incubation
[period] run away and maybe arrive in Kisangani. So it is very important to
inform health care workers to alert them of the risk of admission of highly
contagious patients," he said.
Kisangani is Congo's 3rd biggest city and a major trading center on the Congo
River.
Plague, which is spread between rodents by fleas, can also be transmitted to
people through infected rodent flea bites. It has a case-fatality rate of 50%
to 60% in humans if not treated with antibiotics, WHO says. There are 3 main
forms of plague in humans and the one suspected in the former Zaire is
pneumonic plague, WHO said. "It is very important to quarantine, isolate
these people who are sick with pneumonic plague so that the transmission is
brought under control. If we can find the cases and treat them effectively,
this can be stopped," said May Chu, a WHO expert.
A 10-member WHO emergency team was leaving at the weekend with supplies of
antibiotics to try to stem the outbreak and ensure that health workers in the
region isolate suspect cases. But the remote mine in mineral-rich Ituri,
reportedly controlled by rebels, is difficult to reach and the team will
require U.N. security clearances, officials said.
Cases are still occurring in the mine, where conditions are crowded and
unsanitary, and 20 workers were admitted to health facilities in Zobia with
symptoms Wednesday [16 Feb 2005], he added. The diagnosis of plague had been
verified through testing, WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said.

[As implied in the posting, the epidemic curve and analysis are
needed to discover the potential cause of the outbreak. Cases have
apparently been reported over almost 2 months, so it is likely that
several generations of primary pulmonary plague have occurred,
assuming the diagnosis is correct.
Primary pneumonic plague (1 percent of natural plague presentations)
arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious
aerosols, such as would be produced when there are pneumonic
complications in bubonic plague. It is also the form of disease
contracted from infected cats. This is, importantly, the form of the
disease that would be most likely if _Yersinia pestis_ were to be
used in an aerosol as a biological weapon. Such an aerosol would
likely be used in an indoor setting to avoid the outdoor UV radiation
inactivation of the organism.
Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.
Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters as being at greatest
risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through
air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for
prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol. -
