A sophisticated racket of workers at Entebbe International airport is minting millions of shillings daily from unsuspecting travellers to China by extorting money from them ostensibly to process a yellow fever vaccination certificate, an investigation by The Observer has revealed.

China does not require travellers from Uganda to carry along this certificate, 2 officials at the Chinese embassy in Kampala confirmed to The Observer this week. The well-placed officials, who declined to be named, emphasised that Ugandans intending to travel to China are made aware of the requirements when they are applying for a visa, and a yellow fever certificate is not one of them.

Our investigation has revealed that an extensive syndicate at Entebbe airport that stretches from the seemingly well-heeled airport staff manning the check-in desks at the departure lounge to the security personnel, imposes the yellow fever certificate as a requirement for travelers to China well knowing it is not.

When unsuspecting travelers are cornered by Entebbe Handling Services (ENHAS) staff placed between the 1st security check and the airline check-in desk, they are told they can't travel until they have been vaccinated at the airport clinic located near the arrivals lounge.

The unscrupulous airport staff have been able to sell the yellow fever dummy to people going to China and not the UK or USA because they know a number of countries in Asia such as Malaysia and Thailand insist on a yellow fever certificate before entry. They thus try to lump in China, well knowing that many businesspeople are heading there.

Countries that insist on yellow fever certificates as a prerequisite for entry, such as South Africa, make it explicitly clear at the visa application stage. Other countries such as Tanzania and South Sudan also require travellers to carry the certificate but they do not enforce it as strictly as South Africa does.

[It is not clear from this report if travelers from Uganda bound for China are actually vaccinated at the airport, or are just charged to receive vaccination cards without being vaccinated. In either event, if true, well-organized fraudulent efforts like this one shake citizen's confidence in national public health efforts in general. If this situation is investigated and confirmed, one hopes that the Ugandan authorities will bring a swift end to this practice, and bring fraud perpetrators to justice.
