Epidemiologists from Santiago are concerned by the appearance of 4
more cases of leptospirosis at the Jose Maria Cabral y Baez Hospital,
a situation that is being attributed to sanitary problems and to
deficiencies in municipal garbage collection.
The disease is transmitted by rat urine. There had been 4 cases
reported for all of 2005, meanwhile there have been [an additional] 4
cases reported between 31 Dec 2005 and 1 Jan 2006.
The health center has reported 4 deaths, a 75-year-old male and a
24-year-old male, both residents of Puerto Plata [a city on the north
coast of the Dominican Republic - Mod.MPP], and a 68-year-old male
resident of Santiago [the 2nd largest city in the Dominican Republic
- Mod.MPP] and a 46-year-old female [residence not specified - Mod. MPP].
The epidemiologist Aulio Collado attributed the new cases of
leptospirosis to overcrowded neighborhoods. He believe that one
shouldn't minimize the situation and recalled that on various
occasions he has warned of the possibility of a major outbreak of the
disease that could not be controlled by health authorities.
On 5 Jan 2006 the provincial director of Health, Ramon Martinez,
suggested that the municipal authorities should pursue greater
efficiency in garbage collection. "No only will we limit this
outbreak to these 4 cases, but we will also have a meeting with the
hospital directors in the region," he promised.
Martinez said that he is waiting for the results of testing on the
most recent cases in order to confirm they are positive.

[ProMED thanks Thomas Schmidt for this report.
Leptospirosis is a spirochetal infection that is distributed widely
throughout the world, with the major risk factor being exposure to
water (as noted above) -- no matter how pristine-looking -- that has
been contaminated with infected rodent urine. Because of its varied
manifestations, particularly in clusters, many different diseases
including viral hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus need to be
considered in the differential diagnosis.
Leptospire infection has protean manifestations. As a result, it is
frequently misdiagnosed. Approximately 15-40 percent of patients who
were exposed but did not become ill show serologic evidence of past
infection. The incubation period is usually 7-12 days, with a range
of 2-20 days. Approximately 90 percent of patients manifest a mild
anicteric (without jaundice) form of the disease, and approximately
5-10 percent have the severe form with jaundice, otherwise known as
Weil's disease. Severe disease can also manifest with respiratory
symptoms, and this has been described associated with pulmonary
hemorrhage in Argentina. The treatment of choice is tetracycline.
