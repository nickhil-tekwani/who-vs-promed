Blood samples of 6 suspected cases of dengue were sent to the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases on Friday even as 14 fresh dengue cases
were reported earlier this week. A total of 39 cases of dengue have been
reported during 2003 in New Delhi. Two of the suspected dengue cases sent
for confirmation were reported from the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences and one from Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Municipal health officer
KN Tiwari said, out of the 39 cases which have come to light, only 25 were
contracted in the city.
"The other 14 patients are suspected to have acquired the infection from
neighbouring states," he said. The fresh cases have been reported from
central, west, and Najafgarh zones, he said. Dengue claimed over 420 lives

An 11 year old boy who spent the summer break in Indonesia has become the
36th victim of the mosquitoborne dengue fever in Hong Kong in 2003. The
schoolboy was holidaying with his family from 27 Jul to 24 Aug and
developed symptoms including fever, bone pain, and skin rash the day after
arriving back in Hong Kong, a Department of Health spokeswoman said. He was
admitted to Tseung Kwan O Hospital on Saturday and discharged on Monday.
Dengue fever was confirmed yesterday. No other relative who went with him
to Indonesia was infected.
This year's [2003] 36 cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong have all been
importedT. This is the highest number since the disease was first found in
the city in 1994. Last year [2002], the first local outbreak of dengue
fever struck 20 people. There were 24 imported cases.
