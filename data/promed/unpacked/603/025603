Guillain-Barre syndrome in children and adults can occur as either
sporadic cases or in clusters of cases. The most frequent cause of
Guillain-Barre syndrome, whether in epidemic or sporadic cases,
appears to be a gastrointestinal infection with _Campylobacter
jejuni_, while infection with a virus or mycoplasma is a less common trigger.
Antibodies to _C. jejuni_ cross-react with neural gangliosides.
High dose intravenous immune globulin (2 grams per kilogram body
weight divided over 4 or 5 daily doses, if available and affordable,
is an alternative to plasma exchange as therapy for Guillain-Barre
syndrome.
