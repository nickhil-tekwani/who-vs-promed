Pest & disease alert: fireblight (_Erwinia amylovora_)
------------------------------------------------------
According to data from the Food and Environment Research Agency
(Fera) 4 separate outbreaks of _Erwinia amylovora_ have occurred on
_Cotoneaster_ [ornamental shrub] plants since late August [2010].

Fireblight was discovered in Somerset, Lincolnshire, and twice in
Cambridgeshire where plants were treated. However, in another
incident in Cambridgeshire, _Cydonia_ [quince], _Crateaegus_
[hawthorn], and _Cotoneaster_ plants were destroyed to contain the
outbreak.

New outbreaks of fireblight in Leon, Palencia, and Salamanca
------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock of the Junta [executive] of
Castile and Leon officially declared the existence of various
outbreaks of 'fireblight'. The threat is located in 11 towns in the
province of Leon. There is only one focus each in the provinces of
Palencia and Salamanca.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family
_Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and
bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species
from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species, as reported in item
[1] above, serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend
forming black hooks, cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees
invariably die. The bacteria are highly infectious and are spread by
insect activity, wind, water, mechanical means, and with plant
material (including budwood). They enter the host plant through
wounds. Since they overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs
infected during the previous season, the amount of inoculum and thus
the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high
fireblight levels.

Disease management may include monitoring, cultural measures (such as
removal of pathogen reservoirs), and bacteriocidal sprays. Currently
the most effective control is application of streptomycin during
flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly
subject to strict regulations. Certain cultivar/rootstock
combinations may provide some protection.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence
of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern in Europe,
the Middle East, and northern America. Importation of plant material,
including fruit, from areas with endemic fireblight poses a
considerable quarantine risk, and the pathogen has been placed on the
A2 quarantine alert list of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO).
