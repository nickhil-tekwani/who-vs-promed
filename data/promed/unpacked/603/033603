Deer herds in the Aldanskiy district in Yakutia, an autonomous republic in
northeastern Siberia, are threatened with an epidemic.
More than 100 animals have already died and 200 are showing signs of a
disease, strongly suspected to be Siberian ulcer [anthrax, senior shepherd
Eduard Struchkov told Itar-Tass at Yakutia's Ministry for Emergency
Situations on Thursday.
Experts from the agricultural department and an emergency committee
representative left for the area of Gynym river roamed by the infected herds
today.

[This is a fairly isolated area ENE of Lake Baikal. "Deer" can cover a range
of species for this area. And if it is an outbreak of anthrax, one may well
suspect that the area has been affected in the past, rather like the Alberta
Wood Bison National Park (in Canada). - MHJ
[Since the report is from a herdsman, one can assume these are reindeer -
