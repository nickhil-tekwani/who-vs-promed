Evaluation method for teliospores of _Tilletia indica_, _T. controversa_
and _T. barclayana_ in the soil
A simple and reliable method to evaluate the presence of teliospores of
_Tilletia indica_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest), _T. controversa_ (EPPO
A2quarantine pest) and _T. barclayana_ in soil was developed in USA. This
method is based on successive filtration of soil put into suspension and
centrifugation in a sucrose solution. With this method, teliospores of _T.
indica_, _T. controversa_, and _T. barclayana_ could be recovered, with a
spore density as low as 10 teliospores per gram of soil. No significant
difference in recovery rates of teliospores was obtained between the three
_Tilletia_ species. Formulas were proposed to estimate the actual numbers
of spores in naturally infested soils (as a function of the number of
teliospores recovered from soil by this method).
