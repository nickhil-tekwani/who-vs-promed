People in Oswego County are now officially under a public health
threat, following the death of a child, and now a dog, from eastern
equine encephalitis, better known as EEE.

The county is preparing to spray to control mosquitoes and avert
another tragedy. However, there is still no set schedule for when
spraying will start. Health officials say it will depend on weather
conditions. What we do know is that the 1st area to be targeted will
be the Toad Harbor-Central Square area.

The focus now is on protection, for you and your family members, as
well as your pets.

NewsChannel 9 spoke with the veterinarian who treated the dog who was
sickened with EEE and she said it's extremely rare for an animal,
other than a horse, to contract the virus. Second, she said in all the
research and journals she's looked through, this was the 1st and only
documented case she could find in New York State, which to her is
worrisome.

Dr Maureen Luschini, VMD with the Veterinary Medical Center of Central
[VMC] New York told NewsChannel 9, "The only publication out there
affecting dogs is from Georgia, so to my knowledge this is the 1st
time we have seen it this [far] north."

It was just earlier this month [August 2011] when a young dog was
admitted to the Veterinary Medical Center with signs similar to EEE in
humans. Days later it was euthanized. Doctors didn't know what they
were dealing with until the test results came in.

Within 10 days of being bitten by a mosquito with EEE, dogs will
develop a fever and a loss of appetite. Within 24 hours, clinical
signs generally worsen.

"Before [now] we were never screening for this condition in dogs or in
dogs presenting [with] acute neurological signs; so it certainly
raises a red flag," continued Dr Luschini.

Even though [a woman] and her dogs live in a different county the news
still creates some concern. "My dogs swim almost everyday and of
course when you're near water, you have mosquitoes, so hopefully the
stuff I have on them will make a difference," she said.

Another woman we spoke with said she wants all counties to spray [for
mosquitoes]. "They should be spraying in all area counties,
definitely, so this doesn't happen again down the road. It's been
serious enough all summer long, they should be doing something about
it," [the woman] said.

Veterinarians caution against using repellents on your dog or [other]
pets, since it can be toxic. They say the best thing to do is keep
your dog away from areas that have stagnant water or keep them inside,
especially if they are outside a lot.

Alert from the Veterinary Medical Center and Dr Luschini: A young male
puppy presented to VMC's Emergency Service 2 weeks ago with a history
of lethargy, anorexia, fever, and seizures. The patient presented
recumbent and febrile (temperature of 105 deg F [40.5 deg C]) with
cluster seizures. He was tachypneic [rapid breathing] with harsh lung
sounds in all fields. Neurologic exam revealed meiosis [small pupils]
OU [both eyes], rotary nystagmus [rapid involuntary movements of the
eyes] OU, and muscle tremors (particularly of the face). A complete
blood count and chemistry panel showed no significant abnormalities.
The patient lived in a kennel environment and, due to concerns for the
rest of the dogs in that home, this patient was euthanized and
submitted to Cornell University for a necropsy. Diagnostics returned
with a definitive diagnosis of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

To my knowledge, there has not yet been a case report of EEE in a dog
in New York State. This dog lived in a kennel in Oswego County, the
same county where a young child recently died from EEE.

Please be on high alert for this fatal disease among your canine
patients presenting with acute neurologic signs including stupor,
ataxia, and depression, especially in young patients (less than 6
month of age) or in dogs that live mostly outdoors.

The earliest signs include fever, depression, and anorexia, but
progression to neurologic signs is rapid. Serology and PCR are
possible antemortem diagnostics, but viral isolation from affected
tissues (that is, the brain) is the gold standard.

Should you suspect you have a case, contact the Cornell University
Diagnostic Laboratory at 607-253-3900 and the State Health Department
for further information.

I would be interested in knowing if any of you encounter suspected or
confirmed cases in your practices.

A 4-year-old horse in Halifax County had to be euthanized after
contracting the state's 1st reported case of eastern equine
encephalomyelitis this year [2011].

Triple E, as the disease is called, is a mosquito-borne disease. It's
preventable in horses by yearly vaccination, and experts are sounding
the alert.

"The number of reported EEE cases fluctuates each year," said State
Veterinarian David Marshall. "Late summer to early fall is peak
mosquito season in North Carolina, and this is right on schedule for
us to start seeing cases."

According to the state, "North Carolina had 6 reported EEE cases in
2010, 23 in 2009, and 13 in 2008. It is estimated that for every
reported case, 4 or more cases go unreported. There was one case last
year [2010] of West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne disease that
affects equines."

Officials report "people, horses, and birds can become infected from a
bite by a mosquito carrying the diseases, but there is no evidence
that horses can transmit the virus to other horses, birds, or people
through direct contact."

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been known to affect horses and
humans, but also many birds. It has occasionally occurred in dogs, but
is rare.

There is a vaccine for horses. The vaccine is often combined with West
Nile virus. Horse owners should be vaccinating. Remember it takes at
least 2 weeks after vaccination to develop immunity. While protection
from EEE wanes in about 6 months, it is recommended that horse owners
vaccinate at least this often in areas prone to this disease.

The mosquito can transmit this disease to humans, birds, and rarely to
dogs. Animals cannot transmit the disease to humans.

Ridding your home, paddock, or other areas of any standing water can
help reduce the places where mosquitoes can breed. Water may be
standing in small areas, such as water in the overflow dish of a
flower pot, or inside an old tire. Eliminating these breeding places
can help reduce the prevalence of mosquitoes that carry the disease.
However, there are always complicated issues to communities spraying.
