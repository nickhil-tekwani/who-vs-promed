Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Ghana
----------------------------------------
Information received on 14 Feb 2018 from Dr Kenneth M. K. Gbeddy, Chief Veterinary Officer, Veterinary Services Directorate, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Accra, Ghana

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 3 Jan 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 10 Jan 2018
Report date: 14 Feb 2018
Date submitted to OIE: 14 Feb 2018
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H9N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Dwen, Dormaa Ahenekro, Dormaa Municipal, Brong-Ahafo
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Jan 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 16 822 / 4225 / 4225 / 12597 / 0
Affected population: 78 weeks old brown layers in deep litter

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost
Birds / 25.12 / 25.12 / 100 / 100
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Dormaa Municipal borders with Cote d'Ivoire. Day old chicks come from Cote d'Ivoire and spent layers also move from Dormaa to Cote d'Ivoire. Inputs like maize come from Cote d'Ivoire.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; quarantine; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses; by-products and waste; stamping out; disinfection; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Control of wildlife reservoirs

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Accra Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 10 Jan 2018 / Positive

[It is well known that LPAI H9N2 circulates in Africa. However, this would be the 1st time that the subtype H9N2 is characterized as a highly pathogenic strain. Further laboratory studies may be needed to fully characterize the virus. If it is indeed a highly pathogenic strain as reported, this would be quite alarming for both animal and public health. In addition, also of concern about this report is the fact that the finding was reported to the OIE over one month after the strain was identified as highly pathogenic.

To date, naturally occurring highly pathogenic influenza A viruses that produce acute clinical disease in chickens, turkeys and other birds of economic importance have been associated only with the H5 and H7 subtypes. Most viruses of the H5 and H7 subtype isolated from birds have been of low pathogenicity for poultry. As there is the risk of a H5 or H7 virus of low pathogenicity (H5/H7 low pathogenicity avian influenza [LPAI]) becoming highly pathogenic by mutation, all H5/H7 LPAI viruses from poultry are notifiable to OIE. In addition, all high pathogenicity viruses from poultry and other birds, including wild birds, are notifiable to the OIE. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf

A Eurasian lineage of H9N2 (LPAI) viruses is currently widespread among poultry in some areas, and has become very diverse, with numerous reassortants, including some that share internal genes with H5N1 viruses. H9N2 viruses have been detected in wild birds including some terrestrial species. H9N2 viruses have been found occasionally in pigs, and might sometimes cause clinical signs in this species. They have also been detected in dogs, and by serology in cats, and infections can be reproduced experimentally in both dogs and cats, although virus replication may be limited. Serological evidence of infection was found in performing macaques in Bangladesh, and in wild plateau pikas in China. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/highly_pathogenic_avian_influenza-citations.pdf

The following comment is quoted from the article entitled "Influenza A(H9N2) Virus, Burkina Faso" by Zecchin B, Minoungou G, Fusaro A, et al., published in Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2017;23(12):2118-2119. The full article is available at, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/12/17-1294_article

"Identification of H9N2 subtype virus in West Africa, where highly pathogenic H5 strains of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (Gs/GD) have been widely circulating since the beginning of 2015, is a concern because of animal health implications, negative effects on local economies, and possible emergence of reassortant viruses with unknown biological properties.

Reassortment events between H9N2 and highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype viruses were reported in China in 2005 and 2016 and in Bangladesh in 2012. In December 2013, an H5N1 subtype virus that had an H9N2 subtype polymerase basic 2 gene was reported in a patient in Canada who had returned from China. Moreover, H5N6 subtype reassortant viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4, which contain H9N2 subtype-like internal genes, were identified in China in 2015-2016.

H5 strains belonging to clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4 are currently circulating in West Africa. This finding, combined with detection of human-like receptor specificity and 2 mutations typical of human influenza viruses in the H9N2 subtype virus from Burkina Faso, might indicate emergence of a strain capable of infecting humans and warrants additional attention to the avian influenza situation in West Africa".
