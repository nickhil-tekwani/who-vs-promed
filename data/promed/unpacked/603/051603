First report of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Slovenia
-----------------------------------------------
_Erwinia amylovora_ (Ea), [the bacterium that causes fire blight (FB) is
an EPPO A2 quarantine pest. [It is an A1 quarantine pest in Slovenia which
had never been found ... in official, ...systematic surveys ... since 1998.
More than 600 monitoring points were checked for the presence of symptoms
and approximately 60 host plants with or without suspect symptoms were
tested every year. ... [Fb ... was found for the first time in July 2001,
at one location on an old pear tree showing visual symptoms.
Ea was isolated on growing medium from a few samples collected from a
single infected tree [and its identity was determined by...
immunofluorescence, pathogenicity and PCR tests. The identity of the
pathogen was also confirmed by the Dutch Plant Protection Service's
laboratory in Wageningen, [and eradication measures [were taken ...
immediately ... according to national legislation.
The infected tree was destroyed ... and the survey was intensified with
observations and sampling of all host plants within a radius of 5 km.
Within a radius of 1000 m from the infected tree, 62 samples were collected
and tested, and 2 [infected trees... were found, [one on apple and one on
pear ... [which were destroyed. These infected fruit trees were all
located in private gardens in the Northern part of Slovenia which is not an
important fruit-tree production area. ... No further infections ... were
found.
The current situation of Ea in Slovenia can be described as "Absent: found
only at one location and eradicated."

[FB can cause severe losses primarily in apple and pear. Types of loss
include (1) death or severe damage to trees in the nursery; (2) death of
young trees in the orchard; (3) delay of bearing in young trees due to
frequent blighting of shoots and limbs; (4) loss of limbs or entire trees
in older plantings as the result of girdling by fire blight cankers; and
(5) partial loss of the crop by the blighting of the blossoms and young
fruits.
The bacterium has a very extensive host range which includes other pome
fruits (e.g., quince) and shrubs and trees. Disease management involves use
of resistant cultivars, good cultural practices, strict sanitation and
close control of antibiotic, pesticide and fertilizer applications.
Biocontrol of the disease using antagonistic bacteria may offer some degree
of control.
