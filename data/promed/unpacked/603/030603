Abstract
---------
Anthrax has been reported in domestic and wild dogs throughout much of the world. Generally, canids are considered resistant to anthrax, although there are several reports of anthrax deaths in both wild and domestic canid populations. Prior to 2012, anthrax had not been reported in dogs in Ukraine, despite a long history in livestock and wildlife. An outbreak involving at least one cow and one dog was reported from a backyard setting in southern Ukraine in August of 2012. Laboratory results and epizootic data were compiled from ofﬁcial investigation reports of regional and state veterinary services involved in the case response. A single dog died after being fed meat and bones from an illegally slaughtered heifer that died of anthrax 5 days earlier. On the evening of the dog's death, the dog refused food or water; however, there were no other clinical signs. Laboratory tests of dog tissue included traditional bacteriology for _Bacillus anthracis_, a small-rodent bioassay for virulence, and immunoprecipitation tests (IPT). IPT was positive, viable _B. anthracis_ colonies were cultured, and a bioassay conﬁrmed virulence. This was the 1st conﬁrmed case of canid anthrax in Ukraine. This case report serves to remind veterinary ofﬁcials that anthrax can affect a wide number of species. We advise surveillance systems remain ﬂexible and include animals that might not otherwise be tested.

[Many thanks to my former student for your interesting paper from August 2014. In fact, in the UK, canine anthrax was not uncommon in fox hounds. The huntsman, responsible for the hounds, would regularly get meat for them from the local knackers, who dealt in dead livestock primarily to recover hides. And when feeding meat from an anthrax carcass, one or 2 of the 2-3 dozen hounds would eat more or were more susceptible and die. It was a fact of rural life.

Still a nice paper.

This report refers to an outbreak in Ukraine in August 2012. A domestic dog died of anthrax on 20 Aug 2012, in a backyard setting in southern Ukraine (Voznesenka Village, Melitopol Rayon, Zaporizka Oblast). ProMED reported the relevant outbreak; see the following posts:
- 31 Aug 2012 Anthrax - Ukraine (05): (ZP) 20120831.1275555
- 22 Aug 2012 Anthrax - Ukraine (04): (ZP) bovine, OIE 20120822.1257263
- 20 Aug 2012 Anthrax - Ukraine (03): (ZP) bovine 20120820.1253031

But without any reference to canine infections. Such happens.

I chose to report this article, which just came to my notice, when the author, a one-time graduate student of mine of whom I am very proud, forwarded this Academia-mail report. I have taken the opportunity to share it with our ProMED members so that as and when and if on their next anthrax investigation, they check to see if the farmer's dog was affected. Something to observe that might not be seen by others. - Mod.MHJ
