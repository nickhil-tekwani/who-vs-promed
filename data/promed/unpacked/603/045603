In a recent ProMED-mail post (Melioidosis - Spain ex Gambia
20091024.3662), melioidosis is referred to as connected to climatic
changes, especially in connection with the 2004 tsunami, which was
followed by an increased number of reported incidents of the disease,
especially in Indonesia. In all probability the increase was not just
caused by increased attention, but also by an absolute increase in
cases. However, assigning this to climatic changes, and indeed
referring to the tsunami as a climatic event is probably somewhat
misleading.

A more likely cause of the probably increased incidence of
melioidosis in humans following the 2004 tsunami are the increased
exposure of large groups to flooding and injury in the weeks and
months following the disaster. Any natural event like the tsunami
will make contamination by _Burkholderia mallei_/_pseudomallei_ more
available at the same time as the number of puncture-wounds and
indeed exposure to contaminated water increases dramatically, thus
putting more people at risk.

I was interested to read about this case, and the follow up posting
from Henry Wilde, both of which support my belief that melioidosis is
commoner in Africa than is currently realized, although not often
diagnosed because of a lack of laboratories capable of identifying
the organism and a lack of awareness of the disease amongst
clinicians.

More recent reviews than the one cited by the moderator (1,2) have
found very few further cases clearly acquired in Africa. This is only
the 2nd case of melioidosis with a link to the Gambia of which I am
aware. As cited by the moderator, the other was reported from the UK
Medical Research Council Unit, which has had a longstanding presence
in the Gambia (3), although the patient herself originated in Sierra
Leone. If human melioidosis were common in the Gambia then one would
expect it to be recognized more frequently by this well equipped and
well resourced unit, which does not appear to have been the case. So
the true incidence of melioidosis on the African continent remains
very unclear.

Detailed molecular epidemiological studies of _B. pseudomallei_ are
shedding interesting light on its epidemiology and evolution (4). It
would be interesting if the isolate from Gonzalez's case could be
made available to one of several groups currently undertaking such
studies so that its relationship to isolates from southeast Asia and
northern Australia could be determined.

The other interesting and difficult issue is when to use prophylaxis
for those exposed to patients with melioidosis or working with the
organism in the laboratory. In reality there have been very few cases
of melioidosis actually acquired in these ways. Since the drugs used
for prophylaxis are not without risks themselves, careful risk
assessment is necessary, as mentioned by Gonzalez. However, there is
very little hard evidence on which to base decisions, so those faced
with this dilemma may be interested to read the combined views of a
group of those working with the organism (5).

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs. Lausund and Dance for their comments.
Indeed, the devastating late 2004 tsunami was not truly a climatic
event but rather a consequence of an earthquake. Not only were there
an increased number of cases of melioidosis, the flooding and
cutaneous injuries caused an upswing of gastrointestinal illness as
well as tetanus. - Mod.LL]
