Greece and Bulgaria are to draw a joint strategy for combating an epizootic
disease epidemic which broke out in Southeast Bulgaria and has already
caused the slaughter of hundreds of animals.
In a meeting held in Sofia by the general directors of the Greek and
Bulgarian veterinary services, the officials agreed to set up a joint group
of experts to coordinate efforts to curb the spread of the disease.
Although only a few cases of the disease have been reported in Greece,
Athens responded immediately to the Bulgarian invitation to attend the
meeting.
