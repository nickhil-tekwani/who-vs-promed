VACCINE DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION OPENS
=====================================

In response to the international public health priority associated with the
emergence of infectious diseases including HIV, drug-resistant bacteria,
filoviruses and others, the Global Vaccine Development Foundation, a
non-profit 501(c) (3) public foundation has been created to catalyze and
mobilize efforts to prevent the extensive morbidity and mortality caused by
new and emerging infectious diseases.
To achieve its goals, the Foundation has targeted three critical and
complementary programs: surveillance, vaccine development and distribution,
and education and advocacy. It will actively cooperate with other
interested organizations and institutions in these areas.
Surveillance: The Foundation will promote the use of modern telcommunication
technologies to enable scientists, medical personnel, and public health
officials to effectively investigate, monitor, and respond to new and
emerging infectious diseases.
Vaccine Development and Distribution: The Foundation will seek to accelerate
the development of promising candidate vaccines for new and emerging
infectious diseases and will develop strategies for innovative financing
mechanisms to expedite worldwide vaccine distribution.
Education and Advocacy: The Foundation will promote public and media
awareness of the urgent threats from emerging infectous diseases and will
advocate for global prevention and control. Towards this end, the
Foundation will stimulate the development of future generation of disease
prevention specialists.
