Importation of gelatin from BSE countries stopped by FDA:
An advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
taking a second look at whether gelatin, a ubiquitous product derived
from the skin, bones and connective tissue of pigs and cows, can
potentially be contaminated with the agent that causes bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). In an effort to prevent the transmission of BSE,
in 1992 the FDA called for a ban on the use of cow products from
countries where BSE occurs. However, because gelatin is not derived from
brain or spinal cord tissue -- the most likely carriers of BSE -- the
substance was thought to be safe, and was exempted from the ban. But
during the meetings this week, the FDA advisory committee voted 10 to 3
to change the status of the additive, which was previously regarded as
"generally recognized as safe (GRAS)." "After hearing the evidence,
weighing newer scientific information and thoroughly discussing the
issues, the majority of committee members concluded that the exemption
of gelatin from BSE countries should not continue". A series of steps
are used to obtain gelatin, including heat treatment to kill any
infectious agents. But it's not clear if such treatments are effective
against BSE, noted the committee. And it is thought to take years for
the disease to develop after exposure to the agent. There have been no
cases of human neurological disorder linked to gelatin and there have
been no reported or confirmed cases of BSE in cattle in the U.S., noted
Patricia Shafer, a spokesperson for Kraft Foods, Inc. in Northfield,
Illinois and the manufacturer of Jell-O, a gelatin-based product. "We
are very confident in our gelatin supply for several reasons," she said.
"One is that the FDA itself has said and continues to say that the U.S.
gelatin supply is safe."
