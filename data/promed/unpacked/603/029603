Re- ProMED posting 14 Apr 2003 [Unexplained death - Pakistan ex South
Africa: RFI 20030414.0914
--------------------
The death on Sunday 13 Apr 2003 at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi
(AKUH) of a Pakistani youth who had returned from South Africa on 31 Mar
2003 was not due to SARS.
The patient did not have any symptoms of pneumonia and no significant
findings on chest x-ray. He presented with fever, sore throat, cough,
vesicular lesions in the oral cavity, and hepatomegaly. After admission he
developed gastrointestinal bleeding and haematuria. Laboratory tests showed
him to have abnormal liver function tests with raised bilirubin and SGPT.
His admission WBC was 4000/cc; over the next 48 hrs his platelets dropped
from 81 000/cc to 38 000/cc and INR increased from 1.66 to 5.6.
The patient was isolated and precautionary measures were taken, not because
of SARS, but because of an initial suspicion of viral hemorrhagic fever.
However, subsequent serum IgG and RT-PCR for Congo Crimean hemorrhagic
fever are negative as was Dengue serology.
The Hospital kept the patient's family fully informed and ribavirin
prophylaxis provided to close contacts until CCHF was excluded. This case
was not reported to provincial authorities, because it was neither SARS nor
confirmed viral hemorrhagic fever and diagnostic workup was pending.

From: Dr. Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

I ran this case past GIDEON and came up with the following differential
diagnosis. Assuming that the clinical picture is entirely due to a single
infectious disease acquired in South Africa, GIDEON lists the following
(probabilities in parentheses):
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (87.7 percent), Hantavirus infections -
Old World (11.5 percent), Leptospirosis, Marburg virus disease, African or
Meditteranean spotted fever, Malaria and Typhoid. Additional notes
generated by the program state that, "Seropositivity toward Puumula and
Hantaan viruses has been demonstrated among rodents in the Free State and
Northern Cape Province: _Crocidura hirta_ (lesser red musk
shrews), _Elephantulus myurus_ (rock elephant shrews), _Aethomys
namaquensis_ and _Rhabdomys pumilio_." The severity of disease in this
case would favor Hantaan rather than Puumula virus infection. Although
Marburg virus infection has not been reported to date, an Australian
hitchhiker was treated in South Africa in 1975 after acquiring the
infection in neighboring Zimbabwe.
Of course, it is also possible that the patient's infection was acquired in
Pakistan, either before or following the trip to South Africa. In this
case, the differential diagnosis would still favor a Hantavirus or CCHF.
Dengue would also appear, albeit with low ranking by GIDEON.
The dates of disease onset vs. itinerary and timing of serological tests
would be helpful in focusing the differential diagnosis; as would animal
and insect exposure, additional clinical findings [both positive and
negative], health of fellow travelers if any, etc.

[ProMED-mail would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Rumina Hasan (Dept
Pathology/microbiology AKUH), Dr. Lubna Zuberi (Dept Medicine AKUH)and Dr.
Afia Zafar (Dept Pathology/microbiology AKUH) for rapidly submitting this
first-hand report on the clinical presentation of the case described in the
newswire posting (ProMED-mail Unexplained death - Pakistan ex South Africa:
RFI 20030414.0914). We sent the clinical description of this case to Dr.
Steve Berger for differential diagnosis based on the Global Infectious
Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON,
<http://www.gideononline.com>). We are also grateful to Dr. Berger for his
rapid response, and have included his findings in part [2] above. We look
forward to hearing more information on this case as it becomes available.
From the initial press release we did seriously question placing SARS and
CCHF together as part of the differential diagnosis, as these diseases have
significantly different presentations. As we have mentioned in prior
postings on SARS, in many areas the lay press is jumping on any illness
with any respiratory component, labeling it SARS, and including it in press
reports until proven otherwise. - Mod.MPP]
