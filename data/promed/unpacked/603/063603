West Nile fever in Canada - virus isolated in a crow
-------------------------
Information received on 23 August 2001 from Dr Brian Evans, executive
director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Winnipeg:
Description of affected population in the outbreak: the positive case was
diagnosed in a young-of-year male crow (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) picked up
on 8 August, about 375 kilometres south west of Toronto, in the
southernmost part of Canada, on Lake Erie. On 18 August 2001, Health
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, reported a preliminary
presumptive positive test result in a second bird, a blue jay (_Cyanocitta
cristata_) picked up in Oakville, Ontario, on 13 August 2001. Oakville is
about 15-20 kilometres west of downtown Toronto, on Lake Ontario. No
domestic animal or human has yet been found positive in Canada.
Diagnosis: both the initial screening test of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) assay for RNA and a second standardised, non-nested PCR assay were
positive at the Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg.
Confirmation of a first diagnosis in a previously "free" area required
isolation of the virus and/or positive immunohistochemistry (IHC). The IHC
test was conducted at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Laboratory
(Canadian Centre for Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory, Winnipeg) and was
reported positive on 22 August. Virus isolation was made at the Health
Canada's laboratory.
Source of agent/origin of infection: migratory birds are suspected of
spreading virus from the WNV fever epizootic occurring in the United States
since 1999.
Control measures: the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre (CCWHC)
is the main source for wildlife surveillance data in Canada. This
organisation operates the wild bird surveillance component of the overall
West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance programme led by Health Canada's
laboratory. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is also collaborating with
an enhanced passive surveillance targeted at horses and domestic birds.
Health Canada's laboratory is responsible for the public health aspect and
human surveillance.
More information on WNV surveillance activities in Canada can be found on
the Health Canada web site at:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/wnv-vwn/index.html>
The participation of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in the overall WNV
surveillance programme led by Health Canada is described in a document
found at: <http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/toce.shtml>
[The OIE weekly Disease Information referenced Health Canada and Canadian
Food Inspection Agency websites. The Health Canada site will provide more
information than the CFIA website. The CFIA inspection agency is involved
because of their role in animal disease control and not because WNV is a
foodborne problem. - Mod.PC
