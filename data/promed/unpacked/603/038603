Ulcer-Causing Bacteria Found In Central Pennsylvania Surface Waters
6-02-98
Harrisburg, Pa. -- A research team headed by Penn State Harrisburg
Assistant Professor of Environmental Microbiology Katherine Baker has found
the cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and certain types of
stomach cancer -- _Helicobacter pylori_ (H. pylori) bacterium -- in river,
creek and lake water in Central Pennsylvania. The study represents the
first report of live H. pylori in surface water in the United States,
demonstrating a major reservoir for this organism outside the human body.
Although _H. pylori_ infects half the world's population, surface water as
a primary source of infection has been unknown prior to the research
project involving Dr. Baker and John Hegarty, a Penn State Harrisburg
graduate student in Environmental Pollution Control and a graduate of
Bishop McDevitt High School in Harrisburg.
_H. pylori_ was first described in the early 1980s by Australian
researchers. The organism is found in the stomachs of the majority of
people in the world. In most people, it does not cause any disease. In a
small percentage of individuals, the organism causes serious consequences.
It is now accepted that _H. pylori_ is the cause of most duodenal ulcers
and between 70 and 80 percent of gastric ulcers. In the late 1980s, a link
between _H. pylori_ and certain types of stomach cancer was shown by
researchers at Stanford University.
Normal testing procedures do not identify the presence of live _H. pylori_
in water. Therefore, the Penn State Harrisburg researchers had to develop a
method to detect the organism. They combined two staining techniques to
enable them to count live H. pylori. The bacterium was found in more than
75 percent of the 36 tested surface water samples.
Baker and Hegarty delivered the results of their research last month at the
98th General Meeting of the American Society of Microbiology in Atlanta.
"Water looks to be a major factor in the transmission of the bacterium,"
Baker says, pointing out that the organism was found in both surface water
and untreated well water from shallow wells where surface water
contamination is likely to occur. Epidemiological studies have shown that
infection with _H. pylori_ is associated with levels of sanitation,
particularly water sanitation. In developed countries, less than 50 percent
of the population is typically infected, while in developing countries, the
infection is almost universal. In addition, the bacterium's DNA has been
found in sewage-contaminated water samples in Peru where the infection rate
is extremely high, leading researchers to speculate that water might be a
source of infection.
Initially, Baker limited her study to surface water. But upon learning a
fellow employee's mother had just been diagnosed with an _H. pylori_
infection, the study expanded. "Her drinking water came from an untreated
shallow well and she had just recently started to drink lots of water to
help her lose weight," Baker explains. Water examined from the well after a
rainstorm, when surface water contamination was likely, showed the presence
of live _H. pylori_. The Penn State Harrisburg faculty member notes that
"while we do not have conclusive evidence that the contaminated well water
caused the woman's _H. pylori_ infection, the possibility certainly
exists."
Baker emphasizes that the research to date has been limited to untreated
water sources. "More than half of Pennsylvania's residents obtain their
drinking water from shallow wells which receive no disinfection. Therefore,
we targeted non-municipal water supplies in our research," she says. Since
the detection method is quite labor intensive, the team's next step is to
develop a quick and easy test for monitoring water for this harmful
bacteria.
There is no evidence that _H. pylori_ is found in municipal or treated
water supplies and research by the EPA indicates that chlorine disinfection
kills the bacterium. "I certainly have no qualms about drinking municipal
water," Baker adds.
For those people who obtain their drinking water from untreated wells, Dr.
Baker recommends having the well tested to see if surface water
contamination occurs. If it does, or if individuals, wish to take
additional precautions, having a disinfection system installed is a good
idea.

[Thanks to Elizabeth for passing this to us. If one of our members at
Pennsylvania State University would contact Katherine Baker so that she
could inform us of her methodology ... the above script is not very clear
on this matter ... it would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
