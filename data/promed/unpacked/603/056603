The number of drug resistant cases of tuberculosis (TB) in the West Midlands continued to rise last year [2011]. One in every 14 cases of tuberculosis diagnosed in the region last year was resistant to at least one routine drug. More worryingly, a handful of cases were resistant to several drugs.

Coventry has some of the highest rates of TB in the country. Professor Ibrahim Abubakar, head of TB surveillance at the Health Protection Agency, said: "The increase in drug resistant cases remains a concern and a challenge to our efforts to control TB in the UK."

There are 4 main antibiotics used to treat TB, but a growing number of cases are resistant to one or more of those drugs. Patients usually contract a drug resistant strain of the disease from another person or as a result of inappropriate or incomplete treatment. The number of patients who complete their course of treatment has risen during the last 10 years but one in every 6 patients still does not finish their medication. Professor Abubakar said: "Failing to complete treatment is one of the key causes of drug resistance.

"TB disproportionately affects those in hard to reach and vulnerable groups, particularly migrants."

He said it was vital that NHS [National Health Service] managers in cities like Birmingham and Coventry that have the highest rates of TB prioritised the disease to reduce the number of cases in future. The West Midlands saw cases of TB fall to 872 in 2010. However, that figure rose to 1011 last year [2011] -- similar to the number of cases diagnosed in 2008 and 2009. Of those 38 cases were resistant to at least one drug. Professor Abubakar said: "Although we are disappointed that there has been an increase in new TB diagnoses in the past year, we are pleased that TB cases overall have been stabilising since 2005."

TB is often considered a historic disease but rates remain high in many deprived urban areas. People who are born in areas where TB is common are at a greater risk, as they are more likely to have been exposed to the disease. A regional project has been launched to tackle TB in hotspots such as Coventry. Target TB West Midlands is being coordinated by the Health Protection Agency and backed by councils, the NHS and the charity TB Alert. West Midlands director Dr Huda Mohamed said: "We must be aware that health services sometimes fail to reach some groups in the community and that increases the risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment. By working with these communities we hope to make a real difference."

[Seven to 8 percent of those with no previous history of tuberculosis reported to the US National Tuberculosis Surveillance System in recent years had _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates with resistance to at least isoniazid (INH), a 1st-line drug used to treat TB; but the frequency of isoniazid-monoresistant TB cases has remained at slightly above 4 percent from 1993 to 2005 (http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=773435 and http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/tuberculosis/factsheets/multidrug-resistant.html).

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid plus rifampin, 2 1st-line drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis. The CDC reported that 1.0 percent of those with no previous history of TB (primary tuberculosis) in the US were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/tuberculosis/factsheets/multidrug-resistant.html). The proportion of primary MDR TB cases disproportionately affects foreign-born persons in the United States. This group accounted for over 80 percent of such cases in 2010 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6111a2.htm). Most of these cases are due to activation of latent TB infection. For persons with a previous history of TB, the percentage with MDR TB in 2010 was approximately 4 times greater than among persons not previously treated for TB. 4 cases of extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB (all occurring in foreign-born persons) have been reported in the U.S. for 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6111a2.htm). XDR-TB is a form of the MDR-TB that is resistant to a fluoroquinolone and at least one of the injectable 2nd-line anti-TB drugs (kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin), in addition to being resistant to rifampin and isoniazid. Drug-resistant TB requires more extensive chemotherapy, involves drug therapy over more extended period of time, is more often unsuccessful, and is more expensive than treatment for drug-susceptible TB.

The Midlands, a region of central England with a population of 9 439 516 (2001 census), does not correspond to any current administrative area. West Midlands includes Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Shropshire, the metropolitan boroughs of Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton, and the unitary boroughs of Stoke-on-Trent and Telford and Wrekin. East Midlands comprises Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire and Rutland (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands_(England)).
