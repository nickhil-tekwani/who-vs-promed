KUALA LUMPUR (Malaysia): The Fisheries Department has banned the export of
cockles from Sabah due to the "red tide" outbreak. The department said in a
statement issued here yesterday that samples of sea water and cockles
collected off areas in Sabah showed a dangerous level of toxicity at 80ug
(micrograms)/100gm (grams).
"The situation is expected to change for the better in April or May with
the arrival of the rainy season," the statement to Bernama said. The "red
tide" outbreak is caused by the increase in the population of a toxic
species of plankton, making shellfish which eat them poisonous to humans.
The "red tide" outbreak in Sabah is seasonal, occurring after a dry spell
following heavy rains and strong winds. In 1976, there were 202 cases of
paralytic shellfish poisoning with 7 deaths. So far more than 300 cases of
poisoning have been reported in high risk areas identified as Sipitang,
Kuala Penyu, Binsuluk, Kota Kinabalu and Kota Marudu.
All forms of shellfish in waters off Sabah are not safe for consumption. In
Kota Kinabalu, Sabah Medical and Health Services Department director Dr
Saimy Ismail said his department was checking all markets to ascertain if
certain types of shellfishes and fishes containing high levels of paralytic
shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, were being sold.
"If we find such food we will confiscate it," Dr Saimy said when contacted.
He said this when responding to claims by Consumer Association of Sabah
president Patrick Sindu who alleged that high toxin shellfish and certain
species of fishes were being sold openly at markets.
