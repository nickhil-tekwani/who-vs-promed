As of 6 Apr 2006, 10 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), 6 cases of
diarrhea and one case of asymptomatic infection linked to an outbreak,
which began in Feb 2006, have been notified to the Norwegian Nasjonalt
folkehelseinstitutt (1). All patients with HUS and 5 of the patients with
diarrhea were children aged 2-8 years. The last patient became ill around
15 Mar 2006.
Microbiological investigation:
9 of the HUS cases have been laboratory confirmed as _E. coli_ O103
infections, using either stool sample culture (4 cases) or serology (5
cases). All 7 patients with diarrhea have only had a positive stool sample.
Most _E. coli_ O103 isolates tested positive for eae and stx2 genes, and
all were negative for stx1; however, some of the patient isolates did not
have the stx2. All isolates had an identical multi-locus VNTR analysis
(MLVA) profile.
Case control studies:
The case-control study in Feb 2006 was based on the first 6 cases and
provided strong evidence that minced meat from producer A was the likely
source (1). Subsequent interviews with the later patients led to another
hypothesis: cured meat sausage morrpolse. Initially, this product was only
mentioned by one of the first 6 patients, however, from repeated interviews
with the patients and interviews with kindergarten staff, it was discovered
that this product could be linked to all cases except one.
The expanded case control study included 15 cases and matched controls and
justified the suspicion against the cured sausage products from producer A
-- adjusted matched Odds Ratio 25.1 (2.2-281.1). Based on this information,
new advice was provided to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (see below).
Environmental investigation:
The incriminated cured meat sausage was sliced, and contained different
types of meat, such as mutton and pork, as well as meat spices and
conservatives. There is only one meat processing facility of producer A
that produces these kinds of sausages. Several lots of the incriminated
sausages were sampled and tested for _E. coli_ O103. Positive samples were
sent on to the National Reference Laboratory for Enteropathogenic Bacteria
for further testing. On 22 and 29 Mar 2006, _E. coli_ O103 with an
MLVA-profile identical to that of the patients was detected in unopened
packages of 3 cured sausage products produced in the same facility. On 31
Mar 2006, the _E. coli_ O103 outbreak strain was also detected in a batch
of mutton at a production plant of producer A. This type of mutton is one
of the ingredients in the incriminated sausages.
Control measures:
On 20 Mar 2006, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority withdrew the
incriminated cured sausage products produced between 1 Dec 2005 and 20 Mar
2006 and posted an alert on the European Rapid Alert System for Food and
Feed (RASFF <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/rapidalert/>) (2). A
national sales ban on this product has been in effect since then and the
production process is under evaluation. There is no indication that these
cured sausages have been exported. The minced beef implicated in the early
case control study is now no longer considered a vehicle of the infection.
There seems to be no association between the production facilities and the
products do not share any ingredients.
This outbreak emphasises the need for good slaughtering and manufacturing
practices for cured sausage products that are consumed raw. These products
must be microbiologically safe since they are eaten without further cooking.

[This follow-up illustrates an important point in the scientific method,
that is, continue to test your hypothesis and with time you may find it to
be incorrect.
The finding of asymptomatic individuals with stool cultures positive for a
VTEC organism is not uncommon either in a cluster setting or an endemic
one. The following citation (with abstract) is an example of this:
Silvestro L, Caputo M, Blancato S, et al: Asymptomatic carriage of
verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 in farm workers in Northern
Italy. Epidemiol Infect. 2004: 132: 915-19.
Abstract:
Fecal samples from 350 farm workers on 276 dairy farms and 50 abattoir
employees from 7 different operations were examined for the presence of
Verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ 0157 (VTEC O157) by an
O157-specific enzyme-linked fluorescent assay followed by
immunoconcentration. VTEC O157 was isolated from 4 (1.1 percent) of the
farm workers. A 2nd stool sample was obtained from the positive farm
workers as well as from their household contacts. VTEC O157 was isolated
from the wife of one of them. The strains from the same household shared
the same Verocytotoxin genes profile, phage type and pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis pattern. The VTEC O157-positive subjects had neither
intestinal symptoms at [that time] of sampling nor a history of bloody
diarrhoea or renal failure. Our study seems to confirm the hypothesis that
farm residents often develop immunity to VTEC O157 infection, possibly due
to recurrent exposure to less virulent strains of VTEC.
