A case of Japanese encephalitis has occurred in South Korea for the first
time in four years, the Health and Welfare Ministry said yesterday.
Officials said that a 29-year-old man from Wando, South Cholla Province,
was found to be infected with the disease while receiving treatments at
Seoul National University Hospital. The patient was first hospitalized in
Wando 21 Aug 1998 for high fever, paralysis and unclear consciousness. When
his condition failed to improve, he was transferred to the SNU Hospital 27
Aug 1998.

The last cases of Japanese encephalitis in Korea was reported in 1994. At
the time, three persons came down with the disease.
The ministry issued a warning against the disease 13 Aug 1998 across the
country, advising that children under age 15 be vaccinated.

[Interesting that it was reported that the first warning was given 13
August and that the patient was hospitalized on 21 August. Perhaps they
are conducting mosquito and sentinel surveillance and had advance notice? -
