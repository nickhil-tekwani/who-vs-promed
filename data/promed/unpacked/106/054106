Anthony Fauci said U.S. booster shots against COVID-19 are likely to start only with the vaccine by Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE, while the Moderna Inc. shot may be delayed. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain pushed back against criticism that the Biden administration is rushing booster shots ahead of scientific evidence.

The Group of 20 is set to pledge to do more to tackle the impact of the pandemic on mental health as ministers meet in Rome this weekend.

The U.K. is looking at requiring vaccine passports for entry to big venues by this month [September 2021], though has yet to make a decision on shots for healthy schoolchildren. Italy will decide by the end of the month [September 2021] whether vaccines will become mandatory.

Key developments
----------------
- Global tracker: Cases pass 220.5 million; deaths exceed 4.5 million
- Vaccine tracker: More than 5.46 billion doses administered
- Delta surge means this is as good as it gets for global growth
- They suffered through COVID, and still don't want the vaccine
- One vaccine makes more antibodies than another. Does it matter?
- Battered by COVID, cities fight for survival

Israel to brief U.S. on Pfizer boosters
---------------------------------------
Israel, the first country to widely roll out booster shots, will brief the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as decides on additional COVID vaccine doses in the U.S., Reuters reported. Officials with Israel's Health Ministry will brief U.S. counterparts on [17 Sep 2021], days before President Joe Biden has said he wants to begin a widespread booster campaign. The briefing will be confined to the Pfizer Inc-BioNTech shot used in Israel -- and which officials say is likely to be rolled out first in the U.S. as a booster.

Ohio judge to rule on Ivermectin case
--------------------------------------
An Ohio judge is set to issue a ruling involving ivermectin, a drug often used to treat parasites in livestock.

The case is one of a handful around the U.S. involving the use of the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.

At issue is whether a hospital must continue, against its wishes, to administer the drug to a 51-year-old man who contracted COVID-19 and was placed on a ventilator. His wife sued to force the treatment.

Michael Oster, a judge in Butler County, temporarily let stand an order that UC Health must administer the medicine, though almost all medical experts warn against it as ineffective as an anti-viral and possibly harmful.

Oster ruled on [Fri 3 Sep 2021] that the hospital could discontinue the treatment if the patient suffered negative side effects and that he would make a final decision by [Mon 6 Sep 2021].

Government can't convince on vaccines, Kentucky Governor says
--------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. is "well past" the point where unvaccinated Americans are going to listen to a government official and take the vaccine because of it, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on [Sun 5 Sep 2021] on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We're probably past even the point where a local official, a pastor or others" could do so, he said. People are "going to have to call or go see that person they love and care about that is unvaccinated and they're going to have to put their relationship with that person on the line," Beshear said. The Democratic governor has gone head-to-head with the state's Republican-led legislature on the subject of masks. State officials in Kentucky, which is currently battling one of the worst outbreaks in the U.S., have limited the governor's emergency powers. Almost 58% of people in Kentucky have gotten at least one shot, compared with the U.S. average of 62.3%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.

Boosters likely to start with Pfizer: Fauci
-------------------------------------------
President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser said U.S. booster shots against COVID-19 are likely to start only with the vaccine by Pfizer Inc.and BioNTech SE, while the Moderna Inc. shot may be delayed. "The bottom line is very likely at least part of the plan will be implemented, but ultimately the entire plan will be," Anthony Fauci said Sun on CBS's "Face the Nation." Fauci's comments may lead to more clarity on the administration's stance after Biden ran into resistance by medical experts who advise U.S. regulators over what they view as political interference in the review process.

Delta peaking in U.S. south, Medical dean says
-----------------------------------------------
The delta variant wave is showing signs of peaking in the U.S. south, where it has driven infections and hospitalizations to records, Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health said.

The spread in the Midwest is unlikely to be as bad, largely because of higher vaccination rates and tools such as more testing, he said on "Fox News Sunday." He also defended President Joe Biden's drive to widely administer boosters, a plan that has been criticized for getting ahead of scientific evidence. "It is clear to me that this is probably going to end up being a 3-shot vaccine package," he said, adding that the evidence was stronger for older and more medically vulnerable people than for the young and healthy.

Biden isn't rushing boosters, Klain says
----------------------------------------
President Joe Biden's administration remains hopeful that booster shots will kick off in the U.S. in about 2 weeks, though it will need approval by regulators and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said. Klain pushed back against criticism that Biden is attempting to rush booster shots ahead of scientific evidence. Officials from the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration were involved in setting the week of [20 Sep 2021] target date, he said on CNN's "State of the Union" on [Sun 5 Sep 2021]. "We still are hopeful that at least one of the vaccinations could be available that date," Klain said.

Israel to restart tourist group program
----------------------------------------
Israel will restart a pilot program on [19 Sep 2021] allowing organized tourist groups of 5 to 30 people to visit the country. Tourists must have proof of a 2nd Israel Health Ministry-recognized vaccination within the past 6 months or have had their 3rd vaccination, to qualify for entry. They will also have to present a negative PCR test and will undergo a serological test at the airport upon landing. The Tourism Ministry said it hopes to allow individual tourists into Israel in the near future.

BOE said to drop staff return policy
-------------------------------------
The Bank of England has reversed a policy that was scheduled to start in September [2021] encouraging staff to return to the office at least one day a week, a person familiar with the matter said. The BOE has now told staff that there's no longer an expectation to come in and that they can choose to return on a voluntary basis, the person said. That's because of a recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.K.

Germany's vaccine contribution
-------------------------------
Germany is seeking to provide 100 million vaccine doses to global inoculation efforts by the end of this year [2021], DPA reported [Sun 5 Sep 2021], citing Health Minister Jens Spahn. "That's as much as we've used in our country so far," Spahn said on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting of health ministers in Rome.

Italy to decide on compulsory vaccine
--------------------------------------
Italy will decide by the end of September [2021] whether vaccines will become mandatory for all people aged 12 and over, Public Administration Minister Renato Brunetta said. A law will be passed if the country hasn't reached a vaccination level between 80% and 90%, he said. At the moment, the level is about 71.5%, government data show.

G-20 to do more to tackle mental health
----------------------------------------
The Group of 20 are set to pledge more action to tackle the fallout of COVID-19 on mental health, according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg. Health ministers meeting in Rome this weekend will acknowledge the consequences from isolation to unemployment to food insecurity, and that the pandemic has exposed gaps in mental health systems. The impact has disproportionately hit groups including women, older people, persons with disabilities, as well as the poorest and most vulnerable, the draft showed. Ministers will therefore pledge to increase access to services and to better integrate mental health into their broader health care systems.

Pfizer safe for cancer patients: study
--------------------------------------

An Israeli study among 330 actively treated cancer patients found that 88% developed antibodies after 2 doses of Pfizer's vaccine, compared with 97% among a control group of healthy patients. The researchers measured the antibody response 2 months after the 2nd inoculation. The study at Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center also found no significant side effects among cancer patients receiving active treatment. The proportion who didn't develop adequate antibody responses was highest among those receiving chemotherapy as a single drug, compared with those treated with immunotherapy and targeted therapy as single drugs.

German cases now exceed 4 million
---------------------------------
Germany has now recorded more than 4 million cases since the pandemic began, according to the RKI public health institute. Health officials registered more than 10 400 infections in the 24 hours to [Sun 5 Sep 2021].

U.K. looking at vaccine passports for big venues
------------------------------------------------
The government is "looking at by the end of September [2021]" requiring vaccine certification for entry to large venues where infection risk may be higher, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said in an interview with Sky News. He also said the government hasn't yet decided on whether to roll out vaccines to healthy 12- to 15-year-olds, but if the move does go ahead, then parental consent would be needed.

[2] mRNA vaccines: comparison
Date: Sat 4 Sep 2021
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QYSFLQDWLU6A


Ten months ago, the results of large clinical trials appeared almost too good to be true: 2 messenger RNA vaccines reduced symptomatic COVID-19 cases by more than 90% in almost every group that got them. Now, subtle differences between the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. vaccines are emerging across patient groups over time. One small U.S. study found waning levels of antibodies with Pfizer's vaccine, particularly in an older group of people. And a larger study from Belgium found that Moderna's shot may generate more antibodies than Pfizer's.

But what this all means in the real world is still unclear. While billions of doses of vaccine have been administered around the world, researchers are still working to understand the nuances of how long their protection lasts, and how it differs from one person to another.

Getting answers to those questions is a crucial step to determine who might need a booster shot, especially for older people and those with weakened immune systems. The more infectious delta variant, the rise of which has coincided with slight drop-offs in vaccine effectiveness, has raised the stakes and led governments to begin rolling out a 3rd dose of the shots. The Food and Drug Administration will hear public arguments on [17 Sep 2021] about whether or not to go ahead with booster shots of Pfizer's vaccine.

Much of the focus has been on levels of antibodies, which serve as one of the immune system's front-line defenses. One theory about Moderna's vaccine is that it creates more of those antibodies because it uses a larger dose and the 2 doses are administered over a one-week longer period than Pfizer's.

But antibodies are just one component of immunity, and it isn't clear if they are the most important one, especially over the long term.

"Do we know an antibody level that protects against COVID? The simple answer is we still do not know that," said Paul Burton, Moderna's chief medical officer, in a [Fri 3 Sep 2021] call with reporters. Still, Moderna's trial data show that a 3rd shot 6 months after the 2nd raises antibody levels "well into that comfort zone" back above levels seen in the initial phase 3 trial.

Immune memory
-------------
Along with shorter-lasting antibodies, COVID vaccines also trigger what's essentially a long-term memory in the immune system. That memory appears to increase and become better at making variant-fighting antibodies over time. That longer-term protection, which includes what are known as T cells and memory B cells, is harder to measure in the lab than antibodies. But it's thought to play an important role in preventing severe illness and hospitalizations.

But less than a year into the vaccine campaign, much of the research has focused on vaccine-derived antibodies, which help lock onto an invading pathogen and tag it for attack by the rest of the immune system.

A small U.S. study examined a group of nursing-home patients and staff who got 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. It found antibody levels in both groups waned over time. But the 120 residents in the study, who had a median age of 76, started out with a much lower level of antibodies than the younger staff did.

Over a number of months, "they end up in an even worse spot," said David Canaday, an infectious disease physician, and professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, who led the study, which was released as a preprint before publication in late August [2021]. [Significant reduction in humoral immunity among healthcare workers and nursing home residents 6 months after COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. David H. Canaday, Oladayo A. Oyebanji, et al., medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.15.21262067; this version posted 20 Aug 2021].

Two weeks after a 2nd inoculation, neutralizing antibodies had fallen below the level of detection in 16% of nursing home residents who hadn't had COVID before their immunizations. Six months post-vaccination, 70% had extremely low levels. By contrast, only 16% of the 64 younger care-givers had such meager antibodies 6 months out, the research found. "Definitely the protection will drop a fair amount with these levels of antibody loss," Canaday said. But it's unlikely such a loss will mean zero protection.

A 2nd study compared antibody levels in 167 University of Virginia health system staff immunized with either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Antibodies levels after the 2nd vaccine were about 50% higher in people who got the Moderna shot, the researchers said [Thu 2 Sep 2021] in a letter in Jama Network Open.

Subtle differences
------------------
But when the researchers dug further, they found that the difference was mostly explained by an inferior response to the Pfizer vaccine in people 50 and older, says Jeffrey Wilson, an immunologist at the University of Virginia and co-author on the study. With the Moderna vaccine, the antibody response after 2 shots didn't differ dramatically by age group.

"There are probably subtle differences between Pfizer and Moderna," said Wilson. "Whether that has a clinically meaningful impact on protection against the virus remains to be seen." The University of Virginia's finding is broadly consistent with a bigger study of more than 1600 workers at a hospital in Belgium that found people who got the Moderna vaccine had, on average, double the antibody levels of those who got Pfizer. But the Belgian study, which was published [Mon 30 Aug 2021] in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found Moderna produced higher antibody levels in all age groups. [Steensels D, Pierlet N, Penders J, Mesotten D and Heylen L. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response Following Vaccination With BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. JAMA. Published online 30 Aug 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.15125]

None of the studies measured whether fewer antibodies result in less protection over time. But as the delta variant has taken over, emerging data increasingly show a deteriorating level of protection from immunizations, leading to more reports of breakthrough infections where a vaccinated person becomes ill.

Protection against severe disease and hospitalization -- the most important public-health benefit of vaccination - has generally remained strong. "We're not seeing the hospitals filling up with vaccinated people," says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. "What we're seeing is mostly unvaccinated people still making up the bulk of the new cases."

[3] USA (Miami): deaths
Date: Sat 4 Sep 2021
Source: Huffington Post [edited]
https://news.yahoo.com/15-miami-dade-public-school-021517732.html


A 30-year teaching veteran was one of 15 Miami-Dade County public school staff members who died of COVID-19 in just 10 days as Florida continues to reel amid the continuing, overwhelming toll of an unfettered pandemic.

"It's a tremendous loss," said a school official, referring to the death of longtime teacher AC, 55, earlier this week.

"The number of lives that he impacted are countless. So many young men had the benefit of him intervening in their lives and pointing them in the right direction," Marcus Bright, who works with a local education program 5000 Role Models of Excellence, told NBC-6 TV.

AC taught at Holmes Elementary School in Miami's Liberty City area, which is a primarily Black neighborhood with 42% of the population living below the poverty line.

Local education officials haven't released the identities of the other teachers or staff members.

"The loss of any of our employees is one that is always profoundly felt as every member of this organization is considered a part of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools family," the district said in a statement. "We extend our hearts and prayers to the loved ones of those whose lives have recently been lost."

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has dismissed the importance of COVID-19 vaccinations and signed an executive order banning mask mandates at schools, issued no comment on the astounding death rate in the county schools system.

The state Health Department was sued earlier this week by the Florida Center for Government Accountability and Democratic state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith for not providing detailed, daily statistics about Florida's surging COVID-19 cases in violation of the state's open-records laws. The suit argues that the DeSantis administration is deliberately manipulating COVID-19 data to make it appear the problem was not as dire as it actually is.

"The DeSantis administration has consistently refused to release COVID-related public records, which not only hurts our efforts to contain this deadly virus, it is also unlawful," Smith said in a statement after the suit was filed.

"That's why we're suing them -- to obtain the public records our constituents are entitled to under the Florida Constitution and to force the state to resume daily COVID dashboard reporting and avoid future litigation on this matter."

Florida is in the grip of its deadliest wave of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. As of mid-August [2021], the state was averaging 244 deaths a day, eclipsing the previous peak of 227 a year ago. The state reported 2345 deaths and over 129 000 cases this week. Hospitals have had to rent refrigerated units to store bodies.

The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19, however, eased slightly over the past 2 weeks from 17 000 to 14 200.

[15 deaths in 10 days is extremely disturbing and likely a consequence of Florida's policy of dismissing the importance of COVID-19 vaccinations and banning mask mandates at schools, with penalties for non-compliance. The need for vaccines and masks is based on scientific evidence. The Florida policy is baseless and clearly a danger to the public. With schools open, it is especially dangerous. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 14 countries including India (39 521), UK (36 880), the USA (35 586), Iran (25 870), Malaysia (20 396), the Philippines (19 951), Turkey (19 391), Russia (18 645), Japan (17 478), Mexico (15 586), Thailand (15 452), Vietnam (13 137), Brazil (12 915), and France (10 410), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6429 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 3 Sep 2021 to late 4 Sep 2021). There appears to be a weekend drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 1.8% increase in daily reported cases and a 19.7% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 221.54 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.58 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
