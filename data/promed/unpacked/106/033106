Doctors from the Luis Razetti Hospital in Barinas say that 5 people have been admitted to the health center allegedly infected with leptospirosis. They contracted the disease after bathing in a lagoon in the town of Boconoito, Portuguesa State.

Patients are under observation, due to the deadly effect of this disease. The doctors took samples for evaluation at the National Institute of Hygiene in Caracas. While leptospirosis is [being] confirmed, patients are given preventive treatment in search of their recovery, reported La Patilla.

At the Razetti Hospital in Barinas, the death of a young doctor due to hemorrhagic fever was also confirmed, according to epidemiologist Cecilia Chávez, who was asked for an explanation on how this disease is spread, which is also deadly.

Despite the cases that were registered in the 1st health center in Barinas, the authorities of the Luis Razetti Hospital have not made an official statement to alert the population about what they should do to avoid more infections, especially in the winter season.

[The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is a federation made up of 23 states. Barinas and Portugesa are adjacent states in west central Venezuela. A map showing the location of Venezuelan states can be found at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Venezuela_Division_Politica_Territorial.svg. Barinas (pop. 353 442 residents in 2011), a city and the capital of the state of Barinas, is 45 km [28 mi] southwest of the town of Boconoíto in the Portugesa State. A map showing the locations of Barinas and Boconoito can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Barinas,+Venezuela/Boconoito,+Portuguesa,+Venezuela.

The news report above says the diagnosis of leptospirosis in 5 people from Barinas, who bathed in a lagoon in Bononoito, awaits results of laboratory tests submitted to the National Institute of Hygiene in Caracas. However, the news report also mentions the death of a doctor in Barinas due to "hemorrhagic fever," but does not elaborate on the suspected microbial diagnosis in the deceased doctor or any epidemiologic link between the deceased doctor and the 5 cases, if leptospirosis is suspected in all these patients.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) due to Seoul hantavirus and leptospirosis due to leptospira bacteria, both rodent-borne infections, may have similar clinical presentations. Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis. Dr. Clement also pointed out that concomitant leptospiral and hantaviral infection can occur in the same patient, and diagnostic testing should encompass both diseases.
