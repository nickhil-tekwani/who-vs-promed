The St. Clair County Health Department said the source of the salmonella outbreak during the Belleville [Illinois] Chili Cook-off in October 2016 has not yet been determined and it has taken "several" more calls from people who believe they might have gotten sick. "We're continuing to get other information from other folks," Executive Director Barb Hohlt said Friday [4 Nov 2016]. "We've gotten several phone calls since then."

Since the county health department issued a public health advisory Thursday, 3 Nov 2016, it's been investigating the outbreak along with the Illinois Department of Public Health. Hohlt said the county health department was notified of less than a dozen confirmed salmonellosis cases on Saturday, 29 Oct 2016. After that, Hohlt said they started reaching out to those individuals for interviews "to see if there was a common denominator." By Thursday, 3 Nov 2016, Hohlt said the county health department had identified a link. The individuals had said they attended the annual Belleville Chili Cook-off on 8 Oct 2016.

The cook-off was hosted by the Greater Belleville Chamber of Commerce, which released a statement saying it had been notified on Thursday of the salmonella outbreak "with possible ties to the Chili Cook-off." The event was held 7-8 Oct 2016 in downtown Belleville. "We are working closely with the health department to help aid in the investigation as currently the source of the outbreak is unknown," the Chamber of Commerce said. "The Chamber provides each Chili Cook-off vendor with a checklist along with health and food guidelines that are received from the St. Clair County Health Department. Vendors are not allowed to serve food until a St. Clair County Health Department official has inspected their site for proper sanitation and food handling."

"As a result, we are working with the health department on changes that can be implemented going forward to help reduce the possibility of an outbreak at future festivals in St. Clair County," the statement continued.

[From this posting, it is unclear how many individuals may have attended the cook-off from out of state and may not be aware of this cluster. Since chili is served hot, it is likely that something was undercooked, some sort of issue with kitchen hygiene occurred with someone's chili or the vehicle for transmission was an alternative food source. - Mod.LL
