North Korea confirms bird flu epidemic
-----------------------------------------
North Korea's official news agency on Monday confirmed that the
communist regime recently slaughtered thousands of chickens after an
outbreak of bird flu at chicken farms in Pyongyang.

It is the 1st known case of bird flu, which has wreaked havoc in
Southeast Asia and China, to strike North Korea.

"2 or 3 chicken factories, including one in Hadang, was recently hit
by avian influenza," the North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
quoted an anti-epidemic council official as saying.

The Hadang factory is one of 5, constructed in December 2002, that
breed and process chickens in Pyongyang, the Unification Ministry
said.

The official added that the Pyongyang regime has practiced emergency
measures to prevent the disease from spreading to other regions. The
KCNA said there has been no reported human case of bird flu in North
Korea.

"We've already cremated tens of thousands of chickens," the official
said. "Experts and scientists are also cooperating to eradicate the
virus."

Rumors were circulating early this month [March 2005] about an
outbreak of avian influenza in North Korea, making a trader in Seoul
indefinitely delay its plan to sell North Korean chicken in South
Korea.

After receiving news of the unconfirmed outbreak, Porky Trading
Korea, the firm in Seoul, asked its North Korean counterparts 3 weeks
ago to delay chicken shipments. The trader was ready to send a ship
to the North Korean port of Nampo to ship 40 tons of North Korean
chicken. The company had planned to buy 2000 tons of North Korean
chicken this year [2005].

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Seoul said that the
outbreak of bird influenza in Pyongyang would have no impact on South
Korea, because no North Korean chicken or duck had been bought by
South Korea.

North Korea's state media has recently held campaigns against the
outbreak of bird flu, and set up quarantines at airports, sea ports
and border areas, while categorically giving assurances that the
country is completely free from the epidemic.

[Korea (Dem. People's Rep.), which became an OIE (World Organisation
for Animal Health) member-country in March 2001, is expected to
officially notify the said organization about this outbreak. This is
in line with article 1.1.2.3. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code
(2004) which says:

"Veterinary Administrators shall send to the Central Bureau a
notification from the Delegate of the country by telegram, fax or
e-mail, within 24 hours, of any of the following events:
a. 1st occurrence of a listed disease and/or infection in a country
or zone/compartment;
b. re-occurrence of a listed disease and/or infection in a country or
zone/compartment following a report declared the outbreak ended;
c. 1st occurrence of a new strain of a pathogen of an OIE listed
disease in a country or zone/compartment;
d. a sudden and unexpected increase in the distribution, incidence,
morbidity or mortality of a listed disease prevalent within a country
or zone/compartment;
e. an emerging disease with significant morbidity or mortality, or
zoonotic potential;
f. evidence of change in the epidemiology of a listed disease
(including host range, pathogenicity, strain), in particular if there
is a zoonotic impact."

Seemingly, the 1st (a) of the said notifiable events is the one
applicable to the North Korean situation, the relevant listed disease
being HPAI (Highly pathogenic avian influenza). Data on the subtyping
of the HPAI virus involved, with special attention to subtype H5N1,
are of particular importance. - Mod.AS]
