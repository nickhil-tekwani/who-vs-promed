The Mysterious disease of Murshidabad
---------------------
National Institute of Virology could ultimately isolate Influeza virus A
(type not known) from clinical materials of some children suffering from
the disease. However, the Government authorities strongly believe that it
was due to malnutrition and pollution. So they have taken all measures on
that line ­ foods and purified drinking water were supplied to the area in
sufficient amount. The disease has been contained and hopefully the crisis
is now over. The ongoing monsoon in that area may have also a part in this
process.
In this connection I should have mention an account of a child death in
that area published by a daily local Newspaper  Ganashakti a few days
ago. One child died while drinking milk without evidence of any previous
disease. What does it prove? It clearly indicates how true is Garys milk
contamination theory given in the comment of the very first report.There
was a general strike for one day in the district in protest against the
death of so many children. Thanks to Gary N. Greenberg, Andrew M. Davis,
Daniel L. Sudakin, Raymond Weinstein, Patricia Doyle, Gene Finneran,
Moderators MPP and LM and others for their suggestions which were forwarded
to the Government.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Das for continued contributions on
this as yet undiagnosed outbreak. The identification of influenza A in some
specimens is noted, but the initial descriptions of this outbreak did not
seem consistent with influenza (as per the first ProMED-mail posting, "high
fever, breathlessness, convulsion, increased salivation, followed by
stiffening of jaws within 5-6 hours of the onset of the disease and death".)
In ProMED-mail posting Undiagnosed deaths, children - India (W. Bengal)
(05) 20030616.1488 there was a discussion from Daniel L Sudakin MD MPH
Assistant Professor (Principal Investigator, National Pesticide Medical
Monitoring Program) Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology
Oregon State University which raised the possibility of pentachlorophenol
(PCP) poisoning as a possible etiology as acute intoxication presents as
high fever with rapid progression to life threatening symptoms.
In the 28 Jun 1996 MMWR 45(25);545-549 article on Pentachlorophenol
Poisoning in Newborn Infants -- St. Louis, Missouri, April-August 1967
(accessible at: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00042776.htm>)
there is a description of an outbreak of clinical illness in newborns
exposed to skin absorption of sodium pentachlorophenate (a sodium salt of
pentachlorophenol) residues on diapers. Extoxnet
<http://ace.ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/pips/pentachl.htm> mentions a high
acute exposure to PCP can cause elevated temperature, profuse sweating,
dehydration, loss of appetite, decreased body weight, nausea, and
neurological effects such as tremors, uncoordinated movement, leg pain,
muscle twitching, and coma.
Further information on the results of toxicologic studies would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
