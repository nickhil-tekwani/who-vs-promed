Virus Detection Puts Winegrape Industry on Alert
Monday 31 May, 1999 (2:17pm AEST)
The discovery of a new disease has put the grape industry on alert with
researchers at South Australia's Waite Institute diagnosing the devastating
Grapevine B virus in samples from Victoria.
The infected vine samples are believed to have arrived in Australia from
Israel in 1993, and while the imports were originally cleared by quarantine
officials, the extent of subsequent plantings isn't known.
Professor Bob Symons of Waite Diagnostics says the spread of the disease
would be disastrous for viticultural industries. Minor to severe yield
reduction from unthrifty plants and death of vines are consequences of
the disease.

[According to reports from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, plants
of Jade Seedless grape in two vineyards at Mildura, Victoria were found to
be infected by the virus following DNA testing. Further tests to determine
if the virus has spread to other parts of Australia are to follow. A
voluntary moratorium on the movement of Jade Seedless grape has been
imposed. The virus is readily transmitted by grafting, and slow spread of
the virus by the grapevine mealybug (_Pseudococcus maritimus_) has
been reported to occur in vineyards in Israel, Mexico, and South Africa
