Laboratory tests on specimens from animals in the village of
Gardashobain in the Khachmaz region after attacks by jackals have
shown that they were infected by rabies. According to information
provided by Yolchu Khanveli, the press secretary of the state
veterinary service at the Ministry of Agriculture, during the past
few days, no cases of attacks on villagers have been recorded.
Previously, some cases of attacks have been reported in the village
of Gardashoba, which is surrounded by forests, when 4 children and an
old man were attacked by jackals. All have received appropriate
post-exposure treatment. Khanveli said that all cattle and other
livestock in the village have been immunized now against rabies.
During the past few days, one child had died as a result of rabies
virus infection in the village of Neftchala. In this case, the
parents were responsible for the fatality, as they did not seek
medical care for the child. The state [veterinary] service stated
that they were not solely responsible for rabies control but had been
assisted by the executive bodies of Khachmaz region, the Association
of Hunters, and the Ministries of Health, Ecology and natural resources.
