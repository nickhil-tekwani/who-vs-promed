A 2nd type of mosquito that carries the Zika virus has been discovered in Mission Viejo [California], according to a Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District official.

Asian tiger mosquitoes were found last week at a home near the corner of Olympiad Road and Melinda Road, Dave Leckness, a trustee with the Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control, said Saturday [13 Aug 2016].

The mosquitoes were detected using several traps on the exterior of the home.

Samples were collected from the traps on Tuesday [9 Aug 2016] and Vector Control inspectors conducted a thorough inspection of the home the following day, Leckness said.

The residents, who weren't identified, are experiencing bites and have observed mosquitoes outside and inside their home, he added.

They have been supplied with an aspirator to collect any adult mosquitoes they find and Vector Control inspectors are slated to place additional traps around the property.

A Vector Control investigation team will also be deployed to the neighborhood to determine the extent of the Asian tiger [mosquito] infestation, Leckness said.

"This coming week we will treat it aggressively," he said. "We want to keep the mosquitoes out of here ... it (Zika) frightens us."

Prior to the discovery of the Asian tiger mosquitoes, yellow fever mosquitoes, most likely to transmit the Zika virus, were found in Mission Viejo.

Yellow fever and Asian tiger mosquitoes are not dependent on standing water to breed, unlike the mosquito that transmits West Nile virus, Jared Dever, spokesman for Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District, has said.

Mosquitoes that carry Zika can lay eggs in empty containers, such as a gardening pot, and survive for more than 6 months until rainfall.

Mosquitoes can only transmit the Zika virus after it bites a person who has the virus in their blood.

So far in California, Zika virus infections have been documented only in people who were infected while traveling outside the United States or through sexual contact with an infected traveler, according to the California Department of Public Health.

As of Friday [12 Aug 2016], there have been 153 travel-associated Zika virus infections in California. Los Angeles County has 34 infections; Orange County has 10, San Bernardino has 7 and Riverside County has 5.

There has been no local mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus in California.

The virus poses a danger to pregnant women. Babies have been born with smaller than normal heads -- or microcephaly, and in severe cases, brain damage.

But many people infected with Zika virus won't have symptoms or will only have mild symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The most common are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis.

There is no specific medicine to treat Zika.

[Both _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 12 years (see archives listed below). Most localities are in Southern California. _Ae. aegypti_ continues to spread in Orange County in Southern California. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ continued to be found in new localities in Southern California in 2015 and now again in 2016, and some of these California localities are places where both species have been reported in earlier ProMED-mail posts. The reports so far do not indicate that the populations of these mosquitoes are abundant, so it seems that there is little chance of sustaining ongoing transmission of Zika, dengue or chikungunya viruses currently.
