A mysterious hepatitis that causes liver failure in most horses has now been linked to an unusual virus.

For almost 100 years, veterinarians have puzzled over the cause of Theiler's disease, a mysterious type of equine hepatitis that is linked to blood products and causes liver failure in up to 90 percent of afflicted animals.

A team of US scientists has now discovered that the disease is caused by a virus that shares just 35 percent of its amino acid sequences with its closest-known relative. The team named it Theiler's disease-associated virus (TDAV), and published the discovery in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see item 2 below].

Led by Amy Kistler at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Emeryville, California, the team responded to an outbreak of Theiler's disease at a farm in which 8 horses had suddenly developed hepatitis after being injected with an antitoxin to prevent them from developing botulism. The researchers used next-generation sequencing to analyse RNA samples from the antitoxin and from 2 of the horses, and assembled the complete genome of the new virus. The virus was found in every one of the 8 horses, as well as in the animal (from a different farm) that was the source of the contaminated antitoxin.

"In the span of a few months, we were able to sequence and validate a virus that had gone undetected for almost a century," says Kistler. She thinks that traditional virus-hunting techniques failed to find TDAV because they rely on strong similarities to known viruses, or on the ability to culture the mystery culprit. By contrast, her team sequenced everything in their samples -- an approach "that meant we didn't have to know what we were looking for", she says.

To better understand the role of the virus, the team inoculated 4 healthy horses with the contaminated antitoxin. Within 10 weeks, all of them carried TDAV in their bloodstream, and one later showed rising levels of liver enzymes that suggested liver disease.

Although the researchers did not purify the virus before injecting it into the horses, Pablo Murcia, a virologist from the University of Glasgow, UK, says that "they have a strong case: I will be very surprised if TDAV turns out not to be the cause of equine serum hepatitis. Now, a new question arises," he says, "where does this virus come from?".

It is also possible that there is another unknown virus behind Theiler's disease. After all, human hepatitis can be caused by at least 5 viruses.

TDAV belongs to the family _Flaviviridae_, which includes the viruses behind yellow fever, dengue fever, and hepatitis C. It is most closely associated with a genus of newly discovered viruses called Pegivirus, and is the 1st of these to be convincingly linked to disease.

"The challenges in culturing [pegiviruses] mean that we're only now getting an understanding of how widely distributed and significant they are," says James Wood, who studies animal infections at the University of Cambridge, UK. He hints that some studies on new pegiviruses may be published in the future.

Abstract
--------
Theiler's disease is an acute hepatitis in horses that is associated with the administration of equine blood products; its etiologic agent has remained unknown for nearly a century. Here, we used massively parallel sequencing to explore samples from a recent Theiler's disease outbreak. Metatranscriptomic analysis of the short sequence reads identified a 10.5-kb sequence from a previously undescribed virus of the _Flaviviridae_ family, which we designate "Theiler's disease-associated virus" (TDAV). Phylogenetic analysis clusters TDAV with GB viruses of the recently proposed Pegivirus genus, although it shares only 35.3 percent amino acid identity with its closest relative, GB virus D. An epidemiological survey of additional horses from 3 separate locations supports an association between TDAV infection and acute serum hepatitis. Experimental inoculation of horses with TDAV-positive plasma provides evidence that several weeks of viremia preceded liver injury and that liver disease may not be directly related to the level of viremia. Like hepatitis C virus, the best characterized _Flaviviridae_ species known to cause hepatitis, we find TDAV is capable of efficient parenteral transmission, engendering acute and chronic infections associated with a diversity of clinical presentations ranging from subclinical infection to clinical hepatitis.

[Infectious, toxic, and undefined etiologies may cause acute hepatitis. Clinical signs may appear suddenly with horses appearing lethargic, anorectic, and icteric. Photosensitization, diarrhea, and clotting abnormalities also may be seen. Neurologic signs resulting from hepatic encephalopathy and/or hypoglycemia can be most severe in animals with acute fulminant liver disease. Signs of endotoxemia may be present, depending on the underlying etiology and the ability of the Kupffer cells to remove endotoxin from the systemic circulation. Increases in serum SDH and AST activities indicate acute hepatocellular injury. GGT is increased with cholestasis secondary to hepatocyte swelling. Cholestasis results in hyperbilirubinemia, with the direct (conjugated) fraction ranging from 15-35 percent of total in horses. Increased serum total bile acid concentration, decreased glucose and BUN concentrations, and prolonged coagulation times become evident as hepatic function progressively worsens. Anorexia can lead to hypokalemia. The CBC is variable because it may reflect an inflammatory response with a neutrophilia or endotoxemia with a neutropenia, increased band neutrophils, and toxic changes.

Idiopathic acute hepatic disease (IAHD) is the most common cause of acute hepatitis in horses. It is primarily a disease of adult horses. IAHD is also known as Theiler's disease, serum hepatitis, and postvaccinal hepatitis.

Onset of clinical signs is acute. Acute mortality may be 50-60 percent with overall mortality as high as 88 percent in affected horses. Horses with IAHD typically present with anorexia, hepatic encephalopathy, and icterus. The CNS signs are variable, ranging from lethargy to aggression or maniacal behavior, central blindness, and ataxia. Photosensitivity and discolored urine due to high bilirubin concentrations may be seen. Fever is present in approximately 50 percent of cases. Weight loss (uncommon), ventral edema, jugular pulses, ileus, and acute respiratory distress have been seen in some horses with IAHD. These findings suggest there may be a subclinical phase before development of overt hepatic failure. Intravascular hemolysis with hemoglobinuria may be seen in some terminal cases. Most cases are sporadic, but outbreaks with several horses involved have been reported. Recognition of IAHD in one horse indicates horses on the same premises should be carefully observed for clinical or serum biochemical signs of hepatic disease.

Diagnosis is based on history, abrupt onset of clinical signs, and laboratory alterations suggestive of hepatic insufficiency. In some cases, the liver is shrunken and difficult to visualize with ultrasonographic examination. A definitive diagnosis can be made only by liver biopsy. Differential diagnoses include acute pyrrolizidine toxicosis, hepatotoxins, acute infectious hepatitis, acute mycotoxicosis, cerebral disease, and hemolytic disease.

There is no specific therapy for IAHD. Supportive therapy (IV crystalloid fluids with added glucose and potassium) and treatment of the hepatic encephalopathy may be successful. Stressful situations, such as moving the animal or weaning the mare's foal, may exacerbate the clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy and should be avoided. Sedation should be used only to control behavior that could lead to injury of the animal and to allow therapeutic procedures.

Recovery depends on the degree of hepatocellular necrosis. Affected horses that remain stable for 3-5 days and that continue to eat often recover. Decreases in the SDH and prothrombin time along with improvement in appetite are the best positive predictive indicators of recovery. Horses with rapid progression of clinical signs, uncontrollable encephalopathy, hemorrhage, or hemolysis have a poor prognosis. For affected horses that do recover, the long-term prognosis is good. In some horses, progressive weight loss and death may occur during the months after the initial clinical signs.

If the virus has been identified will there be a vaccine, or a prevention strategy, and how soon?
