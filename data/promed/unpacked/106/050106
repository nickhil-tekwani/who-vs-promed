Some 20 new outbreaks of bluetongue in cattle have been reported in France since 16 Aug [2016], bringing the total number of cases reported to the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) to 317. All of the cases were detected as part of active surveillance of herds having as little as 4 cattle to well over 400, with only one outbreak of the disease reporting more than one animal infected.

In a total of 2754 susceptible cattle, 22 positive cases of bluetongue were detected. However, no animal died from the disease or had to be destroyed/slaughtered because of it, according to the OIE. The reported outbreaks of the disease occurred mainly in the centre of France, with the Allier and Puy-De-Dome regions of the country most affected.

Most outbreaks were resolved in a matter of days, but there are still 2 cases on-going which were detected in August and 4 cases still continuing which were reported in September [2016].

Bluetongue is a viral disease which affects ruminant animals. The disease is not contagious and is carried by a midge which is mostly found in warm climates. Controls such as screening, surveillance, disinfection and the control of disease-transmitting midges have been put in place to deal with the outbreaks, the OIE said.

The extent of the restriction zones has not changed as a result of these cases and has been the same since April 2016. Voluntary vaccination is also under way in France with a free provision of doses by the state.

[The above information is included, in detail, in France's follow-up report No. 42 to the OIE, submitted 13 Sep 2016, with an interactive map showing the locations of the 20 new "outbreaks", in which 22 "cases" were diagnosed. The report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=20948.

All of the cases were detected as part of active surveillance as part of pre-movement testing, and all were in cattle where just 1 or 2 animals tested positive out of the consignment (variable numbers). None were clinical cases. However, in 6 cattle, with low CT values, indicating high levels of viral RNA, virus was also isolated, confirming that virus is now circulating again in these Central regions. France has sentinel surveillance in place along the north coast, in the free areas, as well as the regions on the border of the restriction zone. The extent of the restriction zone has not changed as a result of these cases and has been the same since April 2016.
