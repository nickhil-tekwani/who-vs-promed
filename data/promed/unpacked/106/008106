The Sarasota County Health Department will test the pool and spa area of IslandWalk at the West Villages development in North Port to determine whether they are the source of a legionnaires' disease outbreak that occurred at the gated community [Fri 23 Feb 2018].

Tom Higginbotham, environmental health director for the Sarasota County Health Department, said special test kits arrived [Tue 27 Feb 2018] and water from the hot tub and two pools will be tested. The health department's investigation should take about 2 days, Higginbotham said. While the spa and 2 pools are the main focus, the testing may be expanded beyond that to the community's irrigation system since it draws water from untreated lakes. Regardless of the outcome, Higginbotham said the health department will likely recommend that the hot tub be sanitized with the highest levels of chlorine possible.

Legionnaires' disease was first diagnosed at IslandWalk by Dr Ahmed Farooq, an infectious disease physician at Venice Regional Bayfront Health, who called the health department after he found the 1st case, then determined that the IslandWalk hot tub was the common denominator when he diagnosed the 2nd case. "The most important thing is this is not a contagious disease, which means it cannot be spread from person to person," Farooq said. "It is a waterborne pathogen; that means it usually lies in the water, and when the water is aerosolized, you inhale the bacteria. It goes to your lungs, and it causes the disease." Farooq could not provide a definitive number but said quite a few cases have been treated. A Sarasota Memorial Hospital spokeswoman said 3 cases were diagnosed at the hospital last weekend [24-25 Feb 2018] but had no additional data.

Macey Kessler, a spokeswoman for DiVosta Homes, said in an email, "We were alerted to the issue at approximately at 4 pm on [Fri 23 Feb 2018]. The pool and spa were closed within 30 minutes of being contacted, and residents were notified. "The facilities will remain closed pending further testing," she continued. "We are working with the Sarasota Department of Health to get this issue resolved. Our 1st priority is the safety of our residents."

IslandWalk residents voiced concern that other common areas, such as the community and event center buildings may be sources for the disease as well. Both Farooq and Higginbotham dispelled those concerns. "They have independent air conditioning systems; the systems are isolated," Higginbotham said. "There would be no water flowing into the systems."

Higginbotham spent about 2 hours [Tue 27 Feb 2018] conducting a town hall meeting in the event center at IslandWalk, trying to alleviate concerns about the gated community's common buildings and explain about legionella, its exposure risk, and prevention. Higginbotham said he stressed that as long as the water features at IslandWalk are maintained and cleaned, chances are an outbreak will not reoccur.

The Sarasota County Health Department regulates about 1400 public and community pools. He characterized a cluster of cases, such as those at IslandWalk, a rare event. "Legionella itself is not that rare, but for there to be a cluster like this can be years apart," he added. The health department visits every public pool and spa in Sarasota County four times a year. 2 of those are state inspections, when a variety of contaminants are tested -- including enteric and _Escherichia coli_ bacteria. Higginbotham said Castle Group's maintenance records show that it has kept up with regular testing, and the spa has been regularly drained once a week." [Those are] all things that we are going to have to verify during our investigation," he added.

The Sarasota County Health Department is investigating an outbreak of legionnaires' disease at the IslandWalk at the West Villages community in North Port (Florida). The Department of Health advised community officials to shut down the pool and spa on [Fri 23 Feb 2018].

Residents say at least 11 people were taken to area hospitals for treatment.

[North Port is a city with a population of 57 357 residents in 2010 in southern Sarasota County, Florida, United States. Located just north of the town of Port Charlotte (in Charlotte County, Florida), North Port is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota Metropolitan Statistical Area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Port,_Florida). A map of North Port can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/North+Port,+FL.

IslandWalk at the West Villages is a gated community of single-family homes with a clubhouse and pool/spa (http://www.islandwalkvillage.com).

In addition to the community's pool/spa, the 1st news report above mentions that the community's landscape irrigation system is also suspected to be a potential source for the outbreak of legionnaires' disease in North Port, since landscape irrigation systems can generate aerosols during its operation. Inhalation of legionella in the form of an aerosol is a common mode of acquiring legionnaires' disease. Landscape irrigation systems can draw water from untreated lakes or reclaimed water in Florida (http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ae449 and http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ae448). Reclaimed or recycled water is wastewater from a sewer system that has been treated by a wastewater treatment plant to a level consistent with its intended use (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water).

Although legionellosis outbreaks have not been reportedly associated with use of reclaimed water, _Legionella_ species are commonly found in reclaimed water (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4584268/pdf/pathogens-04-00470.pdf).

Genotyping of clinical isolates, if available, will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical isolates with the genotypes of environmental isolates will help establish transmission pathways. - Mod.ML
