Background data on leishmaniasis in Baluchistan & Sind (Pakistan)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In fact in 2003 I visited with my colleagues from Eastern Mediterranean
Regional Office (EMRO) the Larkana and Dadu foci, which are located 300 km
northeast of Karachi in Sindh Province. The Province is located between
Baluchistan on the west, and on the east it borders India and Radjasthan
State. Both are well-known endemic areas for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).
The disease appeared in Sindh province in 2001, and the current CL epidemic
was reported to WHO Office, Islamabad in early 2002. An assessment survey
based on a case control study was immediately carried out by WHO office in
Pakistan in February 2002. 58 villages were selected for a case control
study with stratified samples. 15 people were trained. 103 active CL cases
were diagnosed. The average prevalence in Dadu District appeared to be 6.1
percent and in Larkana 3.3 percent. However, some villages reported point
prevalences from 8-20 percent. Active lesions were found more often in
males than females, and the mean age of patients was 15.6 years in Dadu and
17.5 in Larkana. Mean number of cases per household was 1.78 in Dadu and
168 in Larkana. The high proportion of active lesions compared to scars (77
vs 95 percent) confirmed the recent introduction of the parasite in the area.
Most of patients were farmers with low socio-economic level (200 to 300 Rs
per month). They live in a rural setting, where they cultivate seasonal
crops such as wheat and rice. However, due to a severe drought during the
last 3 years, crops have been severely affected.
The following were some of the clinical factors that favor Zoonotic
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL):
- No recidivans cases
- No family cases
- Short incubation period between the infective bite and the appearance of
lesions during the transmission season
- Short duration of lesions
- More males infected than females, and a high percentage of the lesions
located on the legs -- both factors suggesting an occupational association
(i.e. doing field work in the evening in areas close to the rodent burrows).
The rodent burrows are the perfect biotope for sandfly breeding and resting
sites, because temperature and humidity are constant, organic remnants
allow maturation of sandfly larvae, and the sandflies have the opportunity
of taking a bloodmeal on the rodents.
Conclusions:
-The epidemiology corresponded to the zoonotic form of cutaneous
leishmaniasis (ZCL), and it was confirmed through the biochemical typing
(isoenzymes)of human isolates in Montpellier, France. All isolates were _L.
major_.
Some questions remain unanswered:
- The identification of the sandfly vector(s) (_P.papatasi_ and/or _P.
salehi_),
- The identification of rodents which are animal reservoirs (_Meriones
crassus_, _M. lybicus_, _M. hurrianae_, _Tatara indica_).
- Why did the epidemic occur? Facilitating factors?
There are at least 2 possible explanations:
- Due to a severe drought in recent years, there was an increased movement
of seasonal workers and nomads from Baluchistan who facilitated the
importation of the disease to Upper Sindh. As reported by local
dermatologists, the disease appeared first in villages of Upper Sindh,
close to the mountainous belt bordering Baluchistan. The importation of the
disease into a non- immune population led to the epidemic.
- Due to the drought and the subsequent reduced harvests, rodent
populations had less food available in the field, which probably forced
them to move to the peri-domestic environment, allowing frequent
transmission to humans.

[This very informative report is most w
elcomed and greatly clarifies the earlier recent posts on leishmaniasis in
Sind (Pakistan). It is interesting to learn that the parasite has been
identified as _Leishmania major_, and therefore involves rodents as
reservoir hosts, and not _L.tropica_, which is not known to have non-human
reservoir hosts._L. major_ was first discovered in rodents in south-central
Asian areas of the former USSR. As Dr Desjeux says, the most likely reservoir
hosts are _Meriones_ species (gerbils), which are granivorous and nocturnal
in their habits.
In north-west India _Meriones hurrianae_ and _M. libycus_ are thought to be
the main vertebrate hosts, and may prove to be the reservoir hosts in the
Sind area of Pakistan. I agree that _Phlebotomus papatasi_ and _P. salehi_
have to be the prime suspects in vector transmission, although other species
may transmit the parasites among rodent populations. - Mod.MS]

Visceral, cutaneous, and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis are the 3 major
clinical forms of leishmaniasis caused by various species of the genus
_Leishmania_ .Visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar, caused by _L. donovani_
is the form that poses a major health problem in different parts of India.
In India both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis are found. But
characteristically, these 2 conditions are not found in the same regions.
Kala-azar is restricted to the eastern states, while cutaneous
leishmaniasis is confined to a few foci in western India. Muco-cutaneous
leishmaniasis is not reported from India.
Indian kala-azar shows certain characteristics. First, it is not a zoonotic
but strictly an anthroponotic disease; no animal reservoirs are present.
Man is the only reservoir of infection and only human-sandfly-human
transmission occurs by the bite of anthrophilic _Phlebotomus_ species. This
is in contrast to the disease that is reported from South America, the
Mediterranean, Middle Asia, and east Africa, where dogs and other animals
are the important zoonotic reservoir of the disease. Second, post-kala-azar
dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), which is a non-ulcerative lesion of the skin,
is an important feature of the Indian kala-azar. The condition, which is
usually seen after completion of treatment and cure, occurs in 10 percent
and in 3 percent of cases of kala-azar in India and Africa, respectively.
PKDL in Indian kala-azar appears after a latent period of 2 years and may
even persist as long as 20 years. In contrast, PKDL in Africa appears
shortly after treatment and persists for only a few months. The importance
of PKDL lies in the fact that these cases with an enormous number of
accessible leishmanial parasites in the skin serve an important human
reservoir. And third, kala-azar in India is basically a rural disease
dependent on the availability of the vector species and prevalent living
conditions of the human host.
Indian Kala-azar is primarily seen in endemic form in Bihar and also in
West Bengal and parts of Uttar Pradesh. Kala-azar of late in India is
showing a rising trend and is also being reported from hitherto non-endemic
areas of Delhi, Jammu, and Kashmir Himachal Pradesh and also from Karnataka
and Maharastra. Sporadic cases of kala-azar have also been reported from
parts of Tamilnadu, Pondicherry, Orissa Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat.
Indian kala-azar has been known to exist in India for more than a century.
It is tempting to suggest that the leishmania parasite was introduced to
India from East Africa in the early 19th century, possibly from Sudan.
Although there was a marked decrease in the incidence of kala-azar
beginning in the 1950s, the disease continued to remain sporadic in several
states such as Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Tamilnadu, and Gujarat. In the
1970s there was a sudden resurgence of kala-azar, which was noted in 4
districts of the state as well as to other states.. Since 1985, a large
number of cases have been reported particularly from Bihar: 75 523 (1977),
59 619 (1996), and 56 000 (1995) [might this last year be a typo?]. Similar
outbreaks of kala-azar have also been reported from West Bengal. In 1980 an
outbreak of kala-azar was noted in 2 districts and gradually spread to
other districts. During 1998 the disease was endemic in 9 districts of the
state.
Resurgence of kala-azar in different parts of India may be due to many
factors, some of which include
(a)Man-made environmental changes that increase exposure of humans to the
sand fly vector,
(b) drug resistance of the parasite to conventional pentavalent antimonial
compounds,
(c) resistance of sand fly vectors to commonly used insecticides,
(d) the cases of PKDL, which serve as an interepidemic reservoir to
maintain infection in the community, and
(e) movement of susceptible populations into endemic areas due to increased
domestic travel and immigration.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis -- unlike kala-azar -- is zoonotic in India but is
restricted in its distribution. The ulcer at the site of the sand fly bite
is the typical skin lesion. Frequently, there are serous or purulent
discharges from the ulcer leading to the formation of scales or crusts. The
ulcer over a period of 2 years heals spontaneously, leaving behind a small,
flat, and depigmented scar. The condition transmitted by _P argentipes_
has been reported mainly from the areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan
along the Indo-Pakistani border. The condition is both anthroponotic and
zoonotic. The dog is the main animal reservoir of zoonotic cutaneous
leishmaniasis. More than 150 cases were reported from Bikaneer (Rajasthan)
during the 1970s. The cases started decreasing, and in 1992 only 11 cases
were reported.

[ProMED thanks Professor Parija for his informative comment and background
data. The question of whether leishmaniasis in India and Pakistan is
entirely anthroponotic clearly needs further study. - Mod.EP]
