Dahuk [province], famous for its high quality apples, has been ravaged by disease and shelling. These trees normally produce tonnes of apples every year. Many farmers' harvests have been completely destroyed by apple scab disease [which] has been spread all around the area.

[Due to] airstrikes, many farmers have been forced to abandon their farms, which in turn has led to the spread of apple scab, since the farmers have not been able to treat their trees with preventative products.

As well as being hit by disease, unusual weather has caused problems. [A farmer said], "The summer was very hot, and there was less water. Also, in spring when the apples were about to become ripe, [the area] was hit by hailstones which resulted in apple scab, and this year's [2018] harvest is gone."

[Scab disease (also called black spot) caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ affects apple, crab apple, loquat and a few other related tree species. It is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and losses can be more than 70 per cent. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit and are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures. Cracks in fruits may serve as entry points for other pathogens to cause rotting pre- or post-harvest.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain, and they are carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays per year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.

The related species _V. pirina_ causes scab on pear with similar symptoms. The pathogens are specific to pear and apple, respectively, and cannot cross-infect the other's hosts. Other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops.
