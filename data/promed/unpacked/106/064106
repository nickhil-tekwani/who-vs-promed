In response to comments from Ms. Harrington and Dr. Wilde:
The article in question (Wichita Eagle newspaper) was intended for
consumption by the general public. Although we all disagree with the
conclusions of Mr. Graves (including those of us involved with public
health at the state level in Kansas), the content was never meant to
be subjected to review by those in the rabies prevention arena.
Therefore, the conclusions were all-encompassing and intended as a
'general public' guideline.
Given a very short space to let the public in the U.S. know how to
respond to an increase in cases in wildlife species, is the best
response to quote page upon page from the Compendium Committee or
tell them how canine vaccination in Thailand is handled? I believe
instead that the public should be told to keep their pets currently
vaccinated. This step is the best way to protect domestic animals
from unrecognized exposure to rabies virus. As worldwide statistics
show, if individuals would keep their domestic animals, particularly
canines (both owned and feral), currently vaccinated, rabies as a
major cause of human fatalities would cease.

The article from the Wichita Eagle states "The local alert was issued
after a rabid skunk was caught 13 Apr 2002 in a confrontation with a
dog in Bel Aire, Graves said. It was unclear whether the skunk bit
the dog, which had been vaccinated against rabies, but the dog was
quarantined for observation for 10 days, Graves said. The skunk was
taken to Kansas State University, where it tested positive for
rabies."
Talking with animal control in Wichita, it appears that the newspaper
may have been confused by some of the information given. Kansas laws
on rabies control are consistent with the recommendations in the
Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, 2002 guidelines.
An owned and wanted dog with a current rabies vaccine that is exposed
to a known rabid animal would be revaccinated and observed for 45
days, which is what is occurring with the dog mentioned in the
article. A healthy owned and wanted dog that bites a human would be
confined and observed for 10 days and evaluated for signs of
illness. Neither the Kansas Department of Health and Environment nor
Wichita Animal Control would recommend quarantining a vaccinated dog
for 10 days with the scenario described.
