A team of researchers has now engineered a virus nanoparticle vaccine against _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_, tier 1 agents that pose serious threats to national security of the United States.

_B. anthracis_ and _Y. pestis_ are the pathogens that cause anthrax and plague, respectively. Using bacteriophage T4, the scientists developed the vaccine by incorporating key antigens of both _B. anthracis_ and _Y. pestis_ into one formulation.

Two doses of this vaccine provided complete protection against both inhalational anthrax and pneumonic plague in animal models. Even when animals were threatened with lethal doses of both anthrax lethal toxin and _Y. pestis_ CO92 bacteria, the vaccine was shown to be effective.

The study is published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

"This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents," the researchers noted in the study. Their results demonstrate that T4 nanoparticle is a novel platform for developing multivalent vaccines against pathogens of high public health concern.

Scientists have created a vaccine that protects against both anthrax and plague amid fears of terror threats. The bacteria behind anthrax and the pneumonic plague are 2 of the deadliest pathogens that could be used in warfare. Researchers from The Catholic University of America therefore created a single vaccine that could provide complete protection against the 2 diseases. Tests on animals showed the vaccine worked, even if they were infected with a deadly dose of either of the 2 killer pathogens.

"This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents," scientists led by Dr. Pan Tao said. The Washington DC-based team combined toxins from the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_, which cause anthrax and the pneumonic plague, respectively. These toxins are known to stimulate an immune response when a person becomes infected.

When given to mice, rats and rabbits, the vaccine gave complete protection against both diseases, even when the animals were infected with doses that are known to [be] deadly. The [vaccination] is thought to stimulate immune cells to clear the bacteria from the body. It is unclear when it may be available. The study was published in the journal of the American Society for Microbiology.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classes' anthrax and plague [bacteria] as the pathogens that pose the greatest threat to the national security of the US. Both anthrax and plague can kill in as little as 3 days.

The most deadly form of anthrax is inhaled (pneumonic), which can quickly cause sufferers to cough up blood and even fall into coma. If spores enter a person's lymph nodes, they can multiply and produce deadly toxins that spread throughout the body. This can lead to life-threatening internal bleeding, as well as the death of tissues and [failure of] major organs. Although there is an FDA-approved anthrax vaccine, it can cause the airways to collapse and general circulation failure.

There is no approved vaccine for plague; however, an experimental one is sometimes used in the military. It is unclear what the potential side effects of the newly-developed dual vaccine may be. The pneumonic form of plague is the most dangerous, which can cause patients to cough up blood and suffer sudden cardiac arrest. The bacteria for both diseases are most often inhaled as infected droplets.

As well as protecting against a potential terror threat, the researchers believe the plague vaccine could be used globally. The disease killed 209 people in Madagascar in an outbreak last year [2017].

Abstract
--------
_Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_, the causative agents of anthrax and plague, respectively, are 2 of the deadliest pathogenic bacteria that have been used as biological warfare agents. Although Biothrax is a licensed vaccine against anthrax, no Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine exists for plague. Here, we report the development of a dual anthrax-plague nanoparticle vaccine employing bacteriophage (phage) T4 as a platform. Using an in vitro assembly system, the 120- by 86-nm heads (capsids) of phage T4 were arrayed with anthrax and plague antigens fused to the small outer capsid protein Soc (9 kDa). The antigens included the anthrax protective antigen (PA) (83 kDa) and the mutated (mut) capsular antigen F1 and the low-calcium-response V antigen of the type 3 secretion system from _Y. pestis_ (F1mutV) (56 kDa). These viral nanoparticles elicited robust anthrax- and plague-specific immune responses and provided complete protection against inhalational anthrax and/or pneumonic plague in 3 animal challenge models, namely, mice, rats, and rabbits. Protection was demonstrated even when the animals were simultaneously challenged with lethal doses of both anthrax lethal toxin and _Y. pestis_ CO92 bacteria. Unlike the traditional subunit vaccines, the phage T4 vaccine uses a highly stable nanoparticle scaffold, provides multivalency, requires no adjuvant, and elicits broad T-helper 1 and 2 immune responses that are essential for complete clearance of bacteria during infection. Therefore, phage T4 is a unique nanoparticle platform to formulate multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens for national preparedness against potential bioterror attacks and emerging infections.

Importance
----------
Following the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_ that cause anthrax and plague, respectively, are 2 Tier 1 select agents that pose the greatest threat to the national security of the United States. Both cause rapid death, in 3 to 6 days, of exposed individuals. We engineered a virus nanoparticle vaccine using bacteriophage T4 by incorporating key antigens of both _B. anthracis_ and _Y. pestis_ into one formulation. Two doses of this vaccine provided complete protection against both inhalational anthrax and pneumonic plague in animal models. This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents. Further, our results establish the T4 nanoparticle as a novel platform to develop multivalent vaccines against pathogens of high public health significance.

Discussion, Comment
-------------------
It is significant that the dual anthrax-plague vaccine, unlike the traditional subunit vaccines, elicited robust immune responses against both antigens in the absence of an adjuvant. In fact, addition of adjuvants such as Alhydrogel and/or liposomes to the nanoparticles did not enhance the immune responses (data not shown). We speculate that this might be because the viral nanoparticles, mimicking the PAMPs of a natural pathogen, engage with the TLRs and robustly stimulate the innate and adaptive immune systems of the host and do not need an external adjuvant (46) [see URL for references]. Consistent with this hypothesis, the T4 dual vaccine elicited both TH1- and TH2-mediated antibody responses against both antigens. This seems to be a signature characteristic of the phage T4 nanoparticle platform, one that is highly desirable for clearance of pathogenic organisms during natural infection. However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms.

In conclusion, our studies highlight some unique properties of the T4 phage nanoparticle that are distinct from the traditional subunit vaccines, which could facilitate formulation of multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens. Potentially, additional antigens from other biothreat agents and/or from emerging pathogens could be incorporated using the same principle, and these formulations can be customized to address different threats in different geographical regions of the world. Additional advantages of phage T4 platform include the following: highly stable structure, scalability, cost-effectiveness, safety, and lack of preexisting immunity in humans. Together, these factors could accelerate the streamlining of clinical trials, manufacture, and deployment at a much reduced cost, time, and effort. Phage T4, thus, is a good candidate to develop as a "universal" platform for creating and stockpiling multivalent vaccines as part of our national preparedness against potential future biothreats and emerging infections. With some more refinement, this platform may have the most desirable target product profile for licensure.

[This apparently very successful vaccine worked for mice, rats, and rabbits. It is still a long way away from trials in humans. But from this account it may well be a winner. It is quick. It is effective. It is efficient. People ask me whether I have fears working with _Bacillus anthracis_. Frankly no because humans are hard to infect and antibiotics are effective.

What does frighten me is exposure to _Yersinia pestis_ as we have no effective vaccine: the French have a vaccine which they use but I can see delays if it were needed in a hurry. It is a horrible death and it is not called the "Black Death" for nothing. So while this joint vaccine may be promulgated as a defence in case of a biowarfare attack, which is not every day events, split into its components they have a place for protection for those exposed to these pathogens occupationally. The reservoir for _Y. pestis_ is field rodents in Arizona. Anthrax is increasingly sporadic in cattle but it has its favorite spots, but otherwise we see it in deer in west Texas, in Wood Bison, and in northern cattle. The 'Hot Shot' men burning those infected bison carcasses, which average around 2500 lbs each, deserve some immunity protection. And from this account of this experimental dual vaccine, 2 shots are enough. A significant improvement over the present human anthrax vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]
