Bubonic Plague Confirmed in Namibia
-----------------------------------------------
Local medical authorities confirmed Monday an outbreak of bubonic plague
in Namibia's populous north-central region that has killed three of 73 people
with the disease.
Dr. Naftali Hamata of the Namibian health ministry said tests done at the
South African Institute for Medical Research last week showed that six of
11 samples sent for analysis proved positive for bubonic plague. He said
the other five cases may also still prove positive, but more testing must
be done.
Bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, killed an estimated 25
million people in Europe between 1346 and 1351, wiping out nearly one-third
of the population. The disease is transmitted by fleas infecting rats which
in turn infect humans. If left untreated, it can kill within three to five days.
Today, it is easily treatable by powerful modern antibiotics.
Hamata said his ministry suspected the outbreak was caused by young cattle
herders who came into contact with rats carrying the virus while hunting
them for food.
Outbreaks of the disease in the area have been reported since the early
1960s, Hamata said.
"We are having all the affected homesteads in the area sprayed (with
pesticide) at the moment, but you have to catch every rat to be sure it is
gone,'' he said.
