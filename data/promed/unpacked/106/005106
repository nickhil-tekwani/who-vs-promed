[In Lualaba province,] 6 cases of yellow fever have been recorded in the health zone of Sandoa. Another case is reported in Kasaji, also in the province of Lualaba. According to the bulletin of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), published on [Wed 7 Dec 2016], all these cases were confirmed after results of the samples tested by the Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) of Kinshasa were positive.

This information is confirmed by the nurse supervisor of the Sandoa health zone, Josu√© Tshibangu.

According to the OCHA office in Lubumbashi, these cases occurred 3 months after the yellow fever vaccination of more than 792 990 people older than 9 months old.

This campaign covered the health zones of Dilolo, Kapanga, Kasaji, and Sandoa, border areas of Angola, following the confirmation last July [2016] of a case of yellow fever in the Dilolo health zone, adds the OCHA newsletter.

This increase in the number of health zones under yellow fever epidemic in Lualaba, will risk the infection spreading to the neighboring provinces of Upper Lomami and Upper Katanga, due to movements of people, OCHA worries.

From 1 Jan-30 Nov 2016, Lualaba province recorded 159 suspected cases of yellow fever, including 7 deaths.

[This appears to be a continuation of the YF outbreak that spilled over from Angola into the DR Congo, although there is no mention of this possibility nor of sylvan (forest) origin of the infections. The appearance of hot-spot flare ups is not surprising in areas that are more remote from occurrence of previous cases, where vaccination was not done. The WHO has called for increased surveillance in the DR Congo to be able to detect cases early on and respond quickly. The report above makes no mention of a vaccination effort in the areas where these cases occurred. Concern about possible spread to neighboring provinces is justified.
