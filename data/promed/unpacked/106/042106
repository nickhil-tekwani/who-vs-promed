Researchers at the University of Gottingen, Germany, have recently discovered that one _Trichoderma_ species caused severe rot in cobs of maize. A massive outbreak of an unknown [disease] on maize cobs was detected in southern Germany in 2018. The scientists analyzed 18 separate _Trichoderma_ strains mainly from maize cobs in Germany and France.

The study revealed that some of these strains are highly aggressive with a cob infestation of 95-100%. By molecular genetic analyses, spores could be assigned to the species _T. afroharzianum_. Within this species, previously unknown plant-pathogenic strains seem to have evolved that are now responsible for this disease affecting maize.

[Antagonistic fungi in the genus _Trichoderma_ have been shown to be effective as biocontrol organisms to suppress various fungal pathogens including soil-inhabiting species (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20160317.4102576, 20151109.3779551, 20130805.1864259). They are used as foliar applications as well as seed and soil treatments.

The following is additional information for the report above, as supplied in the source publication:

[1] Ear rots by _Trichoderma_ spp. (TEA) in maize have been reported previously from the US, where infection is thought to be associated with injuries to ears. Some of the fungi involved can also produce a mycotoxin.

[2] TEA symptoms in Germany included white mycelium between kernels and on the husks, with massive production of greenish conidia covering all kernels and all layers of husks from the base to the middle part of the cob. No mechanical damage or injuries were observed on infected cobs. In some cases, premature ripening of kernels occurred.

[3] Four locations in Germany and France were sampled. The highest disease severity was 96% by a _T. afroharzianum_ isolate. Non-pathogenic strains did not cause reduction in cob dry matter (signifying size, kernel yield, etc.), while the 3 most aggressive strains caused significant losses in dry matter.

[4] Eight isolates were identified as _T. harzianum_, 4 as belonging to the _T. afroharzianum_ clade, one as _T. tomentosum_. Four isolates were highly aggressive; 2 biocontrol isolates induced slight infection; 11 isolates were non-pathogenic. The 4 highly aggressive isolates were reassigned to _T. afroharzianum_; the 2 commercial biocontrol isolates as well as the other non-pathogenic strains belonged to _T. harzianum_, _T. atroviride_ or _T. tomentosum_.

[5] Several epidemiological aspects of TEA remain to be elucidated. The aggressive strains of _T. afroharzianum_ were restricted to warmer regions. The potential production of mycotoxins by aggressive strains needs to be examined. Spread of the disease in Europe and yield loss analyses under field conditions are required to assess the economic significance of TEA.

[6] The widely applied culture '_T. harzianum_ T22' was determined to be _T. afroharzianum_. Some species in the _T. harzianum_ complex appear to be exclusively endophytic, while others were only isolated from soil. Further work is needed to determine whether beneficial strains could mutate into aggressive pathogens.
