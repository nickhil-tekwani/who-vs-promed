The local and state health departments report an outbreak of
gastrointestinal illness caused by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection
associated with the consumption of raw shellfish.
A number of those sick ate raw oysters collected from Galveston Bay. These
oyster beds are now closed until deemed safe by the health department, and
a recall of oysters from the area is underway.
Temperatures locally have been greater than 95F with the bay water now
85F. This is thought to be a contributing factor in the growth of the Vibrio.
