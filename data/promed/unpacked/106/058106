The Ministry of Health has reported 17 confirmed cases of hantavirus including one death. The report says the province of Los Santos has the highest rate of confirmed cases (13).

The Pan American Health Organization detailed that hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is transmitted by inhalation of saliva, and urine of infected rodents. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. After 4-10 days, the initial phase of the disease, symptoms include cough and severe dyspnea, requiring intensive care, and can cause death.

[Los Santos continues to be the province with most cases of hantavirus infection. Although the above report and previous ones do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, as mentioned in earlier posts, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
