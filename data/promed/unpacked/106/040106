[The fact that HPAI subtype H5N8 and other subtypes (HPAI H5N5 and H5N1) currently circulating in the European continent have been detected in wild birds is very indicative that these viruses are being distributed wherever these wild birds migrate. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must therefore implement all the biosecurity measures necessary to protect their flocks from exposure and infection.

The following abstract comes from a scientific report on Avian influenza overview in EU/EEA and the UK -- update on 19 Nov 2020, which is available in ref 1:

Abstract
--------
Since 16 Oct 2020, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have been reported in several EU/EEA countries -- Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden -- as well as in the United Kingdom. As of 19 Nov [2002], 12 pm, 302 HPAI A(H5) detections have been reported, with the majority of the detections referring to wild birds (n = 281), and a few related to outbreaks in poultry (n = 18) and captive birds (n = 3). Most of the detections in wild birds were in wild waterbirds, being barnacle goose the most affected species (n = 110), followed by greylag goose (n = 47), Eurasian wigeon (n = 32), mallard (n = 14), and common buzzard (n = 13). Three HPAI virus subtypes were identified -- A(H5N8), A(H5N5) and A(H5N1) -- with A(H5N8) being the most reported subtype (n = 284). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses evolved from a single progenitor virus that went through multiple reassortment events. Based on the ongoing autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe, there is a continued risk of further introduction of HPAI A(H5) viruses into Europe. Furthermore, given the expected movements of both migratory, and resident wild birds in Europe during winter, there is a high risk of further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. No genetic markers indicating adaptation to mammals have been identified in the viruses analysed so far, and no human infection due to avian influenza viruses detected in the recent outbreaks has been reported. For that reason, the risk to the general population remains very low. However, following the precautionary principle, people should avoid touching sick or dead birds unprotected to minimise any potential risk.
