Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus - Ukraine 1 Sep 2015
---------------------------
In Ukraine, 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been confirmed, with dates of onset of paralysis on [30 Jun 2015] and [7 Jul 2015]. Both are from the Zakarpatskaya oblast, in south-western Ukraine, bordering Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. 1 child was 4 years old and the other 10 months old at the time of onset of paralysis.

Ukraine had been at particular risk of emergence of a cVDPV, due to inadequate vaccination coverage. In 2014, only 50 percent of children were fully immunized against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases.

Public health response
-----------
Discussions are currently ongoing with national health authorities to plan and implement an urgent outbreak response. An outbreak response of internationally agreed standard, as adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, requires a minimum of 3 large-scale supplementary immunization activities with an appropriate oral polio vaccine, to begin within 2 weeks of confirmation of the outbreak and covering a target population of 2 million children aged less than 5 years, and the public declaration of the outbreak as a national public health emergency.

WHO risk assessment
---------
Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized. A robust response can rapidly stop such events. Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country and subnational surveillance deficits, the risk of further spread of this strain within the country is deemed to be high. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage. WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from Ukraine to be low, but notes that the infected oblast shares borders with 4 countries (Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland).

WHO emphasises the need for a full and complete implementation of an outbreak response of the internationally agreed standard. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
-------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

[This answers the questions raised in the post earlier today (which preceded the posting of this information on the WHO website - Poliomyelitis update (04): Ukraine, 2 cases, RFI 20150901.490607).

This is now the 2nd country in 2015 with an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) type 1, with Madagascar having reported 9 cases so far in 2015, with most recent date of onset 7 Jul 2015 (see Poliomyelitis update (03): Nigeria, Pakistan, global update, chronic shedder 20150901.3614553 and http://www.who.int/csr/don/24-july-2015-polio/en/ for more details.).

The challenge of this outbreak is whether the live attenuated virus vaccine (oral polio vaccine - OPV) should be used, as the virus responsible for this outbreak is a vaccine-derived virus.

As a reminder, the occurrence of cVDPV cases is an indicator of low vaccination coverage (discussed in the prior post - Poliomyelitis update (04): Ukraine, 2 cases, RFI 20150901.490607).

ProMED-mail would like to thank Manuel Mendez Diaz and Irene Lai, MD for submitting information on the cVDPV isolates as well. - Mod.MPP
