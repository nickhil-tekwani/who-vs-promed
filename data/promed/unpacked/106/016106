First Report of Dry Bean Anthracnose (_Colletotrichum lindemuthianum_) Race
73 in North Dakota.
L. E. del RÃ­o, R. S. Lamppa, and P. L. Gross, Department of Plant
Pathology, North Dakota State University. Fargo 58105. Plant Dis. 86:562,
2002; published on-line as D-2002- 0312-02N, 2002. Accepted for publication
20 Feb 2002.
Dry bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L. cv. Pintoba) plants showing typical
anthracnose symptoms were observed in 3 commercial fields in North Dakota
(Towner, Steele, and Pembina counties) in July 2001. Disease incidence in
all fields ranged from 5 to 20 percent. [A] fungus was isolated from leaves
and pods on potato dextrose agar and identified as _Colletotrichum
lindemuthianum_ (Sacc. & Magnus) Lams.-Scrib [Cl]. (3).
Pathogenicity and race identification were determined on a set of 12
standard differentials (2). 3 isolates, 1 from each county, were grown for
7 days in Mathur's medium. Spores were suspended in water and Tween 80 (0.1
percent vol/vol) and adjusted to 1 000 000 spores per ml. 30 ... 2-week-old
seedlings of each differential were inoculated with each isolate on the
adaxial side of the primary leaves using a Paasche airbrush.
Inoculated plants were incubated in moist chambers for 5 days at 20 degrees
C under 14 h of fluorescent light and then moved back to the greenhouse.
Disease reaction was assessed 3 days later. Isolates of Cl ... races 7 and
73 obtained from J. Kelly (Michigan State University) were used as positive
controls. Inoculations were repeated once.
All 3 North Dakota isolates and the positive control for race 73 produced
sporulating lesions on the differentials 'Michelite', 'Cornell 49242', and
'Mexico 222'. No lesions were observed in the other differentials.
An unidentified anthracnose race retrieved from a single plant in 1982
constitutes the first report of the presence of anthracnose in North Dakota
(4). In 1992, Michigan breeding materials infected with race 73 were
planted in North Dakota (1); upon detection, the infected plants were
destroyed and the fields quarantined.
The epidemics observed in the 2001 season, developed in sites distant from
the places where the Michigan materials were planted and have been
associated with a single seed source.
To our knowledge, the presence of anthracnose race 73 reported here
constitutes the first report of anthracnose in commercial dry bean fields
in North Dakota.

[The genetic diversity of Cl is a major factor in management of dry bean
anthracnose. The pathogen infects many varieties of common bean as well as
other types (tepary, lima, and mung beans). The disease is widely
distributed in the world. Race 73 is one of 3 major races worldwide and new
races not previously described have been reported in Africa. According to
plant pathologists at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, Cl readily survives
on bean seeds but not very well on straw and dried pods. Plant debris on
infested fields should be ploughed under after harvest in order to reduce
survival of the pathogen during winter. Use of seed of resistant cultivars
adapted to the local region is the best strategy in disease management. A
