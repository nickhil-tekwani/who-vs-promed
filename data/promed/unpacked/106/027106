Doctors face 10 cases a day of patients displaying symptoms like chikungunya and dengue, but blood tests indicate new virus or dangerous mutation; PMC [Pune Municipal Corporation, Maharashtra state] roped in to take action.

With cases of body ache, joint pain and fever getting reported every day, most sufferers would believe they're carrying symptoms of dengue or chikungunya -- but now, a new conundrum has presented itself. Doctors are increasingly being exposed to cases of a virus that presents familiar symptoms, but isn't the expected infection. They have gone so far as to claim an outbreak of such cases, since after running several tests, the illness is still unspecified among several patients, leading them to believe it is the curious case of a virus of unknown origin.

Citing it as a cause of concern, doctors have taken the matter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department, to facilitate the diagnosis and detection of the virus as well as raise awareness of the people. Most physicians claim to have seen more than 10 cases a day of mystery fever.

When Mirror cross-checked with Dr S T Pardeshi, Chief of Health, PMC, he said, "We will be taking serious cognisance of this as many doctors have reported it to us. Symptoms like joint pain and body ache are commonly seen in chikungunya, but we will involve the National Institute of Virology (NIV) to determine what this new virus is. With a change in weather, it is possible that a mutation of a known virus could have taken place. It has further been suggested that people report such symptoms to a medical practitioner within 48 hours."

Dr Rajesh Gadia, director of the dengue unit at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, said, "These cases are mostly from populated pockets like the Peths. Patients complain of severe body ache, joint pain and high fever. These are basic symptoms of chikungunya, but blood samples tested for that and dengue surprisingly test negative. We have concluded that it is a virus of unknown origin, which is a scare. We need PMC to intervene and help us identify it."

He added, "Unfortunately, people are coming to us 3-4 days after getting a fever, so we are losing out on the early period within which we can catch the virus. Early detection is the key to identifying the virus, which has not happened due to lack of awareness."

The outbreak is said to have started from the 1st week of November [2015].

Dr Santaji Kadam, general physician and member of the General Practitioners Association, echoed, "It has been 3 weeks since we have been seeing such cases. It is definitely an outbreak. Many are getting reported in a severe form. We doctors have not been able to detect the virus yet. So far, only symptomatic treatment is being given to people. Reasons for such an outbreak need to be pinpointed."

Confirming this, immediate past president of GPA, Dr Vilas Takane, said, "Several cases are getting reported from various areas. We physicians have met and discussed this new virus and our plan of action, deciding to report all such cases to PMC. We plan to hold a meeting with the health department as well to make a proper plan."

Indian Medical Association (IMA) Pune's secretary, Dr Sanjay Patil, confirmed the outbreak, saying, "For now, the major role is that of the PMC, which needs to step in to check the actual number of cases caused by this virus. We suspect that there are many more cases that have not yet approached clinics. Only thorough blood tests can detect the actual condition."

[The etiology of this outbreak is undetermined. Chikungunya virus infection apparently has been ruled out by an unspecified test. It is not clear if laboratory tests have ruled out dengue virus infections. Involvement of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) is essential to determine which virus is involved in the outbreak if, indeed, a virus is responsible. ProMED would appreciate receiving the results of any tests done locally or at the NIV.
