After being bitten by a 6-year-old rabid boy, 5 members of a family are battling for their lives. The boy was attacked by a dog in January [2013] in Agar Road in Ujjain [Madhya Pradesh state]. The rabies-affected dog died a day after biting the boy. According to family members, the 6-year-old boy developed rabies and bit 5 of them before his death in June [2013]. His uncle is said to have developed symptoms of rabies.

According to a source, he [the boy] died because he was treated by a quack. The boy developed symptoms of rabies 3 days after the dog bit him. He was rushed to MY Hospital when his condition became worse. However, the doctors refused to treat him because he was very critical.

The boy had bitten his father, mother, grandmother and an uncle and aunt before his death. The boy's aunt said, "We all received rabies inoculations after the boy's death. But my brother fell sick and we think he is also affected by rabies now. I don't know if anybody else in the family has developed rabies or not."

[An unusual account of suspected transmission of rabies from a 6-year-old boy to a family member (by bite) despite timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis to all family members bitten by the sick child. The story lacks independent corroboration, and time frames are confusing. In particular, it was not unequivocally confirmed that the boy actually died as a result of rabies virus infection. The diagnosis seems to be based on the biting behavior of the sick child before his death. Likewise it has not been established that the boy's sick uncle has actually contracted rabies virus infection. Further information is awaited.

Ujjain is an ancient city in Malwa region in central India, on the eastern bank of the Kshipra River, today part of the state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the administrative centre of Ujjain District and Ujjain Division (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjain). - Mod.CP
