[Since, reportedly, gene sequencing has already been applied by ARRIAH
(Federal Centre for Animal Health, OIE Regional Reference Laboratory
for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia in
Vladimir, Russia), it may be possible to define the relationship of
the Mongolian FMDV serotype O strain to the one currently circulating
in China, South Korea, and Japan (topotype SEA, strain Mya-98). Such
information, probably provided cooperatively by ARRIAH and WRL-FMD,
IAH, Pirbright, UK, is anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS]
