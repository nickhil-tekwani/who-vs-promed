A Windham man has tested positive for Powassan virus and is the 1st case in the state this year [2022], according to the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Health officials are urging residents to take action to prevent tick bites.

The man is between 50 and 59 years old and became ill during the 4th week of March [2022], according to the state.

Laboratory tests done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Laboratory in Ft. Collins, Colorado, confirmed the presence of antibodies to Powassan virus, health officials said.

The man, who was hospitalized with a central nervous system disease and had a known tick bite, has been discharged and is recovering at home, according to the Department of Health.

From 2017 to 2021, 12 cases of the virus were reported in Connecticut, including 3 in 2021. Of those 12 cases, 2 were fatal.

"The identification of a Connecticut resident with Powassan-virus-associated illness emphasizes the need to take actions to prevent tick bites from now through the late fall," Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD said in a statement. "Using insect repellent, avoiding areas where ticks are likely, and checking carefully for ticks after being outside can reduce the chance of you or your children being infected with this virus."

Juthani said the virus is usually spread through the bite of an infected black-legged or deer tick [_Ixodes scapularis_].

It takes a week to one month after the bite from an infected tick to develop symptoms of the disease, and the virus can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes after the tick first attaches.

Health officials said that while most people infected with Powassan virus likely experience no symptoms or a mild flu-like illness, some people will develop severe illness affecting the central nervous system. About one out of 10 cases of severe illness are fatal, and approximately half of survivors experience long-term health problems [neurological sequelae].

Severe cases might begin with fever, vomiting, headache, or weakness and rapidly progress to confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, or seizures.

They said there is no vaccine nor a specific treatment for the associated illness. Severe illness is treated by hospitalization, respiratory support, and hydration.

[This is the time of year when ticks become active and cases of Powassan virus (POWV) infection start to occur, as this case did. POWV transmission is active in Connecticut again this year (2022) as it has been in recent years. Cases of Powassan virus infection have been reported every year in recent years from one or more of the eastern and northeastern or midwestern states of the USA including Connecticut. An important point of this report is that POWV can be rapidly transmitted to humans a short time following the bite of infected deer ticks (black legged ticks, _Ixodes scapularis_). In areas where this tick is common, inspection for the presence of this tick and their swift removal are important.

Ticks become infected when they feed on groundhogs, squirrels, white-footed mice, or other rodents that have the virus in their blood. Infected ticks can then spread POW virus to people and other animals by biting them. People do not develop high enough levels of the virus in their blood to infect biting ticks. As a result, people are considered "dead-end" hosts for Powassan virus. There is no vaccine for POW virus, so avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure. The CDC has good guidance concerning avoidance of ticks at https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html. - Mod.TY
