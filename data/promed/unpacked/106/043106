Bird flu outbreak feared as thousands of chickens die in Burma
--------------------------------------------------
Last week, thousands of chickens died suddenly at Moulmein, Mon State
in southern Burma and local worried residents suspect that there
could be an outbreak of bird flu.
The chickens are said to be from a farm at 6-mile Hill near Moulmein
University, but Veterinary Department of Mon State said these
chickens died from ordinary diseases. There have been reports that
the state authorities have been trying to cover up the news making
the people suspect that these chickens died from avian flu.
"There have been some deaths from the extreme heat. There is no
massive death in the thousands," a local veterinary official told
DVB. "There have been flu outbreaks in other countries. It still
hasn't happened in our country. There is no report of the outbreak in
Burma. If there is a problem or something suspicious, we check it
straight away. We have no cover-up from our part. If there is an
outbreak in a neighbour country, we just close the border down from
this side if need be. We could not allow it to spread it to our
country".
At the same time, some of the pigeons in Rangoon look as if they are
suffering from a kind of illness causing worries to those who live in
building blocks in the town centre, according to the local residents.
When DVB asked a retired vet if there could be an outbreak of bird
flu in Burma as there had been in some Asian countries in the past,
he said: "I am still investigating. Around Moumein and Burma border
areas, the condition is ripe for an outbreak," he remarked. He
added that laboratories in Burma "won't be able to spot such a
strange disease like the bird flu. Some of them haven't got enough
instruments and the like. Due to their situation, I haven't seen them
do things systematically. Whatever it is, I don't trust them," he
said.
According to latest reports, there have been some deaths of chickens
in Sagaing and Mandalay Division in central Burma, and the local
authorities are imposing a news blackout on the matter.
According to a report from Rangoon by AP on 20 March, the UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) donated USD 350 000 to Burma to
prevent the outbreak of bird flu.
The director in chief of Veterinary Department Dr. Than Tun told DVB
that he hadn't received reports of the deaths of chickens and he also
denied a news blackout on the matter. "We recently mentioned in
Kumudra magazine that we are continuing to take action on bird flu,"
he insisted.
When DVB asked why the FAO donated money to Burma if the situation is
not critical, Dr. Than Tun said: "They give money to non-infected
countries: there must be about 5 or 6 in all. In my opinion, even
China is included".
When DVB pointed out that bird flu epidemic started in China,
therefore it could not be called a "non-infected" country, Dr. Than
Tun insisted that the money was given as technical cooperation and
suggested DVB to ask the FAO for details.

[Mortality in poultry, by itself, is not sufficient to justify
suspicion of avian influenza; field and laboratory surveillance
activities should be applied to produce a reliable evaluation of the
epizootiological situation on the ground.
Following the initial reports of HPAI in Eastern Asia, in Dec 2003,
the OIE tried to obtain 1st-hand information on the true situation in
all regional countries. Subsequently, 8 countries -- including
Myanmar -- reported the absence of disease. The Director General of
the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) in the
Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, Government of the Union of
Myanmar, sent on 16 Feb 2004 an official report to the OIE about the
absence of HPAI infection in his country. The report included the
following description of the relevant steps taken:
"Surveillance and inspection teams have been formed at
state/division, district and township levels respectively involving
local authority, medical staff from the Health department, and vets
from the our department, LBVD. They are to inspect every poultry farm
at their designated areas and inform up to HQs through local vets
when they find normal or suspected cases. Most of the cases found in
Myanmar are NCD [Newcastle disease], Marek's disease and CRD [Chronic
Respiratory disease = Mycoplasma]. Up to now, we have not encountered
suspected case of AI that meet the criteria of 100 percent mortality
or above 40 percent within 3 days. We performed diagnosis based on
clinical signs, PM lesions, virus isolation, HA/HI tests and ELISA
techniques. No suspected human RDS case related to AI [were] reported
from the medical side as well".
In January 2005, the following citation was published in a newswire
(see 20050129.0316): "The World Health Organization has said the
avian influenza virus might already have infected people in countries
neighboring Viet Nam such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, but these
countries lack the infrastructure or capacity to conduct necessary
surveillance".
Renewed surveillance efforts are required to confirm or -- hopefully
-- refute the recent rumors from Myanmar.
The other 7 countries which reported the absence of HPAI were
(parentheses indicate dates of notifications of "cleanliness"):
Bangladesh (2 Feb 2004); Mongolia (12 Feb 2004); Philippines (12 Feb
2004); Singapore (12 Feb 2004); Nepal (16 Feb 2004); India (04 Mar
2004); Sri Lanka (29 Jul 2004). - Mod AS]
