Abstract
--------
Objective: Unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infections in farmed minks raised immediate concerns regarding transmission to humans and initiated intensive environmental investigations to assess occupational and environmental exposure.

Methods: Air sampling was performed at infected Dutch mink farms, at farm premises and at nearby residential sites. A range of other environmental samples were collected from minks' housing units, including bedding materials. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was analysed in all samples by quantitative PCR.

Results: Inside the farms, considerable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found in airborne dust, especially in personal inhalable dust samples (approximately 1000-10 000 copies/m3). Most of the settling dust samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (82%, 75 of 92). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in outdoor air samples, except for those collected near the entrance of the most recently infected farm. Many samples of minks' housing units and surfaces contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Conclusions: Infected mink farms can be highly contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This warns of occupational exposure, which was substantiated by considerable SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in personal air samples. Dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 to outdoor air was found to be limited and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in air samples collected beyond farm premises, implying a negligible risk of environmental exposure to nearby communities. Our occupational and environmental risk assessment is in line with whole genome sequencing analyses showing mink-to-human transmission among farm workers, but no indications of direct zoonotic transmission events to nearby communities.

[The "key messages" of the paper, as summarised by the authors, are as follows:

"1. What is already known about this subject?
- SARS-CoV-2 infections in farmed minks were first observed in the Netherlands and later in other countries worldwide.
- This raised concerns regarding environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from minks to farm workers and the general population living in the vicinity of the infected farms.

"2. What are the new findings?
- Our intensive environmental investigations showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA contamination inside infected mink farms and considerable SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in personal air samples, warning for occupational exposure among farm workers.
- Dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 to outdoor air was found to be limited and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in air samples collected beyond farm premises, implying a negligible risk of environmental exposure to nearby communities.

"3. How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
- Given the risk of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between minks and humans, COVID-19 preventive measures and strict biosecurity are essential in mink farming.
- Once a mink farm is infected by SARS-CoV-2, the whole farm should be considered contaminated, which necessitates intensive precautionary measures, including proper cleaning/disinfecting, even in the period after culling."

According to WHO/FAO/OIE risk assessment (20210218.8200008), 35 countries globally are known to maintain mink farming. Their (alphabetic) list follows (in brackets: the 12 countries that have already reported COVID-19 in farmed minks): Argentina, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cambodia, [Canada], China, [Denmark], Estonia, Finland, [France], [Greece], Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, [Italy], Kazakhstan, [Latvia], [Lithuania], Malaysia, [Netherlands], Norway, [Poland], Romania, Russia, South Africa, [Spain], [Sweden], Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, [USA], and Viet Nam.

Following the mass cullings undertaken in the Netherlands and Denmark, the largest population of farmed mink globally is currently maintained in China. So far, no cases of COVID-19 in mink have been reported there. - Mod.AS
