[A total of 3 products from the same company have been recalled for a
risk of botulism due to processing issues. Because of the potential
severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in
this case, there are no human cases associated with the food products.
Most of the food recalls (as in these cases) are related to defective
preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in
the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
