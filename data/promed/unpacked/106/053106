UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, HUMAN, SWINE - PAPUA NEW GUINEA (02)

The mystery pig deaths have been investigated by our vets, and anthrax was
diagnosed based on history and clinical symptoms.
Anthrax in pigs is endemic in some parts of the highlands provinces and
also present in West Irian Province of Indonesia. The anthrax in New Guinea
Island (PNG/Irian Jaya) is only adaptable to pigs and not other species;
including humans; it is very fatal in pigs but does not affect other
species, including ruminants and humans. This is [a] similar strain to one
in southern Africa.
Epidemics of anthrax in village pigs do occur from time to time in the
highlands, and the disease was previously diagnosed in southern highlands
province and has spread widely to areas like Bosavi area. Movement of live
pigs is a common occurrence in the highlands provinces, and this is most
likely the source of spread of anthrax to Bosavi. Anthrax in pigs in PNG
has only been reported and diagnosed in village and wild pigs, in this
case. It has never been reported or diagnosed in commercial piggeries in PNG.
Deaths of humans are not related to anthrax but probably due to clostridial
enterotoxaemia (referred to as "pig bel" in PNG) and is associated in PNG
with consuming large quantities of pork, especially during feasts, or in
this case, we presume, people were consuming sick pigs or dead pigs because
they did not want to waste them. Both diseases are preventable by
penicillin-based antibiotics. However, control in wild pigs with
vaccination and antibiotics is impractical in the predominately wild and
semi wild pig populations in the Bosavi situation.
NAQIA advised people to confine their pigs and hand feed them as the only
option to control the situation, but we also know this itself is difficult
because of the way these people traditionally look after their pigs, which
are mainly free ranging and semi-wild type pigs. In other highlands
provinces where anthrax is endemic, people normally confine their pigs at
night and let them out in the morning, so prophylatic use of antibiotic
works in this situation. Health officials have sent antibiotics for
treatment. Both NAQIA and Health authorities are developing public
awareness material.
I hope this clarifies the pig deaths situation in PNG to be not as reported
in newspapers and media, including the ridiculous "gunshot anthrax"
diagnosis, which, unfortunately, was also reported by ProMED-mail.

[The above was referred to Dr Puana prior to posting. His reply indicated
that samples were taken from affected pigs. Our thanks to Dr Puana. They
have a similar system -- domestic pigs free ranging during the day,
confined at night -- in southern Belize, where they feed on, among other
things, domestic garbage. While wandering, domestic pigs are a cheap way of
dealing with garbage; they do thus pose various public health risks,
including for human cysticercosis. - Mod.MHJ]
