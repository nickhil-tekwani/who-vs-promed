[1] Guinea: Vaccine trial volunteer
Date: Sat 7 Mar 2015

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/british-ebola-expert-tests-experimental-vaccine


An Ebola expert has volunteered to be vaccinated against the disease to help bring an experimental new drug to the front line in Africa. Prof Miles Carroll, head of research microbiology services at Public Health England, is working in Guinea where the life-saving capabilities of the VSV-EBOV vaccine are about to be tested. The phase III trial, the final step before a drug is made generally available, began on Sat, 7 Mar 2015, the World Health Organisation has announced.

Professor Carroll said: "This is a significant milestone and a real step forward in development of the 1st Ebola vaccine, and I'm delighted to have been part of the European team supporting this work here in Guinea. "I have also volunteered to be vaccinated in the trial, to help show the local population the vaccine is safe, and with the help and expertise of my Public Health England colleagues in the UK we have constructed a lab in Guinea to assist with processing blood samples from the trial."

Since Sep 2014, the 2 most advanced Ebola vaccines have been evaluated in about 15 countries in Africa, Europe and North America. The VSV-EBOV vaccine was selected for the Guinea trial based on criteria including safety, immune responses, levels of neutralising antibodies and supply availability. The vaccine, developed by the public health agency of Canada, will be distributed in Basse Guinee, the region with the highest number of Ebola cases in the country. A ring vaccination strategy will be adopted, based on the approach used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. This involves identifying a newly diagnosed Ebola case, known as the "index case", and tracing all of his or her contacts. They are then vaccinated if they agree.

The WHO director general, Dr Margaret Chan, said: "We have worked hard to reach this point. There has been massive mobilisation on the part of the affected countries and all partners to accelerate the development and availability of proven interventions. If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the 1st preventive tool against Ebola in history." The assistant director general, Marie-Paule Kieny, who leads Ebola research and development at the WHO, said: "An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones."

Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: "It's fantastic to see large-scale efficacy trials of this promising Ebola vaccine getting under way in Guinea. Testing investigational medicines during an epidemic is incredibly challenging, but this approach gives us the best possible chance of finding a safe and effective vaccine in time to save lives during the current epidemic, and to help us prepare for future outbreaks. "Just getting to this point is a phenomenal achievement and one that would not have been possible without the hard work and unprecedented global collaboration between public and private entities, governments and the local communities in the three affected regions."

[2] West Africa: Drug & vaccine trials in jeopardy
Date: 9 Mar 2015

After months of debate over clinical trials, it may be too late to vet potential Ebola drugs and vaccines. One drug maker has canceled plans to test its antiviral because there aren't enough Ebola patients left.

'Sadly ... it has been a missed chance,' one WHO official says of testing Ebola drugs. After killing at least 9936 people and infecting more than 24 202, the Ebola epidemic appears to be running out of steam. And for some medical researchers, this hard-won progress poses a problem.

Unless the outbreak explodes again, potential cures such as ZMapp can't be given to enough patients to accurately determine their effect. Nor is the virus infecting enough people to let researchers test the efficacy of 2 potential vaccines that are being given to about 18 000 health and emergency workers in Liberia. Even proposals to treat patients by transfusing into them blood serum from Ebola survivors have become impossible to test with scientific rigor. "We just don't have sufficient cases," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's point person for medical emergencies.

Already pharmaceutical maker Chimerix Inc. of Durham, N.C. has canceled a trial of its antiviral drug brincidofovir. That trial was supposed to take place at an Ebola treatment center run by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, but only a handful of patients enrolled in the study when it began on 2 Jan 2015; 5 months ago, the treatment center was among the nation's busiest, but last week there were no new Ebola cases reported anywhere in the country.

Under normal conditions, it takes about 200 to 300 patients to conduct a preliminary Phase II trial to see whether an experimental drug appears to be helpful and safe. If it looks as though the drug works, its effectiveness is determined in a much larger Phase III trial, which traditionally involves 2000 to 3000 people, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Those numbers are now hard to come by. And for some researchers, this turn of events is particularly frustrating. They had wanted to start testing some of these drugs months ago, when the outbreak was still spreading to more than 800 people per week.

Instead of getting trials underway, scientists spent months engaging in a heated debate over the best way to test whether any of these drugs worked. "Sadly ... it has been a missed chance," said Dr. Piero Olliaro, an Oxford University infectious disease expert and official at the WHO. On one side of the debate were top American medical officials from the FDA and the National Institutes of Health. They pressed for randomized controlled trials that would pit the drugs against dummy pills known as placebos, or against a monitored group of patients that received neither drugs nor placebo. These types of trials are considered the best ways to produce conclusive data about a drug's disease-fighting capability.

But in the case of the latest Ebola epidemic -- the biggest in history -- a number of experts have argued that this careful approach is unfeasible and unethical. Some said it would be wrong to withhold potential cures from vulnerable patients. Others fear it would be practically impossible to conduct such a study in the most affected countries -- Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- because of suspicion over Western medical practices.

Dr. Richard Whitley, a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama, said that when he attended a WHO conference on experimental Ebola drugs, West African health ministers offered a clear message on the use of placebos. "They vehemently said, 'We're not going to do placebo controls. Find another way to study your drugs in our populations,'" Whitley said during a recent Ebola symposium at Harvard University.

A special WHO medical panel agreed in August [2015] that it was ethical and necessary to offer experimental drugs to Ebola patients. The following month, the London-based Wellcome Trust, Doctors Without Borders and other nonprofit groups joined the WHO in announcing the launch of a fast-track initiative for evaluating investigational drugs without placebos. But the academic debate continued.

- In October [2014], Olliaro and 16 other health experts published a letter in the medical journal Lancet calling for quicker alternatives to randomized controlled trials.
- In November [2014], top FDA officials argued for such trials at a session of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in New Orleans.
- in December [2014], they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that not using randomized controlled trials could have "tragic consequences."

In the end, officials at the WHO and within the U.S. government opted for a mix of trial methods.

The 2 top vaccine candidates -- one developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the other from the Canadian government and Merck -- are being tested against placebos in trials overseen by the NIAID. Study participants began receiving shots last month [February 2015] in Liberia.

The WHO launched a separate Phase III trial of the Canadian vaccine in Guinea on Saturday, with plans to test the NIAID vaccine when supplies are available. These trials will not involve placebos, however. Instead, medical workers will employ a "ring vaccination" strategy, similar to the one used to fight smallpox in the 1970s, according to the WHO. When a case of infection is identified, medical workers will vaccinate all of their contacts, if they are willing.

ZMapp, the drug made by San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical, will be tested somewhat differently; 2 groups of patients will receive the highest available level of supportive care. But only one of the groups will get the drug. The trial launched in Liberia at the end of February [2015]. FDA officials have argued that because effective supportive care greatly improves an Ebola patient's odds of survival, even the control group of patients will experience better survival rates.

Another experimental Ebola treatment was tested in yet another way. In late December [2014], doctors began offering favipiravir -- an antiviral drug produced by Japan's Fujifilm -- to all new patients at a Doctors Without Borders treatment center in Gueckedou, Guinea. Their outcomes were compared with those of patients who were admitted to the facility before the study began. The study was completed recently after enrolling about 60 patients, Aylward said. Although there have been rumors that the drug was effective, officials said the data are still being analyzed. "It would be very premature to say the results are encouraging," the WHO official said.

Indeed, it's possible that none of them will yield the kind of data that will let researchers figure out whether any of these drugs or vaccines is effective. "The wrangling over trial design has caused delay, thus allowing the caseload problem to arise," Olliaro said. Dr. Clement Adebamowo, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Maryland, is in the camp that says the insistence on randomized, placebo-controlled trials was misguided. One of the biggest problems was the amount of time needed to implement them. "These acute infectious diseases have a short timeline," said Adebamowo, who serves as director of the West African Bioethics Training Program in Ibadan, Nigeria. "We need to continue the conversation on how to do better next time."

[3] Sequelae following Ebola infection
Date: Mon 9 Mar 2015

http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/ebola-leaves-ongoing-health-issues-for-survivors-of-the-viral-disease/2015/03/09/b58f76dc-c340-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html


Texas nurse Nina Pham, who was infected with the Ebola virus, says she has had ongoing health problems since being cured, an outcome that experts say is not uncommon for Ebola survivors.

Pham told the Dallas Morning News last month [Feb 2015] that she has experienced hair loss, body aches and insomnia in the months following her infection. She was diagnosed with the disease in mid-October [2014] after treating a patient from Liberia who had Ebola [on arrival in Texas]. Pham was hospitalized in isolation for several weeks before she was declared Ebola-free.

The long-term effects of Ebola have not been well studied, and doctors will probably learn a lot more about the disease's aftermath from the current outbreak in West Africa, the largest in history, said Jesse Goodman, an infectious-disease expert and a professor of medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center.

But it is clear that Ebola survivors can experience temporary health problems as a result of their battle with the disease, Goodman said. These ailments -- which include body and joint aches, and fatigue -- are "the kind of side effects you might expect from any very serious infection," These symptoms may result, in part, from the body's release of immune-system chemicals called cytokines. These chemicals fight the disease but make people feel sick. Dehydration, low blood pressure and nutrition problems that people experience during an Ebola infection can also injure a person's muscles and other tissues. Muscles and nerves also could be directly injured by the virus and take time to recover, Goodman said.

Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol has said that she experienced nerve pain after her infection. "It wouldn't be surprising, in a very severe infection that is spread all over the body, to have some long-term damage to sensitive tissues like nerves," In addition, after a patient is cured, the virus may persist in some parts of the body, including the eyes, and cause inflammation and vision problems, Goodman said.

After the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, about 15 percent of survivors developed eye problems, such as eye pain and vision loss. In the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, in which nearly 24 000 people have been sickened and more than 9800 have died, there have also been reports of survivors with vision problems, according to the World Health Organization. These eye problems typically respond well to treatment, but if left untreated, they can lead to blindness. Although it can take months, most patients who have survived the disease do fully recover. In the wake of the outbreak in West Africa, there are now many more Ebola survivors than before, and studies of these patients should give doctors a better idea of how often lingering side effects occur and whether other problems can also occur, Part of the Ebola response effort should include educating people about the complications of Ebola and ensuring that patients have access to care to prevent consequences such as blindness. Attention should also be paid to the social and economic hardships that Ebola survivors face, Goodman said.

Several organizations are working to help Ebola survivors make the transition back into their communities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC).
