[1] Hong Kong weekly report

In its weekly report, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) last week confirmed 12 H7N9 avian flu cases reported from China's mainland from 2-8 Jun 2017.

The previous 2 weeks saw 8 and 9 cases reported, respectively, so the update reflects a small uptick.

Nine of the 12 cases had known exposure to poultry, and one patient was listed as a 4-year-old. That case is notable because H7N9 infections in children are uncommon. Eight men and 4 women contracted the virus, and their ages range from 4 to 68 years. The patients reported symptom onset from 20 May to 3 Jun 2017.

Three of the cases are from Beijing, and officials said they were likely imported from other provinces. A new case from Shaanxi province was likely imported from Inner Mongolia province, the 2nd such case in Shaanxi in the last 2 weeks.

There were 2 cases each reported in Anhui, Chongqing and Henan, and one each from Jiangsu and Shandong.

The CHP said the new cases warrant a call for strict personal hygiene for travelers to China's mainland. Travelers to the mainland or other affected areas have been told to avoid visiting live-poultry markets or farms.

"They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends," the CHP report said. "They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry."

In other H7N9 news, Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease tracking blog, posted a translated report from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture that described a large poultry die-off in Inner Mongolia province, which reported its 1st poultry outbreak just a few weeks ago.

Of almost 60 000 laying hens, more than 35 000 died, the report said. A national reference lab confirmed H7N9 on 8 Jun 2017, and the large number of poultry deaths suggests that the virus is highly pathogenic. At least 3 human cases of H7N9 have been traced back to Inner Mongolia province in June 2017.

During the period between 9-15 Jun 2017, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region reported one human H7N9 AIV case (55-year-old male) in Baise city.

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has reported a total of 27 human H7N9 AIV cases (including 14 fatal, 13 discharged from hospital) since 2017.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [16 Jun 2017] is monitoring a notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission that 5 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), including one death, were recorded from 9-15 Jun 2017, and strongly urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The 4 male patients and one female, who came from Beijing, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan and Zhejiang and were aged from 41 to 68, had onset from 25 Apr to 6 Jun 2017. Among them, 3 were known to have exposure to poultry or poultry markets.

Travellers to the mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchase of live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention, and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The CHP's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is underway. The travel industry and other stakeholders are being regularly updated on the latest information.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below while handling poultry:
- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume them immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page, and the YouTube Channel.

de Vries RP, Peng W, Grant OC, Thompson AJ, Zhu X,. 3 mutations switch H7N9 influenza to human-type receptor specificity. PLoS Pathog 13(6): e1006390.
-----------------------------------
"The avian H7N9 influenza outbreak in 2013 resulted from an unprecedented incidence of influenza transmission to humans from infected poultry. The majority of human H7N9 isolates contained a hemagglutinin (HA) mutation (Q226L) that has previously been associated with a switch in receptor specificity from avian-type (NeuAcα2-3Gal) to human-type (NeuAcα2-6Gal), as documented for the avian progenitors of the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) human influenza pandemic viruses. While this raised concern that the H7N9 virus was adapting to humans, the mutation was not sufficient to switch the receptor specificity of H7N9, and has not resulted in sustained transmission in humans. To determine if the H7 HA was capable of acquiring human-type receptor specificity, we conducted mutation analyses. Remarkably, 3 amino acid mutations conferred a switch in specificity for human-type receptors that resembled the specificity of the 2009 human H1 pandemic virus, and promoted binding to human trachea epithelial cells."

Author summary
--------------
"Influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype continues to cross the species barrier from poultry to humans. This zoonotic ability is remarkable as the virus retains specificity to avian-type receptors. To effectively transmit between humans, the virus needs to acquire human-type receptor specificity. In this study, we show that recombinant H7 proteins need 3 amino acid mutations to change specificity to human-type receptors. Although we are not allowed to assess if these mutations would lead to efficient transmission in the ferret model, this knowledge will aid in surveillance. If these amino acid mutations are observed to arise during natural selection in humans, timely actions could be taken."

[According to this publication, the authors have demonstrated in vitro that several alternative 3-amino-acid mutations (V186G/K-K193T-G228S or V186N-N224K-G228S) can switch the receptor specificity of the H7N9 HA from avian- to human-type, a property required for transmission in humans and ferrets. Of these highlighted mutations, only isolated examples of 186G and 193N have, to date, been actually reported in H7 avian isolates. These mutants have shown profound loss of binding to avian-type (α2-3 linked) receptors, and increased binding to human-type (α2-6 linked) receptors in both glycan microarrays and glycan ELISA-type avidity assays as reported in this paper. Thus, there are multiple ways for H7N9 to obtain human-type receptor specificity.

The bottom line is that there is need to continuously monitor the evolutionary changes in the virus and look out for any of the mutational events mentioned above or otherwise. - Mod.UBA
