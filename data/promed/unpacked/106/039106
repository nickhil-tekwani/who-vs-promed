["Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal disease of horses, mules, donkeys, and zebra. Recently, the infection was reported in camels. The aetiological agents of equine piroplasmosis are _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_. Approximately 14 species of ixodid ticks in the genera _Dermacentor_, _Rhipicephalus_, and _Hyalomma_ have been identified as transstadial vectors of _B. caballi_ and _T. equi_, while 8 of these species were also able to transmit _B. caballi_ infections transovarially. Infected animals may remain carriers of these blood parasites for long periods and act as sources of infection for tick vectors.

The parasites occur in southern Europe, Asia, countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Cuba, South and Central America, and certain parts of the southern United States of America. _T. equi_ has also been reported from Australia (but, apparently never established itself in this region), and is now believed to have a wider general distribution than _B. caballi_.

The clinical signs of equine piroplasmosis are often nonspecific, and the disease can easily be confused with other conditions. Piroplasmosis can occur in peracute, acute and chronic forms.

The acute cases are commoner, and are characterised by fever that usually exceeds 40 deg C (104 deg F), reduced appetite and malaise, elevated respiratory and pulse rates, congestion of mucous membranes, and faecal balls that are smaller and drier than normal.

Clinical signs in subacute cases are similar. In addition, affected animals show loss of weight, and fever is sometimes intermittent. The mucous membranes vary from pale pink to pink, or pale yellow to bright yellow. Petechiae and/or ecchymoses (a hemorrhagic spot, larger than a petechia) may also be visible on the mucous membranes. Normal bowel movements may be slightly depressed and the animals may show signs of mild colic. Mild oedematous swelling of the distal part of the limbs sometimes occurs.

Chronic cases usually present nonspecific clinical signs such as mild inappetence, poor performance and a drop in body mass. The spleen is usually found to be enlarged on rectal examination.

A rare peracute form where horses are found either dead or moribund has been reported.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, chapter 2.5.8 "Equine piroplasmosis" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.08_EQUINE_PIROPLASMOSIS.pdf (NB: Version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014):

"Some species of _Babesia_ or _Theileria_ can occasionally infect species other than their usual host, including humans. To date, the most important pathogens for humans appear to be the bovine pathogen _B. divergens_ in Europe and the rodent species _B. microti_ in the USA. Although _B. caballi_ or _T. equi_ may have been implicated in a few human infections in the past, these organisms do not seem to be important zoonoses. However, human babesiosis is still incompletely understood, and the possibility of infection with these organisms has not been ruled out."
