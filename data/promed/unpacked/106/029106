Clarification on choice of Adenovirus type 36
----------------------------------------------
I am responding to queries about the selection of Adenovirus type 36
(Ad-36) for our research and about our conclusions derived from the
results. As mentioned in the posting, I have no control over any reporter
writing their own version of the story.
Here is the real story. I had stumbled upon the obesity-promoting potential
of an avian adenovirus (SMAM-1) when I was working in Bombay, India. SMAM-1
also showed an association with human obesity. I thought that this was
important enough to pursue and came back to the United States where I had
obtained my graduate training. The plan was to simply import SMAM-1 and
continue the work. After being refused permission to import SMAM-1 into the
United States by the USDA, we were forced to focus on adenoviruses
available in the US. This time we decided to focus on a human adenovirus.
However, there are 50 different types of human adenoviruses and we were
faced with the problem of selecting one of them. We used some logic, some
guess work, and some luck in getting the right virus. Unlike Ad-2, 5 or 15,
Ad-36 was not well studied and we thought there were chances that its
adiposity promoting potential had remained undetected. In addition, Ad-36
is antigenically [a very unique virus [which does not cross react with
most other human adenoviruses. In absence of any other pointers, this
quality was very attractive to us. Antigenically [uniqueness may (or may
not) mean that it has; 1) unique receptor site and / or tissue preferences,
2) other unique characteristics or expressions, and 3) ease in detecting
type-specific neutralizing antibodies in animals and humans. The very first
experiment showed that we had a good [choice. In [this experiment, we had
[included an additonal virus, CELO (an avian adenovirus), [which was
observed not to induce increased adiposity like Ad-36. This demonstrated
that [the effect of Ad-36 is not just a result of a virus infection. Next,
we conducted several experiments to confirm the reproducibility of the
phenomenon. We screened humans for the presence of neutralizing antibodies
to Ad-36 as well as Ad-2, Ad-31 and Ad-37 (other human adenoviruses).
Prevalence of Ad-36 antibodies was 30% in the obese subjects and 5% in the
non-obese subjects. Prevalence of antibodies to [the other human
adenoviruses screened was not different between the obese and the
non-obese. We have similar results in twin samples. This indicated that
among the antibodies screened, only Ad-36 antibodies had differential
prevalence among the obese and the non-obese.
[Regarding the issue of causation versus association, I make the following
comments. In several experiments we have infected animals with Ad-36
(isolated and retrieved the virus from the animals) and observed increased
adiposity in them. This makes us feel comfortable to say that Ad-36 DID
INCREASE adiposity in animals (which is the title of the article
published). I have repeatedly said this to reporters that we can not
conclude about the causation of obesity in humans. The most definitive
experiment of infecting humans and observing adiposity can not be done due
to ethical reasons. Therefore, we will have to always depend on indirect
evidence for the role of Ad-36 in human obesity. Based on our preliminary
data in humans, we can only say that Ad-36 antibodies are associated with
human obesity. I think we are entitled to that limited conclusion.
I notice that various experts are expressing their opinions that this paper
does not show a cause of human obesity. This comment is absolutely
accurate. However, I am surprised because I have not claimed [this in our
manuscript or in any of my interviews. I certainly understand the
difference between causation and association.
