AVIAN INFLUENZA, POULTRY - USA (CT) (09)

I was seriously misquoted in a previous posting (Avian influenza, poultry -
USA (CT) (07) 20030418.0949) by the referenced article, which originally
appeared in the 12 Apr 2003 edition of the Hartford Courant and was written
by Andre Bowser. The route of administration of the avian influenza vaccine
to be used in Connecticut is subcutaneous.
Mr Bowser was interviewing another Connecticut Department of Agriculture
official for the article, and I was called in for not more than 3 minutes.
I did not specifically tell Mr Bowser the route of administration of the
avian influenza vaccine. I was questioned as to the various routes of
vaccine administration in poultry and other livestock, and I explained each
one. I did not say that "the vaccine would be administered subcutaneously
into the muscle"!
In addition, the statement "putting the vaccine in feed or water won't work
because chickens are notoriously sloppy eaters" cannot be attributed to me.
I did not attempt to correct the gross misrepresentation when the article
appeared in the Hartford Courant, but I am requesting that ProMED-mail
publish the correction.
