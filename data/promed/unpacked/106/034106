Researchers have detected _mcr-1_ "superbug" gene for the 2nd time in the United States. The gene makes bacteria highly resistant to a last-resort of antibiotics. It was found in a sample of _E. coli_ bacteria from a patient in New York. In the country [USA], the gene was first discovered in a patient from Pennsylvania.

The latest case of superbug was reported on [Mon 27 June 2016] in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. The _mcr-1_ gene makes bacteria resistant to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat multi-drug-resistant infections, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE, which US health officials have dubbed as "nightmare" bacteria.

The presence of _mcr-1_ gene is concerning because the bacteria can share resistance genes. US officials are concerned that the _mcr-1_ gene may find its way into CRE bacteria. This will make the bacteria resistant to all types of antibiotics.

Researchers have been looking for presence the _mcr-1_ gene all over the world since it was discovered last year [2015] in people and pigs in China. The recent detection of the bacteria was a global effort called the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, which was led by Mariana Castanheira of JMI Laboratories based in North Liberty, Iowa.

As part of the effort, 13 525 _Escherichia coli_ and 7481 _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ strains were tested. They were collected last year [2015] from patients in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, Europe, and North America. Of these, 390 were resistant to colistin, while 19 of these isolates tested positive for the _mcr-1_ gene. The samples that were tested positive for [the] gene came from 10 countries. One sample was from the US.

To keep track of the spread of this resistance gene in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has disclosed plans to expand laboratory capacity to 7 or 8 regional laboratories, plus add capacity to laboratories in each US state as well as 7 cities or territories.
