India: encephalitis outbreaks attributed to virulent form of Chandipura virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chandipura virus has [attracted] considerable attention in India,
particularly after the large-scale deaths of children in parts of
Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh last year and in Gujarat this year. But a
recent study at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has [predicted]
that the worst is still to come, because the virus, first isolated from
humans in India in the 1960s during an outbreak of dengue and other forms
of viral diseases, has now acquired a totally virulent form.
In addition, in the absence of any treatment, coupled with a lack of
previous exposure to this pathogen, human beings have not developed
immunity to fight the virus, scientists at the NIV warned. As many as 250
children in certain pockets of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh succumbed to
Chandipura virus infection last year, which was initially diagnosed as
Japanese encephalitis.
The matter has come to light following recent genetic sequencing done at
the NIV laboratory, a report of which has already been submitted to its
parent body, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR): "The genetic
structure may have undergone mutations, thus making it more virulent." NIV
officer-in-charge Dr AC Mishra was unavailable for comment, but officials
at NIV confirmed the findings: "This is something which we have stumbled
upon only now," a scientist told TNN, adding that the involvement of the
virus in the outbreak of encephalitis has upgraded it as an agent of great
public importance. Chandipura virus, named in 1965 after a village near
Nagpur, where it was first isolated, belongs to the family _Rhabdoviridae_
and is a member of the genus _Vesiculovirus_ whose type species is
_Vesicular stomatitis virus_ (VSV).
Meanwhile, NIV, on the occasion of its golden jubilee celebration, is
organizing an international symposium, entitled "Emerging Viral Infections:
New Frontiers and Challenges," next month [11 to 13 Oct 2004]. The
symposium will focus on viral infections of the central nervous system,
viral hemorrhagic fevers, emerging respiratory viruses, viral hepatitis,
novel virus discovery tools, and viral infections in HIV/Aids. The
symposium also has a session in which central and state government health
officials, scientists, and key administrators will discus India's
preparedness for tackling emerging viral diseases. The deliberations will
review and recommend methods for tackling emerging viral infections of
public health interest.

[As noted previously in ProMED-mail, Chandipura virus is a ubiquitous
infectious agent on the Indian sub-continent, which can infect humans and
many other mammalian species. The high background of specific antibodies
and virus RNA in the population of India combine to obscure any potential
role of this virus in pediatric illnesses, and the matter remains
unresolved. Until the data accumulated at the Institute of Virology in Pune
are published in full, doubt will remain about the significance of
Chandipura virus as a human pathogen. - Mod.CP]
