[Buruli ulcer was widely reported to have re-emerged as a problem in the
Eastern Region of Ghana last year, and has now been reported in a total of
83 patients during 1999. The affected who reported to various health
centres in the region are undergoing free, but slow treatment. A synopsis
of the Buruli cases, which was obtained from the Eastern Regional
Directorate of Health Services, indicated that all, but four of the 15
districts of the region, reported cases of the ulcer during the year. The
Akuapem South district [reported 38 cases followed by Yilo Krobo with 17
and Akuapem North with 9. Suhum, Kraboa-Coaltar had 80 cases; Birim North -
4; Manya Krobo - 3; and Kwahu South district had 1 case. The data also
suggested that the infection was [more frequent in the rainy season than
during the dry spell. The peak was in June when 21 Buruli ulcer cases were
recorded. Other months of high incidence were September (12), November(11),
May and October (9) each and July (6). In [both April and December, 5
cases were recorded, [and March and August each had 2 cases. While the dry
month of January had only 1 case, February was actually free of Buruli
ulcer cases.
[This report means that the only districts of the Eastern Region which are
Buruli ulcer-free, are the Afram plains, Fanteakwa, Asuogyaman, West Akyem
and Kwaebibriem. Knowledge about the causes of Buruli ulcer remains scanty
as a lot of studies are still underway on the subject. However, when
contacted, the Eastern Regional Director of Health Services, Dr. Aaron
Offei, explained that certain [bacteria called [_Mycobacterium ulcerans_
is the agent of the disease. This bacterium is at times on some grass and
fauna in the bush and along the paths leading to rivers and ponds. "Once
you come into contact with the bacterium, it starts with a small swelling
on your skin called pre-ulcerative node." According to Dr. Offei if the
node is left untreated, it develops into a big sore commonly called
'Kisikro' by the Akans. Though the agents of the disease do not dwell in
water per se, he said, the [mycobacteria appear to be prevalent on grasses
and fauna near to certain water bodies. Among the endemic areas are pockets
of settlements along the Densu River in the Suhum Kraboa-Coaltar and
Akuapem South districts as well as Amasaman in the Ga Rural district.
Asked how the 83 infected people are faring, the Regional Director said
their wounds were being cleaned and dressed with gauze and medicines. That
treatment could take one year or more before the sores heal completely,
depending on how big they are, he said, saying that the treatment is
supposed to be free. In view of the long period of healing and the pain
caused by the disease, Dr. Offei called on all people who notice the node
or swelling on their skins to [report to the nearest health centre for
diagnosis, explaining that if detected early the disease can be stopped
with only an [excision around the node. He advised rural dwellers to wear
long clothing before going to their farms or riversides to protect their
skin from being brushed directly.
