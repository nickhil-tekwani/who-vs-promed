Two people in Belgium have been infected with _Listeria_ bacteria that lead to the death of 3 people and a miscarriage over a 2-year period in the Netherlands, a sampling by a federal health centre showed. [See ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (15): (Netherlands) fatal, WGS, cold cuts 20191005.6711608, which described a listeriosis outbreak that affected 20 people, 3 of whom died and one woman had a miscarriage, over the past 2 years after eating cold cuts produced by Offerman, a Netherland-based producer. - Mod.ML]

The cases in Belgium affected a 97-year-old woman and a Dutch national who recently gave birth in Antwerp [Belgium], a study by federal health research centre Sciensano confirmed. Both women were infected with the bacteria in 2018, according to the study, which compared samples of bacteria in the Netherlands with those of Belgian patients infected, HLN reports.

The centre's study comes after three people died and one woman had suffered a miscarriage in the Netherlands after eating meat contaminated with _Listeria_ over a 2-year period, which was reportedly linked to Dutch meat producer Offerman.

In Germany, 2 _Listeria_-related deaths were also reported in the central state of Hesse. [See ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (16): (Germany) fatal, WGS, meat, healthcare facilities 20191019.6736570, which described a listeriosis outbreak that affected 40 people, 3 of whom have died, in 12 German states between 2014 and 2019, due to _Listeria_-contaminated meat products manufactured at a processing facility in the German state of Hesse and widely distributed to more than 20 European countries. This German outbreak associated with the Hesse-based meat processing facility is unrelated to the Netherlands/Belgium outbreak associated with the Netherlands-based meat processing facility. - Mod.ML]

News of the deaths led supermarkets in Belgium to issue recalls for prepackaged meat, a move they said at the time was precautionary. Offerman, a subsidiary of Belgian food group Ter Beke, has since been shut down in the Netherlands.

The Sciensano study could not identify the cause of the infections in Belgium, since isolated cases, unlike outbreaks, are not subject to follow-ups, Het Nieuwsblad reports.

[The incriminated meat is refrigerated cold cuts that are not cooked before eating (i.e., ready-to-eat). Cold cuts are well-recognized sources for listeriosis. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease. People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_. - Mod.ML
