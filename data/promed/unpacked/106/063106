VIDA VETERINARY INVESTIGATION DIAGNOSIS ANALYSIS
Veterinary Investigation Surveillance Report 1996 and 1989 - 96. A tabulated
summary of diagnoses recorded at Veterinary Investigation Centres in
England, Scotland and Wales.
The Veterinary Investigation Diagnosis Analysis database contains a record
of every submission made to the laboratories of the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency and the Scottish Agricultural Colleges. The database which has been
operating since 1975 is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world
and to date holds records on approximately 4.5 million submissions. As well
as the production of the annual report, VIDA is also used for ad-hoc
investigations and in 1996, 235 individual data requests were answered. For
further information see the section on the ad-hoc service below.
The 1996 book contains information on monthly and yearly diagnosis trends in
cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, birds and miscellaneous species as well as a
summary of livestock populations and weather conditions. Diagnoses are
divided into the following nine groups
Group 1 Systemic diseases and those not readily classified organically
Group 2 Diseases of the digestive system
Group 3 Diseases of the respiratory system
Group 4 Diseases of the urinary system
Group S Diseases of the musculo-skeletal system
Group 6 Diseases of the nervous system and organs of special sense
Group 7 Diseases of the skin
Group 8 Diseases of the blood and lymph circulatory and poietic systems
Group 9 Diseases of the reproductive and mammary system
Example of Disease Trends in 1996 - CATTLE
General
Although the total UK cattle population fell, the cattle population of Great
Britain was at its highest level since 1991. Despite this increase, total
cattle submissions fell from 140,813 in 1995 to 122,770 in 1996, a drop of
12.8%. This surprising trendis perhaps, in part, explained by the
extraordinary disruption of the cattle trade as a result of the
implementation of further BSE control measures.
Reproductive diseases
A surprisingly high diagnostic rate was achieved for Brucella screenings and
this despite a reduction in the diagnosis of both leptospira and _Salmonella
dublin_ abortion. A more strict interpretation of serological evidence may
explain the reduction of leptospirosis diagnoses whilst widespread use of
vaccines in an attempt to control _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT104 may have
resulted in reduced exposure to _S.dublin_. _Bacillus licheniformis_
remained a significant cause of abortion in the first six months of the
year, but the most remarkable statistic was the threefold increase in the
incidence of protozoal abortion, primarily that associated with _Neospora
caninum_.
Respiratory diseases
1996 was notable for the remarkable increase in the incidence of parasitic
bronchitis, particularly in the wetter western parts of the country, with
new cases being recorded well into November. An increase in the detection of
_Mycoplasma bovis_, usually in conjunction with other pathogens associated
with pneumonia, may reflect a real increase in incidence of this pathogen
throughout the country.
Alimentary diseases
Cases of salmonellosis due to _S.typhimurium_ showed a decrease for the
first time in many years, most probably reflecting a fall in numbers of
cases associated with definitive type 104. Rotavirus and cryptosporidia
remained the two most commonly diagnosed causes of calf scour despite the
availability of an effective vaccine for the former. The increased diagnosis
of bovine coccidiosis in recent years continued in 1996 and remains
intriguing. Recorded diagnoses of Johne's disease in cattle continued an
upward trend. A further reduction in the diagnosis of fasciolasis from the
high figure of 1994 is perhaps only a reflection of less favourable weather
patterns during 1996 resulting in low snail populations and little chance
for the free-living stages to develop and survive.
Mastitis
A reduction of approximately 20% in the diagnosis of mastitis associated
with virtually all the commonly recognised mastitis pathogens is surely a
reflection of the stringent financial penalties being imposed upon milk
producers failing to control the disease in their herds. It is interesting
to note that this reduction includes both environmental and
non-environmental causes of mastitis equally, suggesting a welcome adoption
of the wide-ranging control measures that have been emphasised for many
years. A continuation of this trend into 1997 is anticipated.
Vida Ad-Hoc Data Retrievals Service
We are able to offer a customised data retrieval service from the VIDA
database. An extensive number of diagnoses are recorded on the database for
cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, various species of birds, and other
miscellaneous species including horses, rabbits, fish, dogs, cats, deer and
badgers.
Information can be retrieved for any number of years from 1975 to the
current year, for any number of diagnoses and for any of the species
recorded on the database. You can ask for data relating to a specific age
group and for diagnoses made from a specific type of sample or from a
specific area of Great Britain. The information is collated by county,
diagnosis or Veterinary Investigation Centre and by month and year for each
diagnosis and species requested.
