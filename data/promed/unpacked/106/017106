[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other
forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 2 Jun 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------
The following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJ referred
to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of
definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated
in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease
thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 2 Jun 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 115
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 48
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 163

Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new cases diagnosed
during the past month, and the number of patients alive is unchanged.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995 and the peak
number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17
in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and
so far no new cases during the 1st 5 months of 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 2 Jun 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 54 referrals, 27
deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, none from
familial CJD, 2 from GSS, and none from vCJD.

et maladies apparentees [in French, trans. & summ. Mod.CP, edited]

This document lists the numbers of confirmed and probable cases of all
forms of CJD recorded in France from 1992 to 2008. The original text
should be consulted for a full breakdown of the figures. During that
period there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now deceased. They occurred
between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one in 2000, one in 2001, 3
in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 3 in 2007, and
none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and 11 female patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6 of
the patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris] and 17 in the
provinces. All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129 of the
prion protein gene. No special risk factors were evident, which
distinguished these patients from those with other forms of CJD
(sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic). However one patient had visited the
UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 2 Jun 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there have been 630
referrals, 20 deaths from sporadic CJD, one death from iatrogenic
CJD, 3 from familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

[3] A novel prion disease: AA amyloidosis

[Ref: Are cheetahs on the run from prion-like amyloidosis? PNAS, 20
May 2008; 105(20): 7113-4. Epub 16 May 2008]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A commentary by Byron Caughey and Gerald S Baron
Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories,

Abstract: The misfolding and aggregation of proteins is often an
accident waiting to happen. Consequently, organisms have developed
sophisticated chaperone and quality-control systems to limit abnormal
protein interactions and the accumulation of toxic aggregates.
However, sometimes these systems can be overwhelmed, and diseases,
namely protein misfolding diseases, can result. One such disease,
amyloid protein A (AA) amyloidosis, is wreaking havoc in the captive
cheetah population, complicating efforts to rescue this endangered
species from extinction. One key to managing this fatal disease in
cheetahs is to understand why it is so prevalent. Most cases of AA
amyloidosis in mammals appear to occur spontaneously, usually as a
result of chronic inflammation or genetic peculiarities that
predispose the organism to the deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA)
protein in fibrillar deposits called amyloid. In this issue of PNAS,
Zhang et al. [see below] report that AA amyloid is excreted in the
feces of cheetahs with AA amyloidosis and that this fecal amyloid can
in turn promote a similar disease in mice. These results suggest that
cheetah AA amyloidosis may not be simply a spontaneous disease, but
also a natural prion-like, transmissible protein misfolding disease.

The following is the abstract of the paper referred to in the
preceding commentary [edited, available at:
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/105/20/7263?etoc>].

[Ref: Fecal transmission of AA amyloidosis in the cheetah contributes
to high incidence of disease. PNAS, 105(20): 7263-8. Epub 12 May 2008]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beiru Zhang et al.

Abstract: AA amyloidosis is one of the principal causes of morbidity
and mortality in captive cheetahs (_Acinonyx jubatus_), which are in
danger of extinction, but little is known about the underlying
mechanisms. Given the transmissible characteristics of AA
amyloidosis, transmission between captive cheetahs may be a possible
mechanism involved in the high incidence of AA amyloidosis. In this
study of animals with AA amyloidosis, we found that cheetah feces
contained AA amyloid fibrils that were different from those of the
liver with regard to molecular weight and shape and had greater
transmissibility. The infectious activity of fecal AA amyloid fibrils
was reduced or abolished by the protein denaturants 6 M guanidine-HCl
and formic acid or by AA immunodepletion. Thus, we propose that feces
are a vehicle of transmission that may accelerate AA amyloidosis in
captive cheetah populations. These results provide a pathogenesis for
AA amyloidosis and suggest possible measures for rescuing cheetahs
from extinction.

[4] Potential human transmissibility of BASE prion
Date: Tue 1 Apr 2008

[Ref: Evaluation of the human transmission risk of an atypical bovine
spongiform encephalopathy prion strain. J Virol. April 2008;
82(7):3697-701. Epub 30 Jan 2008]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qingzhong Kong et al.

Abstract: Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the prion disease
in cattle, was widely believed to be caused by only one strain,
BSE-C. BSE-C causes the fatal prion disease named new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Two atypical BSE strains, bovine
amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and
BSE-H, have been discovered in several countries since 2004; their
transmissibility and phenotypes in humans are unknown. We
investigated the infectivity and human phenotype of BASE strains by
inoculating transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human prion protein
with brain homogenates from 2 BASE strain-infected cattle. Sixty
percent of the inoculated Tg mice became infected after 20 to 22
months of incubation, a transmission rate higher than those reported
for BSE-C. A quarter of BASE strain-infected Tg mice, but none of the
Tg mice infected with prions causing a sporadic human prion disease,
showed the presence of pathogenic prion protein isoforms in the
spleen, indicating that the BASE prion is intrinsically lymphotropic.
The pathological prion protein isoforms in BASE strain-infected
humanized Tg mouse brains are different from those from the original
cattle BASE or sporadic human prion disease. Minimal brain spongiosis
and long incubation times are observed for the BASE strain-infected
Tg mice. These results suggest that in humans, the BASE strain is a
more virulent BSE strain and likely lymphotropic.

[These experiments with transgenic humanised mice expressing the
human prion protein gene suggest that the BASE prion strain may be
more virulent in humans than the BSE prion strain, and possibly
lymphotropic. They do not establish, however, that the BASE prion
might be more transmissible from cattle to humans. - Mod.CP]
