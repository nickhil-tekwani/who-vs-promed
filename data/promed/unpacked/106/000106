Health officials: syphilis outbreak worsening in southern Idaho
-----------------------------------------------
A syphilis outbreak that started in 2003 is worsening in Canyon
County and parts of southern Idaho, health officials say. Since the
outbreak began, the Southwest District Health Department has found
104 cases of the sexually transmitted disease in its region, which
covers 6 counties in southwestern Idaho. Most of the cases have been
in Canyon County.

The cases have been spread evenly among men and women. Half of those
infected have been jailed in the past, and 70 percent admitted to
being users of methamphetamine, officials said.

One 15-year-old girl has been diagnosed twice in the past 2 years
with the disease, according to health district staff. "It's
frightening to think we've had someone who's 15 and has had it
twice," said Laurie Boston, Southwest District Health spokeswoman.

7 babies have been born with the disease in the district since 2003,
enough of a bump to make Idaho the state with the 6th-highest rate of
congenital syphilis in the nation, Boston said. CDC reports that
during 2003 -- the latest year that figures are available -- 4 babies
were born with syphilis in Idaho.

Some scattered cases have been diagnosed in Ada County, and Lincoln
County and the Twin Falls area have also seen an increase, Boston
said.

Health department officials said in 2004 that the outbreak began with
a case in Homedale and was quickly spreading among the young Hispanic
population. In an effort to stem the disease's spread, the district
increased the number of staffers who deal with the disease and
assigned case managers to each pregnant mother who tested positive
for syphilis.

The district also teamed up with the Idaho Migrant Council and Terry
Reilly Health Services to educate the public about the outbreak and
teach what symptoms to watch for and how to get tested. The efforts
had some success. "The Hispanic population is coming down," said
Jacque Walker, preventive health manager for Southwest District
Health.

Still, the outbreak is rapidly spreading among drug users, and health
district officials are focusing education efforts on bars and
organizations that deal with addicts. It's tough for health workers
to track sexual partners of infected people because drug users may
have had multiple partners or may not remember who their partners
were, officials said.

"It's really difficult to get them into treatment because they live
such chaotic lives, and they're fearful of contact with authorities,"
Walker said.

"You can have it in your body for years and not know you have it
until you have different things making you sick," Boston said.

In 1999, there were 2 cases of syphilis in Southwest District
Health's region, and none in 2000. One case was confirmed in 2001, 9
cases in 2002, 38 in 2003 and 46 in 2004. So far, 20 cases have been
confirmed in 2005, Boston said.

In 2003, the CDC reported a syphilis infection rate of 3.4 per every
100 000 people in Idaho, compared to a rate of 3.9 per 100 000 in
Washington, and zero cases in Montana. Oregon also had a syphilis
infection rate of 3.4 per 100 000 people in 2003, the CDC reported.
