Preliminary tests indicate bacteria found in an abnormal hoof taken from an elk killed in a vehicle collision in Skagit County east of Sedro-Woolley may be the same strain found in diseased elk in southwest Washington.

Last month [December 2015], the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) sent abnormal hooves collected from 4 elk in northwest Washington to Colorado State University to test for treponeme-associated hoof disease, which has infected 2 elk herds in southwest Washington.

Results came back negative for 3 elk harvested by hunters in Whatcom County, but the sample from Skagit County revealed microscopic evidence of treponeme-associated hoof disease, said Kristin Mansfield, WDFW epidemiologist.

All 4 of the elk tested by the university were from the North Cascades herd -- also also known as the Nooksack herd -- which includes about 1000 animals centered in Skagit and Whatcom counties. The hoof that tested positive for treponeme bacteria was taken from an elk found dead along Highway 20.

"We routinely send disfigured elk hooves from around the state for testing, but this is the 1st outside of southwest Washington that shows evidence of this disease," Mansfield said. "At this point it is unclear whether this condition will spread to other elk as it has in the affected area."

Mansfield said WDFW now plans to have hoof samples from the animal sent to testing facilities at Washington State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to confirm the initial findings and determine whether the bacteria are the same strain found in southwest Washington. Test results are expected next month.

Treponeme associated hoof disease was initially diagnosed in southwest Washington elk herds in 2014, after 5 years of analysis by 5 independent laboratories. While relatively common in livestock, hoof disease caused by treponeme bacteria had never before been diagnosed in wildlife.

Starting in the late 1990s with reports of elk with hoof deformities in the Cowlitz River Basin, the disease has spread to a number of counties in southwest Washington, affecting both the Mount St. Helens and Willapa Hills elk herds.

WDFW is currently conducting 2 studies pertaining to hoof disease -- 1 to assess the prevalence of the disease in southwest Washington, the other to gauge its effects on elk survival and reproduction.

As a precautionary measure, the department investigates reports of abnormal hooves from elk killed by hunters, traffic accidents and other causes and submits those showing signs of the disease for testing, Mansfield said.

[Reports of lameness and deformed hooves in free-ranging Roosevelt elk (_Cervus elaphus roosevelti_) have occurred sporadically in southwest Washington State for over a decade; however, the apparent number and geographical distribution of these reports increased dramatically in 2008 (see ProMED post 20130305.1572490).

In cattle, sheep, and goats, foot rot is a disease with multifactorial causes, with an essential spirochetal bacterial component. The spirochetes involved belong to a diverse phylogenetic group of _Treponema_ sp.

Post-mortem examinations and diagnostic tests conducted in diseased animals have failed to identify a primary cause of hoof deformity in this chronically affected elk population. The levels of copper and selenium found in these animals were low compared to those of livestock (copper deficiency in cattle is associated with increased incidence of infectious hoof disease), but it is unknown whether these levels are low for free-ranging elk.

According to a recent paper by Han and Masfield (J Wldlf Dis 50: 259-79, April 2014) no hoof disease has been reported in domestic livestock by local veterinarians and landowners.

These elk seem to have a deformity, not necessarily foot rot. While a treponema has been associated with some cases, it is very minor in foot rot cases.

What most of us think of as foot rot or infectious pododermatitis, is a hoof infection commonly found in sheep, goats, and cattle. As the name suggests, it rots away the foot of the animal, more specifically the area between the 2 toes. It is extremely painful and contagious. It can be treated with a series of medications, but if not treated, the whole herd can become infected. The cause of the infection in cattle are 2 species of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that can grow without oxygen), _Fusobacterium necrophorum_ and _Bacteroides melaninogenicus_. Both bacteria are common to the environment in which cattle live, and _Fusobacterium_ is present in the rumen and fecal matter of the cattle. In sheep, _F. necrophorum_ first invades the interdigital skin following damage to the skin, and causes interdigital lesions and slight inflammation. The 2nd stage of the disease is marked by the invasion of the foot by the foot rot bacterium _Dichelobacter nodosus_, a Gram-negative anaerobe. Usually, there is an injury to the skin between the hooves that allows the bacteria to infect the animal.

Another cause of foot rot may be high temperatures or humidity, causing the skin between the hooves to crack and let the bacteria infect the foot. This is one of the reasons foot rot is such a major problem in the summer. Foot rot is easily identifiable by its appearance and foul odor. Treatment is usually with an antibiotic medication, and preventing injury to the feet is the best way to prevent foot rot.

It seems the causative factor in the elk hoof deformity may not be clear. Is the recent finding of a treponema the cause? Or a secondary invader because of other previous hoof trauma/damage/overgrowth? These animals are in the wild and are not under the same conditions as some of the domestic animals such as the sheep and cattle described above.

So the question becomes, is the treponema the cause of the problem or a secondary invader? If secondary, then what is the cause?

Regarding mineral imbalances, perhaps more work is needed as data from captive cervid herds indicate the need for copper may be different than that of domestic ruminants. Likewise with selenium. Selenium deficiency and especially its excess have been associated with hoof overgrowth in some species. So, some serious work on selenium in these animals apparently needs to be done. And as always, funding is a concern for research projects. - Mod.TG]
