Event summary: Peste des petits ruminants [PPR], China (People's Rep)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Four new follow-up reports have been submitted by China to the OIE:
- follow-up report no 13 on 4 Apr 2014 (10 new PPR outbreaks)
- follow-up report no 14 on 8 Apr 2014 (13 new PPR outbreaks)
- follow-up report no 15 on 9 Apr 2014 (35 new PPR outbreaks)
- follow-up report no 16 on 9 Apr 2014 (31 new PPR outbreaks)

The total number of PPR outbreaks since the start of the current epizootic in China, on 5 Dec 2013, is 135.

The summary report above includes a map showing all outbreaks.

[For details on each of the 89 new outbreaks reported within 5 days, including the respective morbidity and mortality data and the control measures applied, please refer to the source URL above where links to each follow-up report are available.

Notably, in all outbreaks, the affected population is composed of animals "purchased from another place" and "vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)" is being applied.

It seems that the central government has eventually decided to undertake a major effort, incorporating all provinces, to try suppress PPR prior to the commencement of the grazing season, when long-distance movement of susceptible sheep and goat flocks, including offspring born during the recent lambing season, may unavoidably expose them to infected animals. Such a disease-control operation deserves to include preventive vaccination, on top of "vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)".

China's PPR-susceptible animal population (2012 OIE data) is 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000 goats.

As obvious from the interactive map, new outbreaks are currently located also close to China's borders with Russia, Viet Nam, and Myanmar.

PPR is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
