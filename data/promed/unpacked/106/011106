Another death by yellow fever confirmed in Goias state
------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health confirmed one more fatal
case of yellow fever in the State. The victim was
a housewife aged 65, living on a farm in
Cristianopolis, 90 km [56 miles] from Goiania
[the state capital]. According to the management
of the Department of Epidemiological
Surveillance, when the health team sought her in
the rural area to offer the vaccine, she refused
to be immunized on religious grounds. The woman
began to feel the first symptoms of the disease
on 13 Jan 2008. On 19 Jan 2008 she died in a
hospital in Goiania.

[Initial] lab tests were performed at the Evandro
Chagas Institute of Para, and they were all
negative. On this Thursday [28 Feb 2008], the
last laboratory test, immunohistochemistry, came
out positive. With this new case, the number of
deaths from yellow fever in Goias in 2008 rises
to 10, out of 17 confirmed cases.

In 2007, 7 cases of yellow fever were confirmed, of which 6 died.

was 60 cases including 24 deaths notified, 35
cases including 19 deaths confirmed, 23 cases

still under investigation -- see:

It is not clear whether the case above is one of
the 2 fatal cases under investigation. - Mod.JW]

[2] Brazil, vaccine adverse events
Date: Fri 29 Feb 2008

Comment on "Adverse events associated with the YF
vaccine" posted on 25 Feb 2008 (20080228.0810).

The report from the Ministerio da Saude,
Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude in Brazil
discusses adverse events associated with the YF
vaccine. Ambiguities in the report are most
likely related to the fact that investigation is
ongoing. Of 7 cases, one has been confirmed as a
fatal case of viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) and
6 others are currently considered as systemic
reactions to the vaccine, possibly linked to a
vaccine component, resulting in death.

In the past some cases thought to be yellow fever
have turned out to be vaccine related fever on
sequencing of the virus (1). On the other hand
some cases attributed to the vaccine were
secondary to wild-type virus (2). The age and sex
of YEL-AVD are of particular interest. It appears
that in cases under the age of 30, for unknown
reasons, most are in women in their 20s.

Yellow fever in Paraguay - update
Mobilization against Yellow Fever in Paraguay Continues
-------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare
(MSPBS) of Paraguay has reported the confirmation
of 16 cases of yellow fever (YF), including 3
deaths; 7 of these cases, young people who
visited rural areas, are from the Department of
San Pedro, and are related to the jungle cycle of
the virus. The other 9 confirmed cases, which
include the 3 deaths, are from San Lorenzo
Municipality, outside of Asunci√≥n. Another 15
suspected cases are being investigated.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health is taking
measures to contain the disease in affected
areas, and more than 1 million people who live in
or travel to these affected areas have been
vaccinated. The Ministry of Health obtained 2
million doses of yellow fever vaccine from the
International Coordinating Group on Provision of
Vaccines of the World Health Organization. Brazil
sent 850 000 doses and Peru sent 144 000 doses of
vaccines, adding to the 300 000 Paraguay had in
reserve.

[4] Paraguay (Asuncion)

The Paraguayan Ministry of Public Health today
reported 6 new cases of suspected yellow fever in
Asuncion and its environs.

Health authorities had under surveillance about
15 cases, of which 4 have been discounted today,
physician Antonio Arbo, coordinator of the
national campaign against the disease, told the
press.

Local newspapers listed 8 dead, while the
Ministry of Public Health confirmed only 5.

Last week [25-29 Feb 2008] more than a million
people were immunized, and a few days ago the
government received 2 million more doses of the
vaccine from the World Health Organization, which
is calming the hysteria caused by the appearance
of the 1st fatal cases and the [initial] lack of
vaccine.
