El Salvador: Dengue/DHF Update
------------------------------
On presumptive diagnosis of [first and second degree] dengue hemorrhagic
fever, 4 children, aged 6 months, 4, 8, and 10 years respectively, have
been admitted to the Bloom Hospital. [Previously] this year the Department
of Health has reported 52 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (and the deaths
of 2 children), and 608 cases of the classic form of dengue fever.
The Great San Salvador area is experiencing a small increment in the index
of mosquito larval infestation. On average for every 100 houses inspected,
6.7 percent harbor mosquito larvae. In the capital, the infestation is
above 9 percent. The current official campaign aims to lower this index to
4 percent.
In 2000 the dengue epidemic took the lives of 31 children of under 5 years
of age and one adult. The epidemic was controlled with the help of medical
personnel from Cuba, Mexico, and Costa Rica. In 2001 the number of dengue
cases recorded nationally was 608, plus 58 cases of dengue hemorrhagic
fever and 2 deaths.

El Salvador: Rise in Dengue Cases Causes Concern
------------------------------------------------
Salvadorian health officials expressed their concern on Thu 9 May 2002 at
the increase of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases reported in
recent days, as well as the presence of influenza type B virus. [Concurrent
outbreaks of dengue & flu also occur in Puerto Rico, which complicates the
clinical diagnosis. - Mod.JW]

Deputy Health Minister Herbert Betancourt said that 639 cases of dengue
fever and 54 cases of DHF had been confirmed, which mostly affected
children. He did not say whether any deaths were reported due to the more
severe form of the disease. Nearly half of the dengue cases were reported
by the San Salvador Health Department, while the other most affected
provinces were Santa Ana, La Libertad, and Chalatenango, in central and
western El Salvador, the official added.
Authorities registered 333 cases of dengue and 3 cases of DHF between
January and April 2001. Citizens should be on alert this year [2002], since
the
rate is significantly higher, Betancourt said

A Case of Dengue Fever in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------
A new case of secondary dengue fever infection was diagnosed at the
Virology Laboratory of the Dr. Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The
case presented with fever, generalized body aches, and upper abdominal pain
of 4 days duration. The patient had been [treated in] another hospital for
2 days before coming to the Dr. Fakeeh Hospital. The patient is a
33-year-old male. Laboratory data showed leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and
elevated liver enzymes AST and ALT.
Testing of the first sample obtained on the fifth day of symptoms showed
positive IgM ELISA, and an IgG titer of 1/40 using indirect
immunofluorescent assay. Testing the same sample by RT-PCR showed a
positive band corresponding to the appropriate molecular weight for the
amplified product and [aligned with] the positive control. Blood samples
have been cultured and results are awaited. The patient's condition has
improved and he was discharged 4 days after admission for follow-up.

Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever in Brazil: WHO Update 2
--------------------------------------------------------
During the first quarter of this year, Brazil's national health authorities
have reported 317 787 cases of dengue fever including 57 deaths, with Rio
de Janeiro State being the most affected area with 41 percent of all cases
registered. During January and February 2002, in comparison with January
and February 2001, an increase in the number of cases has been observed in
14 of the 27 States and the number of cases was 886 percent [i.e. almost 9
times
- Mod.JW] greater in Rio de Janeiro State during this period in 2002.
As of Thu 25 Apr 2002, 95 463 cases, including 571 dengue haemorrhagic
fever (DHF) cases and 31 deaths, were reported within Rio de Janeiro
Municipality alone. A dramatic decrease in disease activity was observed
during the month of Apr 2002 in the Municipality, with cases occurring
between 1 and 25 Apr 2002 representing [only] 3 percent of cases reported
since
the beginning of the year. [The geographical distribution of cases in Rio
de Janeiro Municipality is illustrated in a figure provided by the Rio de
Janeiro municipal health authority, which can be accessed at the above URL.
- Mod.CP].
This outbreak is associated with dengue virus serotype 3, which has only
been recently introduced into the population and explains the increased
number of DHF cases registered in 2002.
