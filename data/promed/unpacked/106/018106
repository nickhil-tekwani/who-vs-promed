We agree with your comment that it is wrong to ascribe a dual aetiology, by
two distinct arboviruses, to the disease Australian Arbovirus Encephalitis
[AAE. The term AAE was coined to replace the name of the disease called
Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE in an attempt to dispel public opinion
from the notion that this disease was restricted to the Murray Valley in
the south, when it occurs widely in other parts of Australia. Confusion
remains amongst many lay people because the cause of AAE is called MVE virus.
Unfortunately, in the 1970's, when another arbovirus, Kunjin virus, was
implicated as a rare cause of encephalitis, both MVE virus and Kunjin virus
were lumped together as causes of AAE, and this view persisted amongst some
people for years. It is now generally agreed that AAE is caused by the MVE
virus and Kunjin encephalitis is caused by Kunjin virus.

[It is reassuring to know that fewer and fewer people are using this
misnomer. St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Nipah
encephalitis, Norwalk disease, hepatitis virus, La Crosse encephalitis, Sin
Nombre virus (the worst named of all the hantaviruses), Marburg disease --
the list of focally inappropriate and geographically nonsensical names is
very, very long. People simply have to become accustomed to the names given
to viruses. It would be much better if the people who named the viruses
would put some thought into the names they give them because these names
will persist. String cut. - Mod. CHC
