Iran's medical authorities say that _Aedes [albopictus_] mosquito larvae, [vector of] the causative agent of dengue fever, have been observed in the neighborhoods and streets of Bandar Abbas in the south of the country in recent days.

Fateme Norouzian, the spokesperson of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, said on Friday [8 Jul 2022] that environmental health experts of this university have seen the larvae of this _Aedes_ mosquito in several parts of the city last week. According to him, "areas near beaches, wharves and harbors in port cities and islands are among the most dangerous areas of the province."

Dengue fever is transmitted to humans through this mosquito. This infectious disease, which is caused by the dengue virus, is also known as "bone-breaking fever" because the patient imagines that their bones are breaking due to the severe muscle pain caused by this disease.

Fever, headache, back pain, itching and muscle pain are other symptoms of this disease. In fact, this disease has flu-like symptoms in total, and if it is severe, the patient may even suffer from internal bleeding.

Dengue is spreading faster than any other disease in the world, yet there is no known cure and no vaccine is available for it [there is one commercially available vaccine for dengue but its use is restricted to those who have had a previous dengue virus infection. - Mod.TY]. In order to deal with it, health experts recommend spraying the place where mosquito larvae are found and also observing hygiene in living and work places.

The main habitat of this _Aedes_ mosquito, which is also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is in the tropical regions of the world, especially in Southeast Asia. The spokesperson of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences has added that it is possible that this mosquito entered the country through the import of goods such as used tires and bamboo stems from infested countries.

[_Aedes albopictus_ continues its spread around the world (see map of worldwide distribution at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/World-distribution-range-of-Aedes-albopictus-introductions-Map-indicating-the-first_fig2_308343168). It has been found in adjacent country Turkey, so its appearance in Iran is not surprising. The finding of larvae in several parts of the city suggests that this mosquito has been present there for a significant period of time. Control of this mosquito is extremely difficult. - Mod.TY
