Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections linked to dried coconut
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of [20 Mar 2018], 13 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 8 states. WGS performed on bacteria isolated from ill people showed that they were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

States / case count
California / 5
Colorado / 1
Connecticut / 1
Idaho / 1
Missouri / 1
Oregon / 2
Texas / 1
Utah / 1
Total / 13

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [22 Sep 2017] to [26 Feb 2018]. Ill people range in age from 1 to 73 years, with a median age of 40. A total of 67 per cent are female and 3 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis did not identify predicted antibiotic resistance in 10 of 11 isolates from ill people. One isolate contained resistance genes for ampicillin and azithromycin. Testing of outbreak isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory revealed 2 isolates with no antimicrobial resistance and 1 isolate with resistance to streptomycin. This resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of antimicrobial used to treat most people, but some infections may be difficult to treat with the therapy usually prescribed and may require a different drug.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence indicates that dried coconut is the likely source of this multistate outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Seven of 8 people interviewed (88 per cent) reported eating dried coconut from grocery stores. Of the 7 people who reported eating dried coconut, 4 people purchased the product at different Natural Grocers store locations. Public health officials continue to interview ill people to learn more about what they ate in the week before becoming sick.

FDA and state health and regulatory officials collected leftover dried coconut from ill people's homes, as well as dried coconut from Natural Grocers store locations where ill people shopped and from the Natural Grocers' Distribution Center. FDA testing identified the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium in an unopened sample of Natural Grocers Coconut Smiles Organic collected from Natural Grocers. The outbreak strain was also identified in an opened, leftover sample of Natural Grocers Coconut Smiles Organic collected from an ill person's home. FDA also collected dried coconut from International Harvest, Inc. The outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium was identified in samples of International Harvest Brand Organic Go Smile! Dried Coconut Raw and Go Smiles Dried Coconut Raw.

On [16 Mar 2018], International Harvest, Inc. recalled bags of Organic Go Smile Raw Coconut and bulk packages of Go Smiles Dried Coconut Raw. The recalled Organic Go Smile Raw Coconut was sold online and in stores in 9-ounce bags with sell-by dates from [1 Jan 2018] through [1 Mar 2019\. Recalled bulk Go Smiles Dried Coconut Raw was sold in a 25-pound case labeled with batch/lot numbers OCSM-0010, OCSM-0011, and OCSM-0014. These products were sold in various grocery stores. Regulatory officials are working to determine where else Organic Go Smile! Raw Coconut and Go Smiles Dried Coconut Raw were sold.

On [19 Mar 2018], Vitamin Cottage Natural Food Markets, Inc recalled packages of Natural Grocers Coconut Smiles Organic labeled with barcode 8034810 and packed-on numbers lower than 18-075. Recalled Natural Grocers Coconut Smiles Organic were sold in 10-ounce clear plastic bags with the Natural Grocers label. The packed-on number can be found in the bottom left-hand corner of the label.

CDC recommends people not eat recalled International Harvest, Inc brand Organic Go Smile! Raw Coconut, Go Smiles Dried Coconut Raw, or recalled Natural Grocers Coconut Smiles Organic. Throw it away or return it to the place of purchase for a refund. Retailers should not sell or serve recalled dried coconut products.

This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates when more information is available.
