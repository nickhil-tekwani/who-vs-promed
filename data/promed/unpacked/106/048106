According to a Deseret News report yesterday [25 Jun 2019], a migrant boy who had been detained at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection camp came to Utah with typhoid fever last month [May 2019]. The child was hospitalized with a severe case in Salt Lake County soon after arriving in Utah. He was treated and fully recovered and released after a week.

Health officials say there is no additional threat of the disease in Utah from this case.

Typhoid fever is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium _Salmonella_ Typhi. _Salmonella_ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacteria. Both ill persons and carriers shed _S._ Typhi in their feces.

You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding _S._ Typhi or if sewage contaminated with _S._ Typhi bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.

Typhoid fever can be successfully treated with appropriate antimicrobials, and persons given antimicrobials usually begin to feel better within 2 to 3 days.

[The child was likely part of the large number of Central Americans who are attempting to seek refuge in the USA because of significant risks in their home country. Hopefully, if the conditions in the facility he was held in was adequate, the risk of transmission to others would be minimal.

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever; anorexia; lethargy; malaise; dull, continuous headache; nonproductive cough; vague abdominal pain; and constipation. Despite the (often high) fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.78 inch) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
