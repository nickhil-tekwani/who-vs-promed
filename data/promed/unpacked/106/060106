As of Tue 17 Oct 2017, there have been a total of:
1726 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
699 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 percent],
1013 recoveries, and
14 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [9 Oct 2017], there have been a total of:
3 newly confirmed cases,
1 newly reported fatality, and
0 newly reported recoveries.
