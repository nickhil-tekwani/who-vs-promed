DR Congo Ebola situation report
-------------------------------
5 cases (4 confirmed, 1 probable); 5 deceased; 1311 vaccinated
2 health zones affected (Mbandaka & Wangata, [Equateur province])

"This is the DRC's 18th Ebola outbreak and the 3rd to strike Equateur province since 2018. Genetic evidence suggests the latest outbreak was likely triggered by a new introduction of the virus from animals to humans."

To date, 234 contacts have been identified and are under surveillance, while 1013 people, including 695 frontline workers, have been vaccinated, Anadolu Agency quoted the WHO country office as saying on Twitter.

Health authorities in DR Congo announced that the latest outbreak of Ebola virus was detected in the Mbandaka city of the northwestern Equateur province on [23 Apr 2022], 4 months after the end of the 13th outbreak was declared.

This is the 14th outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo. In 2018-2020, the deadliest outbreak killed nearly 2300 people, the 2nd highest toll recorded in the history of the hemorrhagic fever.

[There is an apparent discrepancy in the number of Ebola outbreaks noted in the 2 posts above. This is because they are counting from different dates. This most recent outbreak has been 100% fatal, 5 cases/5 deaths, although the most recent case is classified as probable. The 4th case died just under 1 week earlier (see ProMED Ebola update (06): Congo DR (EQ) fatal 20220523.8703421). There is no detailed information on the 5th case.

With contact tracing underway along with vaccination, the outbreak is not expected to explode. But it is important that families go to clinics for treatment as soon as they suspect Ebola, and practice safe burials in the case of deceased family members. - Mod.LK
