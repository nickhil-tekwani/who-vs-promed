The Minister of Health of the Dominican Republic, Juan Bautista
Rojas, said today [16 May 2007], that 1900 dengue cases had been
registered in the country from the beginning of this year [2007],
until 15 May [2007], and that, according to government estimates,
this number could rise to 6500 by the end of the year.
So far this year [2007], 4 people have died from dengue and health
authorities are studying 4 other cases who possible died of this
disease, added the Minister.
Of the 1900 registered cases during these months [in 2007], 56 have
been DHF, the most serious disease, and the rest have been classical
dengue [fever].
In all of 2006, there were 6252 cases of DHF, with 53 deaths, and
6061 cases of classical dengue [fever].
The majority of these reported cases in the Dominican Republic have
been recorded in the areas of greatest population, such as the
provinces of Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional, Santiago (north), and
Peravia (south).
Over the past month, the Ministry of Public Health has carried out a
campaign to fight dengue, in which 3 million students have
participated and [more than 1.2 million] homes have been visited. In
addition, 2.7 million booklets with advice on the proper storage of
domestic water have been distributed among students and teachers.
These water containers are potential breeding sites for _Aedes
aegypti_, the vector that transmits the virus.
This campaign has permitted the elimination of [more than one
million] mosquito breeding sites, according to the Minister, who is
confident that his department has contributed to the "generation of
the desired awareness" within the population.

[The total number of cases reported in 2006, which provides a greater
number of DHF cases (6252) than of classical dengue [fever] (6061)
is, by all measures, inexact. The proportion of classical [dengue
fever] cases to DHF cases is always at least 10-15:1 and it is easier
to recognize the latter than the former. Therefore, the real number
of dengue cases that are not DHF must always be an order of magnitude
greater than the number of complicated [DHF] cases.
The official numbers reflect a clear underreporting of the classical
form or an exaggerated overestimation of DHF [cases]. - Mod.JT; [in

The dengue fever outbreak that has struck Bali, one of the world's
top tourist destinations poses a "low risk" to visitors to the
Indonesian island, says a state health official. [Health official
Subrata, told Adnkronos International (AKI),] "Most of those who have
fallen ill come from parts of the island that have a high population
density and where it is difficult to control garbage collection, such
as the town of Denpasar and the districts of Badung and Gianyar."
The main tourist centers on Bali -- Sanur, Kuta, and Ubud, [as well
as the districts of Badung and Gianyar, fall under [the jurisdiction]
of the Denpasar municipality], and hygienic and sanitary conditions
are of a higher level than in other parts of the island.
According to reports by local broadcaster Metro TV, at least 10 more
people every day have been treated for dengue fever in the island's
main Sanglah Hospital, in Denpasar, since the outbreak began in
January [2007]. The lack of space at [the hospital] forcing many of
the patients to lie in beds placed in the hospital's corridors.
Subrata told AKI that more than 1163 cases of dengue fever have been
identified since January [2007], with 8 people dying of the disease.

The Department of Health in American Samoa is stressing the
importance of the '3 D's' of dengue prevention.
There have been 16 reported cases of dengue fever in American Samoa
this year [2007], an increase of 9 cases since last month [April 2007].
The Public Health Officer and Medical Director for the Department of
Health, Dr Ivan Tuliau, says there are 3 key steps to help prevent
dengue fever. "We're calling it the '3 D's' of dengue prevention: the
1st is drain, 'D' for drain standing water around the house that may
serve as mosquito breeding sites. The 2nd 'D' is for dress
protective, long sleeve shirts, long pants, covering exposed skin as
possible; and the last, is to use mosquito repellant containing DEET."
Dr Tuliau says the last dengue epidemic [in the country] was in 2001,
when there were more than 100 cases of dengue fever, but from 2003 to
2006, only 3 dengue cases were reported.

[It would be interesting to know which of the _Aedes_ mosquito
vectors is transmitting the virus during this outbreak, and which
dengue virus type is involved.

[During the week of 13 May 2007, 180 new cases of dengue were
reported], an all-time high and mirroring trends in 2005, when the
disease hit epidemic proportions in Singapore.
For the 1st 19 weeks of this year [2007], there were close to 1500
dengue cases. That is nearly 50 percent higher than the corresponding
period in 2006. The Health Ministry says the spike may be due to a
new dengue [virus] strain in Singapore -- dengue 2, which is
responsible for 60 percent of all dengue cases [in the country] so far.
"Singaporeans who have contracted dengue are mostly immune to dengue
1 but they will be susceptible to dengue 2." Health Minister, Khaw
Boon Wan, said, "For many years, Singapore's [has largely been]
dengue [virus] 1, although dengue [virus] 2 is quite common in our
neighbours. [He reported on a recent trip to Indonesia, where, he
learned, the most common strain is dengue 2. The minister added that
within the region, there are different kinds of virus strains, so
presumably, somebody must have brought the virus into Singapore and
from there it just spreads.]
So, what can be done to solve the problem? The government says the
National Environment Agency (NEA), Town Councils, and grassroots
organizations have been activated to search and eradicate potential
sources of mosquito breeding in residential areas. The NEA will also
be working with shipyards, construction sites, and other industries
to stop mosquitoes from breeding. But the public too will need to do
their part.
So far this year [2007], there have been no deaths from dengue in Singapore.

The current hot and rainy spell has caused a rise in dengue cases in
almost all States last week [week of 6 May 2007]. [There were 916
cases between 6-12 May [2007], compared with 799 registered between
29 Apr and 5 May 2007].
The Health Ministry's disease control director, Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul
Rahman, said 869 of the victims suffered dengue fever and 47, dengue
hemorrhagic fever [DHF]. "It's worrying," he said. "A concerted
effort by the health authorities and the public is needed to get rid
of all _Aedes_ mosquito breeding grounds."
Between 1 Jan and 12 May [2007], a total of 18 645 dengue cases were
reported, compared with 11 821 cases during the same period last year
[2006]. So far this year [2007], 47 people have died of the disease.
Dr Hasan said health authorities still reported that construction
sites were the main culprits for the breeding of _Aedes_ mosquitoes
followed by factories, schools, and rubbish dumps.
Last week [week of 6 May 2007], the authorities issued 255 notices
and 370 compounds to those caught breeding _Aedes_ and collected RM
61 510 in fines [USD 18 127].
