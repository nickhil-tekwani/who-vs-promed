Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 28 Dec 2018
--------------------
From [31 Oct 2018] through [30 Nov 2018], the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) National Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 8 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 2 deaths.

From 2012 through [30 Nov 2018], the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported globally to WHO under IHR (2005) is 2274 with 806 associated deaths. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals, animal products (for example, following contact with camels), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[As of 30 Nov 2018, there have been a total of 2274 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported, including 806 associated deaths for a reported case fatality rate of 35.4%.

The above WHO summary contains more information than previous summaries, including details on co-morbidities and outcomes and dates of reports of outcomes. In checking my spreadsheets and the MOH updates, there are some differences in dates and in ages, but there is agreement in Saudi Arabia having reported 8 newly confirmed cases in the specified period, including 2 deaths and 2 secondary cases (both household contacts of previously confirmed cases).

As stated previously, now that major nosocomial transmission has faded into the archives with few, if any, secondary cases reported from in-hospital exposure, the pattern of transmission seems to be sporadic cases, primarily from Saudi Arabia, many with a history of contact with camels, albeit many with no identifiable high-risk exposures. In summary, MERS-CoV hasn't gone away, but hopefully large hospital/healthcare facility-acquired cases have faded into the background history of the virus. - Mod.MPP]
