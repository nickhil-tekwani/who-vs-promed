14 people have been diagnosed with rabies infection in Kpone, the municipal capital of the Kpone-Katamanso Municipality in the Greater Accra Region, after an infected dog bit 5 people whilst at church [I suspect, hope, and trust this means 14 people have been exposed to rabies rather than that they have been infected. - Mod.TG].

Dr Emmanuel Kwao Pecku, municipal veterinary officer, told the Ghana News Agency at Kpone in an interview on 17 Apr 2021 that a rabies-infected dog followed some 5 worshippers to their church premises and bit them, infecting [sic] them with the disease. According to the municipal veterinary officer, 9 other persons got infected [sic; were exposed] by coming in contact with saliva from the infected dog, exposing them to the virus.

He explained the dog was immediately quarantined for examination, adding that it showed classical signs of rabies infection. Dr Pecku revealed that the dog was immediately killed, and a sample was taken to the laboratory for a confirmation test. He added that the victims have been given post exposure vaccines and are currently being monitored.

He said the Kpone-Katamanso Municipal Assembly must enforce its by-laws to deal with people whose negligence causes harm to others. He noted that the owner of the infected dog did not bring his dog for rabies vaccination in February this year [2021]. "We mounted our canopy in front of his house, but he did not bring his dog for the vaccine."

The Kpone-Katamanso Municipal Assembly, Municipal Health, and the Veterinary Directorate have intensified plans to deal with rabies cases in the various communities in Kpone.

[These 14 people were exposed to the rabies virus. If they received post exposure prophylaxis, as indicated by the article, then they should not be infected.

Clearly, the animal was not vaccinated against the disease, and this is a serious exposure.

Animals showing signs suggestive of rabies, as this pet appears to have been, are euthanized, and the brains are examined for the rabies virus. We do not know for certain the results of the animal's test, but it may have been positive for rabies. We are glad to know the individuals affected are being appropriately treated. - Mod.TG
