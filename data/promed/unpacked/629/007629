Dog warning as seal virus heads for Forth
-----------------------------------------
Dog owners are being warned to stay away from beaches on the Firth
of Forth amid fears a deadly seal virus could spread to their pets. The
Scottish Executive and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals issued the alert because of concerns that the recent
outbreak of the phocine distemper virus (PDV) could reach the Forth
after a seal was washed up in the Dornoch Firth.
Distemper can be fatal for dogs if not caught early enough, but most
are immunised and therefore would be able to fight off the disease.
However, the SSPCA said any dogs that caught distemper would
"suffer incredibly".
Yesterday the Scottish Executive said one in 10 of Scotland's common
seal population -- about 3000 animals -- could be wiped out by PDV.
Infected seals become unable to dive to feed themselves and die.
A Scottish Executive spokesman said: "We are very concerned that this
nasty disease is still around in Scottish waters, including the Firth of
Forth. We are urging members of the public to keep their dogs away
from any seal carcasses and to call the helpline if they see a distressed
animal."
SSPCA spokeswoman Angela MacLean said: "We would urge anyone
walking along the Firth of Forth beaches who might come across a
distressed seal not to touch it and to phone the helpline. Not only could
the seal have PDV, it also has a nasty bite. "We would ask all dog
owners to stay away from the beaches because the virus can be
transferred to their pets. As there is currently no effective treatment
available it will probably be necessary, in the majority of cases, to
humanely destroy any adult seals suffering from the virus." The deadly
virus is passed between seals and dogs through close contact with the
animal, feces, or in airborne particles similar to the transfer of a cold.
SSPCA superintendent Mike Flynn said: "Dogs can die of distemper if
it isn't treated. But as long as their organs haven't been damaged too
much they can be saved. Most dogs are inoculated against it but for
those that aren't it is transferred very quickly. Scientists believe
distemper is transferred from seals to dogs because the dog distemper
virus is so similar to the seal distemper virus."
John Baxter, Scottish Natural Heritage head of maritime group, said the
distemper virus would spread to the Firth of Forth. "We expect the
Forth to be affected but at the moment we can't say how many seals
will die."
Symptoms include respiratory problems, a reluctance to move,
coughing, nasal discharge and air under the skin around the neck and
head.
Members of the public who see a sick or dead seal are asked to call the
hotline number 08712 447999.
