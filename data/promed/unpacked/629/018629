After anthrax, now brucellosis
BANDUNG: Still reeling from the recent outbreak of anthrax in Purwakarta,
the West Java administration is now on the alert after receiving reports of
a possible outbreak of another animal disease, brucellosis.
The dangerous disease, caused by the _Brucella abortus_ bacteria, affects
pregnant cows, especially dairy cows, and causes stillbirths and premature
births. The head of the administration's animal husbandry office, Tatang
Henandar, said on Friday the disease was first detected in the province in
the middle of last year and has killed a total of 40 cows in Depok, Bogor,
Pangalengan and Sukabumi.
"(But) Brucellosis has yet to become an epidemic," he claimed.
The immediate effect to farmers is infected cows produce less milk. "If
milk production drops by 9 liters per farmer a day, while the price of
fresh milk is now between Rp 1200 and Rp 1500 per liter, you can imagine
the financial losses," said Tatang.
There are some 60 000 diary cows in West Java, supplying 36.69 percent of
the national demand for fresh milk.
Tatang said brucellosis is as not lethal as anthrax as the meat of infected
cows can still be consumed.
"The disease could also strike pregnant woman. And premature babies are
very possible because of it. However such cases have yet to be found so far."

[Although brucellosis can cause abortion storms, I have never heard of
_Brucella abortus_ killing an adult cow.
However, it appears that something is affecting 4 separate areas of West
Java. This disease is a significant zoonotic risk to humans of all ages,
not just babies and pregnant women. Brucellosis infection is spread to
humans through contact with the aborted tissues and through unpasteurized
milk. I would hope we will get more details about this outbreak.This may be
brucellosis, but I suspect a different problem. - Mod.TG
