The Los Santos provincial regional Health Director, Nahir Cedeno, confirmed that 2 people are currently hospitalized in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital, in Las Tablas city, with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS].

[Los Santos province in Panama is endemic for Choclo hantavirus, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] occur there with some frequency. The case numbers have climbed from 47 cases (25 with HPS) as of 29 Aug 2014, to 62 (29 with HPS) just a month later. Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, and can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to the hospital late in the course of their disease. No specific ecological details are provided concerning the environment where these 2 patients may have acquired their infections.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
