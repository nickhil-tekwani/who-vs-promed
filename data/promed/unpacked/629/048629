Punjab, Haryana gear up to contain yellow rust
----------------------------------------------
Punjab and Haryana are gearing up to contain the attack of yellow rust on wheat crops by intensifying the vigil and guiding growers to combat the fungal disease's fast spread.

The recent detection of yellow rust disease in Punjab [ProMED-mail post 20110211.0469] has sent alarm bells ringing. It prompted both the major wheat growing states to take remedial measures. A survey conducted by farm scientists found yellow rust attack in sub-mountain areas of Ropar, Nawanshahar, and Hoshiarpur districts of Punjab and in Una (Himachal Pradesh) just after the completion of sowing in December [2011].

Yellow rust became epidemic in 2008-09 and caused a fall in crop yields in sub-mountain areas of Punjab. Last year [2011], it attacked wheat fields in Haryana [ProMED-mail post 20110404.1042] on over 90 000 hectares of land.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different wheat growing regions, for example by ICARDA (International Centre for Agriculture in Dry Areas), but the process of releasing new varieties to farmers is slow.

In India, the emergence of a new strain was confirmed in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh in 2009 and a change of wheat cultivars was recommended to farmers (ProMED-mail post 20090329.1216).
