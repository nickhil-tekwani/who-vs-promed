Colombian authorities said on Monday they had detected the
1st suspected cases of bird flu in the South American
country, but insisted the strain was not harmful to humans.
Avian influenza was discovered in chickens at 3 farms in
Tolima state in western Colombia, and the affected flocks
were immediately quarantined to prevent the spread of the
disease, the agriculture ministry said in a statement.
There was no sign, however, of the H5N1 strain of bird flu
that experts fear could mutate to become a dangerous human
virus, the ministry said.
Tests will now be carried out on chickens across the country
to check for the virus, [the ministry also] said.
H5N1 has swept through poultry populations in Asia since
2003, infecting 116 people and killing 60, mostly poultry
workers, and resulting in the deaths of more than 100
million birds.
