Outbreak of anthrax in Ngangla geog [block] under Zhemgang dzongkhag
[district]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the incessant rain in mid July 2010 animals either died suddenly
or showed signs and symptoms consistent with anthrax. The cause was latter
confirmed as anthrax as per laboratory observation and clinical symptoms.

The 1st case was suspected to have taken place sometime between mid July
and 13 Aug 2010 when the Mangmi of Ngangla geog [block] had reported the
cattle death to the livestock-in-charge of Panbang and accordingly the
in-charge of RNR [Renewable Natural Resources] Extension Centre (RNREC) in
Panbang sent a flash report to RLDC [Regional Livestock Development Centre]
Zhemgang on 2 Aug 2010. Immediately the team from RLDC, Zhemgang
accompanied by staff of LEC [Livestock Extension Centre], Kagtong visited
the affected villages under Ngala geog to conduct detail investigation. The
investigation team came across a carcass of a Jatsham on 13 Aug 2010. The
carcass was not opened since there was bleeding from the natural orifices
which indicates anthrax. The smears and swabs were collected to carry out
further investigation at the laboratory. The impression smears (slide)
collected on 13 Aug 2010 were subjected to Gram and MB staining and found
Gram positive rods which has the shape of _Bacillus anthracis_. The team
conducted an awareness meeting and advice was given to the farmer about the
risk of anthrax and proper burial of carcasses. A total of 8 people have
suffered from the illness after handling and consuming the meat from the
animals that have died due to suspected anthrax.

It is said that one should never try to open the carcass if there are signs
of anthrax like oozing of tarnished black blood from the natural openings
(nose, anus, eyes, mouth, ear, and hair follicles) unclotted blood,
excessive bloating within a short span of time, fast rigor mortis etc.
[Admirable advice. Extravasation is not common but when you see it, pay
attention. - Mod.MHJ]

The symptoms shown in the field were very much confirmatory of anthrax as
the disease has appeared immediately after the incessant rain during 2
weeks of July 2010. Usually, such sporadic disease outbreaks are seen
immediately after the heavy monsoon if there were any spores in the soil
remaining from times immemorial. Such spores are exposed due to flooding or
landslides and in favorable climatic conditions they remain in the
grass/soil, which is ingested by the animals and outbreaks are encountered.

A similar incident later occurred at Kagtong village in Ngangla geog
killing 13 bovines, 8 equines, 4 swine, and 6 felines; 12 households were
affected in 8 villages in Kagtong village. 80-90 kg [176-198 lb] of dry
meat (beef) were disposed off by the in-charge LEC and BHU [Basic Health
Unit] officials. Later 6 cats died after either consuming raw meat fed by
the owners while cutting the meat to dry or by feeding directly from the
drying meat hanging over the roof. [It is more probable that the cats got
infected from licking the blood dripping from the meat or carcasses. This
is a very common route of infection for dogs also. - Mod.MHJ]

After the visit of the team from RLDC, the disease is now under control
with all types of measures implemented in place such as, injecting the herd
mates with antibiotics, ring vaccination with HS/BQ and anthrax in
progress, the farmers were made aware by calling meetings and enforcing
strict vigilance to prevent consumption of carcasses.

The action taken by the Department of Livestock [DoL] has been that bovine
herd mates were injected with sulphadimidine, as a prophylactic measure,
horses were injected with streptopenicillin to encounter and stop the
disease from emerging in case herd mates got infected, for prophylaxis.
HS/BQ ring vaccination was completed with the help of the investigation
team in the remaining areas. The ring vaccination was started the 1st week
of August 2010. A detailed investigation was done in the outbreak area. DoL
also conducted mass awareness campaigns regarding anthrax and other
zoonotic diseases.

Further recommendations are: to carry out anthrax vaccination in the
affected villages which do not have direct contact with the anthrax
affected animals, ring vaccination in the surrounding villages; the
affected villages should be now treated as anthrax endemic area and anthrax
vaccination should be planned annually until there is no further outbreak
of anthrax for 3 consecutive years; public awareness programmes for farmers
on anthrax and other zoonoses including risk of consuming the meat from
dead animals; restriction on the movement of cattle, horses, and other
animals to the outbreak area; designate a team from NCAH [National Centre
for Animal Health] to further investigate the outbreak and effectively
control the epidemic; and appraise MoH on the situation of disease outbreak
in Kagtong.

[An admirable report. Anthrax is sporadic in Bhutan. Outbreaks in cattle
range annually from 0-4 outbreaks, and with the occasional associated
porcine case or cases. Although the veterinary service is on top of this,
the sporadic nature means that because of public unawareness things can
have gone badly wrong before the cavalry arrives.

Members are encouraged to access the original report for the additional
details, including maps and photographs. Jatsham is the female Mithun x
Siri hybrid which are common in Bhutan; Jatsa is the male and is an
admirable work ox; see for details
