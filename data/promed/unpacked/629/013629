Alberta: first human case of West Nile virus: asymptomatic blood donor
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The first case of West Nile virus infection in a human in Alberta has been
reported. The young woman is from Calgary and is not exhibiting any of the
symptoms of the disease. The infection was identified by a Canadian Blood
Services screening test after the young woman donated blood Thu 7 Aug 2003.
The unit of blood has been withdrawn from inventory and the donor will not
be eligible to donate blood again for 56 days, at which time the virus will
no longer be present in her system. She was contacted immediately and
additional blood testing was conducted over the weekend. A positive test
was confirmed on Mon 11 Aug 2003.
"Based on the experience of other jurisdictions, we knew it was only a
matter of time before West Nile virus would eventually spread to humans in
Alberta and now it appears it has," said Dr Brent Friesen, medical officer
of health, Calgary Health Region. "Testing by Canadian Blood Services and
the Provincial Lab confirm we have our first case. Further testing is being
carried out by Health Canada for final confirmation."
"The initial test results show our West Nile virus test is doing exactly
what it was designed to do -- help reduce the risk that the virus will
enter the blood supply," said Dr Dale Towns, Calgary medical director,
Canadian Blood Services. "This case serves as another reminder for people
to take precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes when they are
outdoors," said Dr Gloria Keays, associate provincial health officer.
"While the risk of infection remains very low, people should take necessary
precautions.
Dr Friesen points out that the majority of individuals who contract West
Nile virus infection will show no symptoms at all and the infection will
run its course. In 15 to 20 per cent of cases, those contracting the virus
will suffer from flu-like symptoms, fever, sore muscles and fatigue. In
less than one per cent of the cases, victims will experience headaches,
nausea, vomiting, weakness, numbness and paralysis. Testing for the West
Nile virus infection is not recommended unless people are experiencing the
more severe forms of illness.

[Although West Nile virus has been detected already in wild birds, equines,
and mosquitoes in Alberta, this report records the most westerly occurrence
of West Nile virus infection in the human population in Canada. This report
indicates also that as in the United States the screening of blood
donations is proving to be the most sensitive indicator of the presence of
the virus in the human population. In Canada 2 of the 3 human cases of West
Nile virus infection (one in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan) have been
asymptomatic blood donors. - Mod.CP]
