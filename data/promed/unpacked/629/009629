Netherlands records 1st bluetongue case
---------------------------------------
The 1st bluetongue case [for 2009 for the country] has been recorded
in Aalten, East Netherlands. The disease was encountered in the
framework of routine examinations, in a young bull. The serotype is
not yet known. Results of the tests are expected next week.

The 1st infection appears to have occured 3 weeks earlier than during
the previous year, when it was detected in Staphorst. Bluetongue
experts of the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) of the Wageningen
University have anticipated a later date for the 1st 2009 outbreak.
This, in view of the lower infection pressure, due to the vaccination
campaign.

Minister of Agriculture Gerda Verburg has called upon cattle owners to
protect their livestock by vaccination. So far, the number of
vaccinations during 2009 is lower than in 2008.

The bluetongue season in Northern France and Belgium seems to have
started later than in 2008. No infections have been recorded, so far
in Belgium. In France, infection in alpacas, with serotype 1, was
recorded in May 2009; no additional cases have been recorded since then.
