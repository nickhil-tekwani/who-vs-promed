Ebola Virus Death Toll Increased By Five Over Past 24 hours
-----------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Five more people died of Ebola hemorrhagic fever over [the past 24
hours, including a nurse who fell ill after treating patients. The death
toll from Ebola hemorrhagic fever now stands at 68 in northern Uganda.
The number of people known to be infected with the deadly fever since it was
confirmed on 14 Oct 2000 rose to 191 by today (27 Oct 2000), up from 182 one
day earlier, said Director General of Medical Services Francis Omaswa. A
total of 12 people were discharged over the past day, bringing to 75 the
number of patients who reportedly have recovered from the virus, Omaswa said.
Uganda also has one of the world's highest HIV rates, but an aggressive
health campaign has reduced the number of new infections. Authorities are
using the same methods to educate people about Ebola hemorrhagic fever.
Ebola can take up to 2 weeks to incubate. During this period, the patient
is not contagious. But once the first flu-like symptoms develop, the patient
can transmit the virus through contact with bodily fluids. In later stages,
the victim begins bleeding internally, vomiting blood and producing bloody
diarrhea. At this point, and for a short time after death, the patient is
most contagious. When the first victims of the outbreak died in Gulu, they
were given traditional burials in which relatives and friends washed the
body and then their hands in a communal basin as a sign of unity. That
turned many of the mourners into new victims. Funerals have since been
banned. Corpses are reported to authorities and carefully buried to avoid
transmitting the disease.
