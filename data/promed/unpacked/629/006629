Cases of leishmaniasis grow by 144 percent
------------------------------------------
The number of infected animals more than doubled between 2007 and
2008, causing concern at the Center for Zoonoses Control of Cuiaba.

The disease is moving forward in urban centers due to the growth of
cities: the federal government banned the treatment of sick animals.

Last year [2008], the number of cases of canine visceral
leishmaniasis reported in Cuiaba grew by 144 percent. In 2007, 123
cases were reported. The number [of reported cases] rose to 301 last
year [2008], according to reports of the Center for the Control of
Zoonoses (CCZ), the veterinary hospital of the [Mato Grosso Federal
University] (UFMT) and clinics. In 2008 there were 6 reported cases
in humans, which resulted in 1 cure and 1 death. The other 4 [cases]
are still under treatment. The disease is also known as "kala azar."

Reporting of cases of visceral leishmaniasis is mandatory. The
increase in reports [of cases] in the whole country was crucial to
the Ministries of Health (MoH) and Agriculture to enact ordinance
1426/2008, which prohibits the treatment of sick dogs.

But even if the disease is confirmed, it is at the discretion of the
owner to surrender the animal to the CCZ for disposal. "The owner
signs a scientific agreement ensuring that appropriate environmental
safeguards are taken," said Caroline Sena, coordinator of the CCZ.

Last year [2008], the CCZ conducted 534 home visits and collected
2052 blood samples. Of the total [specimens tested], 1500 were
negative, 123 were positive, 25 were indeterminate, and 404 are still
pending. In 2007, there were visits 358 made, with 573 blood samples
collected, of which 479 were negative, 94 were positive, and 10 were
indeterminate. [These figures] do not include cases diagnosed by the
university veterinary hospital (UFMT) or clinics.

"The figures are worrisome because the disease is increasing and
demonstrating urban growth," says Caroline Sena. According to her,
the disease has been reported in both rural and urban areas. "We
noticed that the outlying areas tend to have more cases, but there is
a significant amount both in neighborhoods more distant and in central areas."

Disease confirmation is made through a serological examination, which
takes 30 days to [get results]. Transmission to both humans and
canines is related to the bite of a blood-sucking insect (the
phlebotomine called _Lutzomyia longipalpis_) known as the
straw-mosquito or "cangalhinha" [sand fly].

In humans, the protozoan may cause the disease soon, especially in
immunocompromised individuals, or it can incubate for years before it
becomes apparent. Following parasitemia, the leishmania are found in
the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The main symptoms of the disease
include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, weakness, increase in
abdominal girth associated with a loss of abdominal fat, or just weight loss.

According to the Epidemiological Surveillance nurse, Elizabeth
Santiago Pulquerio, the occurrence of cases in humans has also been
growing. One of the main reasons is deforestation associated with
urban growth. The numbers [of reported cases in 2007] were not provided.

In addition to supplying the drug for treatment, the epidemiological
surveillance unit monitors each case for a period of 12 months. Dog
owners who suspect that their pet may be sick should immediately
communicate this fact to the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit or the
CCZ for appropriate action.

People with symptoms also need to be taken immediately to the health
unit. In the capital, the Julius Muller University Hospital (HUJM) is
a reference hospital for the treatment of leishmaniasis.

[Infection in dogs is prevalent in Central and South America, the
Middle East, Asia, and in the Mediterranean region. The disease is
endemic in foxhounds in North America. Isolated cases are diagnosed
around the world in animals that have visited endemic areas. Cats and
other domestic animals are rarely infected and usually only develop
cutaneous ulcers, without showing signs of visceral disease. Canine
leishmaniasis is a zoonosis, and dogs act as a reservoir of the
parasite for humans where there is a competent vector.

The incubation period is quite variable, ranging from 3 months to
several years. The clinical features vary widely; main clinical
presentations are skin lesions, loss of weight or poor appetite,
local or generalized lymphadenopathy, ocular lesions, renal failure,
epistaxis, lameness, and anemia. Occasionally, some dogs have chronic
diarrhea or liver failure. The most common cutaneous lesions are
alopecia with severe dry desquamation, usually beginning on the head
and extending to the rest of the body. Other animals develop chronic
ulceration, located particularly on the head and limbs. The signs
invariably show a slow, progressive evolution.

The most reliable diagnostic test for canine leishmaniasis is direct
observation of the parasite in bone marrow or lymph node smears. The
amastigotes appear as oval basophilic bodies (4 micron) in the
cytoplasm of macrophages. However, it is sometimes impossible to
detect the parasite in infected animals, especially in lymph node
smears. Serologic methods are useful in diagnosis; indirect
immunofluorescence and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are
widely used. The results of a serologic test should be interpreted in
conjunction with the clinical picture. Although these tests are
reliable, a few infected dogs remain seronegative, and there are also
seropositive dogs that never develop the disease.

In endemic areas, rapid treatment of infected dogs, control of stray
and homeless dogs, and action against the insect vectors are
recommended methods of control. Treatment of dogs in non-endemic
areas is questionable and probably unwise if a competent vector is
present. At present, there is no effective vaccine against canine
leishmaniasis. - Mod.TG

Canine leishmaniasis is a well-known reservoir for human
leishmaniasis. Not least in Southern Europe (Spain, France, Italy,
and Greece) dogs are the main reservoir. An increase in leishmaniasis
in dogs will inevitably result in more human cases and control of
infection in dogs is therefore important to reduce the risk of
infections in humans. - Mod.EP
