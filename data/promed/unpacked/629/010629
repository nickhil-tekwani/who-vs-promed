China says firms exported tainted protein to US
-----------------------------------------------
China acknowledged on Tue [8 May 2007] that 2 Chinese companies had
illegally exported contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein for pet food
blamed for a spate of animal deaths in the United States.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it has received about 17 000
complaints of sick pets, with about 4000 deaths reported. Investigations
have extended to livestock feed containing tainted pet food that made its
way to some 6000 hogs and as many as 3.1 million chickens. The Agency said
there was little danger for people. China had denied FDA assertions that
melamine, a chemical used in plastics and fertiliser, had been added to
wheat gluten and rice protein exported from China for pet foods. But Xinhua
state news agency reversed the official position.
"The two companies illegally added melamine...in a bid to meet the
contractual demand for the amount of protein in the products," Xinhua said,
quoting the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine. The Administration said the 2 companies, named by the FDA as
Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co Ltd and Binzhou Futian
Biology Technology Co Ltd, evaded quality checks by labeling their products
as exports not subject to inspection.
Local police had launched an investigation into the case and detained
company officials. The quality control watchdog said it had ordered local
branches to strengthen quality inspection on all vegetable proteins and
pledged to include all vegetable proteins in the exports list subject to
quality checks.
The watchdog said it had notified the FDA of the investigation results and
proposed to set up a cooperation mechanism on food safety with the US.

Transcript of media briefing update By FDA And USDA regarding adulterated
animal feed Washington DC, 8 May 2007:
--------------------------
Our 1st speaker is Dr David Acheson. He is assistant commissioner for food
protection with the FDA. Our 2nd speaker will be Dr Kenneth Petersen who is
the assistant administrator for field operations with the USDA, Food Safety
and Inspection Service. And our 3rd speaker is Ms Vera Adams, the executive
director of commercial targeting and enforcement with US Customs and Border
Protection. Then during the question and answer segment, we have Dr Stephen
Sundlof, who's the director of our Center for Veterinary Medicine at FDA
available. We have Captain David Elder, who is director of the Office of
Enforcement with FDA; and Mr Michael Rogers, director of the Division of
Field Investigations; and Mr Walter Batts, deputy director of our Office of
International Programs. I suspect we have several individuals as well from
the USDA and Customs and Border Protection who will step in as needed.
DR ACHESON: Thank you. This afternoon I would like to address 2 issues with
you all, which are 2 new ones, and then obviously old issues if we have to
address that in Q and A. But I'm going to focus on 2. The 1st is related to
a misrepresentation of the wheat gluten and the concentrated rice protein.
I want to preface it by saying as you are all aware we have been following
wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate from two sources in China, and
have undertaken a number of tests with those related to the detection of
melamine and melamine-related compounds. As part of our strategy just to
ensure that we are following this in all possible directions, a portion of
both the wheat gluten and the rice protein concentrate that was already a
concern because of melamine has been further analyzed by our forensic
chemistry center. And we have discovered that these products, labeled wheat
gluten and rice protein concentrate, are we believe mislabeled, and that
they actually contain wheat flour that is contaminated with the melamine
and melamine-related compounds.
As we discussed previously, none of these products have been used as
ingredients directly in the human food supply. We are not talking about a
new set of ingredients. These are the ones we have been tracking since the
beginning of this situation. We've just taken the analysis of those a
little further. And to reemphasize what we've discovered is that these are
not wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate, but are in fact wheat flour
contaminated with melamine.
The FDA considers this product to be mislabeled based on what I've told you
and we're considering possible enforcement options. Again I want to
emphasize that these mislabeled products are from the two Chinese firms
previously discussed, previously identified in prior discussions and press
conferences. None of this changes the findings regarding the levels of
melamine or melamine-related compounds in relation to the risk assessment
and its feeding to animals. So that part is essentially unchanged.
The 2nd point that I want to raise relates to the issue of fish and
fishmeal. Again as part of our ongoing tracebacks and trace-forwards,
trying to understand where this contaminated wheat gluten may have gone, we
learned that a portion of the mislabeled wheat gluten from the Chinese firm
was sent to Canada and when in Canada was used to manufacture fishmeal, and
that that fishmeal was then imported back into the United States for use in
feeding fish in certain industrial aquaculture type situations. As I said,
this fishmeal was made in Canada and the Canadian authorities are aware of
our findings.
As with the situation with the poultry and the hogs, the levels that we're
seeing in the fishmeal are very comparable, and therefore based on the risk
assessment we do not believe there is any significant human health risk
associated with consuming these fish. The investigation is very active at
this point. We know of a number of firms that received this fishmeal and
our investigators are as we speak getting out there to those firms to
determine just exactly what they are doing with the fish that were fed this
fishmeal. We have so far managed to get to one of these establishments
where we confirmed the positive finding, and that particular establishment
is dealing with very small fish that are ones that are I believe called fry
or small. So these are tiny fish that are not yet ready for human
consumption anyway. That is really just the current state of this
investigation. This is obviously a new finding linking this to the
fishmeal, and it's going to follow I think a very similar pattern as we
have with the other investigation. We'll get out there, we will find out
what's going on at the individual aquaculture industrial fish facilities
and follow up as appropriate.
DR PETERSEN: Okay, thank you, and good afternoon everybody. Yesterday, FSIS
or USDA and FDA announced the results of a risk assessment that looked at
the potential for adverse human effects from melamine compounds. Based on
the findings of the determination from that risk assessment that there was
a very low risk to humans as announced, USDA and FDA are initiating the
appropriate course of action regarding swine and poultry that consumed any
contaminated feed.
In some cases although the contaminated feed can be traced to farms, the
feed that was actually consumed by the animals had a very low amount of the
pet food scraps as we've previously discussed. That feed became so diluted
from the small amount of pet food scraps that any tests no longer detected
the presence of melamine or melamine compounds, so there was a negative
feed test. In those cases, as announced yesterday, some poultry have begun
to be released. In other cases, the feed on the farms either tested
positive for melamine and melamine compounds or there was no feed available
to test. Those swine and poultry are still being held either under state
quarantine or voluntarily by the owners pending the results of an animal
exposure risk assessment and any other investigatory findings, and both of
those are under way. The animal exposure assessment will provide us with
additional scientific data about the level of melamine and its compound in
animal tissues and any decrease of the amount of melamine in animals' body
as it's excreted through the urinary tract.
All of this will help us apply solid scientific data to supplement the
science-based findings in the risk assessment from yesterday. So although
we expect that the animal exposure assessment will support the findings of
the human risk assessment, we're continuing to take a measured approach
until that assessment and the other information from the investigation is
finished. But if the risk assessment proves positive, we would expect the
release for inspection and processing of all the swine and poultry that
remain on hold in connection with this ongoing investigation.
We do expect to have the animal exposure assessment completed very soon,
quite likely by the end of this week. Again, this is being conducted by an
interagency group comprised of representatives from FDA and FSIS, Customs
and Border Protection, CDC, and EPA.
MS VERA ADAMS: Thank you. To supplement the government effort to ensure
that no further contaminated products are entering the US, CBP has
undertaken some additional sampling and testing of imported wheat and corn
gluten as well as rice protein concentrate and isolates arriving from all
countries, destined for human and animal consumption.
Once we have taken the sampling, we send those samples to our laboratory
systems where they will be testing for any contaminants and making sure
these products present no further risk. There's really no evidence at this
time to suggest that the bulk of these products present any risk or have
any further contamination beyond what the FDA has already identified from
the Chinese companies. However, we are conducting these wider tests as a
precautionary step to ensure that these types of products entering through
the US ports of entry are safe.
We do routinely conduct testing of products entering the United States, and
we have 7 regional labs throughout the country that mirror FDA procedures.
Specifically the sampling for the rice protein, wheat and corn gluten began
last week, and we are working to get the results of those samples back as
expeditiously as possible to add to the information pool for this wider
government effort.
1st REPORTER: ...You say you're testing wheat, corn gluten and rice protein
concentrate, and we just heard that in fact it was wheat flour. So I'm
wondering if you're testing the wrong thing. And then I wanted to ask Dr
Acheson, if you could explain further how you sort of determined that this
wasn't in fact wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate. I don't know what
these things look like, but is it that readily apparent?
MS ADAMS: ...If it's misrepresented as wheat gluten then it's important
that we target wheat gluten. And in addition we are constantly in contact
with FDA and USDA to evaluate whether what we need to be targeting and
testing needs to be changed.
DR ACHESON: ...this product did come into the United States labeled as
wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate, so if that's what's being
targeted it would find this. In terms of how did we discover this, it was a
combination of assays that were done to determine this. 1st of all using
something called stereoscopic light microscopy and polarized light
microscopy, and this essentially just characterizes the product initially
and is just sophisticated direct visual microscopy.
That's been followed by a type of chromatography that is looking
specifically at levels of starch, and it's based on those two criteria that
the forensic chemistry center was able to determine that the levels in
starch that we found in these products were such that it made it very
likely that it was wheat flour.
DR ACHESON: The focus is on the rice, things that were labeled as wheat
gluten and rice protein concentrate, as were these. Where we are as I've
said before planning on expanding the assignments as we learn more and we
get the ingredient side of this figured out, I don't exclude the
possibility that we will get into sampling wheat flour specifically. But
right now that's not the top priority. This was not coming in labeled as
wheat flour. It was coming in labeled as wheat gluten.
2nd REPORTER: ...given that China's manufacturers and agricultural sector,
pretty much everything in China that's coming from China, every sector
seems to have a problem. Shouldn't you expand everything, your
investigation of everything that comes across the border from China at this
point?
DR ACHESON: What we're doing is trying to expand our assessment based on
where we're seeing the risks, and if you've been following the story this
is shifting constantly. We started out with a focus on a single company.
It then expanded to import alert on the two companies. That subsequently
expanded to import alert of all protein concentrates coming in from China.
We're extending that into sampling strategies for pet food coming in that
could contain melamine as well as animal feed. So it is expanding as we go,
and as you heard from our colleague at Customs and Border Protection they
are also expanding it. I think one has to focus this on a risk basis. You
have to put the resources where you believe the risk to be greatest and we
are moving the resources based on that, and we'll continue to do that.
REPORTER: ...what don't we know that is being put in Chinese products and
shipped into the U.S. I mean, we didn't know about melamine, we're hearing
about these catfish that have antibiotics and chemicals in them. I mean,
what don't we know because we're not looking at it?
DR ACHESON: Well, if I could tell you what we don't know, I'd know. So
that's not meant to be a facetious answer, but it's the only logical one I
can come up with. We are not just looking for melamine. We have screens for
a whole range of chemical compounds, and we are putting this material
through those screens. So this is not melamine-focused solely. We are
looking for a variety of other things just in case, based on nothing other
than we have the technology, we have the samples, so it makes it smart to
look more broadly. But obviously we are keeping our eyes open, we're
working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If we start to
see unusual spikes of inexplicable illness, clearly we'd ask those
questions. So we're being as broad as we can within, but making maximum use
of resources.
3rd REPORTER: ...Following up on the caller's question about the
antibiotics found in Chinese imported catfish, is that one of the areas
where the FDA is looking at a higher risk import, and are you looking at
that catfish in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and testing it for melamine?
DR ACHESON: The short answer to that question is yes. We have an assignment
that is already underway as part of our risk based approach to protecting
the food supply. That's an assignment which is focused on obtaining and
testing a range of different fish samples, looking for antibiotic residues
and other things. We have just very recently validated an assay for
melamine in fish. That is something that we did not have a week ago. Our
assay teams have been moving really fast and we now have a validated assay
for melamine in fish. And that is going to be added into our screening
looking for the antibiotic residues. So that's something that we've added
in. We're going to go and test any remaining fish samples that we have that
are currently in the lab as part of this assignment, and as new samples
come in we will test those for melamine related compound.
Now depending what we find on that testing, that is going to drive the next
step. Obviously if we find levels, particularly if they are significant,
that's going to a have a different series of next steps than if these are
negative. Again it's focused on where the risks are likely to be and the
resources that we have to devote to it.
4th REPORTER: ...It appears that the Chinese news agencies now say China
believes these two companies exported this, added the melamine illegally
and exported it to get around inspections. Is that your understanding of
what you think happened?
DR ACHESON: As you know our investigators are currently on the ground in
China asking those very kinds of questions. We're working closely with the
Chinese authorities both from Washington as well as locally, and I think as
the investigation unfolds we will have more definitive answers as to what
exactly happened in China, potential explanations as to why it happened.
REPORTER: But this seems to be a complete turnaround. Which story should we
believe? I mean we're further down the road. Do you think the Chinese have
finally accepted the fact that this is what's happened?
DR ACHESON: I can't speak from FDA as to what the Chinese have accepted. We
are following this up on 1st principles, and our main concern is that we
have these food items coming into the United States that contain agents
that they shouldn't, and we're following that up. As to exactly why it
happened in China is part of the investigation the Chinese are undertaking,
sgain with our investigators. Obviously in the longer term, those questions
are important in terms of trying to make sure it doesn't happen again.
REPORTER: Finally, your inspectors have been there a week. Anything you can
share, anything at all?
DR ACHESON: At this point it's still ongoing. They are out there, I know
they are getting to the establishment, some of them have concern. I really
don't have anymore specifics at this point that I can share.
...And then we can come back to your question. The 2nd thing I covered was
the fact that we have discovered melamine in fishmeal. This is the
situation in which again through tracebacks we determined that some of the
product from the companies in China had been imported directly into Canada
and the Canadians had used that product to manufacture fishmeal that was
then imported into the US and sent to a number of aquaculture and other
fishing industry establishments in the US. We're working with the Canadian
authorities on this. They are well-aware of what's going on.
At this point, based on the risk assessment and the levels we know of in
the fishmeal, as with the hogs and the poultry, we do not believe this
poses any significant human health threat. This is a new finding, it's a
very active part of the investigation, and our investigators are getting
out to the establishments where we know this was received. And we'll be
doing some analysis, getting some more samples, and determining the status
of the fish that may have been fed this.
But I want to emphasize at this point based on the risk assessment, even if
these fish had been fed this fishmeal we believe the risk to humans is low.
So those are the two points I summarized, so now I can go to your
questions. Thank you for waiting.
5th REPORTER: ...What got done to the fishmeal in Canada that changed? You
said it was imported as fishmeal and then exported from Canada to the US as
fishmeal. Did something get done to it in Canada? And how many fish do you
think were fed this stuff?
DR ACHESON: I'm sorry if I said that I didn't mean that, but it was
imported into Canada as wheat gluten.
6th REPORTER: This is Karen Roebuck with the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
While it's not expected that people would get sick in the short term from
eating the contaminated food, are the various federal agencies who studied
his ruling out the possibility of long-term health effects from consuming
the compounds over time since kidney damage is cumulative? And also, health
effects aside, Dr Petersen had said last week that the pigs that had eaten
the adulterated food legally could not be put into the market because they
knew they ate the adulterated food. Yet now it seems those, even though you
know they ate the adulterated food and the chickens ate the adulterated
food, they are going into the market. Is that, so my question is, how would
that be legal?
DR ACHESON: Your question on the 1st part which was addressing the
long-term exposure consequences, well 1st of all we don't know for a fact
there's been long-term exposure. We don't even know for a fact yet that
melamine has gone into the human food supply other than via hogs and
poultry at extremely low levels. My best answer to your question on the
long-term health effects is as I said before, we are working with CDC,
looking for any shifts in trends. At this point we can't rule it out.
I think this may become more apparent as further work around this evolves
because obviously one of the questions is feeding studies of these kinds of
levels to animals under research conditions to answer those very questions.
So at this point I can't specifically rule anything in or anything out
other than to say there's absolutely no evidence of just that happening.
I'll turn the 2nd part over to Dr Petersen.
DR PETERSEN: Okay, thank you. Last week when we 1st started discussing some
of this contaminated feed had been fed to the swine, the initial discussion
was to swine, we had very little information. In fact that was about all
the information we had that some level of contaminated feed had been fed to
swine, and so based on that limited information we took what was with us
the most aggressive approach for protecting public health, which was for us
not to apply the mark of inspection to any of those animals.
Subsequently there has been additional information, much of it quite
significant, that's come along. We've learned a little bit more about the
low amount of melamine that was in the pet food and then the low amount of
pet food that's made it's way into the animal feed, and that the exposure,
if anything, to the animals was brief, and that we have no reason to
believe there's any concentration of the melamine in the actual meat of the
animal. So we've learned a lot there, and then over the weekend much of our
initial scientific judgment was further clarified through the risk
assessment which basically showed that even if you take the most extreme
position on exposure, the risk was just 2500 times or so below any known
possible risk.
So we started a week or so ago with limited information and at the time I
still believe the appropriate decision was for us not to apply the mark of
inspection. But now, given all that information and given that we have
specific farms where the feed tested negative, that now FSIS is in a
position to apply the mark, of inspection to those animals. And then
there's this other group of animals where we are still missing some
information, either the feed test was positive or there's no feed available
to test. So we're still taking a precautionary approach to those until
other facts come along. So that's, I realize it looks like a shifting
position, but it's shifted as facts have been put on the table.
And whenever those facts have put us in a position to make sure the public
was well-served, that's what we've done.
DR ACHESON: Yes, let me try to just make sure that everybody understands
some of the background for this because it's complicated, and I want to
just point out that wheat gluten is a component of wheat flour. So if you
start with wheat flour and you can essentially go through a process in
which you wash the starch away, thereby leaving the wheat gluten. The wheat
gluten is the protein part. That's the piece when you want high wheat
protein, it's the wheat gluten that you end up with and the starch is just
washed out.
So the wheat gluten is a component of overall wheat flour. Now this is the
point at which we become speculative, but it may throw some light on to how
does this all fit together. It's certainly a simpler process in which the
manufacturer would take wheat flour or whole wheat, simply grind it up,
thereby it would still have some wheat gluten in it at a low level but it
wouldn't be concentrated because the starch is still there. So its total
protein content would appear to be low. If you then add melamine to that,
what you're effectively doing is, you're adding a source of nitrogen to it.
When you do that, if your measurements of protein is actually measuring
nitrogen, what you've got is a wheat based product that appears to have
high protein because the nitrogen is high due to the addition of the
melamine. So there is a plausible hypothesis as to why this would be done,
and rather than taking the trouble to extract the wheat gluten and wash
away the starch, you simply grind up the wheat, put it all together, and
then artificially create the appearance of it being high in protein by
adding a high nitrogen-containing compound such as melamine. I hope that
explanation hasn't muddied the waters further and obviously we can take
questions if it has, but that may help explain what's going on here.
7th REPORTER: ...I wanted to know if Dr Petersen could just go through the
numbers real quick as far as there were 6000 hogs and then can you tell me
how many chickens we're still dealing with? Are we talking about the
chickens in Indiana, and has anything come of the investigation in the
Missouri plant?
DR PETERSEN: Okay, we mentioned last Friday I believe, and of course we are
on the cusp of the information from the risk assessment last Friday, and so
we'd asked that approximately 20 million young chickens, broilers, be
voluntarily held until we had a chance over the weekend to assess that risk
assessment. So those were held. And then with yesterday's announcement,
most of those, at least half, approximately 10 million, have begun to move
into slaughter channels. So those were ones associated with a negative feed
test, so they met the provisions we laid out in yesterday's announcement
with FDA. Then the other ones on poultry that you mentioned in Indiana are
still approximately 100 000, perhaps less, of the breeder birds that are
still being voluntarily, they are on hold and I don't recall if it's
voluntary or not, at those facilities, and because they, we don't quite
have a negative test on those at this point. So those would be subject to
the other information I mentioned that we're working through this week.
Otherwise, the rest of the numbers are what we've previously mentioned.
REPORTER: So the other, those I think 30 broiler farms and then 8 breeder
farms in Indiana, so the other like 3 million birds there, they've been
good to go? And then what about the other 10 million birds of the 20
million from Friday, the 10 million that have begun --
DR PETERSEN: Could you repeat just the last part of that?
REPORTER: Sure. The 1st part was the other 3 million birds in Indiana, and
then you were also talking about the 20 million birds that was announced
Friday, 10 million had begun to move because they tested negative. What
about the other 10 million, and the hogs?
DR PETERSEN: Okay. The other 10 million are eligible to move; they are
just, because they got the information yesterday they got to queue them up
to the appropriate slaughter facilities. The 3 million you mentioned was
really I think the hard number there was 2.7 million. That goes back a week
or so ago which were birds in Indiana from the roughly 30 farms I believe
that had already made their way into commerce. Those were ones that were
slaughtered back in sometime in March we believe. Then there's one other
piece of information about animals on hold. There are some animals at
several farms on hold in the state of Illinois, and looks like
approximately 3 facilities. Those number of swine on hold is approximately
50 000, and those animals we don't have a negative test, and so they are
subject to the other provisions that we announced yesterday, information
from the animal risk assessment or other investigatory findings. And so
those, that's kind of a new piece of animals that are on hold subject to
what we had yesterday, so that's pretty much what we have in total. The
broilers are the ones that are really moving to market today.
8th REPORTER: ...Do you know how the wheat flour - how do you know the
wheat flour in the fishmeal was contaminated? Are there samples available
for testing of that?
DR ACHESON: Yes, we tested the fishmeal and it was positive.
REPORTER: ...Now that the risk assessment for melamine in feed for
livestock is low, does that mean that you will then allow the pet food
companies to sell all their recalled food to livestock companies as long as
it's used in a small amount?
DR ACHESON: I would ask Dr Sundlof or David Elder to address that, of FDA.
DR STEPHEN SUNDLOF: ...The answer is no; that we consider any of the tests
positive to be adulterated and could not be used to further process into feed.
9th REPORTER: ...I have a couple questions. 1st of all, you've said you
don't know how many fish. Can you tell us how many fish farms or
aquaculture establishments, also what kind of fish? And then as regards the
wheat flour, regardless of what the label said, doesn't that alert you that
wheat flour has been adulterated and that all wheat flour should be tested?
I understand that what you're testing now is mislabeled, but that tells you
there's a problem with that broader product. Thank you.
DR ACHESON: With regard to your 1st question, we do have a preliminary list
of places where we're following up and we're trying to confirm that. That's
part of the validation investigation process, so at this point we don't
have a definitive list of numbers and how many names that I can share with
you. With regard to wheat flour, again it was not, even though the wheat
flour contained melamine it came into the US labeled as wheat gluten or
rice protein concentrate. At this stage we don't have direct indications of
product coming into the US labeled as wheat flour as anything other than
wheat flour. We are certainly talking to our field force about extending
the assignment that we have to look at some wheat flour, to test it, to
begin to go down that avenue, but at this stage it was, we have no reason
to believe wheat flour being imported as wheat flour is problematic.
REPORTER: The kinds of fish that these aquaculture establishments produce?
DR ACHESON: We'll know that better when we visit them, and that's the kind
of information that we obtain when we go and talk to them.
10th REPORTER: ...Who exported the wheat gluten or purported wheat gluten
to the Canadians, and why are you learning this only now? And then also,
are you looking at imports of fishmeal from China or other sources, Chile
for example, as well as poultry that may have fed meal within China that
potentially could have been contaminated? So 3 questions I got.
DR ACHESON: Well, I'm not sure I caught all 3 of them, but let me try. The
1st one, it came from the Chinese firms that we've previously had concern
about.
REPORTER: But who handled it in the interim then here in the United States?
DR ACHESON: Who handled it?
REPORTER: ...Who imported it, and then who re-exported it?
DR ACHESON: Well, it came directly from, I think it came throug ChemNutra.
VOICE: Brokered through ChemNutra.
DR ACHESON: Right. It was brokered through ChemNutra directly to Canada.The
wheat gluten never came to the US. It went directly to Canada, used by the
Canadian company that manufactured the fishmeal. It was only when we
started to get into the depth of the records from ChemNutra and started to
look outside of the US piece that this came to light, and then it was a
question of, okay, well it went to this Canadian company, so what did they
do with it? And then that led to the discovery that it was turned into
fishmeal, and some of that fishmeal then came back into the US.
REPORTER: Does it disturb you that ChemNutra didn't disclose this, that
they weren't more upfront, that they'd actually sold also or brokered at
least wheat gluten to human food or to companies that make meal that goes
into food products beyond just the pet food company they supplied?
DR ACHESON: I would have to talk to our investigators as to the questions
that they specifically asked of ChemNutra. I'm not aware that ChemNutra
were withholding information from us deliberately. So I don't think this --
this was simply as our investigators were pursuing this to the next level,
because initially we were concerned about product coming directly into the
US. That's what it started out. And that's typical with any investigation,
outbreak, traceback, that's the whole point of it. One thing leads to
another, leads to another, leads to another, and like the issues we've
dealt with before you are seeing outbreak investigations. You are seeing a
food-related incident unfold. So it's going to change with time, and it's
always easy with a retrospectoscope to say, well why didn't you ask that
question 2 weeks ago, why didn't you know that three months ago, and I wish
we had. But that's the process of discovery.
REPORTER: Okay, I'm sorry, follow-up. Just are you looking at fishmeal
imports now from China as well as say poultry imports from China that may
have been fed, from birds that may have been fed contaminated feed?
DR ACHESON: We're looking at variety of animal feed coming in from China.
Specifically fishmeal, I would ask whether Michael Rogers or David Elder
have any specifics on that. If not, we could get them to you.
DR MICHAEL ROGERS: We're certainly taking a risk-based approach to looking
at, currently we certainly have in place now the country-wide import alert
that's focused on all vegetable protein products from China, a domestic
sampling assignment, certainly at the border as well as (unclear). But
we're ging to be using the risk-based approach to identify what other
products from China and even possibly transshipped to other countries that
we should be focused on.
11th REPORTER: ...For Dr. Acheson, would it be reasonable to assume that
some company along the supply chain would have discovered before now that
the product wasn't a protein concentrate at all but a wheat flour, or not?
Because they only checked for protein levels.
DR ACHESON: Well, that's an interesting question, and I think when a
company typically gets a product in they will do that quality control of
that product. Different companies will have different degrees of quality
control. Does it meet the standards of what their standard is? If it
doesn't, they will typically reject it. They are not going to ask
questions, well why doesn't it work, what's the problem with it? They will
just simply say, this shipment doesn't meet our standards, doesn't do for
us what we need it to do, and reject it. They don't necessarily have an
obligation just to tell anybody about that. That's just an internal
decision, so I can't rule out the possibility that the companies got this
stuff in. It didn't perform as wheat gluten, and therefore they rejected it.
REPORTER: So explain that last part again? I mean, the companies all along
have been saying they used the wheat gluten and the rice protein concentrate.
DR ACHESON: Yes, they did, because my understanding of that is that they
didn't know it wasn't wheat gluten. They assumed it was wheat gluten. The
pet --
REPORTER: With an average amount of due diligence, should they have
discovered that?
DR ACHESON: That's up to their quality control in the context of their
manufacturing processes. So we're talking initially about the pet food
manufacturers. I don't know what level of quality control they go through
to ensure that when they receive something labeled as wheat gluten they
ensure that it is wheat gluten.
REPORTER: Okay. And then finally it's somewhat easier to see how the wheat
flour is one step on the process to wheat gluten, so you're saying the rice
protein concentrate was not a rice-based product at all?
DR ACHESON: That's my understanding, yes.
12th REPORTER: ...I was just wondering, is FDA or USDA or other agencies,
are you guys thinking about some broad changes in regulation of animal feed
since it seems like there is a pattern here you know - hogs, chickens,
fish. And are you looking at other animal feed too, or -
MODERATOR: Dr Sundlof is going to take that question.
DR SUNDLOF: Yes. We have been for the last couple years working on a more
comprehensive animal feed safety system. And we've been holding a number of
public meetings, and there will be another public meeting this month, I
believe it's either May 21 or May 22, that really addresses a lot of these
questions about how can you have a better overall safety system for your feed.
Previously our feed safety programs have been targeted at specific issues
such as BSE or mad cow disease or salmonella program, or a medicated feed
program in which feed mills actually mixed drugs into the feeds and they
have to do this under good manufacturing practice standards. But we have
not had really an overall, comprehensive program that looks at safety from
a broader perspective such that it would catch problems like we've seen
with the melamine. So that is a work in progress.
13th REPORTER: ...So if we can just go back for a second to why this may be
wheat flour. You talked about how it was, the production process was
simpler. Is this also, is it also cheaper? Is this part of sort of
disguising a cheaper product to something more expensive?
DR ACHESON: One would assume that if it's simple, it's cheaper. But I don't
have a specific economic analysis of that. And I certainly can't speak of
the economic advantages or disadvantages of one over the other. I want to
emphasize that it's only the positive samples that we have found, the
melamine-positive samples that we have found to be wheat flour. This does
not suggest that every sample of wheat gluten and every ingredient with
wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate coming into the US is wheat
flour. We have no evidence of that. It was a further follow-up of the
melamine-positive sample. I want to make sure that you all understand that.
REPORTER: If I could just have a follow-up, what do these fish farms, these
aquaculture, what are they doing? Do you have any idea? Are they breeding
fish for what purpose?
DR ACHESON: Typically they are for two purposes. One is to breed fish to go
directly into commerce as fish for human consumption. And the other is for
stocks to put in reservoirs and lakes and streams.
14th REPORTER: ...Several of my questions have been answered but I still
have a few others. The state, could you possibly give the state that the
farms are in, the fish farms? I'm curious about the percentage of - do
they, are they fed a diet of 100 per cent of this fishmeal? And do we have
any sense of how long these two companies have been exporting to North America?
DR ACHESON: With regard to your 1st question, at this stage I'm not able to
disclose which states are under investigation. As I said, that's active,
and as of right at this point in time, I can't discuss that further. To
your 2nd question as to how long these companies have been importing
products into the US, I know it goes back to 2006. I will ask Michael
Rogers or David Elder if they have any information beyond that.
MR DAVID ELDER: Dr Acheson has stated the investigation is ongoing, we will
be confirming the details as we progress with the investigation. But at
this point in time we don't have any information to extend it any further back.
REPORTER: Can I ask you something though? Are you working with the
Canadians at all, because if they were importing to the US, they were
probably exporting to Canada as well.
DR ACHESON: Absolutely. We're working very closely with the Canadians on this.
REPORTER: And do you know what percentage the fishmeal is of the diet? Is
it 100 per cent? Are these fish fed 100 per cent fishmeal?
DR ACHESON: Dr Sundlof?
DR SUNDLOF: No. Fishmeal would be a component of the total feed, and I
can't tell you exactly what proportion of that it is, but it's probably
less than half.
The call ends.
