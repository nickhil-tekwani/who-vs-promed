A highly contagious swine virus has been detected
on a privately owned game ranch in Saginaw County, state officials said.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture's Geagley
Laboratory confirmed the outbreak of pseudorabies
at the ranch, which has 19 sport swine.

Pseudorabies (PRV) is a highly contagious viral
disease that kills newborn piglets. In rare
cases, it can cause sudden death in cats and
dogs. It also can sicken cattle, sheep and deer
but does not hurt people. Despite its name, the virus is not related to rabies.

"We must protect Michigan's USD 230 million swine
industry," said Don Koivisto, state agriculture
director. "Michigan achieved PRV-free status in
2000, and the ability of this disease to be
spread by feral hogs to other animals could be a risk to the swine industry."

That status should remain intact as long as
Michigan's commercial swine operations remain
free of the virus, officials said.

PRV is transmitted through nasal and oral
secretions, food, water and the environment and
can be carried on car tires, boots, and clothing.

All swine on the Saginaw County ranch will be captured and destroyed.

Officials with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Wildlife Services branch are
trapping and euthanizing feral swine in the area.

State officials are encouraging Michigan
residents to shoot feral swine and submit the carcasses for disease checks.

"We are contacting other states to notify them of
the disease and anticipate some out-of-state
markets will impose restrictions on live swine
from Michigan until testing proves that this is
an isolated case," said Steve Halstead, state
veterinarian. "We need to confirm as quickly as
possible that the disease has not spread to other farms."

The state agriculture department is banning
importation of swine for breeding on game ranches
or for supplying game ranches or facilities using
swine for sport, hunting, or shooting, a
spokeswoman said Wednesday [7 May 2008].

Farms that sold live swine to the Saginaw County
ranch or received live swine from the ranch will be quarantined and tested.

Additionally, all farms and ranches with
commercial or sport swine in a 5-mile radius
around the ranch where pseudorabies was found
will be quarantined and the swine tested.

Meat from PRV-positive swine is safe for humans
to eat. State agriculture officials recommend
cooking meat to 165 F as a precaution against foodborne illness.

Michigan banned importation of hogs from
Wisconsin in 2007 because of an outbreak of the pseudorabies virus there.

[Pseudorabies is an acute, frequently fatal
disease with a worldwide distribution that
affects swine primarily and other domestic and
wild animals incidentally. The pseudorabies virus
has emerged as a significant pathogen in the USA
since the 1960s, probably because of the increase
in confinement swine housing or perhaps because
of the emergence of more virulent strains.
Clinical signs are similar to those of rabies,
hence the name "mad itch." Pseudorabies is a
reportable disease and has been successfully
eradicated from the vast majority of the USA.

Michigan has been free of this disease according
to USDA standards for many years. Consequently,
the state will be examining the site carefully as
they do their trace ins and trace outs (animals
that have moved in or out of the herd or premises).

Aujesky 1st recognized pseudorabies as a disease
of cattle and dogs in Hungary in 1902. It soon
became evident, however, that swine were the
natural hosts of the virus and pigs also could
die as a result of the disease. Because of his
astute observation, the synonym for this disease is Aujesky's disease.

Pseudorabies virus is a DNA herpesvirus. Although
the pig is the only natural host, the virus can
infect cattle, sheep, cats, dogs, and goats as
well as wildlife, including raccoons, opossums,
skunks, and rodents. Experimental studies in
nonhuman primates indicate that rhesus monkeys
and marmosets are susceptible, but chimpanzees
are not. Reports of human infection are limited
and are based on seroconversion rather than virus
isolation. Infections in horses are rare. Only
one serotype of pseudorabies virus is recognized,
but strain differences have been identified using
monoclonal antibody preparations, restriction
endonuclease assays, and heat and trypsin inactivation markers.

The virus can be transmitted via nose-to-nose or
fecal-oral contact. Indirect transmission
commonly occurs via inhalation of aerosolized
virus. Infectious virus can persist for up to 7
hours in air with a relative humidity of 55
percent. Data from England indicate that virus
may travel via aerosols for up to 2 km in certain
weather conditions. Other studies have
demonstrated that the virus can survive for up to
7 hours in nonchlorinated well water; for 2 days
in anaerobic lagoon effluent and in green grass,
soil, feces, and shelled corn; for 3 days in
nasal washings on plastic and pelleted hog feed;
and for 4 days in straw bedding. The virus is
enveloped and, therefore, is inactivated by
drying, sunlight, and high temperatures (37 C).
Dead-end hosts, such as dogs, cats, or wildlife,
can transmit the virus between farms, but these
animals survive only 2-3 days after becoming
infected. The potential role of insects as
vectors is being investigated. Birds do not seem
to play a role in transmission.

The clinical signs depend on the age of the
affected animal. Young swine are highly
susceptible, and losses may reach 100 percent in
piglets <7 days old. In general, signs of CNS
disease (e.g., tremors and paddling) are seen. If
weaned pigs are infected, respiratory disease is
the primary clinical problem, especially if
complicated by secondary bacterial pathogens.
Pseudorabies virus has been reported to inhibit
the function of alveolar macrophages, thereby
reducing the ability of these cells to process
and destroy bacteria. A generalized febrile
response (41-42 C), anorexia, and weight loss are
seen in infected pigs of all ages. Mortality can
be very low (1-2 percent) in grower and finisher
pigs but may reach 50 percent in nursery pigs.
Sneezing and dyspnea are frequently seen, and CNS
involvement is reported occasionally.

After natural infection, the primary site of
viral replication is nasal, pharyngeal, or
tonsillar epithelium. The virus spreads via the
lymphatics to regional lymph nodes, where
replication continues. Virus also spreads via
nervous tissue to the brain, where it replicates,
preferentially in neurons of the pons and
medulla. In addition, virus has been isolated
from alveolar macrophages, bronchial epithelium,
spleen, lymph nodes, trophoblasts, embryos, and luteal cells.

Viral excretion begins around 2-5 days after
infection, and virus can be recovered from nasal
secretions, tonsillar epithelium, vaginal and
preputial secretions, milk, or urine for >2
weeks. A latent state, in which virus is harbored
in the trigeminal ganglia, may exist. In swine
with latent infections, shedding may resume after
periods of stress such as farrowing, crowding, or
transport. Experimentally, corticosteroid
injections (dexamethasone, 2 mg/kg, IM) for 5
consecutive days have induced recrudescence.

Lesions:
Gross lesions of pseudorabies virus infection are
often undetectable. Serous rhinitis, necrotic
tonsillitis, or hemorrhagic pulmonary lymph nodes
may be seen. Pulmonary edema, as well as
pneumonic lesions of secondary bacterial
pathogens may be present. Necrotic foci (2-3 mm
in diameter) may be scattered throughout the
liver. Such lesions are typically found in young (<7 days old) piglets.

Microscopically, nonsuppurative
meningoencephalitis is a characteristic lesion
that can be present in gray and white matter.
Mononuclear perivascular cuffing and neuronal
necrosis may also be present. The meninges are
thickened as a result of mononuclear cell
infiltration. Necrotic tonsillitis with the
presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies, as
well as necrotic bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and
alveolitis are commonly seen. Focal areas of
necrosis are often found in the liver, spleen,
lymph nodes, and adrenal glands of macerated fetuses.

In addition to the gross and microscopic lesions,
other diagnostic aids include virus isolation,
fluorescent antibody testing, and serologic
testing. Brain, spleen, and lung are the organs
of choice for virus isolation. Nasal swabs can be
used for isolation of virus from acutely infected
animals. The nasal specimens must be stored and
transported in cold, sterile saline with
antibiotics to suppress bacterial growth. The
fluorescent antibody test can be performed using tonsil or brain.

Many serologic tests are now available, including
serum neutralization, ELISA, and latex
agglutination. Serum neutralization, which is the
standard test, requires 48 hours to complete. An
ELISA has been developed as a screening assay for
large volumes of sera; however, specificity may
be poor. False-positive results are typically
reassessed using the serum neutralization test.
The latex agglutination test, although highly
sensitive and rapid, may also have poor
specificity. After infection, antibodies can be
detected within 6-7 days using the latex
agglutination test, within 7-8 days using the
ELISA, and within 8-10 days using the serum neutralization test.

A differential ELISA has recently been used to
differentiate antibodies produced as a result of
vaccination from those produced as a result of
natural infection. The vaccines used in swine are
based on the deletion of certain genes (gI, gIII,
or gX) from the vaccine virus. Swine vaccinated
with a gene-deleted vaccine do not mount an
antibody response to the protein coded for by the
deleted gene. In contrast, infection with field
virus results in antibodies against these proteins.

Colostral antibodies to pseudorabies virus may be
present until the pig is 4 months old (similar to
porcine parvovirus). Therefore, paired samples or
serologic profiles may be necessary in grower and
finisher pigs to assess decreasing levels of
maternal antibody and to ensure that pigs are
vaccinated at the appropriate time.

Although there is no specific treatment for acute
infection with pseudorabies virus, vaccination
can alleviate clinical signs in pigs of certain
ages. Typically, mass vaccination of all pigs on
the farm with a modified live virus vaccine is
recommended. Intranasal vaccination of sows and
neonatal piglets 1-7 days old, followed by IM
vaccination of all other swine on the premises,
helps reduce viral shedding and improve survival.
The modified live virus replicates at the site of
injection and in regional lymph nodes. Vaccine
virus is shed in such low levels that mucous
transmission to other animals is minimal. In
gene-deleted vaccines, the thymidine kinase gene
has also been deleted; thus, the virus cannot
infect and replicate in neurons. It is
recommended that breeding herds be vaccinated
quarterly, and that finisher pigs be vaccinated
after levels of maternal antibody decrease.
Regular vaccination results in excellent control
of the disease. Concurrent antibiotic therapy via
feed and IM injection is recommended for
controlling secondary bacterial pathogens.

Numerous programs have been developed for
eradication of pseudorabies virus and include
whole-herd depopulation, a test and removal
strategy, and offspring segregation. Although
effective, whole-herd depopulation is costly and
time consuming. Usually, problems other than
pseudorabies virus (e.g., genetic improvement)
need to be resolved before whole-herd depopulation can be cost effective.

The test and removal strategy consists of blood
testing all breeding swine, culling all positive
animals, and repeating this procedure until the
population tests negative. Naturally infected
animals can be culled when such a strategy is
used in conjunction with a differential
vaccination program. A test and removal strategy
can be effective, but it is laborious, and
latently infected animals that do not exhibit an
antibody response on serologic testing may
potentially resume shedding the virus at a later time.

In an offspring segregation program, young
piglets (18-21 days old) are removed from
vaccinated sows and raised to adulthood at
another site. If enough gilts and boars are
raised in this manner, the original breeding herd
may be depopulated and subsequently repopulated
with seronegative replacements. This method also
allows seedstock producers to sell animals, even
though the breeding herd is infected. In this
case, however, all offspring must be individually
tested using the serum neutralization test and
have negative results before being sold.
