[This is the official WHO confirmation of the most recent case of
human H5N1 avian influenza infection in Egypt (see: Avian influenza,
human (111): Egypt 20070723.2358). There have now been 38 cases in
Egypt and 15 fatalities. The global total of human cases becomes 319,
and the death toll remains at 192.
The most recent previous case in Egypt was reported on 25 Jun 2007.
This lapse of time is in accordance with the forecast of the Egyptian
authorities that the virus would hide away during the sweltering
summer months following a pattern observed in 2006 when human bird
flu cases disappeared between May and October. - Mod.CP]
