OIE Extends its Activities in Food Safety and Animal Welfare
-------------------------------------------------------------
The OIE is broadening and reinforcing its field of activities.
Subjects such as food safety and animal welfare now form an integral
part of its scientific and normative priorities.
a.Food safety:
Food safety is a priority requirement of consumers who wish to eat
risk-free food.
It is incumbent upon the national and international authorities
responsible for food safety to meet these expectations and to ensure
that all countries are in a position to obtain scientific and
technical information allowing them to take appropriate measures for
their socio-economic context.
The Codex Alimentarius, with a secretariat provided jointly by the
FAO and the WHO, is today the organization that proposes food safety
quality standards for adoption by its Member Countries. However, when
an animal disease could have an influence on a food product for
consumption, it is vital for the OIE to intervene upstream by
proposing norms, guidelines and recommendations for Member Countries
and the competent international organizations. These OIE activities
cover the safety procedures for raw materials during food production
and first-stage processing before they are placed on the market.
These measures form part of a food control strategy "from the farm to
the fork".
In order to deal with these issues in more detail, the Director
General of the OIE will soon meet an ad hoc group of world-renowned
specialists that will make appropriate proposals to the OIE Member
Countries.
b.Animal welfare:
This domain, which includes establishing norms for animal protection
on the farm, during transport and at the time of slaughter, is a
growing source of concern amongst consumers and decision-makers.
Although animal welfare is not currently covered by the World Trade
Organization Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement, Member Countries
want to see strong scientific and normative involvement on the part
of the OIE in order to help them resolve potential bilateral disputes
and to dialogue with consumers and animal protection organizations.
In order to ensure that these problems are dealt with on a scientific
basis, an OIE ad hoc group appointed by the Director General will
meet from 2 to 4 April 2002. It is comprised of specialists from five
continents.

[The OIE is an intergovernmental organization created by the
International Agreement of 25 January 1924 and located in Paris. In
May 2001, the OIE totaled 158 Member Countries.
One of the main missions of the OIE is to guarantee the sanitary
safety of world trade by developing sanitary rules for international
trade in animals and animal products. For this end, the OIE develops
normative documents relating to rules that Member Countries can use
to protect themselves from diseases, without setting up unjustified
sanitary barriers. The main normative works produced by the OIE are:
the International Animal Health Code, the Manual of Standards for
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines, the International Aquatic Animal
Health Code and the Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases.
The standards are adopted by the International Committee, which is
composed of the Chief Veterinary Officers/Directors of the Veterinary
Services of the respective member countries.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) deals with international trade
rules. Its Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS)
recognizes the OIE as the leading international standards-setting
organization for animal health and animal diseases that are
transmissible to humans (zoonosis). The cooperation between the two
organizations was formalized by exchanged letters on 4 May 1998; OIE
standards are recognized by the WTO as reference international
sanitary rules.
The announcement on the due broadening of OIE's scope seem to be a
needed adjustment to the significant changes in the world opinion
regarding food and its safety, and new attitudes towards animal
welfare issues. As clearly demonstrated during numerous food safety
events in all parts of the globe, with BSE as a prominent example --
"farm to fork" approach is indeed not a hollow phrase. Consumer√≠s
concerns exercise a significant impact upon international trade in
animals and their products. Reorganization in food-safety control and
legislation bodies have become topics on the agenda of many
countries. Obviously, the new areas of OIE's activities will need
close cooperation with other organizations, such as the WHO, FAO and
WTO. - Mod. AS
