Tnuva destroyed a quarter of a million liters of milk suspected to be toxic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A catastrophe was prevented this week [week of 20 Jul 2012] due to the action of Tnuva dairy workers in Tel Yosef, who suspected that milk supplied originated in a dairy farm in the village Kfar Kish in the Lower Galilee [HaZafon (northern) district], where 59 cows had died due to infection by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_.

The consignment of milk suspected to contain the botulinum toxin was mixed in the Tel Yosef dairy factory with 240 000 liters of dairy milk collected from other farms in northern Israel. Therefore, it was decided to destroy the whole lot, 10 tankers of raw milk.

On the infected premises in Kfar Kish, only 5 cows survived and they are in serious condition. Their owner claims that his livestock had been vaccinated against _C. botulinum_.

[The media terminology "catastrophe prevented" is definitely extreme; however, in view of the incidence of bovine botulism globally, the event described and its handling may be of interest beyond Israel.

Increasing numbers of outbreaks of botulism in cattle have been described in the past decades, probably as a consequence of the enhanced use of plastic-wrapped or packed silage as cattle feed. The inclusion of poultry litter in silage may have played its role as well.

Bovine botulism outbreaks, mainly caused by toxin serotypes C and D (generally regarded as of extremely low or no toxicity to humans) are often large, affecting hundreds of animals and thus, cause enormous economic losses due to death and euthanasia of intoxicated animals, in addition to reduction in milk production. Particularly large numbers of outbreaks have been reported in the UK, Switzerland, and in Israel. There have been also several, smaller outbreaks caused by botulinum toxin serotype B, which is regarded potentially toxic to humans. A single incident (Brazil, 1986) reportedly involved the human-affecting botulinum toxin serotype A.

The risk to public health by the possible transfer of botulinum toxins and/or vegetative cells/spores of _C. botulinum_ to milk has been one of the issues addressed by an expert group appointed by the UK Food Safety Agency (FSA). Their 2006 report includes also data of a risk assessment conducted earlier by the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA). Chapter 6 "Risk to public health" includes the following points pertaining to risk from milk (http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/botulismincattlereport1206.pdf):

"Toxin in milk from cows was not considered to be a risk because clinically affected cows do not normally produce milk or the milk could not be collected for practical or statutory reasons." More severe restrictions and measures are recommended once a case is confirmed to be caused by botulinum toxin serotype A or B.

We are informed that the amount of the milk supplied from the affected farm in Kfar Kish was about 3500 liters. The value of 250 000 liters of raw milk exceeds USD 132 500. It would be of interest to learn more about the scientific considerations leading to the destruction of the said lot; in particular, if the toxin serotype was identified.
