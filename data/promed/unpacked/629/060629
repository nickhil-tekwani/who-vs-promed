Downy mildew disease hits muskmelon crop in Punjab
---------------------------------------------------
Downy mildew disease, which is a limiting factor for successful
growing of various cucurbit crops, has now affected the muskmelon
crop in Punjab. According to Punjab Agricultural University (PAU)
plant pathologist Dr Chander Mohan, the disease has attacked almost
all the varieties of muskmelon grown in the state and severely
affected its yields.

Stating the reason behind the spread of the disease, he said that
farmers in the districts of Amritsar, Kapurthala, and Nawanshahar
cultivated cucumber crop under low plastic tunnels. The temperature
and humidity in plastic tunnels is favourable for the growth of the
downy mildew pathogen and the disease first appeared in cucumber
fields and then spread to the muskmelon fields.

Elaborating the symptoms of the disease, Dr Mohan said initially the
disease appears in the form of water-soaked lesions on the
under-surface of lower leaves. The corresponding area on the upper
surface shows yellow lesions. Later, grey coloured fungal growth
develops on the underside of these lesions and is visible only during
early morning hours when there is high humidity. These lesions later
increase in size and merge with each other giving a blighted
appearance. As a result the growth of vines is stopped thereby
adversely affecting fruit yield and taste.

To control the disease, scientists have suggested spraying crops with
fungicides. Two sprays should be done at weekly intervals. Under
heavy disease risk situation, additional sprays are recommended.

[Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits. _P. cubensis_ is found worldwide,
but it is usually most damaging in tropical and subtropical areas.
Different pathogen strains with variable host preferences (pathovars)
seem to exist. By affecting the leaves and thus the photosynthetic
potential of its host, downy mildew reduces yield and fruit quality,
and it can eventually kill the host plant. If appropriate conditions
are present, plantings can be infected so rapidly that they appear to
have been frosted.

The fungus is an obligate parasite surviving on cultivated or wild
cucurbits, and volunteer plants of crops or cucurbit weeds may serve
as sources of inoculum. The disease is spread by wind, rain splash,
and mechanical means. Disease development can occur over a wide
temperature range under conditions of high humidity. Control
strategies include the use of resistant cultivars as well as
applications of protectant and systemic fungicides.

The related species _P. humuli_ causes a serious disease of hops.
Downy mildews in other fungal genera affect grapevine, sunflower, and
a number of vegetable crops. Generally, each downy mildew species is
confined to a number of hosts.
