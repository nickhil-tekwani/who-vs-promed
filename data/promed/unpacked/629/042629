Belgium Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said on Tuesday samples taken at 3
animal feed firms in the country had tested positive for the cancer-causing
chemical dioxin, leaving 6 firms in the clear.
Dehaene told a news conference on the latest developments in the
dioxin-in-food scare, through the feed, only chickens had shown clear signs
of contamination and there were no risks regarding pork or beef.
Dehaene said he hoped a slaughter ban on poultry from farms not suspected
of having used contaminated feed would end as planned on Tuesday night,
with restrictions on pork, beef and by-products such as butter to be
removed by Wednesday night. "We are doing the impossible, are using every
means so that before the end of the week the situation is normal again."
The lifting of trade restrictions on poultry would mean that three-quarters
of chicken farms would be working as normal again, he added.
Between 300 and 350 samples of possibly contaminated animal feed and fats
would be tested urgently for the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) -- toxic, man-made chemicals which create dioxins when heated. The
test results are due by the end of the week.

Belgium's dioxin health scare has focused attention on how nations enforce
safety standards and has increased support for Europe-wide controls to
ensure the purity of food from stable to table.
Like mad cow disease, the Belgium food fiasco seems to have originated with
contaminated animal feed.
The source of the cancer-causing dioxin hasn't been confirmed but Belgian
authorities have arrested the operators of a Flemish company that sells
animal fats to feed manufacturers.
Be it an accident or a few individuals breaking the law, the crisis has
sparked calls for an independent body to regulate food safety across the
15-nation group.
Under the current scheme, the European Commission issues directives on what
can be fed to animals but national governments make and enforce the laws.
Stuart Thomson, feeds adviser to Britain's National Farmer's Union, can see
the logic of a pan-European body but says you can never regulate against
negligence.
"We're under European administration. We are in there. If we are trading as
a bloc then we should be regulated as a bloc as well. I don't think it is
the regulation that is at fault here. It's the negligence on the part of
the individuals involved."
The United Kingdom Agriculture Supply Trade Association (UKASTA), the
British member of FEFAC, agreed. "One can't legislate against criminal acts
or put traceablity schemes in place that will avoid a criminal act, a
spokesman said.
A European scheme may not have stopped the Belgian crisis, but Doring
argues it would have limited the damage and prevented the collapse of
confidence that resulted from the four-month lapse between the time when
dioxin contamination was first suspected and when it was reported to the
European Commission.

[Since dioxins, at some level, however low, are somewhat ubiquitous, I was
wondering when someone would look for PCBs. It is very reasonable and
prudent to be testing for PCBs, which may be a bigger problem than dioxins.
