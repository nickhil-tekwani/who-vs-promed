As the ticks that spread Lyme disease push ever further into Canada, doctors are starting to notice an unusual fallout from the growing threat: a spike in the number of people seeking help for arthritis triggered by the bacteria [_Borrelia burgdorferi_].

A new study from Halifax, to be presented at an American College of Rheumatology conference in Florida this weekend [5-6 Apr 2014], documented 17 child arthritis patients, most of whom surfaced over the last 2 years just in Lunenburg county [Lunenburg County is located on the South Shore of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia].

Few had experienced any other symptoms and most had no idea they had Lyme [disease] until, complaining of swollen, painful joints, they were referred to a rheumatologist. Once blood tests indicated they had the infection, some were also diagnosed with related neurological problems.

In southern Ontario, a public-health office near one of the province's several Lyme-disease areas has seen a 5-fold increase in cases in the last year, many of the patients experiencing arthritis.

"The majority of children ... never knew they were bitten by a tick. Arthritis was the very 1st presenting symptom of their Lyme disease," said Dr. Elizabeth Stringer, a rheumatologist at Halifax's IWK Health Centre and co-author of the study. "There have been some families who have been surprised, definitely."

The good news is that most cases can be cured with 1 to 3 courses of intravenous antibiotics, though some people can have lingering effects.

The disease is caused by _Borrelia burgdorferi_ -- a "spirochete" bacterium related to the bug that causes syphilis -- typically spread by black-legged deer ticks [_Ixodes scapularis_]. Most people experience a bulls-eye-like rash around the bite location, sores and fever in early stages, followed later, if untreated, by neurological symptoms like face-paralyzing Bell's palsy, heart problems or arthritis.

Lyme is far more common in New England and some other parts of the United States than it is here, but the tick has been moving deeper into Canada over the last several years. With endemic areas now in 6 provinces -- New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia -- the number of infected Canadians reported to authorities has jumped to 315 in 2012 from 128 in 2009, reports the Public Health Agency of Canada. Federal scientists have projected a further advance by the sesame-seed-sized ticks, and more disease as a result.

It makes sense that Dr. Stringer has seen what she called a "sharp rise" in pediatric cases of Lyme arthritis, since children seem more likely to go undiagnosed until the bacteria causes joint inflammation, said Dr. Gordon Dow, an infectious disease specialist in Moncton, New Brunswick. In fact, it was a "huge" jump in children diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis around Lyme, Connecticut, which led to the illness being discovered in the mid-1970s, he said. "You could almost see pediatric arthritis as like the canary in the coal mine," said Dr. Dow. "You start seeing arthritis in one joint in a bunch of kids and that should trigger you to look for Lyme disease."

IWK's pediatric rheumatology department began recording cases of Lyme arthritis in 2008. After a smattering of patients in the 1st few years, about 3/4ths of the total so far came just in 2012 and 2013, said Dr. Stringer. Half the children saw their symptoms disappear after one course of IV antibiotics, while the rest required 2 or 3 courses. But 5 months after treatment, 2 patients still had arthritic symptoms that limited their functioning. A paper published in 2011 by doctors from Hershey, Pennsylvania, concluded that about 25 percent of children treated for Lyme arthritis will still suffer chronic musculoskeletal inflammation.

Chatham-Kent region in Ontario includes Rondeau Provincial Park, one of several parts of the province with Lyme disease-ticks. Though the annual number of cases the health unit has managed to identify is still under 10, it has jumped sharply in the last year, said Dr. David Colby of the Chatham-Kent Health Unit. "There is often a delay in diagnosis, so [arthritis] is not at all uncommon," he said. "It can be quite severe, actually. Patients who go on to the 3rd stage can have chronic arthritis for months or years."

[The following paragraph is extracted from "Lyme disease in Canada: Q & A for paediatricians." Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) Paediatr Child Health 2009; 14(3):103-5. Available at http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/ID/LymeDisease.htm:

Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in North America and Europe, but it is not common in Canada. The eastern black-legged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_) have a more patchy distribution and are well established in some locations in Ontario along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, in southeastern Manitoba, and in Bedford and the Lunenburg area of Nova Scotia. _Ixodes_ ticks are found intermittently in most provinces in Canada, likely brought by migratory birds; 10 percent to 12 percent of these ticks may carry _Borrelia burgdorferi_. Therefore, one could theoretically acquire Lyme disease from the bite of an infected tick anywhere in Canada but the chances are quite low, except in areas where the eastern and western blacklegged tick populations are firmly established. Human cases of Lyme disease in Canada are primarily the result of travel to areas outside of Canada or areas in Canada mentioned above where infected ticks are well established. In 2010, Lyme disease became a nationally reportable disease in Canada (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-fs-eng.php).

Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of the disease appearing months-to-years after the tick bite. Although Lyme arthritis was initially reported to occur in 60 percent of untreated patients with Lyme disease in the US, the frequency has fallen considerably probably because of improved recognition and earlier treatment of patients with early Lyme disease (http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf). Patients with Lyme arthritis may begin to have intermittent bouts of arthritis, with severe joint pain and swelling. Large joints are most often affected, particularly the knees.

Lyme arthritis without clinical evidence of neurologic disease can usually be treated successfully with antimicrobial agents, such as doxycycline (for adults and children 8 years of age or older), amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil administered orally for 28 days. In about 10 percent of patients with Lyme arthritis, joint swelling persists after recommended antimicrobial treatment courses and if untreated may lasted for up to 4-5 years in a few patients (http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf), even though PCR for _B. burgdorferi_ of synovial fluid specimens or synovial tissue specimens, if available, are usually negative. The IDSA recommends retreatment in these patients with another 4-week course of oral antibiotics or with a 2- to 4-week course of ceftriaxone (http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf). Arthroscopic synovectomy has been used successfully in the treatment of such patients. However, it is important to recognize that a small number of patients treated with oral agents have subsequently manifested overt neuroborreliosis, which may require intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G.

Lunenburg, with a population of 2313, is a town located in Lunenburg County (population 47 313) on the South Shore of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia about 40 miles (65 km) southwest of Halifax (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunenburg,_Nova_Scotia). - Mod.ML
