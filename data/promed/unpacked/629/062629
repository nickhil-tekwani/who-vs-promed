Blue ear disease hits 11 provinces in Viet Nam
----------------------------------------------
As of Fri (30 Jul 2010), blue ear disease has affected pigs in 11
provinces across the country, the Department of Animal Health
reported. The southern provinces of Tien Giang and Soc Trang were the
hardest hit, according to the department under the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development.

Other problem areas include the central provinces of Nghe An and
Quang Tri, the Mekong Delta province Bac Lieu, and the northern
province of Cao Bang, the department said. However, it didn't
elaborate on the total number of affected pigs.

The epidemic disease, known as porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome, is likely to spread further, Van Dang Ky, head of the
department's office warned. Ky listed a number of reasons that could
have led to the outbreak, including local people and officials'
negligence regarding preventive measures as well as their lack of
necessary education.

In June 2009, the department said that Viet Nam had successfully
curbed the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, bird flu and blue ear
disease. On 3 Apr 2010, however, blue ear cropped up again in the
northern province of Hai Duong.

[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is
characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory
problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the
PRRS virus, a virus currently classified as a member of the order
Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. The primary
target cell of the virus is the alveolar macrophage of the pig.

Two major antigenic types of the virus exist, the European and the
American type. The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs
but also by faeces, urine, semen and fomites. Additional background
is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf>.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world.
The disease, initially reported from Viet Nam in 2007 where it was
locally named as "Blue ear pig disease," spread throughout the
country and was declared endemic on 23 Feb 2008 (see, with
distribution map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>).
Its identification in Viet Nam followed the spread of the disease in
China with serious economical losses. Viet Nam's handling of the
issue was characterised by commendable transparency. - Mod.AS]
