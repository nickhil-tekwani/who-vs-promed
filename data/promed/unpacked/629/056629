[1] UK: NHS staff "insulted" by UK travel ban

As the latest of the 6 British-built Ebola treatment centres in West Africa admitted its 1st 3 patients this weekend, some of the volunteer NHS staff working there over Christmas said they felt insulted by a draconian ramping up of the protocols they have been told they will have to follow when they return to the UK.

Public Health England (PHE) has told the NHS personnel it is increasing restrictions on their movements when they return from the frontline of Ebola-infection, banning them from travelling on public transport for longer than an hour and increasing from 2 to 3 the number of weeks before they can return to work.

For Dr John Wright, a clinical epidemiologist from Bradford working at the clinic at Moyamba, Sierra Leone, which opened on Fri [19 Dec 2014], it was a slap in the face for him and his colleagues. "It's a return to the ecology of fear that they insisted they were going to steer clear of," he said. "No travel, no shared accommodation, no clinical work, a fever parole officer to report to daily. Why not issue us with plague masks and bells? It's an insult to our intelligence and common sense and is exactly that loss of reason and scientific understanding that they promised they wouldn't lose when we left... PHE [Public Health England] say they're following the practice of the NGOs... PHE should be leading the way with science."

Wright, who has been in Sierra Leone for a month, one of 780 NHS volunteers helping in the region, will return at the end of the month [December 2014]. "I am now trying to work out how I get home from Heathrow without flying or undertaking journeys longer than one hour." ... - more

[Bradford is over 6 hours by bus (cost GBP 30), 3.5 hours by taxi (GBP 220) and 1 hour exactly by air (GBP 61) from Heathrow. Travel from airport to home of more than 1 hour presumably affects more than one volunteer out there. It seems rather unfair to change the return conditions after staff have been deployed, if that is what has happened. - Mod.JW]
