Yyan E, Zhang E, Brooks HW, Horsington J, Brownlie J. Foot-and-mouth
disease virus crosses the placenta and causes death in fetal lambs. J Comp
Pathol 23 Apr 2007.
Summary:
18 pregnant sheep, 6 at 45 days gestation and 12 at 75 days gestation, were
infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type O UKG 34/2001. Two
sheep from each gestational group were killed at 2, 4, and 7 days
post-inoculation (dpi). Three sheep, pregnant for 75 days at infection,
were killed at 17 and 18 dpi. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation (VI) were used to detect viral
RNA and infectious virus, respectively, in fetal tissues taken post mortem.
11 fetuses were obtained from the 6 sheep inoculated at day 45 of
gestation. Of these, 2 of 3 fetuses at 2 dpi had viral RNA detected by
RT-PCR, and virus was detected in one by VI. Viral RNA was detected in 2 of
4 fetuses at 4 dpi, while viral RNA and virus were detected in all 4
fetuses at 7 dpi. No gross abnormalities were evident in these fetuses. In
the group inoculated at day 75 of gestation, viral RNA was detected in 3 of
4 fetuses at 4 dpi. Virus and viral RNA were detected in 3 of 4 fetuses at
7 dpi. Of the 7 fetuses examined at 17 and 18 dpi, viral RNA was detected
in 5, and 4 of these had died in utero. Gross abnormalities, including
hemorrhage and edema in a number of tissues, were evident in many of the
fetuses in this group, but no vesicular lesions were found. Viral RNA and
virus were detected in the amniotic fluid associated with infected fetuses.
This study is the 1st to demonstrate that FMDV may cause transplacental
infection and fetal death.

[Although ProMED-mail does not generally function as a "journal club," we
have posted this summary in view of the potential contribution of the
described research in unraveling the mechanism of FMD infection maintenance
in endemic regions with significant sheep populations. It would be
interesting to study the possibility that subclinically infected pregnant
sheep are in a state to maintain infection for extended periods and
disseminate the virus on pastures and/or premises where other susceptible
animals may get infected.
In their discussion, the authors state that the results suggest a possible
mechanism whereby infected sheep may spread the disease which is not
dependant upon viral persistence in the oropharynx, the traditionally
proposed mechanism by which persistently infected animals may infect others.
There are endemic FMD countries, particularly in the Middle East and vast
parts of Asia, where wild boars might play the role of intermediate FMDV
hosts/transmitters, provided they are exposed to infection -- for example,
by consuming ovine placentas. Furthermore, such a hypothetical scenario
might be supported by the observed seasonality of FMD (such as in Israel),
where the start of the FMD season coincides with the start of the lambing
season (see references).
This is the 1st investigation of FMD in pregnant sheep and fetal lambs in
an experimental setting; further results of the progressing research are
anticipated with great interest.
It is to be hoped that the results obtained and the above hypothesis will
attract the attention and interest of clinicians and field workers in the
relevant geographic regions, triggering enhanced clinical observations and
field studies. - Mod.AS]
