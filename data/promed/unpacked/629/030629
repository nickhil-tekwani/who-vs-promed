The transmission of H7N9 bird flu between 2 unrelated people probably happened in a hospital in China, a new case study says.

Previous reports of person-to-person transmission of the virus have all occurred among family members.

The 2 patients in the study were on the same ward in a district hospital in Zhejiang Province, China in February 2015. One patient was admitted to the hospital on 18 Feb 2015 with fever, cough, and sore throat. His symptoms developed after he bought 2 chickens from a live poultry market, the researchers noted. The 49-year-old man was diagnosed with H7N9 on 24 Feb 2015 and died on 20 Apr 2015.

The 2nd patient was a 57-year-old man with a history of chronic pulmonary lung disease who developed flu-like symptoms after spending 5 days on the same ward as the 1st patient. The 2nd patient was diagnosed with H7N9 on 25 Feb [2015] and died on 2 Mar [2015].

The chickens bought by the 1st patient tested positive for the H7N9 virus. Another 11 samples from the poultry market also tested positive, the researchers noted.

The 2nd patient had no exposure to poultry for 15 days prior to his illness. But, the H7N9 virus that infected him was nearly genetically identical to that from the 1st patient, and similar to the virus found in the poultry market visited by the 1st patient.

The findings suggest that the 1st patient infected the 2nd patient while they were on the same hospital ward, and that the live poultry market was the most likely source of the infection in the 1st patient, according to the authors of the study, published 19 Nov 2015 in the journal BMJ [C-F Fang, M-J Ma, B-D Zhan et al: Nosocomial transmission of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China: epidemiological investigation. BMJ 2015; 351: h5765 . http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5765]

The results "should raise our concern about the increasing threat to public health" and highlight the need for better training and hospital hygiene, along with better surveillance of both patients with flu-like illness in hospitals and chickens in live poultry markets, the researchers added.

The study was led by professor Wu-Chun Cao, of the State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Security at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology in China.

[Epidemiologic and genetic approaches were used to characterize transmission. Contact tracing was done for both patients and their close contacts were monitored. They also collected environmental samples for analysis. The virus obtained from a throat swab of the index and 2nd patients were fully sequenced and compared. Based on this, the researchers noted a one-base pair difference -- a difference that didn't lead to an amino acid change -- in the polymerase segment between the patients' viruses.

Similarly, there was a one-base pair difference between their hemagglutinin segments and a 2-base pair difference between their neuraminidase segments.

The samples from the poultry market exhibited additional differences, though a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis found that those samples clustered together in a single clade. Further, they reported that that clade was genetically similar to viruses that circulated in chickens in 2014.

Receptor binding specificity assays also indicated that the strain could infect both people and birds, the researchers added (excerpted from Genome Web: Genetic analysis indicates likely person-to-person transmission of avian flu; http://tinyurl.com/ptr4ypa)

An accompanying editorial from the BMJ follows:
MAB van der Sande and W van der Hoek: Nosocomial transmission of avian influenza virus A(H7N9)
BMJ 2015; 351: h5980 doi: 10.1136/bmj.h5980 (Published 19 Nov 2015); http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5980.

"We should not accept nosocomial transmission, of any pathogen, in any setting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Since the 1st notification in March 2013 through to 15 Oct 2015, a total of 679 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses, including 275 (40 percent) deaths, have been reported to the World Health Organization [1] These individuals have presumably contracted their infection in China directly from infected birds or their environment, particularly when visiting live poultry markets. Limited human-to-human transmission has been suspected in a few clusters of cases of family members [2]. In a linked article, Fang and colleagues report on a presumed case of nosocomial, human-to-human transmission of influenza A (H7N9) between unrelated individuals [3]. Both patients, showing symptoms, spent time in the same hospital room, were infected with comparable strains, and -- because no other common exposure was identified -- the authors concluded that nosocomial infection was the most likely route of transmission.

"Although Fang and colleagues' report does not prove nosocomial transmission beyond any doubt, the findings should not be completely unexpected. Sporadic human-to-human infections with a range of avian influenza viruses have been reported regularly over the past 2 decades, including suspected nosocomial transmission [4]. This case report once again reminds us to strengthen our efforts to keep healthcare facilities safe for patients. If we cannot ensure a hygienic care environment, we risk wasting any benefits of new (and often expensive) preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions. We need to strengthen surveillance among humans, poultry, and wild birds; develop rapid diagnostic tests; standardise serological assays; develop broadly protective effective vaccines; and do more basic (immunological, genetic, virological) and applied epidemiological and behavioural research. But we must also not forget to maintain and protect the basics of public health, including hygiene in healthcare settings. ...-- more."
