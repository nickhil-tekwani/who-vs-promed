Blue ear pig disease spreads
----------------------------
The blue ear pig virus continues to spread. It has now reached the
southern Irrawaddy Region and into Mon State in southeast Burma.

So far, 6 regions or states have reported outbreaks of the disease,
according to the Rangoon Region Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Department. The virus has spread so widely due to ineffective bans on
the transportation of pigs, veterinarians said.

Early this month, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department
banned transporting pigs and pork into Rangoon Region.

The disease, which affects the reproductive organs and respiratory
tract, was 1st found in the Mandalay area in February [2011] and has
spread to Naypyitaw, Magway, Pegu, Rangoon, Irrawaddy and Mon states.

In early May [2011], pathologists from the Veterinary Institute in
Thailand, who are researching the disease, visited Burma to make
observations in the affected areas and offer suggestions to prevent
and control the spread of disease.

Blue ear pig disease has spread to the Irrawaddy Region and Mon State
in spite of the Burmese government's efforts to contain the virus.In
early May, although the Rangoon Region banned transporting pigs and
pork from the Pegu Region, transporting pigs and pork from the
Irrawaddy Region was allowed.

Rangoon Region authorities have ordered meat shops in Rangoon not to
sell infected pork and said that violators would be punished.
Meanwhile, the price of pork has dropped by half.

A veterinarian said that the blue pig ear disease had spread from
China to Burma, while another source noted that pig traders usually
export pigs from Mandalay to China.

Starting in February, state-run newspapers have periodically run
articles on how to prevent the disease and authorities have launched a
public awareness campaign in some townships.

On the other hand, an editor of a Rangoon-based journal told Mizzima
that the government's public awareness campaign should also be
conducted in villages and in rural areas. "If they hear that the
disease has spread to a ward, they will conduct an awareness campaign
without enthusiasm only in the neighbouring wards. It's not
effective," he said.

"The disease has spread for a long time. They know that it is out of
control. So, they should go to villages and townships in states and
regions to talk directly with people in the areas. Advising people in
only some areas is not enough. Some people do not read state-run
newspapers," he said.

[Though the alleged involvement of a bacterial disease, published
earlier (see 20110605.1722), has not been addressed here -- it seems
not to have been confirmed.

No follow-up report on PRRS has been published by the OIE since the
initial report on the 1st occurrence of the disease in Myanmar,
submitted 4 Mar 2011. - Mod.AS
