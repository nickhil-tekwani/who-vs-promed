A warden message from the US Embassy in Mali is being circulated
concerning an outbreak of probable dengue in the region surrounding
Kayes, Mali. About 26 Oct [2008], a physician began seeing clinical
cases consistent with dengue, including headache and substantial
musculoskeletal pain. Since that time, over 70 patients have been
seen, and, apparently, 2 patients have died after manifesting
hemorrhagic symptoms. At present, the number of new cases is greatly
diminished to one or 2 a day. The Ministry of Health has apparently
been involved and relevant samples dispatched to the Pasteur
Institute and CDC-Fort Collins. Preliminary testing has shown some of
the samples to be positive for dengue. No serotype has been mentioned.

[Over the past 4 months, there have been reports of dengue in West
Africa, including countries neighboring Mali (Burkina Faso, Guinea,
Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire). Dengue-3 virus was the serotype isolated
this year (2008). See ProMED archive no. 20080820.2597 for those
reports. ProMED is grateful to Dr. Herrick for sending this report.
Firsthand information about dengue outbreaks in Africa is very
infrequently provided, and the occurrence of these outbreaks is
doubtless under-reported. If the 2 deaths are indeed due to dengue
virus infection (DHF), the total number of dengue cases is
considerably higher than the over 70 patients mentioned in this report.
