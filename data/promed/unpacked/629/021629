Bacon and other cured pork meats have been identified as risk factors for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in England by researchers. They found consuming bacon, cured pork meats, and pigs' liver were significantly associated with HEV infection, confirming previous links to processed pork products. Scientists investigated risk factors for HEV infections in the blood donor population in England via a case-control study from April 2018 to March 2019. Study participants were 117 HEV RNA-positive blood donors and 564 HEV RNA-negative donors.

Collected information from cases and controls included travel history, animal and environmental exposures, alcohol intake, medication, and other conditions. They were also asked about the food they ate and purchasing preferences with detailed questions about the consumption of pork products. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, joint pain, and headaches. Overall, 76 of 117 cases and 552 of 564 controls were asymptomatic. There was a greater presence of HEV in male than female blood donors, but the reason for this is uncertain, according to the study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The incubation period of HEV can be 2 to 9 weeks. Patients were asked about the 9-week period before the date of their HEV RNA positive blood donation and controls about the 9 weeks before their donation. Of 19 food items included, 14 were significantly associated with HEV infection and most were animal products. No patients and 4 controls were vegetarians. The final model showed the only variables of note were bacon, cured pork meats such as sliced salami and cabanos, and pigs' liver. It is not yet clear whether curing is sufficient to inactivate HEV.

"The identification of these pork products highlights the importance of accurate information about cooking requirements as well as the role and importance of animal husbandry to prevent HEV infection in pigs. Targeting HEV infection at the source would prevent foodborne transmission to the population," said researchers.

Hepatitis E virus has 8 types; genotype 3 (G3) and G4 are primarily foodborne. The increase of HEV in England in 2010 coincided with the emergence of a novel HEV phylotype. No evidence has been found of this phylotype in pigs in England. Viruses detected in human clinical samples in the UK have been closely related to those found in pigs in Europe. Scientists said evidence suggests the risk comes from pork products from outside the UK.

Researchers said preventing the consumption of pigs' liver would lead to only a modest reduction in HEV cases because few people eat it. They also didn't find a risk associated with having pork pies or ham and sausages from a certain UK supermarket chain. This could be because of changes in the supplier or source of pork for the supermarket since a 2013 study made this link or differences between the study populations.

An increasing trend of acute HEV was seen in the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016, with 1212 cases reported in 2015, 1243 in 2016, 1002 in 2018, and 1202 in 2019. HEV is the most common cause of diagnosed acute viral hepatitis in England and the annual estimate of infections is 100 000 to 150 000.

Methods for sampling and testing pork and other food products are not robust enough to provide information about contamination with infectious viruses, according to the study. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has commissioned Campden BRI and Glasgow University to assess the best way to detect hepatitis E virus in pork meat and pork products by optimizing elements of existing HEV extraction and detection methods.

There are evidence gaps on HEV, and standardized and reliable detection methods are needed to get a better understanding. The developed method would be able to quantify HEV from pork meat, offal and pork products with low-level detection if possible. The final report will be published after the project ends in December 2022. It is planned the developed system will be put forward as a candidate for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification as a standard method.

While genotypes 1 and 2 of HEV cause outbreaks of the disease mostly from contaminated water in the developing world, genotypes 3-7 are zoonotic. Genotype 3 is primarily spread from swine, can cause chronic infection in immunosuppressed individuals, and can be transmitted via blood transfusion. The following is a previous report regarding zoonotic HEV in the UK:

Abstract
--------
"Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England and Wales. Most cases are locally acquired and caused by hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV G3). HEV G3 is linked to the consumption of pork products. The increase is associated with the emergence of a new phylotype, HEV G3-group 2 (G3-2, also known as G3abcdhij). 60 individuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of travel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV G3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Epidemiological data relating to usual shopping habits and consumption of ham and sausages were analysed together with typing data to identify any associations with HEV phylotype. Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0.06, CI 0.97-3.53). The HEV G3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is suggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of products made from pork originating outside the UK. This does not infer blame on the supermarket, but the epidemiology of HEV is dynamic and reflects complex animal husbandry practices which need to be explored further."

This report underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E (primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in Europe. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV, and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products), and are caused by genotype 3. In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection that can progress to cirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with chronic infection.

The author's summary of their work states: "Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0.06, CI 0.97-3.53)," although the posting above quotes the paper (in the full text, which is not available to this moderator) as "Only supermarket X, especially [its] own brand, was significantly associated with [the virus]." The statistics noted in the summary give a relative risk of 1.85, which supports an increased risk of almost 2 times, but the P value of 0.06 and a confidence interval overlapping 1.0 both do not reach statistical significance, so "more likely" is better than "significantly associated." Be that as it may, there is no doubt that acquisition of zoonotic HEV in Europe is clearly linked to ingestion of undercooked pork products that were carrying the virus. Adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen practices to avoid cross-contamination will minimize, if not erase totally, this risk. - Mod.LL
