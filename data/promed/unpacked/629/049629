ANTHRAX, HUMAN & LIVESTOCK - ZIMBABWE (02):CORRECTION
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Due to an editorial commission, yesterday's posting erroneously suggested
that the human population was vaccinated against anthrax. This should have
read: "So far, only 20 [cutaneous] cases were reported, and the situation
has been arrested after hard work by the veterinary team. 'They have
succeeded in vaccinating all the affected areas and the situation is back
to normal,' he said."
We regret the error.
