The government has asked those travelling to India from Ebola-affected countries to carry a certificate stating that there is no evidence of the deadly virus in their body fluids, after a person cured of the disease was found to be carrying the virus in his semen.

In case people having been discharged after being treated for Ebola do not have the certificate from the health ministry of the country concerned, they have been advised not to travel to India for a period of 90 days from their discharge, health minister JP Nadda told Lok Sabha on Fri [28 Nov 2014].

[But why 90 days also for women? And what about a person admitted to an ETU with symptoms who had to wait in there for a week for test results, exposed to infection by others, but whose test eventually came back negative? Does s/he get a No-Ebola certificate? And what does that mean? They could have got infected while in the ETU waiting and be incubating when discharged. - Mod.JW]

Another 230 million kronor (USD 31 million) is set to be donated by the Swedish government to fight the Ebola virus in West Africa, making it the largest contributor in the world in terms of funders per capita. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) will distribute the money which bumps up Sweden's overall contribution to 560 million kronor [USD 75 million].

Sweden is now the number one country in terms of funders per capita ahead of the UK and Norway and 5th in total overall. Of the 230 million kronor being donated, 100 million is going towards the UN Ebola response fund, 90 million to Unicef and 40 million to the World Health Organization. Part of the Sida money will be used to purchase vital equipment to have in stock and also to educate the public on how to take precautions against the disease... - more
