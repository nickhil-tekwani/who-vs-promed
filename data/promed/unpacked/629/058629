This [Fri 23 Mar 2018], the Regional Health Agency (ARS) reported that 42 cases of leptospirosis have been reported in Reunion since the year began. One person has died. The south of the island has been particularly affected.

Heavy rains can favor the appearance of certain diseases, and in particular leptospirosis. The cleaning of courtyards and gardens or bathing in fresh water after heavy rain is particularly risky. Following recent heavy rainfall events in Reunion, the ARS Indian Ocean wants to raise awareness of the need to strengthen vigilance and the means of protection through the implementation of simple actions.

The annual number of cases recorded between 2010 and 2017 in Reunion Island is on average 61 cases, most of which occur between January and May (35 to 60 per cent). From 1 January to 20 March 2018, 42 cases were reported, including one death. This number of cases higher than totals for the 1st quarters in previous years, and may be related to the heavy rains and unusual climatic events in recent months, which have particularly affected the south and west of the country.

The geographical distribution shows that the south of the island is particularly affected, north and west are stable, and the east is less affected than in previous years. The rainy season is the most risky period because it presents conditions of temperature and rainfall favorable to the survival in the environment of the bacteria responsible for this disease. Heavy rain events lead to soil leaching and environmental contamination.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Reunion experiences seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis probably related to the rainfall.

Reunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800 000 located in the Indian Ocean, about 943 km (586 miles) east of Madagascar and about 200 km (120 miles) south west of Mauritius, the nearest island.
