Number of enterovirus cases in Macao exceeds 300
------------------------------------------------
Another 11 more enterovirus cases were confirmed here on Thursday [5
Jun 2008], bringing the total number to 332 so far, according to the
city's Health Bureau (SSM). These enterovirus cases comprise hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (mouth blisters). None
of the patients was in serious condition, the bureau said in a press
statement.

Among the 11 new cases, 2 were confirmed as EV 71 (Human enterovirus
71) infections as of Thursday, which were all found in a local
creche, according to SSM. EV71 is a viral infection usually found
among young children. It is also one of the causative agents for
HFMD. To date, SSM has reported some 43 EV 71 infections, and most of
the city's enterovirus patients were children enrolled in local
creches and primary schools.

[The number of HFMD cases in Macao has progressed from 79 on 7 May
2008, to 283 on 29 May and now to 332 on 5 Jun 2008. All cases appear
to have been mild and no fatalities have been reported. EV71 is the
only etiologic agent detected so far.

A recent statement from the Chinese Ministry of Health and the World
Health Organisation (WHO) indicated that HFMD cases in China would be
reported now only on a monthly basis. Therefore, no update on HFMD
cases in mainland China is expected before the 3rd week of June.
