[This report includes information released by official and other

So far in 2001, according to the ArboNET surveillance group report
contained in the MMWR Report reproduced below, 142 West Nile
virus-positive birds have been reported now from the District of
Columbia (1 bird) and 34 counties in 9 states - Connecticut (4),
Florida (21), Georgia (2), Maryland (51), Massachusetts (6), New
Jersey (37), New York (16), Rhode Island (3), and Virginia (1). West
Nile virus has also been detected now in 38 mosquito pools collected
in 10 counties in 4 states (Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New
York - including New York City), representing at least 9 species.
One suspected human case and 3 equine cases have been reported from
the state of Florida. These figures differ from the figures posted by
individual states, indicating a lack of synchrony in reporting.
As well as reporting the first human case in the year 2001, Florida
also can claim the distinction of reporting the first equine case and
the first West Nile virus-positive sentinel chicken. - Mod.CP

West Nile Virus-positive Hawk Found in DeKalb County, Georgia
-------------------------------------------------------------
A hawk with West Nile virus was recently found in DeKalb County,
Georgia. The bird, a Cooper's Hawk, was picked up north of the
intersection of Buford Highway and North Druid Hills Road in north
DeKalb County. The hawk was sent to the Southeastern Raptor
Rehabilitation Center in Auburn, Alabama where it was euthanized.
Tissue samples were sent to the National Wildlife Disease Center in
Madison, Wisconsin. On Mon 23 Jul 2001, the DeKalb County Board of
Health was notified that West Nile virus [infection had been
confirmed.
To date, no West Nile virus infections have been found in humans in
Georgia. Most people who are infected with WNV do not even get sick.
However, a small proportion of people--mostly those over 50--may
become ill with symptoms of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
and require hospitalization. Mosquitoes spread the virus by feeding on
the blood of infected birds. The disease cannot be spread from person
to person.

Georgia Public Radio and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution are
reporting that a hawk infected with West Nile Virus has been found in
DeKalb County, in the Metro Atlanta area. A Cooper's hawk was found
alive but with symptoms of "neurologic damage" near the intersection
of North Druid Hills Road and Buford Highway. This location is about 3
to 4 miles North of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Candidate Equine West Nile Virus Vaccine
----------------------------------------
Dr. William Jeter, an animal industry biologist for the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' Division of
Agricultural Environmental Services, said the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is rushing into production an experimental West Nile
vaccine to be used on horses. Jeter said the vaccine did well in field
trials in New York and New Hampshire earlier this year and, under a
conditional USDA license, could be released for use as early as
mid-August [2001.
While use of the vaccine already has shown no great side effects, its
effectiveness at protecting against West Nile virus infection remains
to be seen, Jeter said. What's more, it can't be counted on to provide
immunity -- only lessen the impact of the virus in those animals that
contract it.
Because of their constant exposure to mosquitoes, horses are
considered most vulnerable to the virus. Jeter said the virus has not
severely harmed the horse industry in New York -- but harsh winters in
that state give annual respite from the blood suckers that carry the
disease. Jeter said relatively few horses in New York contracted the
virus, but of those that did, 38 percent died or had to be killed.

Fourth Bird and Second Mosquito Pool Positive for West Nile Virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As of 25 Jul 2001, the State Mosquito Management Program today
announced a second pool of mosquitoes and a fourth bird positive for
West Nile virus (WNV) in Connecticut.
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) has isolated
West Nile virus from mosquitoes collected on 16 Jul 2001 from the
Beacon Point section of Stratford. The pool of mosquitoes testing
positive in Stratford was _Culex pipiens_. The second trap site in
Stratford (Beaver Dam Road) has thus far tested negative for WNV. CAES
will be setting traps at both sites (Beacon Point and Beaver Dam Road)
in Stratford on 25 Jul 2001. The results from the July 25 mosquito
collection will be available near the end of next week.
Additionally, a second bird was confirmed positive for WNV in the
central section of Wethersfield, bringing the total to positive birds
statewide: 1-Milford, 1-Stamford, and 2-Wethersfield.

Avian Test Results
------------------
All bird testing for West Nile virus is currently performed at the New
Hampshire Public Health Laboratories (PHL). Some birds are reported as
unsatisfactory for testing because they are decomposed. As of Wed 25
Jul 2001: 245 birds were negative for West Nile virus; 0 birds were
positive for West Nile virus; and 19 birds were unsatisfactory for
testing.

Results
of 20 Jul 2001 [edited
<http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/westnile/010720results.htm>

A total of 5 more crows and 7 additional mosquito pools have tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). The crows were collected on 9 Jun
2001 in Princeton (Mercer County), Marlboro (Monmouth), and Scotch
Plains (Union); on 5 Jul 2001 in Kinnelon (Morris); and on 6 Jul 2001
in Edison (Middlesex). The positive mosquitoes were collected on 3 Jul
2001 in Upper Saddle River (Bergen); on 4 Jul 2001 in Green Bank
(Burlington); and 5 pools between 2 and 11 Jul 2001 in Ocean Township
(Monmouth).
Crow, Hawk, and Falcon Testing:
To date, 337 birds, mostly crows, have been accepted for testing by
the Department of Health and Senior Services' Public Health and
Environmental Laboratory. Of those tested, 39 crows found in Bergen
(4), Burlington (1), Camden (3), Cape May (1), Mercer (2), Middlesex
(16), Monmouth (6), Morris (2), Passaic (1), and Union (2) Counties
have been confirmed positive for the presence of WNV.
Mosquito Testing:
To date, 36 mosquito pools collected in Atlantic (1), Bergen (2),
Burlington (1), Middlesex (3), Monmouth (23), Morris (5) and Salem (1)
Counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV. In total, 906
mosquito pools have been tested.
Human Testing:
In total, 20 residents have been approved for WNV testing and 19 have
accepted. Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from these individuals
have been or are in the process of being tested for the presence of
WNV. These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the
established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and
are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus
have been discovered. To date, testing has shown that 5 individuals
were not infected with WNV and results are pending for 14 others.
Doctors of patients with symptoms who do not meet WNV testing criteria
have the option of sending samples of their patients' blood to private
laboratories for analysis using the St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE)
screening test. Since SLE and WNV are closely related viruses, a WNV
case will most likely react to a SLE test. The department has not been
notified of any positive SLE tests to date.

Medical Alert Extended to 14 Counties
-------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE: The Florida Department of Health (DOH) announced today
that they now have the first presumptive human case of West Nile virus
(WNV) in Florida. The patient is from Madison County. Results will be
confirmed by the end of the week. Due to the increased activity of
Eastern equine encephalitis, a medical alert that was issued last
month for Holmes, Washington, and Jackson Counties has been extended
to include Bay, Calhoun, Gulf, Franklin, Liberty, Gadsden, Wakulla,
Leon, Jefferson, Madison, and Taylor Counties.
The Department of Health urges all Floridians to take precautions
against mosquito bites. "Even though the risk of contracting West Nile
virus and other arboviruses (St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), Eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis and LaCrosse
encephalitis) by humans is still low, people need to use protective
measures to reduce their risk of getting the disease," said DOH
Secretary Robert G. Brooks, MD. He added, "There is no reason to
panic, but it is important to take the necessary measures to guard
against mosquito bites."
In addition to one possible human case of West Nile virus infection,
the latest surveillance shows the following counties have animals that
have tested positive for the virus.
Jefferson: 3 crows, 1 mockingbird, 1 bluejay and 1 horse;
Madison: 2 crows;
Washington: 1 crow;
Taylor: 2 crows;
Oklaloosa: 1 bluejay;
Duval: 1 sentinel chicken; and
Leon: 1 hawk, 1 crow and 1 finch.

West Nile Virus Activity; Eastern United States, 2001
-----------------------------------------------------
In 2000, ArboNET, an enhanced human and animal surveillance system
designed to monitor the geographic spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in
the United States and to identify areas at increased risk for human
infections with WNV, detected WNV activity in the District of Columbia
and 12 states (1).
This system, first implemented in the District of Columbia and 20
states along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, was later expanded
throughout the continental United States. This report summarizes
ArboNET data from 1 Jan through 25 Jul 2001, which documents epizootic
WNV activity in the southeast and indicates the need for widespread
implementation of WNV prevention activities.
The first human infection in 2001 was identified in a 73-year-old man
from Madison County, Florida, with illness onset on approximately 15
Jul 2001. He remains hospitalized with encephalitis.
Equine surveillance identified 3 horses with neurologic disease
attributed to WNV infection in Jefferson County, Florida, with illness
onsets beginning on 24 Jun 2001.
Avian mortality surveillance identified 142 WNV-infected birds from
the District of Columbia (1 bird) and 34 counties in 9 states
(Connecticut [4, Florida [21, Georgia [2, Maryland [51,
Massachusetts [6, New Jersey [37, New York [16, Rhode Island [3,
and Virginia [1. Crows accounted for 126 (89%) of the reported birds.
In New York City, one live hatch-year house sparrow had antibody to
WNV.
One sentinel chicken from Duval County, Florida, seroconverted to WNV
in a serum specimen drawn on 10 Jul 2001.
WNV also was detected in 38 mosquito pools collected in 10 counties in
4 states, representing at least 9 species, including a pool of 6
_Culex salinarius_ collected in Baltimore, Maryland, on 11 Jul 2001, a
mixed pool of _Cx. pipiens/Cx. restuans_ collected in Queens, New
York, on 3 Jul 2001, a pool of _Ochlerotatus canadensis_ collected on
5 Jul 2001 and a pool of _Cx. pipiens_ collected on 16 Jul 2001 in
Fairfield County, Connecticut, and 34 pools collected in 7 New Jersey
counties as early as 31 May 2001. The New Jersey mosquito pools
included _Cx. pipiens_ (17 pools), _Cx. restuans_ (9), _Culiseta
melanura_ (3), unidentified _Aedes/Oc._ species (2), _Ae. vexans_ (1),
_Oc. canadensis_ (1), and _Oc. triseriatus_ (1).
MMWR Editorial Note:
The findings in this report demonstrate multifocal epizootic WNV
activity across the eastern United States, including new areas in the
southeast. In 2000, avian mortality surveillance indicated northward
spread of epizootic activity from the New York City metropolitan area
in late spring and early summer, and southward spread as far as North
Carolina in late summer and early fall (1), a finding consistent with
viral spread by migrating birds (2).
The detection of WNV in Florida and southern Georgia in 2001, extends
substantially the known distribution of this virus. Although first
detected in these areas in 2001, WNV may have been introduced into
these states earlier, but epizootic viral activity remained below the
detection threshold of surveillance.
In 2000, avian mortality surveillance identified 4305 WNV-infected
birds, 77 of which were identified by 1 Aug 2000 (1,3). The finding of
142 WNV-positive birds as of 25 Jul 2001, is twice the 2000
surveillance figures, and the geographic distribution of these birds
differs between the 2 years. All of the birds identified in the early
summer of 2000 were from 4 states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, and New York), compared with 44% of those identified as of 25
Jul 2001.
Illness onset on approximately 15 Jul 2001 in the patient from Florida
was the earliest of any person reported since the 1999 recognition of
WNV in the United States.
The extensive epizootic WNV activity and continued geographic
expansion of the virus highlight the need for widespread
implementation and intensification of surveillance, prevention, and
control measures to minimize the risk for human and equine disease.
Prevention activities have included the development and maintenance of
long-term
sustained mosquito-control programs using integrated pest management
strategies and public education programs, emphasizing residential
mosquito larval control and personal prevention measures to reduce
mosquito exposure (4).
WNV detection in _Cx. salinarius_ and _Ae. vexans_ is of particular
concern because these species more readily feed on mammals (including
humans) than do _Cx. pipiens_, _Cx. restuans_, or _Cs. melanura_,
which have a strong feeding preference for birds (5). However,
mosquito-control programs in urban areas should continue to emphasize
reduction of _Cx. pipiens_ populations in the north and _Cx.
quinque-fasciatus_ populations in the south. Although the role of
these species in the direct transmission of WNV to humans is unclear,
their role in the amplification of this virus and the closely related
St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus in urban ecosystems is
well established (6,7).
The occurrence of WNV in Florida raises the possibility of
transmission of this virus by other mosquito species such as _Cx.
nigripalpus_, a primary vector of SLE virus in that state (8), and the
possibility of a longer transmission season than is typical in regions
with a more temperate climate.
The U.S. Geological Survey, CDC, and other federal, state, and local
government agencies have collaborated to establish World-Wide
Web-based maps to track the spread of WNV. These maps are available at
<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html>.

West Nile virus Under-reporting
-------------------------------
LONDON: For every New Yorker diagnosed with encephalitis or meningitis
from West Nile virus in the summer of 1999, there were probably 140
milder infections that went undetected, scientists have estimated. The
findings, which suggest that 2.6 percent of the metropolitan New York
City population was infected during that outbreak, indicate that West
Nile infections are vastly under-reported.
As the mosquito season on the U.S. East Coast intensifies and the
virus threatens to spread elsewhere, health officials advised in The
Lancet medical journal that doctors should consider West Nile
infection when diagnosing unexplained summertime fever, especially if
it's accompanied by headaches, muscle ache, and joint pain. For most
people, West Nile virus causes only a flu-like sickness and many who
are exposed don't get sick at all. It is mostly a concern for the
elderly. Recent research has found that people with diabetes or those
75 or older were more than 5 times more likely to die than others.
In 1999, the first year the virus was found in the Western Hemisphere,
59 people were hospitalized with encephalitis or meningitis and 7 of
them died. Last year, 21 human West Nile cases were reported, 2 of
them fatal, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The researchers, from the New York City Department of
Health and the disease control centers, estimated that in the 1999
outbreak, about 8200 people probably were infected, and that 1700 of
those came down with West Nile fever.
Dr. Bob Shope, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch
in Galveston, Texas, and co-director of the WHO reference center for
viruses transmitted by insects, said that while the study's estimates
are credible, they might be a little high. He said tests cannot
reliably differentiate West Nile virus infection from infection by any
of the more than 60 viruses that belong to the same [genus,
_Flavivirus_, especially if people have been infected with more than
one flavivirus in their lifetime. "They are interpreting the tests as
specific for West Nile virus and I would question that
interpretation," Shope said.
Nonetheless, the underlying finding that scores more people got
infected than previously thought would remain true, experts said. In
the study, 677 people from 459 random households in the Queens borough
of New York answered questionnaires and were given blood tests for
West Nile infection in October 1999. A total of 19 tested positive.
The researchers reached their estimates by extrapolating from the 59
diagnoses of meningitis or encephalitis that year.
West Nile virus was first reported in Uganda in 1937. Cases have been
reported since in Europe, the Middle East, West and Central Asia, and
the Pacific Islands, as well as Africa and North America.

A Comment on the Current West Nile Virus Surveillance Situation
---------------------------------------------------------------
[As of Wed 25 Jul 2001: 1 human (maybe), 2 horses (maybe) in Florida,
a human here, a horse there, a mosquito pool here, a mosquito pool
there, and some dead birds here and there. This simply is
counterintuitive. Given the inadequate nature of surveillance methods
used for arboviruses and the lack of seriousness with which some folks
take West Nile virus, my suspicion is that this virus is just about
everywhere in the eastern United States and maybe in other areas of
North America and perhaps has extended into Latin America. It is
highly unlikely that the only infected mosquitoes, birds, and mammals
found are the ones that have been infected. Something may be
very wrong with the surveillance system, starting with vector
surveillance.
Might any other readers of ProMED-mail have the same impression?
--
Charles H. Calisher
<calisher@cybercell.net>
[The surprising coincidence of the appearance of the first human,
equine, and sentinel chicken cases in the state of Florida would not
have been predicted on previous assumptions about the West Nile virus
outbreak, and in my view tends to favour Dr. Calisher's interpretation
of the current situation. - Mod.CP
[Not to disagree with my esteemed colleague Charlie Calisher, but I
would think that the surveillance effort in all states is even higher
than it was in the last 2 years, & that the dead crow index is a good
one. Looking for arboviruses in their vectors is like looking for a
needle in a haystack (& I know, I've done it for years). Most
mosquitoes that come to traps have never fed before, so can't have
been infected in the first place -- the number that are transovarially
infected is probably rather low. Hence you have to catch & process
many thousands of mosquitoes to make a handful of virus isolations.
Not many states have that capacity.
What limits mosquito transmission is mosquito survival, which can be
measured by the number of days for which the ambient temperature is
above a certain threshold for larval development. In the Southern USA
this threshold was passed before the Northeast. When the Northeast
catches up, we may be in for a nasty surprise. - Mod.JW
