Rabbits ravaged by fatal virus, RCD suspected
---------------------------------------------
A dead rabbit is being tested at Massey University after a suspected
rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) outbreak in Ashhurst [in
Manawatu-Wanganui region].

Two neighbouring rabbit breeders have lost 11 animals in the past 2
weeks, and are now warning other rabbit owners to get them
vaccinated. [The 2 neighbours] now have 9 empty hutches between them.
All will be destroyed in case they harbour the disease.

"I just don't want to risk losing any of the bunnies anymore," [one
of them] said. As a further precaution, all rabbits were separated
and [the daughter], 6, was keeping her pet bunny in the bathtub in
hopes of saving it from infection.

[The breeder] was also hand-rearing 7 baby rabbits, after the nursing
mother died.

[The other breeder] said the virus had struck a couple of weeks ago,
with rabbits turning lethargic and dying within a few hours. She now
feared her remaining rabbits were headed the same way. "Usually I'd
have to top up their food this time of day and they'd be running back
and forth." Instead the rabbits were quiet, and the food barely touched.

They did not know how the virus reached their rabbits, but [one of
them] said research showed the virus could be carried by flies,
humans, and other animals. She had taken a rabbit to Cahill Animal
Hospital in Palmerston North last week [week of 2 Mar 2009], but it
died before arriving. That animal has been sent to Massey University
for tests to confirm if it was RCD, and all the other animals have
been vaccinated.

Vet Debbie Hay said if the rabbits already had the virus, vaccination
would be no use. "It is very infectious, and if they're getting
infected from the same source you'll get a high mortality rate." The
outbreak comes a week after a suspected outbreak in New Plymouth [in
neighboring Taranaki region].

RCD facts
---------
Rabbits generally die within 30-40 hours of infection, from heart and
respiratory failure caused by the development of blood clots in vital
organs. The manner of their death is relatively humane.

Young rabbits, up to 5-8 weeks old, do not die of the disease. They
become immune and survive to breed in the following season, but do
not pass on their immunity.

All tests to date have indicated that the virus affects only European rabbits.

RCD is extremely stable in the environment compared to other viruses.
Tests have shown it can last 105 days at 20 deg C [68 deg F] when
dried on cloth.

[Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD), also known as viral hemorrhagic
disease (VHD) of rabbits or rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), is an
extremely contagious and often fatal viral disease of domesticated
and wild rabbits. This disease affects only rabbits of the species
_Oryctolagus cuniculus_. This includes most show, pet, and laboratory rabbits.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic
disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family
Caliciviridae. Many strains of RHDV appear to circulate in rabbit
populations; these viruses can have distinct epidemiological and
genetic characteristics. Only a single serotype is known, but 2 major
subtypes exist: RHDV and the antigenic variant RHDVa. Nonpathogenic
strains of RHDV have been identified in wild rabbits. One recent
study suggests that different lineages of RHDV may have repeatedly
emerged as epidemic viruses.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is transmitted by direct contact with
infected animals, as well as on fomites. Rabbits can acquire this
disease through the oral, nasal, or conjunctival routes. Most or all
excretions including urine, feces, and respiratory secretions are
thought to contain virus. Animals may remain infectious for up to a
month. RHDV can also be acquired by exposure to an infected carcass
or hair from an infected animal. Long-term, persistent, or latent
infections have recently been recognized in rabbits. Whether viral
RNA becomes reactivated in these carriers, and under what conditions,
is unknown.

RHDV is readily spread on fomites including contaminated food,
bedding, and water. Flies and other insects are very efficient
mechanical vectors; only a few virions are needed to infect a rabbit
by the conjunctival route. Wild animals can transmit the virus
mechanically. Although virus replication does not seem to occur in
predators or scavengers, these animals can excrete RHDV in feces
after eating infected rabbits.

There is no treatment for RHDV.

Prevention is the best control. Strict biosecurity is essential, and
even then insects may pass the biosecurity barriers.
