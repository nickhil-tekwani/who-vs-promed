A boatload of potatoes shipped from PEI [Prince Edward Island] to
Algeria is being unloaded, at least partially, following reports of
ring rot-infected potatoes on board. The issue 1st came to public
attention in the PEI legislature Thursday [1 Nov 2007]. Agriculture
critic Jim Bagnall pressured the government for information on the
shipment. Few details were forthcoming at that time.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] has confirmed to CBC News
that there are ring rot-infected potatoes on the ship, but the
potatoes in question are from Quebec. Algeria requires that imported
potatoes be free of ring rot.

Produce from PEI was also on board, but standard testing found it to
be free of ring rot, and since it was stored separately on the ship,
it is being unloaded. The fate of the Quebec potatoes is not yet
known. CFIA said the potatoes were shipped before lab results were
returned, and so went out at the exporter's risk.

[Ring rot of potato is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_. It is favoured by cool climates
and is found in parts of North America and also established in
northern and eastern Europe. It is listed as a quarantine pathogen
for the EC by the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
Symptomless natural infection has been reported in sugar beet, and
the bacterium has also been found in sugar beet seed. Many
solanaceous species, including tomato and eggplant, are susceptible
by mechanical inoculation. Symptoms on potato are wilting and
yellowing of leaves, rot of the vascular ring of tubers with emerging
bacterial ooze, and extensive tuber rot followed by internal
hollowing, cracking, and mummification in severe cases. Wilting
symptoms may occur late in the season and are often masked by the
natural senescence of the crop. Tubers with ring rot are often
subjected to secondary invasion by other bacteria and fungi, which
can result in total rot of tubers in the field or in storage.

The ring rot pathogen is spread by infected seed tubers or other
plant material, plant-to-plant contact, soil, and mechanical means
(for example during harvest or grading). The bacteria can survive for
several years on dry surfaces and for over a month in water. They can
overwinter in association with unharvested potatoes or debris from
the previous crop.

Symptom expression occurs at different rates in different host
varieties and is affected by temperature and other environmental
conditions. Yield losses of up to 50 percent have been reported.
However, some varieties hardly ever express symptoms. Ring rot can
pass through one or more field generations without causing symptoms
and latently infected tubers are an important means of spreading the
disease. Laboratory tests are needed to detect latent infections.
Disease management is expensive and includes the use of clean seed
potatoes, cultural practices, and plant hygiene measures before and
after harvest.
