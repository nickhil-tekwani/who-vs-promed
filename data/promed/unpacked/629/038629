Children in Rio Grande do Norte were the main victims of DHF,
according to information from the Hospital Infantil Varela Santiago.
According to infectious disease specialist, Kleber Luz, during the
past year [2006] the Hospital Infantil Varela Santiago attended 30
dengue cases counting classical dengue fever and DHF. This year
[2007], that number has practically tripled, reaching 80 [cases].
However, what is more worrying is that this number relates only to
DHF cases. "We have had dengue cases since 1997, with DHF a rarity;
now, we are in this situation [with a high number of DHF cases]. This
is worrying," he said.
Traditionally, the dengue cases increase during the rainy season.
However, currently the city is not receiving a lot of rain [which
ought to be] sufficient to change the occurrence of dengue [cases].
Thus, according to Kleber, it is not necessary to have rains for the
mosquito [populations] to develop. "Where there are people, there are
mosquitoes. Many houses are without [piped] water and the people
[there] store water in tanks and buckets and that is one of the
reasons. Moreover, this city is flooded with construction [projects],
areas propitious for development of [mosquito breeding] foci," he
said.
According to this doctor, since the city is not living through a
dengue epidemic, there is a false feeling that there are no grade 2
[DHF] cases. "It is worse in that there must be a lot of grade 1
[DHF] cases of the disease at home. All these grades are DHF [cases]"
he affirmed.
According to Kleber, the majority of the ill children are from the
interior and are between 3 and 5 years [of age]. "The disease is more
serious in these children," he affirmed.
The only way to avoid dengue is to not let the mosquitoes breed.
Because of this, it is necessary to eliminate their breeding sites

[2] Rio de Janeiro state

The Secretary of health for the State of Rio [de Janeiro] has
confirmed that a dengue epidemic is occurring in some municipalities
of the state and in some metropolitan areas of the city. The areas
most affected are those of the northern and northeastern part of the
state, such as the Itaperuna municipality and some areas of the
metropolitan region such as the Western zone, Niteroi, and Sao
Goncalo.
The State Secretary of Health has received notification of 60 047
cases of dengue during 2007, which is practically double the number
registered last year [2006] (31 054 [cases]). The [state] capital
registered 22 486 cases of the disease.
The Municipal Secretary of Health is investigating the deaths of 3
people who had dengue symptoms. They were patients in the Hospital
Municipal Salgado Filho and died on 22 Nov 2007, and 12 and 17 Dec
[2007].
Confirmation depends on test results from the [laboratories] of the
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. Since the beginning of this year [2007], 29
people have died of DHF in Rio de Janeiro, 21 of them in the capital.
The Superintendent of Health Surveillance, Victor Berbara, said that
the trend in the numbers of dengue cases is increasing. "Since 2005,
we are tending to have a decline in the incidence of _Aedes aegypti_
, the mosquito vector of dengue [virus], but the number of cases is
increasing, which indicates that there is an increase in infection by
the virus [suggesting that the current levels of that mosquito
population are still high enough to support an epidemic. - Mod.JW]
On Fri 14 Dec [2007] the Municipal Secretary of Health initiated the
"Summer Plan against Dengue" with events to intensify, until March
[2008], educational and field activities in various sectors to avoid
proliferation of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_.

In 2007, 82 percent of the [dengue] cases were recorded in the 1st 5
months of the year. The dengue threat was most serious in the
beginning of the year. The attention of the health authorities has
turned to the behavior of the epidemic in the country during this
period. Most of the cases occurred between January and May [2007].
Although in this past year [2007] there were 200 000 more cases of
the disease registered than in 2006, there is now a perspective that
is a little less gloomy. An analysis of rapid detection of foci of
the dengue [virus] vector, _Aedes aegypti_ , was done at the end of
2007, showing that the index of [mosquito] infestation was less than
that of 2006. This work showed that there was a drop of 17 percent in
areas at risk of a [dengue] epidemic.
Despite this reduction, there are still many reasons to pay attention
to this disease. The analysis shows that 32.6 thousand people live in
municipalities considered at risk of a [dengue] epidemic, which
corresponds to 48 percent of the [total] population. In addition,
this study is a useful instrument for orientation of preventive
actions. In case these measures are not adopted, nothing will stop
the increase in the number of [vector mosquito] breeding sites when
the rains come.
One of the problems detected by this analysis was in relation to the
type of [mosquito] breeding sites found. In the northern and
northeastern regions of the country, most of the _Aedes_ [breeding]
foci were in water tanks and wells used by the population that does
not have a constant water supply. There are no short-term prospects
that this situation will change. The alternative would be to use
well-closed water tanks and use insecticides when there are mosquito
larvae in water storage [containers]. [It is not recommended to treat
drinking water with insecticides, which are toxic. - Mod.JW]
Deaths
------
Apart from controlling the number of [dengue] cases, the program to
combat dengue has an additional challenge to reduce the mortality
rate of this disease. In recent years, the proportion of the number
of deaths has increased. In 2002, when the peak of disease was
highest, 5.5 percent of ill [dengue patients] died. In 2007, the
death rate was 2 times higher. The longer the duration of the
epidemic, the greater the risk of DHF.

[Dengue [virus] transmission in 2007 was not interrupted during the
winter, and is symptomatic, showing that the intensity of [dengue
virus] transmission was increased, and is not due to decline
significantly in 2008. - Mod.LJS
