The European Commission said member states have given the green light
to its proposals to revise certain foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]
measures for Cyprus and the UK.

Cyprus will be allowed to resume exports of pig meat from nearly the
whole island, while the UK will be allowed to dispatch meat and meat
products, although exports of live susceptible animals from Surrey
and its surroundings will still be banned.

The commission said all measures for the UK will elapse on 31 Dec
2007, as long as there are no further outbreaks of the disease in the meantime.

[Allowing Cyprus to resume exports of (unprocessed) pig meat from
nearly the whole island, means -- de facto -- that the EU recognizes
Cyprus as a territory free of circulating FMD virus.

On 6 Nov 2007, Cyprus submitted to the OIE (World Organisation for
Animal health) an "Immediate notification" on an outbreak of FMD
serotype O, manifested clinically in a sheep and goat flock in
Dromolaxia, with 19 cases within the 324-strong flock. The index case
was initially suspected to be bluetongue, but diagnosed later as FMD,
based upon positive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) 3ABC
tests carried out in Cyprus and SNT (seroneutralization test) carried
out at Pirbright. The flock was destroyed. (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6436>).
A follow-up report, dated 13 Nov 2007, notified a 2nd infected flock
in Dromolaxia in a flock comprising 53 goats (no cases) and 42 sheep
(10 cases), informing that "lesions were found in the mouth of lambs
in the sheep farm". This time, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was
added to the testing scheme. The flock was destroyed; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6470>.


ProMED-mail questioned the interpretation of the positive serological
reactions in sheep as being indicative of disease; this, in view of
the unconvincing clinical description, absence of circulating virus,
and negative serological reactions in susceptible cattle and pigs in
the vicinity of the "affected" flocks, combined wit the absence of
any disease signs in these susceptible species. The hypothesis was
raised that past vaccinations could have been the cause of positive
sheep serology.

To sum-up and clear this unusual event, a follow-up or final report
to the OIE deserves to be submitted. - Mod.AS]
