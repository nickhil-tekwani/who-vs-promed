Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (LA-MRSA) has been isolated from bulk milk tanks from 5 geographically dispersed UK farms, suggesting it may be established in British livestock, according to a study today [13 Dec 2012] in Eurosurveillance. Researchers used polymerase chain reaction [PCR] to test about 300 potential MRSA colonies among 1500 samples from bulk milk tanks. 7 tested positive for LA-MRSA, 3 of which were from the same farm, marking the 1st instance of the CC398 strain in UK dairy cattle. The authors conclude, "Although pasteurisation of milk should ensure that CC398 MRSA will not enter the food chain, our finding of LA-MRSA CC398 in dairy cattle has clear public health implications for the UK. Workers on dairy farms, or individuals with regular contact with dairy cows, are likely to have a higher risk of colonisation or infection with LA-MRSA CC398 compared to the general population."

The authors concluded:
"This is the 1st description of LA-MRSA CC398 in food-producing animals in the UK. The ability of this lineage to colonise a wide range of host species, coupled with its zoonotic potential, make this finding of significance to both veterinary and human health. Future surveillance for this LA-MRSA CC398 strain in all food-producing animal species in the UK and the evaluation of occupational risk factors for MRSA carriage and infection should be considered."

Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the key themes in the work programme of OIE's working group for Animal Production and Food Safety (APFSWG).

In 2004 the OIE convened an 'ad hoc Group on Antimicrobial Resistance'. Updates to Terrestrial Code texts recommended by the Group were endorsed by the APFSWG and by the OIE International Committee in 2005. The ad hoc Group also established a 'list of Critically Important Antimicrobials for Veterinary Use', which was endorsed by OIE's international Committee in 2007. This list may be viewed on the OIE site at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/OIE_list_antimicrobials.pdf.

OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2012) currently includes, within chapter 6.7 "Harmonisation of National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance and Monitoring Programmes," the recently updated article 6.7.3 "The development of antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programmes," addressing the following "Zoonotic bacteria":
i) _Salmonella_,
ii) _Campylobacter_,
iii) _Other emerging bacterial pathogens_: "Other emerging bacterial pathogens such as methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), _Listeria monocytogenes_, or others which are pathogenic to humans, may be included in resistance surveillance and monitoring programmes".

The chapter is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/2010/chapitre_1.6.7.pdf.

LA-MRSA poses an occupational risk for those in close contact with livestock, particularly pigs, veal calves, and dairy cattle. Unpasteurised milk may be included in the same category. - Mod.AS
