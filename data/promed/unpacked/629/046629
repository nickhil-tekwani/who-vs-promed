A new region of France has now been hit with highly pathogenic avian flu, as the head of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) says he doesn't expect a US-type outbreak because of different farming methods and lower virus virulence, according to media reports. The OIE, meanwhile, has posted details on 3 of the country's outbreaks, as well as on another outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N6 avian flu in Vietnam.

The new outbreak in France, reported today by Reuters, occurred on a duck farm in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques department in the Aquitaine region, the 1st time that region has had an outbreak in 2015. Other regions affected by the 13 outbreaks of high-path avian flu strains are Dordogne, Landes, Haute-Vienne, and Gers, all in southwestern France.

The farm houses 1500 ducks, and H5N9 was confirmed as the strain, marking the 3rd outbreak involving that strain. Before the fall 2015 outbreak, France had not seen an avian flu outbreak in poultry in 8 years. In addition to H5N9, which until December 2015 had never before been detected in Europe, H5N1 and H5N2 strains have also been confirmed.

France is Europe's top agricultural nation, and the impact of the virus has come at a crucial time for the country's foie gras producers. Demand for the delicacy typically peaks during the year-end holiday season. The country is facing restrictions of its poultry products and live birds from its trading partners, including Japan, France's largest foie gras importer, Reuters noted.

The surge in avian flu outbreaks in France is unusual -- especially given that it involves 3 strains -- but it is unlikely to turn into a crisis like that seen in the United States earlier in 2015, when almost 50 000 000 poultry became infected, OIE Director-General Bernard Vallat, DVM, told Reuters yesterday [10 Dec 2015].

"We are not in a situation like that in the United States, because the breeding methods are different and the strains less virulent," Vallat said.

"Poultry farming in the departments hit is extremely active, notably for foie gras, but finally it did not spread that fast unlike other situations we have known where there were a lot of outbreaks," he said, referring to the US situation.

Vallat also noted that H5N2 and H5N9 have never been found in humans and that the H5N1 strain found in France is different from the Asian strain that has caused hundreds of human cases and deaths in recent years. He also stressed avian flu cannot be transmitted by food.

In 3 separate reports today filed with the OIE, French officials detailed previously reported outbreaks involving H5N9, high-path H5N2, and low-pathogenic H5N2.

The H5N9 outbreak began 18 Nov 2015 and involved a farm with 12 600 broiler chickens, 4000 guinea fowl, 3500 capons, and 960 ducks in the Landes region. Farmers had noticed sudden death in the guinea fowl. Of 21 060 poultry, 400 died from the virus, and the rest were euthanized to contain the outbreak. It was the 2nd H5N9 report filed by French authorities, 2 days after they confirmed a separate outbreak in the same region.

The high-path H5N2 virus struck a farm in the Gers region in an outbreak beginning 27 Nov 2015, according to a second OIE report. The virus killed 250 of 8300 ducks, and the rest were culled. Officials had previously filed reports with the OIE on 2 and 8 Dec 2015 involving the same strain in Dordogne region.

The low-path H5N2 outbreak occurred on a farm in Aveyron region and is not included in the list of 13 outbreaks caused by high-path strains. The virus was detected in a flock of 6120 ducks during routine surveillance. All the birds were destroyed.

[Though according to our data, this is the 1st outbreak caused by HPAI H5N9 (but we stand to be corrected), low-pathogenic H5N9 strains have been previously identified in wild birds. According to the Openflu database (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics - SIB; at http://openflu.vital-it.ch), the following H5N9 viruses have been isolated in the past from wild birds (mallards) in Sweden (2002, 2009) and from chicken (or chicken egg?) in Italy (1997, 1998):

A/mallard/Sweden/49/2002

Additional details of these strains, in particular regarding their pathogenicity, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
