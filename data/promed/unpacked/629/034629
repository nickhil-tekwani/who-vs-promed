A spike in syphilis cases among women living in Mildura [Victoria] has health officials worried the infection will be passed onto babies during pregnancy and at birth. Fresh data compiled by the Department of Health and obtained by NCA NewsWire showed there had been 76 cases of the sexually transmitted infection in the northwest regional Victorian city since [17 Jan 2021]. Of those cases, 50 per cent were in women, while across the rest of the state women only accounted for 11 per cent of infectious syphilis cases.

It sparked health authorities to this week launch a new campaign targeting residents in Mildura -- particularly women -- over fears of congenital syphilis, where the infection is passed from mother to foetus in utero.

The Department of Health figures also showed there had been 12 cases of congenital syphilis in Victoria since 2017. Prior to that there were just 2 cases in the previous 20 years.

Victoria acting deputy chief health officer Dr Mihaela Ivan said the numbers were "of concern" as syphilis could be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy and at birth. "Syphilis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and serious birth defects in the baby," she said. "We are urging both men and women to get tested, as there may be undiagnosed cases in Mildura.

"Anyone planning on having a family should get tested to prevent passing on the syphilis infection."

Dr Ivan urged anyone who was sexually active to get an STI [sexually transmitted infection] test at least every 12 months, warning many STIs had no signs or symptoms. "Testing is crucial to diagnosing the infection," she said. "A blood test to detect syphilis is quick, easy and confidential and early treatment is effective. "If left untreated, STIs can cause long term effects on the body, including infertility."

Melbourne is also seeing an increase of syphilis cases in women; an analysis by Alfred Health's Melbourne Sexual Health Centre released in May showed a 220 per cent spike in infections among females in recent years.

Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital doctors were also reporting a 20-fold increase in people presenting with syphilis-related eye infections.

Despite months of coronavirus lockdown in Victoria, the state still recorded 1453 cases of syphilis last year [2020]. Syphilis cases have risen from 636 cases in 2014 to 1659 cases in 2019.

Despite the lockdown, Dr Ivan urged women not to cancel antenatal appointments and to get tested during pregnancy to reduce the risk of congenital syphilis. "Don't delay any medical appointments -- getting an STI test or a sexual health check-up is a valid reason to leave home during the current COVID-19 restrictions," she said.

Syphilis starts with an appearance of sores or ulcers, before developing into a rash. If untreated, it could eventually cause a brain infection, dementia and blindness. It can be cured with penicillin, but people may not seek treatment because they do not realise they have been infected, as syphilis is often asymptomatic following signs of the initial infection.

The Victorian Government has provided AUD 100 000 [about USD 73 700] to support the launching of the health campaign across Mildura. The campaign will run across social media platforms and in local media, encouraging residents to start talking about syphilis, to get tested, seek treatment, and practice safer sex. It will also work directly with local organisations, Aboriginal communities, multicultural groups, and healthcare providers.

[Mildura is a city of about 33 000 residents in northwest region of the Australian state of Victoria, located on the on the border with the state of New South Wales, 550 km (342 mi) northwest of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria and 400 km (248 mi) northeast of Adelaide, the capital of the state of South Australia; Mildura is noted for its grape production, supplying 80% of Victoria's grapes and for significantly higher than average rates of methamphetamine use (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildura).

Use of methamphetamine has been linked to outbreaks of syphilis in both the US and Canada (see posts listed below). No mention of methamphetamine or other possible driving forces for the increasing rates of syphilis, particularly in women, in Mildura, that is linked to a spike in cases of congenital syphilis. More information on the syphilis outbreak in Mildura would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The news report above also says that an outbreak of syphilis, also particularly in women, is occurring in Melbourne. A prior ProMED post reported on this outbreak in the urban poor in Melbourne's outer suburbs and is associated with an increase in cases of congenital and ocular syphilis (see ProMED post Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert 20210518.8367315).
