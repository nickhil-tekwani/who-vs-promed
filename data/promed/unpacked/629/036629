First Report of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus on Tomato Crops in Greece

Phytopathological Institute, Laboratory of Virology, 14 561 Kifissia,
Greece. Plant Dis. 85:678, 2001; published on-line as D-2001-0330-01N,
2001. Accepted for publication 20 Feb 2001.
In late summer 2000, tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) grown in
greenhouses in Ierapetra, Tympaki, and Chania (Crete) showed leaf curling,
reduced leaf size, yellowing, shortened internodes, and a bushy appearance.
More than 30 ha of tomato greenhouses were affected and the disease
incidence ranged from 15 to 60 [percent with estimated crop losses of over
$500 000. Similar symptoms were observed in tomato samples from Marathon
(Attiki) and Southern Peloponnese. All greenhouses [containing infected
plants were infested with high populations of _Bemisia tabaci_ (Gennadius),
which were also observed outside the greenhouses on several weed [species.
[Symptoms on tomato were similar to those caused by Tomato yellow leaf
curl virus (TYLCV).
The [presumed virus could not be transmitted mechanically but successful
transmission was obtained by grafting onto healthy tomato plants. Over 100
samples of symptomatic tomato plants collected from Crete and southern
Peloponnese gave positive reactions when tested by ELISA using monoclonal
antibodies to TYLCV-European (Adgen Ltd).
The serological results were confirmed by PCR using two pairs of primers,
universal degenerate (1) and MA 13 and MA 17 (2), amplifying different
parts of the virus genome. The restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) analysis (AluI, HaeIII, and TaqI) of the 541 bp amplicon obtained
with the degenerate primers showed patterns similar to TYLCV-IS (Israeli
species). The second pair of primers gave the expected 348 bp product,
which was sequenced.
Sequence comparisons revealed 99% identity with TYLCV-Is (EMBL no. X15656,
X76319). The resulting sequence was at least 97.7% identical to sequences
of TYLCV isolates from the Dominican Republic (EMBL no. AF024715), Cuba
(EMBL no. AJ223505), Portugal (EMBL no. AF105975), Iran (EMBL no. AJ13271),
and Spain (EMBL no. AF071228).
[Similar symptoms appeared for the first time in 1992 in Tymbaki, but
[were limited to very few plants in one glasshouse. However, the cause was
not determined. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TYLCV [genus
Begomovirus in Greece.

[TYLCV is also known to be present and spreading in Spain, Cyprus, Iraq,
Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Turkey, Morocco, Cuba, Portugal, as well
as in the states of Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana in USA. In the proposed
revision by the Geminiviridae Study-Group (Fauquet et al.), 8 distinct
species of TYLCV will be recognized. TYLCV-Israel will be referred to as
TYLCV-IL. - Mod.DH
