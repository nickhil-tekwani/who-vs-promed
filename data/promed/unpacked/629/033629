In different reports, United Nations (UN)-based groups described more downstream impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including setbacks in schooling in South Asia and women's employment and maternal health in Latin America.

Global health officials have warned that uncontrolled spread of the virus and lockdown measures will have wide-reaching effects, and earlier reports have shed light on a host of worrisome trends, including those related to childhood vaccinations and health screening for other medical conditions.

UNICEF said yesterday [8 Sep 2021] that school closures led to sharp inequities in learning experiences among children in South Asia, even though governments and related groups took major steps to expand remote learning. The research team based its findings on an analysis of data from India, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka (https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/repeated-school-closures-due-covid-19-leading-learning-loss-and-widening-inequities).

COVID-19-related school closures in the region interrupted learning for 434 million children. The group's survey of students and parents found that in India, 80% of children ages 14-18 reported lower levels of learning during remote instruction than in in-person learning. They also saw similar lapses in learning in Sri Lankan primary school students.

UNICEF said girls, kids from disadvantaged households, and children with disabilities experienced the biggest challenges with remote learning.

George Laryea-Adjei, UNICEF's regional director for South Asia, said even when families had access to technology, children weren't always able to access it. In India, 42% of children ages 6-13 had no access to devices that could support online learning.

Student-teacher engagement, known to impact learning success, also suffered, with most students reporting little or no contact with teachers when schools were closed.

Laryea-Adjei said safe school reopenings must be a top priority for all governments, but more investments are needed to ensure that teachers can adapt to all situations. UNICEF also called for teachers to assess learning level and ensure a "catch-up" period, school districts to prioritize teacher vaccination and offer teachers guidance on engaging with students with different learning modes, and for governments and other groups to expand investments in education.

In another related development, a UN Development Program (UNDP) analysis of COVID-19-related employment patterns in parts of Latin America found that working mothers faced the biggest burden, according to Reuters. The group found that economic sectors hit hardest during the pandemic -- tourism, commerce, and education -- are largely staffed with women (https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-latam-women/during-pandemic-rebound-latin-americas-working-mothers-fall-behind-idUSKBN2G50WY).

They also note that gender imbalances that keep women in unpaid domestic work and caregiving, plus long school closures, also complicated the picture for working mothers during the pandemic. The UNDP found that mothers in 2-parent households were least likely to return to work as economies reopened, but single mothers experienced a stronger rebound in employment.

Meanwhile, the head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) at a briefing yesterday [8 Sep 2021] said the pandemic threatens to wipe away 20 years of hard-fought progress to reduce maternal mortality. Carissa Etienne, MBBS, PAHO's director, said 2600 pregnant women in the Americas have died from the virus, and she urged pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Mexico and Colombia are among the worst-hit countries, where COVID has become the leading cause of maternal death in 2021. Three countries -- Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil -- account for half of the region's deaths in pregnant women, she said. Etienne also warned that the pandemic threatens healthcare for pregnant women and newborns and that the disruptions have become more widespread in 2021.

"We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes."

"Interpretation: Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritise safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises." - Mod.LK]

[2] Africa: variants
Date: Thu 9 Sep 2021
Source: Bloomberg News via News 24 [edited]
https://www.news24.com/fin24/Economy/pandemic-at-risk-of-worsening-with-proliferation-of-variants-in-africa-scientists-say-20210910


The proliferation of COVID-19 variants in Africa, partly attributed to the low rates of vaccination on the continent, could lead to vaccine-evading mutations that complicate attempts to end the pandemic, a group of 112 African and 25 international organizations said.

A study of genomes from 33 African nations and 2 "overseas territories," published in the journal Science on Thursday [9 Sep 2021], tracks the evolution of the pandemic across the continent and the emergence of a number of so-called Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest. One of those, beta, spread around the globe earlier this year [2021] and rendered some vaccines partially ineffective.

The "slow rollout of vaccines in most African countries creates an environment in which the virus can replicate and evolve," the organizations said. "This will almost certainly produce additional VOCs, any of which could derail the global fight against COVID-19."

While more than half of the population of the USA and over 60% of people living in the European Union are fully vaccinated, just 3.2% of Africa's 1.2 billion people have been fully dosed. That's resulted in a severe 3rd wave of infections in many countries and the emergence of a new variant in South Africa known as C.1.2.

The study showed that COVID-19 was introduced to most African nations from Europe, and in turn the continent has exported the variants it spawned back to European countries. Different strains of the virus spread around the continent mainly from South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya -- 3 of the African countries with the strongest links to the wider world.

The beta variant, identified in South Africa in December [2020], quickly raced as far north as the Democratic Republic of Congo, most likely along the road and rail routes that connect the country's ports with the sub-continent, the study said.

The research is the 1st major output by Africa's leading scientists in an effort to increase the continent's ability to produce and analyze genomic data. Two variants in West Africa and East Africa, known as B.1.525 and A.23.1, need to be contained, it said.

"There is strong evidence that both of these VOIs are rising in frequency in the regions where they have been detected, which suggests that they may possess higher fitness than other variants," the scientists said. "Although more focused research on the biological properties of these VOIs is needed to confirm whether they should be considered VOCs, it would be prudent to assume the worst."

The study was done in cooperation with the World Health Organization and the Africa Centres for Disease Control & Prevention. "If the virus keeps evolving on the African continent, this will become a global problem," said Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatics professor who helped put together the study and runs gene-sequencing institutions at 2 South African universities. "It is our moral duty to try to protect Africa and the world."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"The progression of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Africa has so far been heterogeneous and the full impact is not yet well understood. Here, we describe the genomic epidemiology using a dataset of 8746 genomes from 33 African countries and 2 overseas territories. We show that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations predominantly from Europe, which diminished following the early introduction of international travel restrictions. As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and spread within the continent of many variants of concern and interest, such as B.1.351, B.1.525, A.23.1 and C.1.1. Although distorted by low sampling numbers and blind spots, the findings highlight that Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a source for new variants."

Conclusions
-----------
"As with most other parts of the world, the success of genomic surveillance in Africa requires more samples being tested for COVID-19, higher proportions of positive samples being sequenced within days of sampling, and persistent analyses of these sequences for concerning signals such as (i) the presence of novel non-synonymous mutations at genomic sites associated with pathogenicity and immunogenicity, (ii) evidence of positive selection at codon sites where non-synonymous mutations are observed, and (iii) evidence of lineage expansions. In spite of limited sampling, Africa has identified many of the VOCs and VOIs that are being transmitted across the world. Detailed characterization of the variants and their impact on vaccine-induced immunity is of extreme importance. If the pandemic is not controlled in Africa, we may see the production of vaccine escape variants that may profoundly affect the population in Africa and across the world." - Mod.LK]

[3] mRNA vaccines: no miscarriage risk
Date: Thu 9 Sep 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/covid-19-vaccines-dont-raise-miscarriage-risk-3-studies-show


Pregnant women who received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine were not at higher risk for miscarriage than their unvaccinated counterparts, according to a trio of new US studies.

In the 1st study, published yesterday [8 Sep 2021] in JAMA, researchers from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) surveillance network used diagnostic and procedure codes and electronic health records to identify and assign gestational ages of miscarriages and ongoing pregnancies from 15 Dec 2020 to 28 Jun 2021 (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784193). The VSD is a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 9 health systems that represents about 3% of the US population.

Among 105 446 pregnancies, 13 160 miscarriages occurred, while 92 286 pregnancies were ongoing. Of all pregnant women, 7.8% had received at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine, 6.0% received one or more doses of the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and 0.5% received the Johnson & Johnson one-dose adenovirus vaccine before 20 weeks' gestation.

Eight percent of women with ongoing pregnancies had received a COVID-19 vaccine by 28 days, compared with 8.6% of women who experienced miscarriages. The proportion of women 35-49 years who miscarried was higher than the proportion with ongoing pregnancies in that age-group (38.7% vs 22.3%).

Overall, miscarriages were no more likely within 28 days of vaccination compared with ongoing pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio, 1.02), regardless of type of vaccine and gestational age. "Despite limitations, these data can be used to inform vaccine recommendations and to counsel patients," the study authors concluded.

Similarly, in a letter yesterday [8 Sep 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), CDC scientists enrolled 2456 women who were part of the agency's COVID-19 vaccine safety pregnancy registry (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113891).

Of all participants, 2022 reported ongoing pregnancies at 20 weeks' gestation, 165 reported miscarriages (154 of whom miscarried before 14 weeks), 188 completed 2nd-trimester follow-up before 20 weeks' gestation, 16 reported other pregnancy outcomes (e.g., induced abortion, ectopic or molar pregnancies), and 65 were lost to follow-up.

Most participants (77.3%) were at least 30 years old, 78.3% were White, and 88.8% were healthcare workers. A little over half the women (52.7%) had received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

In the primary analysis, the cumulative risk of miscarriage from 6 to less than 20 weeks' gestation was 14.1%, while an analysis using direct maternal age standardization to the reference population showed a 12.8% risk. The risk of miscarriage rose with increasing maternal age.

A sensitivity analysis that assumed that all 65 women with recent contact during their 1st trimester had a miscarriage, the cumulative risk of miscarriage from 6 to less than 20 weeks' gestation was 18.8%. The risk was slightly lower after age standardization, at 18.5%.

"As compared with data from 2 historical cohorts that represent the lower and upper ranges of spontaneous-abortion risk, the cumulative risks of spontaneous abortion [miscarriage] from our primary and sensitivity analyses were within the expected risk range," the researchers concluded. "These findings add to the accumulating evidence about the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy."

And in response to a letter yesterday [8 Sep 2021] in NEJM, a separate group of CDC researchers updated its analysis of 2456 pregnant women who received 1 or 2 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine before conception or 20 weeks' gestation (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMx210016).

Their preliminary findings, originally published on 17 Jun 2021, were based on telephone follow-up of the participants through 30 Mar 2021. The letter writer, Hong Sun, PhD, of Dedalus Healthcare in Antwerp, Belgium, had pointed out that the researchers had erroneously included 700 participants vaccinated with their 1st dose after 20 weeks' gestation, arriving at a risk of miscarriage by week 20 of 12.6%. "This calculated metric is misleading and does not reflect the real risk of spontaneous abortion," Sun wrote.

The researchers agreed with Sun's assessment. Since the original analysis, the researchers had completed follow-up for the remaining pregnancies in those vaccinated before 20 weeks' gestation and enrolled more participants in the pregnancy registry.

They then used life-table methods to perform an updated analysis to determine the cumulative risk of miscarriage from 6 to less than 20 weeks' gestation. The new risk estimate was only slightly higher. "The estimated risks (14.1% overall and 12.8% in age-standardized analyses) are consistent with the risks of spontaneous abortion reported in the general population," the authors wrote.

[4] Israel: cases in children
Date: Wed 8 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/study-says-alpha-variant-doubled-covid-cases-israeli-kids


The SARS-CoV-2 alpha (B117) variant spread faster and more efficiently than previous strains among children 9 years and younger in Israel in late 2020 and early 2021, even amid the concurrent immunization of adults against COVID-19, according to an observational study yesterday [7 Sep 2021] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783851).

A team led by a researcher at Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel in Petah Tikva compared the publicly available daily data of 21 615 children who tested positive for COVID-19 from 1 Aug to 2 Oct 2020 with those of 50 811 children who tested positive from 3 Dec 2020 to 3 Feb 2021. The researchers adjusted weekly incidence rates according to the number of COVID-19 tests performed.

Coronavirus transmission rates doubled -- but hospitalization rates dropped -- after alpha emerged in December 2020 and quickly unseated earlier strains as the dominant virus. The same scenario occurred in adults, with increased contagiousness but not severity. As Israel rolled out COVID-19 vaccines to adults, alpha came to account for 80% of cases.

The slopes of weekly adjusted incidence curves for children younger than 9 years were significantly higher in December 2020 to February 2021 than those in August to October 2020 (84.4 vs 39.1). The rate ratio (RR) of highest to lowest weekly incidence was also higher in the latter period (6.75 vs 3.62).

From December 2020 to April 2021, 15.7% of secondary cases identified through contact tracing involved children 9 years and younger (RR, 2.24) compared with 7.5% from February to November 2020.

A total of 0.98% of children who tested positive for COVID-19 from August to October 2020 were hospitalized compared with 0.52% during December 2020 to February 2021 (RR, 0.53). However, the percentage of hospitalized children who became severely ill or died was similar in both periods (6.5% in the earlier period and 6.9% in the latter; RR, 0.99).

Israel went into lockdown twice over the study period, from 18 Sep to 13 Oct 2020 and from 8 Jan to 7 Feb 2021. Schools closed from 14 Sep to 1 Nov 2020 and from 8 Jan to 15 Feb 2021. The country's COVID-19 immunization effort began on 20 Dec 2020, vaccinating 57% of adults with the 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by 3 Feb 2021.

The researchers noted that the rapid spread of alpha despite the expected mitigating effect of mass vaccination of adults in Israel underscores the importance of making COVID-19 vaccine available for young children. "Nonpharmacologic measures such as lockdown and school closure could not account for the difference in transmission since they were used during both periods," they wrote.

While the authors acknowledged that factors other than alpha may have contributed to the rapid coronavirus spread, they urged action to protect children. "These findings suggest that health authorities in different regions should anticipate this occurrence and implement measures to reduce spread in young children both in schools and at home," they wrote.

[In the past 24 hours, 15 countries, including the USA (160 748), UK (37 717), Brazil (30 891), Iran (26 821), India (24 148), Turkey (23 846), Philippines (22 734), Malaysia (19 307), Russia (18 380), Thailand (16 031), Mexico (15 876), Germany (14 228), Japan (12 730), Viet Nam (12 420), and France (10 969), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 10 880 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 7 Sep 2021 to late 8 Sep 2021). There appears to be a weekend-related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 59 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 59 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 4.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 10.3% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 224.04 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.62 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
