Mass mushroom poisoning, fatal, Voronezh region, Russia
-------------------------------------------------------
47 people have suffered from mushroom poisoning in the Voronezh region, 8 of
whom, including one child, died. As announced yesterday by the State
Epidemiological Surveillance Centre of Voronezh region, 35 more mushroom
pickers are in critical condition in hospitals.
The rainy summer has brought disturbing messages about poisonous "gifts of the
woods". The most frequent source of mushroom poisoning is the death cap
[_Amanita phalloides_ - NP], because of the ignorance of the difference between
edible and poisonous mushrooms. Naturally, most of the victims -- 37 of 47 --
were inhabitants of the regional center [Voronezh - Mod.NP]; country dwellers
understand mushrooms better. [See a photo of _A. phalloides at:

Physicians ask the population to not collect mushrooms at all and to not use
wild mushrooms in food. Throughout this region their sale has been forbidden.

[This epidemic of mushroom poisonings is quite large and repeats the sad events
of 1999, when in Voronezh 357 persons were poisoned with mushrooms and 39 died.
