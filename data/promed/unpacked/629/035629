I have been reliably informed by 2 veterinarians in Texas in a position to know that anthrax has been confirmed on 25 Sep 2013 by TVMDL [Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory] in 2 sable antelope in an exotic deer ranch near Barksdale, Edwards County. This is on Route 55 between Uvalde and Rocksprings. The word is that some 50 animals have died, but specific details are unavailable. The Texas Animal Health Commission is handling it as per standard operating procedures for this disease in Texas.

If this information is correct, the 1st cases would have been in early September [2013], and the ranch initially took minimal precautions. Animals are curious and will check out dead companions, and any spilt blood will be very infectious to any licking tongues -- which is why one should burn carcasses as soon as possible along with any bloody soil.

I know the area, and it is rare to see anthrax cases east of Route 55 on the Edwards Plateau. There is more cover and trees on the west side and it is very open and dry on the east side. This means that the wind speed is higher in this open territory -- which is unattractive to tabanid flies.

Checking with my deer ranchers and gossip mongers, this is the 1st anthrax outbreak in Texas this year [2013]. Up until recently they have been suffering from drought. Recent rains have either been modest or flood-worthy -- they have had 12 inches in Falfurrias, Brooks County, in a couple of weeks.
