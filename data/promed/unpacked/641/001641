At least 350 sheep have died from anthrax poisoning on a property near Nyngan. NSW [New South Wales] Department of Primary Industries confirmed biosecurity measures had been put in place on a Central West property after a large number of livestock deaths. These included restricted animal movements, vaccination of stock, carcass disposal and decontamination.

This comes after a number of major outbreaks in southern Queensland recently, with 120 head of cattle killed from a soil disturbance in March 2017 and another 30 sporadic deaths from October 2017 to January 2018. In 2013, dozens of cattle were killed on two properties near Moree.

Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the disturbance of soil-borne bacteria and can kill sheep, cattle, horses, pigs and other livestock instantly.

Recent research identified the 'anthrax belt', previously from Moree and Walgett to the Victorian border from Corowa to Deniliquin, had expanded further north into central southern Queensland [see URL for a map of Australia showing the extent of this anthrax belt. Ref. Anthrax distribution in Australia from Barro AS, Fegan M, Moloney B, et al. (2016)].

A NSW DPI spokesperson said there was an increased risk of anthrax when feed was short and animals were grazing close to the ground. "It is strongly recommended that all livestock be vaccinated annually against anthrax," they said. Any suspected cases of anthrax should be reported to Local Land Service on 1300 795 299 or DPI on 1800 675 888.

[Nygan is in north central New South Wales; see: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/02/Nyngan.html. Nyngan is a very flat area and subject to flooding.

A number as 350 ovine anthrax deaths is way over the usual anthrax odds, even though such outbreaks tend to be noticed late as single sheep deaths may be ignored. I think we can assume that the recent extreme hot weather in Australia will have had a significant negative effect on their normal innate resistance to infections. - Mod.MHJ
