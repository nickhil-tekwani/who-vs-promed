"New Strain of AIDS Virus Discovered in Africa"
Washington Post (09/01/98) P. A2; Weiss, Rick
French researchers have discovered a rare, new HIV strain that can avoid
detection with standard screening tests. The strain was found in a
40-year-old Cameroonian woman who died of AIDS complications in 1995. The
strain has only been found in three other cases, all in Cameroon.
According to lead researchers Francois Simon and Francoise Brun-Vezinet of
the Bichat Hospital, the strain is related to both common HIV and SIV
strains. Following analysis of the woman's blood in Paris, researchers
observed that the virus belonged to neither group M -- the predominant
group -- or group O.
They also noticed that the new strain had hallmarks of SIV. The scientists,
who report their findings in the September issue of Nature Medicine, then
tested 700 other frozen blood samples from people in Cameroon, finding that
three other HIV samples matched the woman's.
The HIV variant does not appear to have any selective advantage that would
cause it to spread at a different rate than the predominant strains.
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, called the new strain an "interesting curiosity" and
said it was unlikely that the new strain would pose a public health threat.

be wrong. - Mod.JW]
