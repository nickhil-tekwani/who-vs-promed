Fears over sugarcane disease
---------------------------------
An exotic disease is threatening the future of the Queensland sugar
industry after being found on a farm in the state's southeast.
Queensland's Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPIF) today
[Mon 12 Jun 2006] confirmed sugarcane smut was found in the Childers area
on Thursday [8 Jun 2006].
The farm has been quarantined, and eradication of the infestation has
started, as has a surveillance program in a 10-15 km radius from the
property and in other sugarcane areas.
DPIF general manager plant biosecurity Chris Adriaansen said sugarcane smut
was one of the sugarcane industry's "major nasty diseases."
The AUD 2 billion [USD 1.5 billion] Queensland sugar industry, which is
still recovering from Cyclone Larry, which ravaged farms in March 2006,
accounts for 95 percent of the Australian crop.
"It infects the plant and severely stunts its growth, so you end up with a
significant loss in production," Mr. Adriaansen said.
"The worse case scenario is that ... we could end up with the entire crop
being affected, having a significant impact on production and productivity.
The wind-borne disease is usually found in South America and Africa. In
1997-98 it was detected in the Ord River area of Western Australia, which
produces less then one percent of the nation's crop, but has been largely
contained.
It is the 1st case of sugarcane smut in eastern Australia.
Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries Tim Mulherin said
the response to the disease has been "fast and efficient."
He said a control plan developed by the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations
(BSES) with assistance from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection
Service (AQIS) has been activated.
"Under the plan, a BSES task force has begun tracing all movements of cane
and machinery from the suspect property and has commenced a survey of
neighboring farms," Mr. Mulherin said.
"The property has been placed under quarantine under the Plant Protection
Act, prohibiting the movement of any host plants from the property as well
as the movement of any machinery or other items which have been in contact
with sugarcane. BSES, AQIS and my department are working closely with the
sugar industry to ensure the outbreak is eradicated or contained as quickly
as possible."

[The crop plant sugarcane, _Saccharum officinarum_, develops symptoms of
the disease smut when infected by the fungus _Ustilago scitaminea_.
Sugarcane smut was 1st noted in South Africa in 1877. The disease is
sometimes referred to as "culmicolous" smut of sugarcane because it affects
the stalk of the cane. At one time or another, sugarcane smut has been
important in nearly every sugarcane growing country in the world. Australia
has been a major exception, since the disease was present only in western
Australia, a minor production area. The current report extends the
distribution to Queensland and therefore eastern Australia, the major
sugarcane production area. This will be considered a serious new problem
for their industry.
Sugarcane smut does not always pose a serious problem where it occurs.
However, smut may remain unnoticed for years, then quickly devastate large
areas of susceptible varieties. Smut can cause significant tonnage losses
as well as juice quality losses. Disease development is dependent on the
environmental conditions and the resistance of the sugarcane varieties grown.
The use of resistant varieties is the best approach to smut control. There
is a strong genetic basis for resistance, and resistant varieties have been
readily available and used to control outbreaks of smut in several countries.
Using disease-free seed cane is also very important for disease control.
Care should be taken, because this disease can be latent and show up only
after planting.
There are no previous postings on sugarcane smut in ProMED-mail. The
postings listed are for other diseases of sugarcane.
