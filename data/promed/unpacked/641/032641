Foot-and-mouth disease on hog farm in Taiwan's [Taoyuan]
--------------------------------------------------------
Taiwan's TVBS television station reports that agricultural
authorities confirmed foot-and-mouth Disease [FMD] on a hog farm in
[Taoyuan].

On 9 Jun 2009, the farm's owner reported symptoms of FMD in more than
30 hogs. Subsequent testing confirmed FMD. Agricultural authorities
asked the farmer to strengthen immunization. The outbreak has not
affected other hog farms. Authorities stipulated that the affected
hog farm may not sell pork for [at least] 2 weeks, until passing
further tests.

[An immediate notification on the above outbreak was submitted to the
OIE on Tue 23 Jun 2009, by Dr Kwo-Ching Huang, chief veterinary
officer and deputy director general, Bureau of Animal and Plant
Inspection Quarantine, Council of agriculture, Executive Yuan,
Taipei, Chinese Taipei. The location given is Dayuan township,
Taoyuan; the notification includes the following Epidemiological
comments:

In order to ensure the eradication of FMD virus, Chinese Taipei uses
non-vaccinated pigs as sentinel animals on every farm. The prefecture
animal disease control competent authority found 37 pigs on a farm
showing clinical signs consistent with FMD. Samples for serological
test and virus isolation were collected and sent to the national
laboratory. The laboratory confirmed positive results for NSP
(non-structural protein) and negative for virus isolation and RT-PCR
respectively. A total of 23 farms within 3-km (2-mi) radius of the
index farm have been under vigilant monitoring and no clinical or
serological evidence of infection has been found. The differentiation
of serotype is underway. See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8217>.

Previous outbreaks, similarly affecting sentinel animals, had
occurred in Taiwan on 18 Feb 2009 and on 27 Mar 2009. A
