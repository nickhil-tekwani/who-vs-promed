Residents being treated after cat tests positive for rabies
-----------------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 Beaufort County residents who came
in contact with a stray cat are under the care of
a physician after the cat tested positive for
rabies, the South Carolina Department of Health
and Environmental Control said today.

"The stray cat had been in the Lady's Island area
for some months and was being fed by several
people. The cat became ill and was taken to a
veterinarian," said Sue Ferguson of DHEC's Bureau
of Environmental Health. "The cat was euthanized
and tested positive for rabies."

Ferguson said once the rabies virus reaches the
brain, the disease is fatal to humans and
animals, so the people are receiving preventive
inoculations. According to Ferguson, anyone
bitten, scratched or otherwise exposed to the
saliva of a rabid animal must undergo immediate
measures to stop the virus from reaching the brain.

This is the 6th confirmed rabid animal in
Beaufort County in 2008. Last year [2007], there
were no rabid animals confirmed in the county. In
2007, there were 162 confirmed cases of rabies in
animals in South Carolina. So far this year,
there have been 103 confirmed cases in animals in the state.

Skunk in attack tests positive for rabies
-----------------------------------------
Health officials say a skunk that attacked a
local man's dog on Harmon Road has tested positive for rabies.

The positive rabies test was confirmed Tuesday
[19 Aug 2008] by state officials. It is the 2nd
positive rabies test for the Bennington area this
year, but the first since January. A raccoon
tested positive on 11 Jan 2008. So far in 2008,
50 animals have tested positive for rabies across the state.

Rabies is a fatal viral disease found mainly in
wildlife -- especially raccoons, foxes, bats,
skunks and woodchucks -- but can infect domestic
animals and humans. Hundreds of cases of animal
rabies have been reported throughout Vermont
since 1992 and the outbreak will continue to be a
problem for many years, according to Dr. Bob
Johnson, the Vermont state public health veterinarian.

The disease is mainly transmitted by a bite. Rare
non-bite exposures can occur if wet infectious
saliva or nervous tissue contacts a fresh open
wound or the eyes, nose or mouth. Rabies virus is
not found in blood, urine, feces or skunk spray.

Johnson said it is not possible to tell if an
animal has rabies just by looking at it as rabid
animals may seem normal, lethargic or aggressive.
Usually there is a change in normal behavior, he said.

Any animal wounded by a wild animal that is not
available for testing must be regarded as having
been exposed to rabies, Johnson said. A booster
shot should be considered for a currently
vaccinated domestic pet with wounds of unknown
origin. An unvaccinated domestic pet should be
immediately vaccinated and kept under the owner's
control and observation for 6 months, according to Johnson.

Bennington Health Inspector Larry McLeod said
state and local officials wanted to inform the
public of the positive rabies test because it
means more rabid animals could be in the area.

"The one could have come from a family where they
exposed each other, or this could be a lone case.
Usually when there's one out there is more around
the area," McLeod said. "There's a good chance
there could be a family out there of rabid skunks."

In May [2008], a groundhog attacked a woman and
her dog, but the groundhog was killed by police and not tested for rabies.

[The first article does not tell us, but
hopefully the exposed people are being treated
with post-exposure prophylaxis. Neither does this
article tell us what strain of rabies the cat
had. In addition, it would seem prudent to
recommend that owners be reminded to have their pets vaccinated.

The 2nd article does not tell us the strain of
strain of rabies either. Likewise, the condition
of the dog, or whether or not it was vaccinated
against the disease is not conveyed here. Likely
the dog is quarantined but it is not stated.
Again, it would be prudent to remind animal
owners to get their pets vaccinated against rabies. ­ Mod.TG
