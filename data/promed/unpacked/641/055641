An outbreak of hepatitis E virus [HEV] in [Chattogram] city's Halishahar and Agrabad areas for the last 3 months has put the lives of the residents at high risk. According to sources in the area, at least 3 people died in the last week since 17 Jun 2018, while over 300 people have been affected in the last 3 months.

It is suspected that there might have been leakage in [Chattogram] Water Supply and Sewage Authority (CWASA) pipeline. "We have heard that the CWASA pipeline and sewerage line have mingled during the road development works in the area," said a family member of an affected person, adding, "The authorities should check it well."

Dr Selim Akter Chowdhury, chief medical officer of [Chattogram] City Corporation (CCC), confirmed to The Daily Star that 3 people in Halishahar area died due to acute hepatitis in the last week [week of 18 Jun 2018]. According to [Chattogram] Civil Surgeon (CCS) office sources, over 300 people infected by HEV were given treatment in Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease in Fauzderhat area of [Chattogram] since April 2018.

Under this circumstance, a team from Institute of Infectious Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) visited Halishahar area and collected blood samples from 25 affected people on May 3, said CCS, adding that they also collected the sample of drinking water.

Contacted, Dr SM Ali Haider, assistant professor of Gastroenterology of [Chattogram] Medical College Hospital, said people are infected by hepatitis E virus through water and food. "In most cases, supporting treatment as well as complete rest and taking pure water can cure a patient, but sometimes it may turn fatal," he said. A patient out of 100 may die in HEV infection," he added.

Agrabad and Halishahar areas regularly go under water during high tide, and so the underground water tanks of the houses may be contaminated with tidal water, said Dr Azizur Rahaman Siddique, [Chattogram] Civil Surgeon. Tidal water is contaminated in many ways including industrial effluents and human waste, he said.

Contacted, AKM Fazlullah, managing director of [Chattogram] Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) also held the tidal water responsible for the outbreak of jaundice in Agrabad and Halishahar areas. He denied the allegation of presence of HEV in water supplied by CWASA. "If CWASA water was contaminated by HEV, people residing in 80 percent areas of the city would have been affected," he said

Fazlullah, however, said they regularly check the pipeline of CWASA for leakage, but "no such incident" was traced so far in the areas.

CCC chief medical officer Selim Akter Chowdhury, however, said he asked his officials to find out the reason of the death of people in the areas. "I have heard that they were suffering from jaundice. We are looking into it," he said.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries is zoonotic and does not generally cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. - Mod.LL
