[The following review on BTV-8 in Germany has been submitted in response to
ProMED-mail's request (in posting 20080306.0916) for field-collected data,
in particular relating to the effect of the BTV-8 upon fertility and
embryonal development/pathology in bovines and ovines. Sabine Zentis'
exemplary contribution is gratefully acknowledged. - Mod.AS]

Suspected effect of maternal infection with BTV-8 on calves born during the
calving season 2007/2008 in an infected area:

Field observations
------------------
In the Aachen/Duren region of Germany [SW North Rhine Westphalia, map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?action=selmap&country=164_9011_5&language=1>],
infection with BTV-8 was 1st confirmed in August 2006. During the 1st year
the disease was mainly detected in cattle as they are the dominant species
compared to sheep.

Due to the uncertainties surrounding the official disease strategies the
cases notified can be described as the "tip of the iceberg". Seroprevalence
during the winter months 2006/2007 can't be determined as no wide-scale
screening was performed and only severe clinical cases in cattle were
investigated, confirmation of BTV usually made by blood test (antibody ELISA).

From very limited data available (establishment of sentinel herds),
seroprevalence may be estimated to have been 3-60 per cent within herds,
averaging 26 per cent after the 1st year of the outbreak. Results from 8
dairy farms sampled in 2006 were the following (positive/sampled): 1/30;
5/30/; 12/30; 12/30; 2/30; 8/30; 16/27; 5/30.

No exceptional cases of abortions, malformed or stillborn calves were
noticed/reported during the said period.

Bluetongue reappeared since June 2007 in the said region on a much wider
scale than during 2006. Direct losses in cattle herds, associated with
BTV-8 infection, were notified to the authorities on a daily basis,
certainly triggered off by the declared policy to compensate farmers for
cattle that died or had to be euthanized following confirmed infection.

During 2007, 5120 heads of cattle in North Rhine Westphalia had to be
destroyed or died due to bluetongue, and were compensated jointly by the
government and the "Tierseuchenkasse" (compulsory animal disease insurance)
at 7.7 million euro.

Blood tests screened for BTV antibodies during routine sampling in the said
region but on different holdings, in December 2007/January 2008, showed the
following results (positive/sampled):
a. In 8 dairy farms: 92/120; 72/115; 101/101; 28/28;17/18; 6/8;45/60;102/115.
b. In 36 beef farms: 18/39; 11/11; 6/6; 8/25; 52/52; 2/2; 6/6; 29/29; 8/8;
16/16; 19/21; 18/18; 5/5; 16/16; 0/2; 4/4; 31/31; 5/5; 31/32; 15/15; 7/7;
4/4; 1/1; 12/12; 81/82; 35/36; 4/4; 18/18; 21/21; 16/16; 8/8; 3/3; 8/8;
8/8; 9/10; 15/15.

Thus, seroprevalence of close to 100 per cent was seen in cattle kept on
straw bedding with access to pasture (group b, mainly beef cattle) while
seroprevalence in cattle on farms, where animals were kept on slats/liquid
slurry systems (group a, mainly dairy cattle), with no or only limited
access to pasture, showed an average seroprevalence of 70 per cent, ranging
from 32-89 per cent. [The difference between the 2 management systems has
been interpreted by the author as an expression of the rate of exposure of
the animals to the vector rather than to their production line or
respective breeds. - Mod.AS]

Since autumn 2007, a massive increase of abortions, stillborn or weak
calves as well as fertility problems, have been experienced.

In the absence (or, at least, being unaware of such) of a methodic,
thorough veterinary investigation of individual cases, the following
information, collected in the field, is hereby reported, while indicating
that no clear evidence is available to validate the 8 described cases as
resulting from BTV-8 infection. On the other hand, in several cases the
involvement of other known teratogenic agents has been ruled out.

[For the detailed descriptions of 8 bovine neonates with changes suspected
to be related to fetal BTV-8 infection, including their pictures, the
reader is referred to the online communication at
<http://members.aol.com/cvlonghorns/Mat_infec_BTV8.pdf>.-Mod.AS]

The observations described are representative for the problems occurring on
cattle farms in the BTV outbreak region with regard to foetal abnormalities
since 2007. So far, no investigation has been instigated by the national
authorities to establish the exact reason for the [increased, above normal]
rate of malformed, stillborn or weak calves born on holdings with a known
history of bluetongue infection.

In the absence of other agents with known teratogenic effects, the
involvement of BTV-8 can not be disputed [see comment. - Mod. AS] but
thorough, epidemiological investigations on farm, as well as infection
trials are urgently needed to understand how the bluetongue virus BTV-8 is
distributed in the animal during different stages of pregnancy and which
tissues are the main target. The recent finding in imported heifers in
Northern Ireland, leading to the suspicion that in utero infected calves
can be born viable and act as virus reservoir for the vector Culicoides, is
another worrying development that needs immediate investigation.

[Sabine Zentis has bred longhorn cattle since 1989 at the epicenter of the
BTV-8 epizootic, affected since its earliest stages in 2006. Its location
can be found in the maps included in the report at the above URL.

The data collected and discussed by her on location are very valuable and,
in fact, pioneering. We can't but share her wish for enhanced scientific
efforts, in field and laboratory, to investigate the BTV-8 situation in
Germany and the other infected countries. Similarly important is having the
findings published without delay, to allow timely application of
conclusions and recommendations. The issue is not a theoretic one;
livelihood and the very existence of farmers are at stake.

Field observations from other regions/countries would be welcomed.

As to the teratogenic and other changes in bovine (and ovine) foeti: though
the involvement of BTV-8 in evoking such changes seems likely, there is
need for laboratory confirmation in addition to circumstantial evidence.
When arthrogrypotic, CNS and other embryonal changes were observed in
numerous calves, lambs and kids born in northern Israel in autumn 1969,
bluetongue virus was the first and main suspect; however, eventually
another virus (Akabane) was found (1975) to be the villain.

Infection in different stages of pregnancy will induce different anatomical
changes and different immune responses, expressed by different serological
findings in the neonate. Again, investigational effort is in urgent need. -
