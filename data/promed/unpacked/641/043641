CLUSTER OF GASTROENTERITIS/PANCREATITIS? - TEXAS
================================================
The Texas Department of Health recently investigated three patients
with gastroenteritis/pancreatitis. The patients resided in the
Houston-Galveston area (within 50 miles of each other). They are not
acquainted and have no identified common exposures. They were
hospitalized at three different hospitals. None had a previous
history of gallstone disease. None are alcoholics.
Initial amylase and lipase levels dropped dramatically within 24
hours.
We would welcome any suggestions as to possible etiologies, as well
as information on any other similar cases.
