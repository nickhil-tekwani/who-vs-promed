Chikungunya [virus] has infected a total of 5200 villagers in Pangke,
Kabupaten Tanjung Balai Karimun, of Kepulauan Riau province.

The residents could not take medicine because they did not have the
funds to cover the cost. The illness has become an epidemic in the
Pangke Village beginning 3 months ago, but many residents did not realise it.

Moreover their village was under the jurisdiction of the community
health centre, which was considered to be far away: 10 kilometres [6
miles]. So they were lazy about taking medicine.

The head of the Pangke Village, Bakhtiar, urged immediate government
help. Until now the Health Service has not yet come to check and
collect data on the residents. The residents have relied only on
traditional medicine to cure this illness.

Hundreds Of residents in the Bangkalis Regency, Riau, were attacked
by the chikungunya illness as a result of the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito bite [transmitting the virus] over the past 2 weeks.
Resulting from the virus attack that was carried by these dengue
fever mosquitoes, hundreds of residents that were infected could not
be as active as usual because they experienced paralysis, in fact
there are those that experienced blindness.

The head of the Health Service of the Riau Province, Burhanuddin
Agung, said that as a result of the Cikunguya plague that struck in
the Bengkalis Regency, his organization at once mobilised several
medical teams to deal with this illness.

"As of today [13 Oct 2008], according to the data that was received
by us, approximately 300 residents were attacked by the chikungunya
illness." We sent approximately 4 officials to deal with the disease,
Burhanuddin said to okezone, on Monday (13 Oct 2008).

He said that this was the 2nd chikungunya outbreak to strike Riau
Province; a similar outbreak had previously attacked Pekanbaru
inhabitants. However, 9 regions had not yet been infected.

"The symptoms were just the same was with dengue fever with the
occurrence of red spots and high fever, but chikungunya [virus
infection] causes pain in the body and the moving joints," he explained.
