[The spread of the virus seems to have undergone a sharp rise, with
13 outbreaks, of which 10 on cattle and 3 on pig farms covered in the
current follow-up report, starting between 19 - 23 Dec 2010 (6 of
them during a single day, 21 Dec 2010). 7 of the outbreaks are
located in the Gyeonggi province, 5 in the Gangwon province and one
in Incheon Metropolitan City (map included in the report at the above URL).

Stamping out of infected herds and preemptive culling of susceptible
animals within a radius of 500m [547 yards] from them don't seem to
have been effective enough in the control efforts; the involvement of
pigs, since the onset of the epizootic, may have been a major factor
in this difficulty -- on top of the significant
infectivity/invasiveness of the virus strain involved. For more
details on the current spread in the north and north-east of South
Korea, see item 2 further.

If vaccination is currently considered (as indicated by some media
reports), this is not (yet?) reflected in the official reporting: it
indicates that vaccination is forbidden, nor mentioned under
"measures to be applied."

in South Korea since 26 Nov 2010, is available at

[2] Planned vaccination

Korea goes all out to halt foot-and-mouth
-----------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is feared to spread across the country
after 3 new cases were confirmed including on the northwestern island
of Ganghwa on Friday [24 Dec 2010]. Health authorities will begin
vaccination in 5 affected areas Saturday as the epidemic devastated
the local livestock industry and forced provincial governments to
cancel tourist programs and festivals ahead of the New Year. The
government Friday earmarked 154.1 billion won (USD 133.4 million) for
quarantine and decontamination and support for farmers hit by the disease.

The Cabinet will approve the expenditure plan at a Cabinet meeting
slated for next Tuesday [28 Dec 2010], officials said. During a
meeting of top policymakers presided over by Prime Minister Kim
Hwang-sik, the government discussed a range of measures to stem the
disease including enhancing port quarantine regulations.

The epidemic broke out in the southeastern city of Andong on 29 Nov
2010 [in fact, earlier. The index pig farm had tested negative when
pen-side test was applied on 26 Nov 2010, leading to delayed
diagnosis and postponed application of control measures. - Mod. AS].
A total of 51 cases were confirmed in some 20 cities and counties [50
of them already reported to the OIE. - Mod.AS]. Authorities have
ordered the culling of a record 325 000 livestock so far with
estimated losses expected to hover around 400 billion [USD 347.6 million].

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Fri
24 Dec 2010 that 3 additional infections were confirmed on Ganghwa
Island off the west coast, Hoengseong in Gangwon Province and
Yeongcheon in North Gyeongsang Province. A large pig production farm
with 24 000 animals in Yeongcheon, 344 km [214 miles] southeast of
Seoul, tested positive for the disease, it said.

The pigs raised at the production facility [were?] sold to other
farms with authorities acknowledging that animals carrying the FMD
virus may have been inadvertently sold before a quarantine ring was
set up. The animals were put under close observation only Thu [23 Dec
2010] after some animals started to develop blisters on their snouts,
teats and hooves and showed a loss of appetite.

"There is a chance that animals infected with FMD may have been
transferred to other farms," an official, who declined to be
identified, said. All animals on the farm and those within a 3-km
radius are to be culled to prevent the spread of the disease.

Reflecting concern that the disease may continue to spread, a pig
farm in adjacent Gyeongju has been quarantined after some animals
started showing possible signs of the disease. An outbreak in
Gyeongju could become a serious problem since it is the single
largest producer of cattle in the country.

FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs, deer, goats
and sheep. It is harmless to humans. The country was hit by FMD
outbreaks in January [serotype A] and April [serotype O], which cost
more than 250 billion won and left nearly 50 000 animals slaughtered.
Korea ordered a halt to pork and beef exports in January when an
outbreak [serotype A] was confirmed at Pocheon northeast of Seoul.

Starting Saturday [25 Dec 2010], the government plans to vaccinate
133 000 animals in Andong, where the animal disease was 1st confirmed
on 29 Nov 2010, and nearby Yecheon in North Gyeongsang Province. It
said Paju, Yeoncheon and Goyang, all regions in Gyeonggi Province
north of Seoul, will be vaccinated [See item 3, below].

Some 200 teams made up of 800 personnel will administer the shots.
The 1st vaccination process should take about 10 days with the 2nd
[booster] shots to be administered a month later to ensure that the
animals are properly protected. Vaccinations will only be given to
cattle because they are more vulnerable to the disease, with pigs and
other cloven-hoofed animals to be excluded.

[3] Vaccination started

South Korea starts vaccinating cattle against FMD
-------------------------------------------------
South Korea begun inoculating cattle in 5 cities against FMD as part
of its efforts to curb further spread of the animal disease,
government officials said Saturday [25 Dec 2010].

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced
Wednesday its program to vaccinate cattle against the contagion after
the ministry failed to prevent it from spreading across the country.
As of Saturday, a total of 56 cases were reported, leading a mass
cull of 330 000 animals.

Despite a cold wave hitting the country for a 2nd day, the
vaccination was conducted smoothly in 5 cities -- Andong and Yecheon,
the cities of North Gyeongsang Province and Paju, Goyang, Yeoncheon,
the cities of Gyeonggi Provinces, the ministry said.

About 133 000 cattle were vaccinated, the ministry said, adding that
it plans to wrap up the vaccination within 3 or 4 days at the earliest.

[Further details on the vaccination plans, performance and follow-up
will be posted when available. Data on the source of the vaccine and
the vaccine-strain applied will be helpful. According to the
information of the WRLFMD (IAH, Pirbright), the reference virus most
closely related to a serotype O strain isolated in S. Korea on 8 Apr
2010 is named O/MYA/7/98, a Malaysian SEA genotype/strain, topotype
Mya-98 (identity percentage 93.74; see at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000H%20O%20South%20Korea%202010.pdf>).

The vaccination of 133 000 heads of cattle in one day may have become
feasible by the activation, as planned, of 200 teams (mean 665
head/team). This will, most likely, protect those animals but will
not prevent further spread of the virus from the unvaccinated pig population.

Large-scale vaccinations against the similar virus strain which was
involved in the 2010 outbreaks in Hong-Kong, South Korea (April/May),
Japan, Mongolia and Russia, have been recently undertaken in
Mongolia. In Japan, a "vaccination to kill" policy was applied [see
archived 20100519.1646]. The mainland China FMD situation,
particularly genotyping and vaccine application, are less transparent.

So far, 2 official reports on the 2010 FMD epizootic in Japan have
been published (in Japanese). Both were somewhat critical to their
mother organisations. They are:

[1] Intermediate Report of FMD in Miyazaki, by the 'Verification
Committee for FMD in Miyazaki, Miyazaki Prefecture Government',
published 29 Oct 2010. PDF, 11 pages 176KB, available at
<http://www.pref.miyazaki.lg.jp/parts/000148486.pdf>. The full report
is expected early Jan 2011.

[2] Report of Verification Committee for FMD Countermeasures, by the
'Verification Committee for FMD Countermeasures: Independent
Committee in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries',
published on 24 Nov 2010. PDF, 50 pages, 1.76MB, available at
