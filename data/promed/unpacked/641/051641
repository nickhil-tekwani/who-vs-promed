Multistate Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium Linked to Chicken Salad
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Another 105 more ill people from 6 states were added to this investigation since the last update on [22 Feb 2018]. As of [6 Mar 2018], 170 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium have been reported from 7 states.

States / Case Count
Illinois / 9
Indiana / 1
Iowa / 149
Minnesota / 3
Nebraska / 5
South Dakota / 2
Texas / 1
Total / 170

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [8 Jan 2018] to [18 Feb 2018]. Ill people range in age from 7 to 89 years, with a median age of 59. A total of 66 percent of ill people are female. There have been 62 hospitalizations and no deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis did not identify predicted antimicrobial resistance in 67 of 72 isolates (70 ill people and 2 food samples); 5 isolates from ill people contained genes for resistance to all or some of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. This resistance is unlikely to affect the treatment of most people, but some infections might be difficult to treat with antimicrobials usually prescribed and may require a different drug. Testing of outbreak isolates using standard susceptibility testing methods is currently underway in CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory.

Investigation Update
--------------------
State and local health officials continue to interview ill people to ask about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 159 people interviewed, 131 (82 percent) reported eating chicken salad from Fareway stores. Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. produced the chicken salad that ill people reported eating.

It takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks from when a person becomes ill with _Salmonella_ to when the illness is reported to CDC or health officials. Because of this reporting lag, the additional 105 people added to this investigation likely became ill from eating chicken salad recalled by Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. which is no longer available for purchase. The last reported illness began on [18 Feb 2018].

CDC recommends that people do not eat recalled chicken salad. Throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates when more information is available.

[Fareway Stores, Inc. is a retail grocery store chain based in Boone, Iowa, with most of its stores in the upper mid-west of the USA and unrelated to the Fairway Markets in the New York City area.

Iowa, the Hawkeye state, is located in the Midwestern part of the USA and can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa. In colonial times, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt. - Mod.LL]
