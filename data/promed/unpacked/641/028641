Russia: Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome in the Jewish Autonomous
Region (Birobijan)
---------------------------------------------------
4 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been
registered during December in the Jewish Autonomous Region (Birobijan),
while only 9 cases were recorded in the preceding 11 months of 2004. No
fatal cases have been reported.
The outbreak of disease is due to the onset of frosts, said Vyacheslav
Chaban, Head of the Department of Disinfestation and Sterilization of the
State Epidemiological surveillance Centre in the Jewish Autonomous Region.
Frosts cause the red-backed vole and other small rodents, the vectors of
HFRS, to invade human habitations and domestic buildings
There is an additional problem. The amount of rodent control carried out
has been declining in recent years, because this service is no longer free.
Practically no rodent control is being undertaken in rural areas. All 4
cases recorded in December have been inhabitants of rural villages.

[The Jewish Autonomous Region is situated in the southern part of the far
east of Russia. On the west the region borders with the Amur Region, on the
east with the Khabarovsk Region, and on the south its border coincides with
the Amur River and the international frontier between Russia and China. The
region is close to the Pacific Ocean. The total area of the region is 36.3
thousand square kilometers. The human population is about 190 thousand.
The Soviet government set aside the area in 1928 as a resettlement district
for Jews of the USSR, although Jews had no historical connection with this
sparsely settled and economically undeveloped border region. In 1934 the
area was designated an Autonomous Region. The Jewish population of the
oblast remains at less than 6 percent, and Russians make up the bulk of the
population. - Mods.NP/CP]
