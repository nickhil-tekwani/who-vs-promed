Residents of the village of Saidipora Shopian have alleged negligence
by the Animal Husbandry Department with regard to the outbreak of
some unknown killer disease that has so far claimed the lives of 8
cows.
It was also learned that foot and mouth disease (FMD) among animals
is present in other villages -- such as Mugalpora Pulwama, Tengpona
and Tahab -- while a lack of vaccine from the animal husbandry
department has added to the woes of affected farmers.

[This brief indication of a disease this serious does not tell us how
long it has been suspected. It does not tell us clinical signs. What
we know is there is likely foot and mouth disease in other areas of
India (see refs. below). - Mod.TG]
[It is difficult for this moderator to understand how people can complain about
lack of vaccine for "some unknown killer disease". - Mod.JW]
