The doctors have confirmed an outbreak of hepatitis E at Ahmadabad village of south Kashmir's Kulgam district, due to the supply of highly contaminated water to the inhabitants. 5 people in the village have so far been tested positive for the infection.

"As soon as we received the reports of jaundice cases in the village Ahmadabad we deputed a medical team," said Block Medical Officer (BMO), DH Pora Dr Zahoor Ahmad. He said 8 people were found to have jaundice and their blood samples were taken for testing to Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) laboratory in Barzulla Srinagar. "Out of 8, 5 have so far tested positive for [hepatitis E] infection while the reports of other suspected cases is awaited," said Dr Zahoor. He said that the medical teams have been stationed in the allopathic dispensary in the village and they were monitoring the situation.

Doctors attribute the consumption of highly contaminated water by the villagers as the reason for the outbreak. "We also took 3 water samples for testing and the reports of samples is awaited," said BMO. He said that the people need not to panic but only consume boiled water and maintain proper hygiene.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries is zoonotic and does not generally cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population older than 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html.) - Mod.LL
