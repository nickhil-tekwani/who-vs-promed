A further male heroin injector has tested positive for anthrax. The
patient is responding well to treatment at Monklands District General
Hospital in Lanarkshire. This takes the total number of confirmed
anthrax-linked cases to 6, which includes the 3 individuals who have
died.

The other 2 surviving confirmed patients continue to respond well to
treatment -- a male at Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary and a male at
Monklands District General Hospital in Lanarkshire.

A 7th patient, a female, who is being treated at the Southern
General, is being tested and we await the results.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Public Health Protection Unit are
continuing to work closely with NHS Lanarkshire, the procurator
fiscal's office and Strathclyde Police to identify the source of the
anthrax. One avenue, which continues to be investigated by Public
Health and Strathclyde Police is that contaminated heroin or a
contaminated cutting agent mixed with the heroin may be responsible
for the infections.

Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in Public Health Medicine, said: "Drug
injecting is extremely risky and dangerous. The possible presence of
a batch of heroin contaminated with anthrax makes drug injecting even
riskier and even more dangerous. I urge all drug injecting heroin
users to be extremely alert and to seek urgent medical advice if they
experienced an infection. While this section of the community need to
be on their guard the risk to the rest of the population -- including
close family members of the infected cases -- is negligible. It is
extremely rare for anthrax to be spread from person to person and
there is no significant risk of airborne transmission from one person
to another."

As part of ongoing inquiries any drug injecting heroin user who
presents with serious soft tissue infections now or during the last 4
weeks is being investigated.
