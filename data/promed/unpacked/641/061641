SARS - WORLDWIDE (46): DIAGNOSTIC TEST

Speedy SARS diagnostic test to be released Monday
-------------------------------------------------
A Hamburg biotech company will release a real time PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) diagnostic test on Mon 14 Apr 2003, which, it is claimed, can
diagnose SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2 hours. Artus has
teamed up with the Bernard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI) in
Hamburg and will donate the test free to laboratories for evaluation. BNI
[and other laboratories in the WHO consortium] identified a SARS-associated
virus 2 weeks ago as an [atypical] coronavirus. The Artus test will be
available from it and its subsidiaries in both the USA and Malaysia in the
coming week, the company said in a statement. The assay can detect [the
SARS-associated coronavirus] using throat swabs, sputum or faecal systems,
and is an advance on antibody assays from blood which may take 10 or 20
days to process.

[The preceding newswire report was referred to Dr. Chrisian Drosten of the
Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg for comment, and
Dr. Drosten's reply is reproduced below. Neither ProMED-mail, nor Dr.
Drosten, have any commercial association with the companies concerned. The
information is relayed in the public interest.- Mod.CP]
The Bernhard-Nocht Institute (BNI) has developed and evaluated different
RT-PCR tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus (for simplicity,
hereinafter called SARSV - not an officially proposed name or acronym). It
has been our policy to make available all our tests for SARSV before
publication to rapidly provide reliable diagnostic instruments [see
ProMed-mail posting SARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786].
Protocols of the BNI PCRs are available from or,
together with that of other institutions, from the WHO homopage
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/>.
BNI currently recommends 2 different RT-PCRs for SARSV: 1. A nested PCR,
primers BNIoutS2, BNIoutAs; BNIinS, BNIinAs. 2. A real-time PCR, primers
BNITMSARS1, BNITMSARAs2, probe BNITMSARP. All BNI PCRs have been published
in an early release article in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wed
10 Apr 2003 <http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa030747v2.pdf> [See
also: SARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869]. The positioning of
the recommended primers can also be looked up there. Both PCRs allow the
detection of single copies of RNA and do not cross-react with both human
coronaviruses and various animal coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus,
bovine coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, porcine coronavirus).
As a latest development, BNI's real-time PCR has been transformed into a
diagnostic kit by Artus-biotech, a company specialized in providing PCR
kits for diagnostic application.
Role of the BNI: The BNI is an academic institution. BNI has asked two
Biotech companies for assistance in distributing necessary test reagents.
Company 1 is Tib-Molbiol in Berlin, company 2 is Artus-biotech in Hamburg.
BNI itself distributes free of charge a cloned and in-vitro transcribed 200
bp fragment of the SARSV polymerase gene containing the target region of
its SARSV PCRs. The RNA is shipped in lyophilized form to every laboratory
interested in establishing BNI's diagnostic tests. So far, about 80
laboratories worldwide have obtained the RNA. Requests are continuing.
Contact for the RNA: <drosten@bni-hamburg.de>.
Role of Tib-Molbiol, Berlin: Tib-Molbiol has synthesized all primers and
probes developed by the BNI for SARSV in large scale stocks. Tib-Molbiol
makes the primers available from four sites: Roche Taiwan, Roche Singapore,
Roche Hong Kong, Tib-Molbiol Berlin. The oligonucleotides can be obtained
rapidly, i.e. without having to wait for their synthesis, and comply with
the highest quality criteria. The persons responsible at Tib-Molbiol for
this project are Olfert Landt and Uli Lass. Contact e-mail is
<ulass@tib-molbiol.de>. Order e-mail is <dna@tib-molbiol.de>.
In addition to supplying oligonucleotides, Tib-Molbiol gives application
support to labs establishing tests with these oligonucleotides. Detailed
working bench protocols are also provided. Upon request, positive control
material (plasmid) can be obtained from Tib-Molbiol.
Role of Artus-biotech, Hamburg: Artus has made a real-time RT-PCR kit based
on BNI's test. The technical performance of the kit has been approved by
BNI. The test can be used on different real-time machines, including Roche
LightCylcer and Corbett Rotorgene. It contains an internal control that
allows to monitor the presence of PCR inhibitors in each test sample. Artus
is willing to distribute the test for free to allow laboratories to
evaluate the kit before they decide to use it for diagnostics. Further
information can be obtained from Artus project leader Thomas Laue
(<laue@artus-biotech.de>) or via
<http://www.artus-biotech2.com/en/framesets/index_news.php?id=24>.
Please note that the case definition of SARS does not include findings in PCR.
Statement of WHO regarding the use of PCR for SARSV: "Results of PCR ...
can be used to complement clinical diagnostic evaluation. However, tests
have not been validated for confirmation of cases or exclusion of the
disease. The WHO case definition remains unchanged at present. Samples from
potential SARS patients (suspected or probable) should be performed under
conditions of Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3). Biosafety level 3+ is required for
viral culture and animal experiments."
