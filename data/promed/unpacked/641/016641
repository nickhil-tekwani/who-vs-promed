32 people suffered from botulism in Buryatia (Russia)
-----------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the year [2004], the home consumption of smoked and
salted omul [fish] has been the cause of botulism in 32 residents of Buryatia.
The Territorial Medical Center of Catastrophes stated that, since the
beginning of the year [2004], one child has suffered, and 2 adults have died,
from botulism.
Last week [2nd week of October 2004], 4 more people were poisoned. The
information agency REGNUM reports that 8 people are currently hospitalized,
with one of them in serious condition.
Last year [2003] until the end of October, 79 cases of botulism poisoning
were registered. Physicians are warning that the agent of this disease can
develop during the home salting of fish. Medical providers are urging
residents of the republic to avoid buying omul at [street] markets.
