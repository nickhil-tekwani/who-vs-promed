Referring to the Moderator's comment on ProMED-mail post
20091114.3936, I suspect that the overall influenza ecology may be
somewhat more important (with regard to reassortment potential) than
simply whether or not other animal species may be susceptible to
infection by human influenza viruses following exposure.

For example, it may be much more important to determine which animal
species (exposed and susceptible) have other influenza types actively
circulating within their respective populations to put the
prevalence, distribution, genotypic diversity and exposure related
risk factors into better ecological perspective and thereby
facilitate targeting of animal health surveillance energies [Thank
you for capturing what I had hoped the general readership would
understand. - Mod.TG]

We know that other influenza viruses (of comparatively narrow
diversity) actively circulate in factory-farmed pigs quite commonly;
we know that other influenza viruses of possibly slightly greater
diversity circulate occasionally in factory-farmed domestic poultry
(but probably not quite so commonly as they do in factory farmed pigs
if we exclude the current H5N1 HPAI situation in some regions of the
world); we should by now also conclude that suitable exposure
conditions exist for transmission of human influenza viruses to pigs
and poultry (and presumably vice versa) within factory farming
systems (and to susceptible domestic pets within household
conditions), and we also know that wild birds (waterfowl at least)
have the most diverse array of influenza A viruses actively
circulating within populations and sub-populations.

We possibly don't know nearly enough about transmission of human
influenza viruses from humans to pigs and poultry (and/or other
livestock species) raised in non-factory production systems (e.g. the
semi-commercial and backyard production systems that predominate in
developing countries) because surveillance in these production
systems is generally much more complex, expensive, laborious and has
not been very well done. It could, however, be postulated that
influenza viruses of greater diversity may be circulating within such
populations, relative to factory farming systems, and it has also
been postulated that exposure conditions could sometimes be somewhat
more in favour of virus transmission from people to livestock and
vice versa (H5N1 HPAI being only one example); they possibly tend to
more closely approximate conditions applicable between pets and their
owners than the factory farming situation.

Therefore, I think one of the more important questions is where to
direct efforts and available resources for surveillance of influenza
in animals, how to structure the surveillance and, very importantly,
how to interpret the resultant data, for example, bias towards the
comparatively bio-secure factory farming systems where conditions
favour rapid amplification and higher generational turnover of
influenza viruses that infect the animals (where surveillance can
also be conducted relatively inexpensively and more comprehensively,
and interpretation of resultant data may be somewhat simpler), or
towards wildlife, with human exposure and/or less intensive (and less
bio-secure) livestock farming systems where the diversity of
influenza viral activity is likely to be greater and possibly likely
to favour more frequent chance reassortments of a more sinister kind.
Where surveillance is also comparatively much more complex, laborious
and expensive, it must largely be undertaken in less developed
places, and consistent interpretation of data is more difficult.

In that regard, I think it is a great shame that we still seem to be
at a loss about where in the world, when and under what basic set of
ecological conditions PIA(H1N1)'09 made the step from being an animal
virus to becoming a human influenza virus, and it may be very
difficult to shed more clear light on that issue now that
PIA(H1N1)'09 has gone truly global in humans and crossed back to
animals on several occasions unless we get very lucky with
strain-specific serological test technologies and retrospective studies.

[Regarding other influenza viruses, notably avian influenza, there
has been extensive coverage of transmission of the virus between wild
and domesticated birds. When this virus is found in wild and
domesticated birds, the same speculations will likely occur again.

Since ferrets are a human model and we have the current H1N1 in other
animals, it is possible this particular virus could pick up aspects
of some of these other animals, ferrets, cats, etc. and other
companion animals so that as it reassorts, it has portions of other
animals in the virus.

Certainly a challenge is where to focus the energies and limited
money, as this reader points out. Understanding the transmission
between the various species is one area where the resources could be focused.

Surveillance everywhere is important, including in other commercial
animals as well as companion animals. - Mod.TG]
