A Lane County resident and a visitor to Washington County have been diagnosed with measles. Their illnesses are linked to an individual with the disease who passed through Portland International Airport earlier this month [October 2019].

According to the Oregon Health Authority (OHA), the 2 new cases reportedly were on the same international flight that landed in Portland on [12 Oct 2019], as reported by Multnomah County Health Department. OHA epidemiologists are working with public health staff in both counties to confirm sites where others may have been exposed.

None of the people involved in this case had been fully vaccinated against measles.

Eleven children under the age of 15 died this month [October 2019] in the commune of Capunda, municipality of Luquembo, Malanje province, victims of measles, which has affected that district since the beginning of September this year [2019].

The information was advanced this Wednesday [23 Oct 2019] by the director of the municipal health hospital, Correia Jorge, noting that 85 other children affected by the disease are receiving medical and drug assistance in the municipality of Capunda. He said that despite the deaths, the measles outbreak is under control as health authorities are conducting vaccination campaigns near villages to block the disease in the region.

For the past 10 months, Ethiopia has been experiencing a measles outbreak, which began in Oromio region and later affected 3 additional regions: Afar, Amhara and Somali. Since the beginning of the year [2019], a total of 8514 suspected measles cases, including 57 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.67%), were reported.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says measles is endemic in Ethiopia with outbreaks reported annually. A quarter of the people affected during the current outbreak are 15 years and above, and more than 82.6% of cases were either not vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown.

Health authorities in Lebanon are responding to an outbreak of measles. From [1 Nov 2018] through [12 Oct 2019], a total of 1171 cases have been reported, of which 675 (57.6%) were laboratory confirmed, 8 (0.7%) epidemiologically linked cases, and 488 (41.7%) were clinically diagnosed. No associated deaths have been reported as of now [22 Oct 2019].

Measles cases have been reported in all 8 Lebanese governorates, with Aakar, Baalbek-El-Hermel, Bekaa North, and Mount Lebanon governorates most affected. Ninety per cent of suspected measles cases were Lebanese nationals, while 10% were Syrians living in informal settlements and in residential areas. The cumulative incidence of measles among Lebanese was higher than that of Syrians (22.4 vs 11.1 per 100 000 population, respectively).

The most affected age-group among the 1123 cases with known age was children under the age of 5 years with 705 cases (63%), followed by cases of 5 to 9 years of age (271 cases; 24%), 10 to 14 (31 cases; 3%), 15 to 24 (19 cases; 2%), and people over 24 years of age represented 97 cases (9%). In addition, children below 5 years old have the highest cumulative incidence (124.6 per 100 000 population) followed by children in the age-group of 5 to 9 years (41.4 per 100 000 population).

The immunization strategy used by the Lebanon public health sector includes both measles vaccine given at 9 months of age (introduced in 1987) and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine given to children as 2 doses at 12 and 18 months of age (MMR, introduced in 1996). The private sector implements MMR vaccination at 12 months and 4 to 5 years of age.

In Lebanon, between 2000 and 2018, the WHO-UNICEF coverage estimations for 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine ranged from 15% to 75% with a median coverage of 63%.

Public health response: the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Lebanon is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and UNICEF. Public health response measures include:

- epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and monitoring of close contacts;
- sensitization of clinicians on measles surveillance, reporting, case investigation and management;
- social mobilization and distribution of information, education and communication (IEC) materials;
- measles assessment mission, conducted in May 2019, recommended a national measles campaign and support to the epidemiological surveillance unit;
- localized accelerated immunization activities in areas of measles clusters;
- planning of a national measles campaign targeting 1 170 000 children in the age-group of 6 months to less than 10 years of age.

WHO risk assessment: based on the available information, the risk at the national level is considered to be high for the following reasons:

- nationwide case distribution and low vaccination coverage at national level with immunity gaps;
- the country host[s] around one million displaced Syrians with limited access to healthcare;
- limited funding for supplementary immunization activities to improve measles vaccination coverage, and for the epidemiological surveillance unit to support surveillance activities and capacity building;
- measles cases being reported throughout the country.

The overall risk at regional level was assessed as moderate due to porous boundaries allowing free movement between Lebanon and Syria, the low vaccination coverage and recent measles outbreaks reported in neighboring countries. The overall risk at global level was assessed as low.

[7] Loss of immunity
Date: Thu 31 Oct 2019

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/31/775081827/measles-virus-may-wipe-out-immune-protection-for-other-diseases


This year [2019] saw the largest outbreak of measles in the USA since 1994, with 1250 cases reported as of [3 Oct 2019], largely driven by families choosing not to vaccinate their kids. Worldwide, the disease has resurfaced in areas that had been declared measles-free.

Some families choosing not to vaccinate argue that measles is just a pesky childhood illness to be endured. But 2 new studies illustrate how skipping the measles vaccine carries a double risk. Not only does it leave a child vulnerable to a highly contagious disease, but also, for individuals who survive an initial measles attack, the virus increases their vulnerability to all kinds of other infections for months -- possibly even years -- after they recover.

The research begins to explain something surprising that happened when the measles vaccine was introduced in the USA in the 1960s. Rates of childhood deaths from other diseases fell precipitously. The same thing happened as the vaccine was introduced around the world.

But what is it about the measles vaccine that seems to provide protection from more than just measles? The new studies published this week in the journals Science and Science Immunology provide substance to what has been the leading theory: Measles can damage the immune system by erasing the body's memory of previously encountered antigens.

One of the key features of our immune system is that it keeps track of the infectious agents we've encountered and uses that memory to prevent reinfection. But after someone gets the measles, their immune system appears to forget some of what it has encountered, studies suggest. It's an effect researchers refer to as "immune amnesia".

Previous evidence for immune amnesia has been based on mathematical models and population-level studies according to Dr Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and the primary author of the study released this week in Science. The new studies are the 1st to show "any of the real biology that helps explain the population-level effects," he says.

Abstract: Measles virus is directly responsible for more than 100 000 deaths yearly. Epidemiological studies have associated measles with increased morbidity and mortality for years after infection, but the reasons why are poorly understood. Measles virus infects immune cells, causing acute immune suppression. To identify and quantify long-term effects of measles on the immune system, we used VirScan, an assay that tracks antibodies to thousands of pathogen epitopes in blood. We studied 77 unvaccinated children before and 2 months after natural measles virus infection. Measles caused elimination of 11% to 73% of the antibody repertoire across individuals. Recovery of antibodies was detected after natural reexposure to pathogens. Notably, these immune system effects were not observed in infants vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but were confirmed in measles-infected macaques. The reduction in humoral immune memory after measles infection generates potential vulnerability to future infections, underscoring the need for widespread vaccination.

Loss of pre-existing immunity to other diseases has been known to be a consequence of measles infection, but these articles identify the mechanism behind this loss for the 1st time. This loss exacerbates the threat to the health of unvaccinated children. If they become infected with measles naturally, they not only are in danger of contracting severe disease from the measles virus itself, but they also are vulnerable to other pathogenic agents they encounter in the course of daily living, even if they were previously infected and developed immunity to them. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
---------
Objective: To illustrate how data triangulation involving routine data sources can optimize data usage and provide insights into vaccine programme effectiveness by considering measles vaccination and disease incidence data in England.

Methods: We obtained data on measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage in birth cohorts from 1985 to 2016 from child health records and adjusted for under-ascertainment and catch-up campaigns. We assumed that the population had no natural immunity and that vaccine effectiveness was 95% for one dose and 99.75% for 2 doses. Vaccinations done outside the routine schedule and in people who entered England after the age of immunization were identified from primary care records. Measles susceptibility was defined as the percentage of individuals who were not immune despite all vaccination activities. We triangulated measles susceptibility and incidence data.

Findings: Median susceptibility was 4.6% (range, 1.2-9.2). Among cohorts eligible for 2 MMR vaccine doses, those born between 1998 and 2004 were most susceptible. Measles incidence was highest in these cohorts. Data from primary care and child health records were comparable for cohorts after 2000, suggesting that little supplementary vaccination took place. For cohorts before 2000, primary care data quality was insufficient for accurately estimating coverage.

Conclusion: Triangulating routine data on measles vaccination coverage and disease surveillance provided new insights into population immunity and helped identify vulnerable groups, which was useful for prioritizing public health actions to close gaps in immunity. This approach could be applied in any country that routinely records vaccine coverage and disease incidence.

[9] Subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE)

https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10234521/boy-died-measles-dormant-virus/


A heartbroken mum whose 6 year old died from a dormant virus the measles left behind says she wishes she could "go back in time and bring him back." [The boy] died in April this year [2019] after a dormant virus left behind by measles he had as a baby flared up. [His mother has been left heartbroken after losing her son [when he] caught a wild strain of the measles before he could be vaccinated as a baby, developing the usual rash and high temperature associated with the illness.

He bounced back a week later and went on to be a funny, cheeky boy who loved dancing, Tom and Jerry, Arsenal FC and was top of his class at school. But just 6 years later he died of subacute [sclerosing] pan-encephalitis (SSPE), which is caused by dormant antibodies left behind by the measles virus which can attack healthy brain cells at any time.

His symptoms 1st appeared last December [2018], when a usually well-behaved child became naughty and argumentative. Then in February [2019], he told his mum he was "exhausted", became clumsy, forgetful, unable to dress himself properly and stopped doing his schoolwork. [His mum] took him straight to the GP, who advised she take him to A&E, where doctors couldn't pinpoint a reason for his bizarre mix of symptoms. His mum said: "They were asking him about school and said he couldn't keep up. It was like his brain was slowing down."

Around 18 in every 100 000 people who catch wild measles as babies will go on to develop SSPE; it is usually fatal and there is no cure.

[Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare condition that is caused by a measles infection acquired earlier in life. Signs and symptoms of the condition primarily affect the central nervous system and often develop approximately 7 to 10 years after a person recovers from the measles.

SSPE results from a long-term brain infection with the measles virus. The virus sometimes enters the brain during a measles infection. It may cause immediate symptoms of brain infection (encephalitis), or it may remain in the brain for a long time without causing problems.

SSPE occurs because the measles virus reactivates. In the past in the USA, for reasons that are not known, the disorder occurred in about 7 to 300 people per million people who had measles infection and in about one person per million people who received the measles vaccine. However, doctors think the people who developed SSPE after vaccination likely had a mild, undiagnosed case of measles before they were vaccinated and that the vaccine did not cause the SSPE (excerpted from https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/children-s-health-issues/viral-infections-in-infants-and-children/subacute-sclerosing-panencephalitis-sspe). - Mod.LK
