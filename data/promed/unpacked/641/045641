Anthrax spores have been detected in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, a sanctuary to a huge population of protected species of wild buffaloes, raising alarm among conservationists. The finding came following the test of blood samples collected from dead cattle found in the reserve. Some 44 cattle were found dead in the grassland here on [Thu 8 Aug 2019].

Dr. Sanjaya Kumar Yadav of Livestock Disease Research Laboratory, Biratnagar, confirmed the bacteria in the dead animals. "Anthrax is a infectious disease and can spread from cattle to cattle and even to humans. As the disease can kill the patient if timely treatment is not provided, we must be cautious," said Dr Yadav.

According to Dr. Manoj Kumar Mahato of Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Expert Centre, Inaruwa, his office is all set to launch a campaign to stop the bacteria from spreading further. "The bacteria can easily spread from one place to another through wind, soil or water. To stop the disease from spreading further, it is necessary to inoculate [vaccinate] all the livestock found in the wildlife reserve," he said. Mahato added that hardly any symptoms are seen before the infected cattle dies from bleeding from all orifices.

According to experts, people in the vicinity of the reserve who come to the reserve to graze their cattle are also at risk. Anyone who touches the carcass of an infected animal and gets near the area can contract the bacteria through any medium, such as air, water or through any wound in their body.

Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve chief conservation officer Ramdev Chaudhary said the reserve would do all it takes to control the disease.

[With 44 cattle dead already that were grazing inside the park, they have some catching up to do. Hopefully the farms of origin for these cattle have corrals or pens which can be used to vaccinate the cattle. Vaccinating any wild buffaloes is very difficult if you don't have the facilities for handling them. The best for them to do is to bury any buffalo carcasses promptly but this will need heavy equipment. If you have never burnt the carcass of a buffalo or cow, it present problems especially if there is not an excess of dry timber available to be used. Proactively it would be wise to initiate an anthrax control programme for all the herds adjoining this park, and especially those likely to be moved into the park, and in collaboration with their close by Indian provincial veterinarians.

Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshi_Tappu_Wildlife_Reserve) is a protected area in the Terai [foothills low country] of eastern Nepal covering 175 km2 (68 sq mi) of wetlands in the Sunsari, Saptari and Udayapur Districts. It comprises extensive mudflats, reed beds, and freshwater marshes in the floodplain of the Sapta Kosi River, and ranges in altitude from 75 to 81 m (246 to 266 ft). It was established in 1976 and designated as a Ramsar site in December 1987. As it directly abuts India it would be a fair presumption that the infection came from locally affected Indian herds.
