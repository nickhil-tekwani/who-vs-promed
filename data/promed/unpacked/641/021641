A La Plata County woman has contracted bubonic plague, according to the San Juan Basin Health Department. The woman was hospitalized Sat 9 Aug 2014, before she was released to recover at home, Flannery O'Neil, a spokeswoman for the department, said Mon 11 Aug 2014. O'Neil said the department is investigating how the woman was exposed to the plague.

The last case of bubonic plague in La Plata County, which lies in a region of the nation that predominantly sees the disease, was in 2006. A case was also confirmed in nearby Archuleta County in 2012, O'Neil said.

"In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year nationwide," the department said. 4 other cases of plague, specifically pneumonic plague, have been reported in Colorado in 2014. All of those sickened lived in Adams County, according to state health officials. There have been 64 cases of human plague in Colorado since 1957, 9 of which were fatal.
