An outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) among wild boars has been
registered in the Lotoshinsky district in the Moscow region
[Moskovskaya Oblast], says the press release of the Federal
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service of Russia (Rosselkhoznadzor).

As specified by said department, the CSF virus was discovered during
the investigation, by the laboratory of All-Russian institute for
animal protection, of samples from 2 killed (in extremis) wild boars.
The boars were located within the "Lotoshinskaya okhota" hunting territory.

Quarantine measures have been applied, including a ban on boar
hunting. Oral vaccination of wild boars in the region against CSF is
being applied. No additional infected boars have been detected, so
far, among culled animals in the region.

Noteworthy, domestic pigs in the private sector of the Lotoshinsky
district were vaccinated against CSF in September 2007. However,
additional measures for the prevention of CSF spread are being
carried out on the pig farms of the Moscow region.

[This rather belated report adds some data to the previously obtained
information, particularly re the oral vaccination of wild boars. This
CSF outbreak, which had started on 10 Oct 2007, was officially
notified to the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) on 23 Nov
2007 (see ProMED-mail 20071124.3798). The notification included the
following epidemiological information: "Hunting is prohibited.
Neighboring districts (Volokolamskiy, Istrinskiy) were not free from
CSF in 2005-2006". - Mod.AS
