Maize farmers face crop failure
-------------------------------
Maize farmers in Chuadanga district [Khulna division] have suffered
severe loss as a large cultivated area of hybrid corn failed to
produce any seeds. The growth of the plants suddenly stopped with
roots and branches coming out from the stems instead of producing
flowers.

Local department of agriculture [DAE] officials said the fields were
affected by 'downy mildew' disease. They said that there was no hope
of getting any crops from the affected plants and many of the farmers
have been cutting the plants as fodder for cattle.

The farmers who used 2 brands of seed were mostly affected by the crop
failure. Those who used other brands of hybrid seed were less affected
in the area. Seed companies took samples and photographs of the
plants.

The Seed Certification Authority said that they had just come to know
about the outbreak of the disease. DAE plant protection said that they
only conducted germination tests of the seed during import.

[Around 10 different species of downy mildew fungi in the genera
_Peronosclerospora_, _Sclerospora_, and _Sclerophthora_ have been
reported to affect maize. A number of these pathogens can occur
together, but different species may be common in different areas.
Downy mildews are important pathogens of the crop in many tropical
regions of the world. For example in Asia, losses in excess of 70
percent have been documented.

Symptoms of the different fungi are similar but can vary with plant
age, climatic conditions, and host germplasm. It is therefore possible
that the recently imported hybrid maize lines mentioned above are
affected more severely by locally present downy mildews, compared to
the land races planted previously, but that disease susceptibility
varies between the different hybrid lines.

Infection at the seedling stage results in stunting, chlorosis, and
premature plant death. Infection of older plants results in leaf
symptoms of mottling, chlorotic streaking, lesions, and may produce
striped leaves which eventually shred. "Downy" growth often occurs on
leaves and is more common on the lower leaf surface. Plants may be
stunted, tiller excessively, have malformed tassels and ears ('crazy
top' symptoms), and may not produce seed.

Downy mildew spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain,
wind, or mechanical means. The fungi survive between crops on infected
plant material or alternate weed hosts. Some of the pathogens can also
be seedborne, although this is largely restricted to seed that is
fresh and has a high moisture content. Downy mildews are usually
controlled with fungicides. Resistant maize varieties are being
developed for specific pathogens and regions.
