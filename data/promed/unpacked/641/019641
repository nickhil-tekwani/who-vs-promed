National Soybean Rust Commentary (updated: 03/15/07)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Warmer temperatures have increased the growth of kudzu in the south.
A number of soybean sentinel plots have been planted and emerged
(especially in MS). Scouting efforts continue on new growth of kudzu
vines. Soybean rust has been detected on kudzu in eight counties in
Florida and in five counties in Georgia and Alabama. The disease was
also detected on soybeans in one county in Texas. This field was
destroyed about March 1, 2007, and has been planted to corn. There
have been no reports of soybean rust surviving the winter in
Louisiana, Mississippi, or South Carolina. Scouting efforts have
increased on kudzu and newly emerged soybeans.

["Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green
beans, and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen
which causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria
lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese
arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the pathogen in
southern states of the USA. - Mod.JAD"]
