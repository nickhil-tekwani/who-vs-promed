The infected fox was examined by egg flotation and real-time PCR and
was considered positive for _Echinococcus (E) multilocularis_. This
positive finding was confirmed by examining the whole fox intestine
with SCT (sedimentation and counting technique), according to the OIE
manual, and parasites identified were confirmed morphologically as
well as with real-time PCR.

The surveillance in the period 2000-2009 may be hard to assess, as it
relies partly on a less sensitive diagnostic technique (which may be
suited for regions with 10-50 percent prevalence). In a low-endemic
area like Sweden, most foxes have likely only low worm burden. In
neighboring Denmark (prevalence: 1 percent), all records of infected
foxes were with less than 55 worms. Although the coproantigen ELISA
has an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 80 percent, it detects only
50 percent of low grade infections (less than 100 worms), and even
less at worm burdens below 50 worms.

Although substantial in number of examined animals, the reported
2000-2009 studies is not sufficient to prove the previous absence of
_Echinococcus multilocularis_ in Sweden, and the recent finding may
merely reflect a change of methodology.

For a further evaluation of prevalence and geographical distribution,
the methodological design should be comparable to what was done in the
2010 study: detection of intestinal worms by sedimentation/flotation
techniques or flotation/sieving of fecal eggs combined with PCR.

[_Echinococcus multilocularis_ has been spreading north in Europe
from a focus in Southern Germany, Switzerland, and Eastern France. In
2000, 2 foxes were found infected in Denmark and in the artic
Norwegian island of Svalbard.

There is _E. multilocularis_ in Alaska, Northern Canada, and Siberia,
but the extent of _E. multilocularis_ in the wild fauna in Northern
Russia is not known (Eckert J et al: WHO/OIE Manual on Echinococcosis
in Humans and Animals: a Public Health Problem of Global Concern. WHO
& OIE 2001; available at
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2001/929044522X.pdf> and Akuffo
H et al, editors: Parasites of the Colder Climates. Taylor & Francis
Group. 2003).

It is a possibility, that the finding in Svalbard, Norway and now
Sweden is an extension of the Siberian focus and _E. multilocularis_
can be found in Northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland, but this needs
further studies. No human cases infected in Scandinavia have been
described so far. - Mod.EP]
