The All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology received samples of pathological material collected from 6 domestic pigs, which died in the Alagir area, and from one dead pig from the Nart-Ardon's Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. Both foci were found to be infected with the genetic material of the virus of ASF, as reported by the Rosselkhoznadzor, Russian Federation. The state veterinary services of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, are working to contain the ASF outbreaks and prevent further spread of the disease. The last outbreak of ASF in the Republic was registered in 2009 in domestic pigs. One of the affected areas was Alagirsky.
