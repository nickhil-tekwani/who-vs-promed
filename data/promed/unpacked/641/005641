More than 200 Persons may be affected by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_
--------------------------------------------------
There are 201 persons presumably infected with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ in
the Puerto Montt area, 10th Region, because of eating contaminated
seafood. Out of the total, at least 8 persons have a confirmed diagnosis
of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection, while the others are under observation
because they have symptoms suggestive of the disease.
Sanitary authorities confirmed that most of the affected people ate raw
seafood. Therefore, the authorities insisted that people must eat seafood
cooked at high temperatures if possible in order to avoid these problems.

Increasing numbers of persons infected by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_
---------------------------------------------------
The number of persons infected from eating contaminated seafood is still
increasing. As of last Fri, 14 Jan 2005, there were 8 cases of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ infection confirmed by the sanitary authority.
Simultaneously, the results of tests on 50 additional persons who are being
cared for of are awaited, in order to confirm whether they were infected by
the same bacterium, according to Dr. Alejandro Roa, from the Llanchipal
Health Service.
According to a report published today in El Llanquihue newspaper, Dr. Roa
stated that Llanchipal Health Service would hold a press conference in
which the exact number of persons between Fri, 14 Jan 2005 and Mon, 17 Jan
2005 would be presented.
The physician ruled out the implementation of any fishing ban. "It is the
responsibility of the community to take the appropriate measures, since we
have been systematically reporting that any intoxication can be avoided by
using cooked seafood. To ban fishing may lead to economic loss for
small-scale and industrial fishing", he affirmed. Meanwhile, last weekend a
prevention campaign led by the sanitary authority in the communication
media was intensified.
In spite of this, and according to non-official data collected in the past
2 days, more cases presumably attributed to _V. parahaemolyticus_ may have
occurred in persons who ate or bought raw seafood in Angelmo, a tourist
resort. The Head of the Fish and Seafood Traders in Angelmo, Mr. Juan
Oyarzo, confirmed some days ago that more than 90 percent of restaurants in
the area sell cooked seafood.

[Puerto Montt is in the Patagonia area of Chile. Infections with this
organism have been associated with the consumption of raw, improperly
cooked, or cooked and recontaminated fish and shellfish. A correlation
exists between the probability of infection and warmer months of the year.
Improper refrigeration of seafoods contaminated with this organism will
allow its proliferation, which increases the possibility of infection. The
source(s) of the outbreak is not stated, but most commonly this organism is
associated with oysters. - Mod.LL]
