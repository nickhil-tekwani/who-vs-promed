[Following extensive pressure over the past weeks, government denials, and
gossip over who would head up what, 3 separate but presumably
interconnected inquiries into the handling of the FMD epidemic in the UK
have been announced. - Mod.MHJ

The government today announced 3 separate independent inquiries into the
foot and mouth outbreak, but none of them will be the full public
investigation that many politicians and farmers have called on the
Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to deliver. The
environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, said the inquiries will cover the
government's handling of the outbreak, a scientific review of farming
epidemics, and the future of farming and food in the UK. Ms Beckett said it
would be "an inquiry process" rather than an "all-singing, all-dancing
public inquiry." [Details are listed below along with all the other
inquiries in hand in the UK. - Mod.MHJ
The government reiterated that while foot and mouth disease is still
present, the main priority must be to eradicate it. Although [there will
[be preliminary work, the inquiry will not formally begin until it is
clear it will not distract from eradicating the disease. The National
Farmers Union said it would welcome any "fully transparent" inquiry.
The announcement came as the Welsh assembly announced the cull of thousands
more sheep on the Breton Beacons. Between 2000 and 4000 [more animals are
expected to be killed in a bid to halt the spread of the disease across the
Welsh mountain range, said Tony Edwards, the region's chief vet. Some 6500
sheep have already been culled in the mountains. The Welsh rural affairs
minister, Cary Jones, said the disease was not endemic in the Beacons but
was spreading slowly, making it vital that the assembly act quickly to put
"firebreaks" in place.

Details of the 3 independent inquiries into foot and mouth disease, which
will report to Tony Blair and Margaret Beckett:
1. Lessons to be learned from the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak: This
inquiry -- chaired by Dr Ian Anderson of BT [British Telecommunications --
will make recommendations on how the government should handle any future
major animal disease outbreak. He will identify the strengths and
weaknesses of the government's handling of the current crisis. The inquiry
will not be launched until the current outbreak is under control, and will
report 6 months from the time it is set up.
2. Scientific review: Sir Brian Fillet will lead this review, to be carried
out by the Royal Society. It will study the transmission, prevention, and
control of infectious diseases in livestock, asking about the potential
risks of future farm epidemics and whether the UK has the necessary early
warning systems in place to prevent future infections. The review will
consider preventative measures such as vaccination and their effects on
farming. The Royal Society will also consider possible health hazards for
humans resulting from livestock epidemics. It expects to report by next summer.
3. Policy commission on the future of farming and food: The policy
commission was one of Labor's manifesto pledges, and it will be led by Sir
Don Curry, the former chairman of the meat and livestock commission. It
will advise the government on how to create "a sustainable, competitive,
and diverse farming and food sector which contributes to a thriving and
sustainable rural economy." The commission will study how policy options
affect the environment, the economy, and the health and welfare of
livestock. It will cover only England, as farming policy in Scotland,
Wales, and Northern Ireland has been devolved. The government has asked the
commission to report by the end of the year.
In addition to those 3 inquiries, 8 more investigations will be conducted
in the UK and Europe:
1. European commission: The EC will conduct a fraud investigation into the
compensation payments being made to farmers, after an EURO committee
criticized the government's decision to let farmers choose their own
experts to make farm valuations in the wake of a cull.
2. Defra agriculture select committee: The committee will begin questioning
Ms Beckett and other key players involved in the current crisis in October.
3. National audit office investigation, part 1: The NAO [National Audit
Office has already begun a "value for money" investigation into the
government's contingency planning for foot and mouth and "the state of
preparedness" at the time of the outbreak.
4. NAO investigation, part 2 : This investigation -- limited to England and
Wales -- will ask whether the government responded to the outbreak in a
cost-effective manner, and will look at the overall cost of foot and mouth,
both in immediate public expenditure and the wider economic impact.
5. Public accounts committee: These generally follow from NAO reports,
forcing the government to answer questions about the conclusions drawn by
the NAO investigators.
6. Royal Society of Edinburgh: Scotland's scientific review will be similar
to the Royal Society study ordered by the government.
8. Tourism committee: No details exist about this proposed inquiry, but it
will no doubt consider the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak on the
UK's tourism industry.
9. Food and Veterinary Office: The European Commission's envoy has been
studying foot and mouth controls and will issue a final report by the end
of this month.
