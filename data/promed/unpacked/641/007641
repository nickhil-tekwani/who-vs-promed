Dairy facial eczema (FE) can cost individual farmers more than [NZD] 100 000 [about USD 64 270] a year in lost milk production, a recent study has found.

The Ministry for Primary Industries' (MPI) Sustainable Farming Fund is supporting the Facial Eczema Action Group -- made up of veterinarians, dairy farmers and rural professionals -- to explore ways of raising awareness of FE so that more farmers take preventative action.

Many cows don't show clinical signs of FE. As a result, farmers often don't know why milk loss is happening and end up drying off their cows early.

"It's hitting farmers hard in the pocket -- they're losing 0.14-0.35 kg milk solids per cow per day. We worked out that one of the herds in our study had lost [NZD] 125 000 [about USD 80 330], just in milk production" says Emma Cuttance, a dairy veterinarian and head of Veterinary Enterprises Group (VetEnt) Research, which is leading the project.

"Often, people don't think FE is as big an issue as it is, because about 95 per cent of the cattle getting the disease won't display obvious skin lesions, even though the FE is causing damage to their livers.

"If our project can improve the number of farmers effectively managing this disease by even 20 per cent, it will make a phenomenal improvement to the productivity, animal welfare, and sustainability of the dairy industry."

Zinc is currently the main way of treating FE, but many farmers don't administer enough to control the toxin causing FE said Cuttance.

"Blood testing is the best way to determine how badly affected the cows are if they have FE.

"However, getting farmers to do blood tests can be tricky because of the cost and time involved."

The project team brought in AgResearch to examine the wellbeing of cows affected by FE to see if there are other ways of identifying clinical signs.

The 1st trial involved putting pedometers on cows to observe their movements. Having found no real difference in their behaviour compared to healthy cows, they moved on to analysing the blood profile of affected cows.

"Stress and pain can be detected in the blood" although analysis of the results is still in progress said Cuttance.

Another approach the team is exploring is photographing damaged livers at the meat works.

"If processing plants were required to grade livers according to damage and report back to farmers it would increase understanding of how serious the issue is."

The next step is to get the word out via a range of resources, which will be made available through DairyNZ's website. These include an online cost calculator, an investigation tool for testing zinc, and educational videos and webinars.

Steve Penno, Director Investment Programmes at MPI, said the support of this project recognised FE was an issue needing to be addressed.

"Whichever way you look at it, it's in farmers' best interests to proactively manage this disease -- both in terms of improving cattle health and wellbeing and the bottom line."

More information about facial eczema
------------------------------------
Dairy facial eczema (FE) is caused by a fungus growing on dead and dying matter in the pasture which releases a spore with toxins in it. It is most likely to grow and produce spores in warm and humid conditions. Zinc is currently the main way of preventing the disease.

Trial work done in 2014 examining zinc concentrations in the blood of 1200 cattle from over 100 farms in the North Island showed approximately 70 per cent of cattle did not have enough zinc to protect against facial eczema.

To help prevent the disease, farmers need to monitor the spore count on their own farms.

They are advised to start a management programme when spore counts trend upwards to 30 000 spores/g and continue until spore counts are 10 000 spores/g or below for at least 3 weeks. Blood testing is advised to check the effectiveness of zinc administration.

["Facial eczema is caused by a toxin (sporidesmin) produced by the spores of the fungus _Pithomyces chartarum_ growing on pasture. The fungus grows in the dead litter at the base of pasture in warm moist conditions. This condition can affect cattle and sheep.

Sporidesmin, when ingested by cattle, damages the liver and bile ducts.

The damaged liver cannot rid the body of wastes and a breakdown product of chlorophyll builds up in the blood causing sensitivity to sunlight, which in turn causes inflammation of the skin.

There is no cure for FE so prevention is the only way of protecting animals. To be effective, preventative measures need to be in place before eczema spores are found.

Preventative measures include monitoring pasture spore count and either dosing animals with zinc or spraying pastures with a fungicide.

Breeding cows which are more tolerant to facial eczema is a solution to reduce the impact from facial eczema in the long term.

Regarding dosing of zinc
------------------------
- Start early -- at least 2 to 3 weeks before the spore growth danger period.
- Weigh a representative sample of at least 20 cows of each of the mobs [herd] to be treated to calculate the dose of zinc required.
-- Fully dose cows with zinc: drenching with zinc oxide, water dosing with zinc sulphate, administering in feed or as an intraruminal bolus (such as Time Capsule, Face-Guard).

The more control a farmer has over the amount of zinc a cow receives the more likely it is the cows are receiving the correct daily dose. Zinc drenching and intraruminal bolus will, for this reason, provide more reliable protection than adding zinc sulphate to drinking water.

Zinc is toxic in high doses; care should be taken in calculating dose rates.

Producers may also be able to submit blood or serum through the veterinarian for a mineral profile. Doing such profiles for approximately 20 animals would provide a producer with an average of how much zinc should be supplement for animals with a designated weight range. This may also help confirm how deficient in zinc the animals really are.

Treatment:
Cows showing clinical signs of facial eczema can recover if prompt action is taken
- Dry off affected cows now, to reduce pressure on the liver.
- Put zinc cream on white areas of the coat and the udder (if affected).
- Move affected stock into dense shade. Indoors is best (hay-barn, calf-rearing and implement sheds) but make sure there is a good water supply and supplementary feed available for cows.
- Feed cows at night, so they are not exposed to sunlight and stop hard grazing so cows do not graze down into dead matter where the spores causing FE live.
- Feeding maize and/or silage can help, but cows will still tend to graze if they are kept on pasture.
- Make sure the diet is balanced, with good levels of energy and protein (and zinc. - Mod.TG)

In addition to the above, for very sick cows.
- Use a starter drench to boost metabolic function.
- Use vitamin B12 supplementation.
- Seek veterinary advice regarding additional pain relief treatment.

Practical indicators of recovery include liveweight gain and improvement in body condition score (BCS). Be aware animals can take up to 12 months to fully recover.

Animals with a previous history of clinical FE have a lower chance of recovery than previously unaffected animals.

When making decisions to cull cows act early before body condition score and the severity of the condition cause unnecessary distress and suffering. If sending cows for processing farmers need to be aware animals will not be accepted if emaciated or with severe skin damage (sores, weeping wounds, etc.)."
