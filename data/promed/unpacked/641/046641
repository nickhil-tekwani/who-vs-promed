The following is the latest updated report on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in Iran, issued by the Arboviruses and Viral Haemorrhagic
Fevers Laboratory (National Center) of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, in
Tehran, for the period 1 Jan to 21 Dec 2006.
This supplement our last report posted on ProMED-mail on 6 Jun 2006
[archive no. 20060606.1578] "Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever-Iran."
From 1 Jan to 21 Dec 2006, the total number of suspected cases was 100.
Among the 100 suspected cases from different provinces of Iran, we found 32
IgM positive, RT-PCR positive cases, 12 IgM positive, RT-PCR negative case
(the serum sample had been collected late, hence the RT-PCR result was
negative); and 2 IgM negative, RT-PCR positive cases (they suffered
fulminating illnesses and died before they could develop any immune
response). So we had a total of 46 (32+12+2) confirmed cases with 3 deaths
among the confirmed cases. The most infected province is Sistan-Baluchestan
province in southeast Iran.
It should be mentioned that for some of the biological reagents used in
serological survey, such as antigens and immune ascitic [fluids], we have
had scientific assistance from the Pasteur Institutes of Paris and Dakar.
(The recombinant antigen used in ELISA tests has been produced as a
scientific collaboration between our lab and the Unite Postulante de
Genetique Moleculaire des Bunyavirides of the Pasteur Institute of Paris).
Also, for different aspects of our molecular survey, we have had scientific
collaborations with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control,
the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health (Winnipeg, Canada),
and the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston [USA]).
