A Nevada County lake's beach remains closed following an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ infection that hospitalized 4 children, 2 of whom have developed a severe condition that can lead to fatal kidney failure.

As of Monday afternoon, 31 Jul 2017, the Nevada County Health Department had received reports of 6 children and one adult infected with or showing symptoms of _E. coli_, all of whom spent time recently at Lake Wildwood's Main Beach, according to the Nevada County Health and Human Services Agency. Four of the children were hospitalized, the agency reported. Two of them have hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially life-threatening condition. One child who was hospitalized has been discharged.

Symptoms of _E. coli_, which can take up to 10 days to appear after infection, include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and vomiting, according to a county press release.

The lake's Main Beach and its waters remain off-limits since county officials closed the recreational area on Friday, 28 Jul 2017, following reports of the outbreak. Water samples collected that day indicated high levels of bacteria considered an indicator for _E. coli_. The county has recommended that people avoid swimming in the lake entirely until tests show its other beaches to be safe.

The Nevada County Health Department and Environmental Health Department are still investigating the source of the _E. coli_. Animal feces may be responsible, the county's Health and Human Services Agency stated in a press release. County officials found no leaks from wastewater treatment facilities in the area of the lake.

Ken Cutler, a Nevada County health officer, urged people to seek professional care immediately if they believe they may have _E. coli_. "This illness is more dangerous in young children than healthy adults," a county press release quoted Cutler advising. "If there are complications such as dehydration or anemia, timely treatment can make a significant difference in your recovery."

[The mentioning of hemolytic-uremic syndrome confirms the suspicion that this cluster of cases, now 7, is caused by a strain of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 per cent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.

Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly, and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.

As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some being defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with co-expression of the toxin genes.

A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).
