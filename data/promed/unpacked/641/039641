State health officials have found 11 new cases of _E.coli_ 0157:H7 on the
Mississippi coast. _E. coli_ is a bacterium that produces a toxin which
causes severe illness and, sometimes, death. Health officials say the new
cases are in Jackson county and the Biloxi area. An investigation and
increased testing began earlier this month when _E. coli_ was determined to
have caused the death of a 16 month old Jackson county toddler. The source
of the contamination has not yet been found.

[The reference to "ll new cases" refers to a temporal group of 3 other
cases identified in the Mississippi coastal area in early November. There
have been no new relevant news releases on the Mississippi State Department
of Health website <http://www.msdh.state.ms.us/> since 7 Nov 2000. At that
time there was no molecular evidence such as pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis analyses for linkage (strain identity) of the isolates and
no information about common food sources. At that time the Department was
reporting a total of 18 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 disease for the calendar
year statewide. There have been increasing numbers of cases noted annually
since 1994 when the Department began monitoring the numbers, but that
probably reflects increased surveillance. Further information about strain
characterization and epidemiological linkage of cases would be of interest.
