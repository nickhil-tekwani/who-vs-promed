A mysterious disease has killed over 200 camels in Baracha area here, an owner of the camels said on Sunday [11 May 2014].

Haji Bilal Muhammad Hasni, owner of the camels, had to suffer the losses of millions of rupees as his 200 camels have been killed by a mysterious disease. He said the government should immediately send a team of doctors to the area, otherwise, the disease will spread in the whole region. He said each camel is worth Rs 150 000 [USD 1519.00].

[In the absence of any details on the event, such as its chronology, clinical signs, post mortem findings, the size of the susceptible population (denominator), age of the victims, presence of other animal species on the affected premises and their health status, etc., it is not even possible to decide whether the etiology of the event is of an infectious nature. Such information will be appreciated.

Pakistan's (dromedary) camel population is, according to the 2012 OIE report, one million animals. Previous mass mortalities in Pakistan remained undiagnosed (see references in the "See Also" section).
