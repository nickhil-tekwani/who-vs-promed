The centre on [Tue 27 Sep 2016] asked for a detailed report on scrub typhus, a bacterial disease, from the Himachal Pradesh government in view of the rising number of cases. According to sources, the disease has affected more than 700 people and claimed 20 lives. Union health minister JP Nadda assured support to the state for managing the endemic disease. "The ministry is closely monitoring the situation and, if requested, shall provide all logistical and technical support to the Himachal Government," he said.

Scrub typhus, which is caused by a group of microorganisms [in the family _Rickettsiaceae_], is usually transmitted by mites that are found in the shrubs in hilly areas. It can also be transmitted by lice, ticks, and fleas. [Chiggers, the mite larvae, are the vectors for scrub typhus. The pathogen is _Orientia tsutsugamushi_.]

In Delhi, where the disease in not very common, 33 people have tested positive and 2 have died of it so far this year [2016].

The symptoms of scrub typhus are similar to chikungunya, which is doing the rounds in Delhi. It begins with high fever, skin rashes, respiratory problems, red eyes, and unconsciousness. Some of the patients also develop joint pains, which is characteristic of chikungunya. It may progress on to respiratory distress, pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), kidney failure, and then multi-organ failure. If untreated, it can kill.

If detected in time, the disease can be cured using antibiotics. "Dengue and chikungunya are self-limiting viral diseases that do not have any treatment, apart from management of symptoms. In scrub typhus, however, administering antibiotics on time can save lives," said Dr Rama Chaudhary, professor of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). But, getting an early diagnosis is a problem in Himachal, where Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) is the only scrub typhus testing and treating centre.
