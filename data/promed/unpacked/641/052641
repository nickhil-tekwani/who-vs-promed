EEE: horses in Ohio and New York euthanized
-------------------------------------------
In what has been a long, hot, dry summer, more cases of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) have been confirmed in Ohio and New York recently.

Two horses were euthanized in Ohio, bringing the total for EEE cases in
that state to 4. Williams and Sandusky counties each have had 1 case in the
past couple of weeks, while Mercer County reported 2 cases earlier this
year [2010].

In Vernon, New York, a yearling colt was euthanized after displaying
clinical signs of EEE on 7 Oct 2010. He first exhibited signs in late
September and the New York Department of Health's Wadsworth Laboratory
confirmed EEE.

This was the 1st confirmed case in Oneida County since 2006, but the 7th
case in New York this year (the 1st New York case was confirmed in August
2010). Other New York counties that have had horses euthanized due to EEE
include Madison (1), Oswego (2), and Onondaga (3).

"The hot summer weather provided ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes
resulting in higher than normal instances of arboviruses including eastern
equine encephalitis and West Nile virus throughout New York state," health
director Gayle Jones told the Rome Sentinel.

Eastern equine encephalitis is caused by a virus that can infect birds,
horses, and humans. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and outbreaks
typically occur in late summer and early fall when mosquitoes are most
abundant. Infected horses could experience symptoms including paralysis,
impaired vision, difficulty swallowing, hanging their heads, and grinding
their teeth.

It is noteworthy that earlier this month (September 2010), there was a
human fatality from EEE in Onondaga County NY (see prior ProMED-mail
posting Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (27): (NY) human 20100905.3188).

Horses should be vaccinated at least every 6 months and probably more often
as the protective titers to EEE wane in less than 6 months.

This is a mosquito transmitted disease and horses cannot transmit the
disease to their care takers or owners. - Mod.TG]
