Clubroot discovery not surprising
---------------------------------
Clubroot spores have been detected in canola fields across Manitoba, but a Swan River grower might be the 1st producer in the province with dramatic yield losses because of the disease.

Ryan Immerkar, an agronomist, was called out to diagnose a production problem. Most of the field [yielded] around 50 bushels per acre, but a 10 to 15 acre patch was yielding 10 bushels per acre. He found galls on the roots [and] sent samples to a lab for confirmation. "It came back positive," said Immerkar. "There's more than one field now (on the affected farm) where it's showing up."

Anastasia Kubinec, Manitoba Agriculture, said the producer didn't report the disease to the province. She said the discovery isn't surprising. "There may be more cases this [2015] fall. We are finding it at low concentrations throughout the province through soil samples, [but] the spore levels in some areas are higher. We do suspect that we will have cases every year now."

In 2013, Manitoba Agriculture confirmed the presence of clubroot symptoms in 2 canola fields. Scientists had previously found clubroot spores in soil samples [ProMED-mail post 20120502.1120037]. Clubroot has been in central Alberta for more than a decade and producers [are] seeding varieties with resistance to the disease and growing canola less frequently, typically one crop in 4 years.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus-like organism _Plasmodiophora brassicae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease affecting nearly all cultivated members of the family, including oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties), cabbages, and turnip, as well as many wild species, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It is found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical highlands.

The pathogen enters root hairs and wounded roots. It multiplies rapidly causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem, taproot or secondary roots ("clubs"). Affected roots often decay before the crop has matured. Depending on the timing of infection in the crop cycle, symptoms may include wilting, stunting, and yellowing of plants, or premature ripening resulting in shrivelled seeds. Due to the distortion of the roots, plants may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Decaying roots release many resting spores, which can survive in the soil for a decade or more in the absence of a susceptible host plant. The disease can be spread with soil (for example on agricultural machinery), farming activities and infected plant debris. Use of clean planting material and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between fields is essential. Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Raising soil pH by addition of lime and experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to be effective (see ProMED-mail post 20120521.1139354).

The species is composed of numerous pathotypes which makes breeding crop cultivars with durable resistance difficult. In Canada, several of the pathotypes are known to occur in Alberta, and the disease was reported to have arrived in Saskatchewan in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20111007.3012). A new resistance-breaking strain is currently emerging in Alberta (ProMED-mail post 20150618.3447106).
