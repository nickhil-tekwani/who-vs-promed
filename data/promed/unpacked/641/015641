Slovakia: Apparent Increase in Fox Rabies - Request for Information
--------------------------------------------------
Several districts in the central Slovak region of Ziar nad Hronom have
warned inhabitants of a rabies infection that is being spread by foxes.
Back in December 2002 several municipalities in the region, including the
towns of Star Kremnicka, Lovcica-Trubn, Bansk Hodrusa, and Nov Bana,
reported cases of rabies. Veterinary authorities have confirmed that foxes
were responsible for the rabies in every instance.
In all the affected municipalities strict measures have been taken to
prevent the spread of the illness. Rabies is fatal and spreads from animal
to animal or from animal to man through a bite or scratch. Doctors said the
incubation period ranges from 20 to 60 days.

[There is some ambiguity in this press report. It is interpreted to mean
that the rabies cases referred to are confined so far to the fox population
(and perhaps some domestic animals). ProMED-mail is not aware of reports of
human cases of rabies infection in this region of Europe. Further
information would be appreciated to clarify the situation. An increase in
rabies in the fox population may require implementation of a wildlife oral
vaccination programme. - Mods.AS/CP]
