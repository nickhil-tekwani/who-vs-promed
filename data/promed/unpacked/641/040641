The number of flu cases reported in South Australia this year [2014] has more than doubled, putting pressure on the state's public hospitals. Health minister Jack Snelling said it had been the worst flu epidemic since the swine flu pandemic in 2009. He said this year's outbreak is on a scale that would test any public hospital system. "It's having a huge impact on the number of people who are presenting to our emergency departments, particularly the people who are vulnerable," Mr Snelling said. "The season seems to be starting later as well, which is a concern because I think we will continue to see our emergency departments and hospitals very, very busy for the next month or so."

Opposition spokesman Rob Lucas said 5 out of 6 metropolitan hospital emergency departments were full at some point on Thursday [4 Sep 2014]. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital had been full for a week, with some patients waiting hours to be treated. There had been ramping [ambulances unable to off-load patients] at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in recent weeks with patients treated in ambulances outside the hospital emergency department due to a lack of available beds inside. "Patients in our emergency departments have been subjected to huge waiting times, as our system is really struggling at the moment." Hospitals could have been better prepared, Lucas says. Mr Lucas said preparations should have been made to deal with the surge in demand for medical treatment. "The emergency department doctors have gone on the public record saying we have always known that at this time of the year there is going to be pressure on our system through flu outbreaks," he said. "They've known since March of this year [2014] that it's going to happen and they are the ones who are saying the government needs to cope with the system much better."

Mr Snelling said it was unclear why there had been such a huge increase in flu cases this year with health professionals still investigating the outbreak. The Minister said 100 extra hospital beds had been "flexed up" to try to provide extra capacity but called on people who had not yet had a flu shot to get vaccinated. "It's not too late to get a flu vaccination. It makes a big difference in whether you get the flu or not and if you do, how bad it is."

[According to the most recent WHO global update (see: Influenza (25): WHO global update 20140830.2736452), the southern hemisphere influenza epidemic is now in full swing, although relatively constrained to Oceania. In both Australia and New Zealand, ILI (influenza-like illness) activity and the number of influenza detections have increased. The most frequently detected virus has been influenza A(H1N1)pmd09. In Australia, ILI activity and the notification of laboratory-confirmed cases have shown an increase in the last few weeks. However, overall activity was lower than last year (2013) and consistent with the expected seasonal trend. In New Zealand, the ILI consultation rate was slightly above the seasonal threshold. Out of 824 respiratory samples tested, 231 (30 per cent) were positive for influenza, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 the most frequently detected influenza virus. In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable, with a decreasing trend observed in several islands. ILI activity, however, increased in American Samoa, Niue, Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. No antigenically novel strains have made their appearance, and the current vaccines remain well matched.

It may be that the epidemic in South Australia is greater than elsewhere in Australia, but there is a lack of quantitative information. South Australia is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the continent and has a total land area of 983 482 square kilometres. - Mod.CP
