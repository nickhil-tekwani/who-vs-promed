The Jordanian MoH issued a press release that had a much more thorough report on MERS-CoV and which indicates there is a 3rd person infected -- the 9-year-old son of the infected husband and pregnant wife (reported in ProMED-mail MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (94): UAE (Abu Dhabi), Qatar 20131129.2082330).

In the press release, Dr Hijjawi also mentioned that the male patient has 3 brothers and their wives, constituting about 20 family members, who were all ordered by Abu Dhabi not to travel or return to Jordan for 12 days, and undergo intensive tests to ensure they have not contracted the virus. After 12 days, if there are no symptoms, they can travel.

Dr Hijjawi also contacted the patients' family members in Amman [Jordan], learned more details about the patients' lifestyles, and asked the family members to get in touch with the MoH with any updates.

Hijjawi also said their investigation found that the patients passed through Saudi Arabia before going to the Emirates, predicting -- from the high incidence rate [of MERS-CoV] in SA -- that that might have been when they contracted the disease.

Dr Hijjawi also assured the press that Jordan still only has 2 cases announced in the past, and there are no new suspected cases.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[If these 3 cases (the parents and the 9-year-old child) are officially reported as laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, they will raise the global tally to 163 laboratory confirmed cases with 68 deaths.

The newswire above suggests that there was a history of travel for this family to Saudi Arabia during the incubation period. As there was travel within the region, the possibility of exposure to the MERS-CoV in either Jordan, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates is present. More information on the results of investigations of this family as well as the extended family discussed in the newswire would be greatly appreciated.
