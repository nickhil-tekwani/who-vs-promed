Official clarification on ProMED publication (Undiagnosed disease - Ecuador: domestic pig, RFI 20220923.8705748):

On 7 Sep 2022, an alert was received by local media related to a suspicion of classical swine fever (CSF) in the province of Esmeraldas, canton San Lorenzo, Mataje parish, which after the epidemiological investigation [it] was learned that 10 animals died 8 months ago with respiratory signs [AGROCALIDAD was not notified at the time]. AGROCALIDAD responded to this alert through the animal health inspectors of the province, who immediately mobilized to the area, where it was found the susceptible population was 51 pigs, which did not show clinical signs of officially controlled diseases. According to the testing protocol, 24 pigs were sampled for the diagnosis of classical swine fever (CSF). According to the diagnostic algorithm in the country, any sample suspected for CSF is also analyzed for African swine fever (ASF) as part of the routine surveillance established for this disease in the country. According to the results of the molecular biology laboratory of the directorate of AGROCALIDAD Animal Diagnosis, all samples analyzed were negative to PPC [CSF] and PPA [ASF] under the RT-PCR technique. AGROCALIDAD maintains [CSF control] using identification and vaccination of susceptible herds.

[We appreciate the 3 different attempts to contact ProMED on 23 Sep 2022, 24 Sep 2022, and 26 Sep 2022 to respond to the questions raised in the initial post regarding the possibility it could be ASF or CSF breakthrough in vaccinated animals. As noted in the clarification statement provided to ProMED above, both CSF and ASF test results were negative for all samples tested. -Mod.JH
