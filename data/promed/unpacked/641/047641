re: Foot and mouth disease situation in the European neighbourhood
------------------------------------------------------------------
The EuFMD Secretariat has received at 15.39 CET a message from Dr Irfan Erol, General Directorate of Food and Control, Turkey, confirming the detection of a serotype A strain of FMDV in outbreaks in October [2015], of close genetic relation to recent type A isolates from Saudi Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. The OIE and DG-SANTE [Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety] were informed at the same time.

The message is provided below. Confirmation via the ADNS and OIE is expected to follow. The Turkish authorities are thanked for sending this important information for the EuFMD member states.

The EuFMD Secretariat

"Dear Dr Keith and Dr Angot,

"I am sending this email on behalf of Prof Dr Irfan Erol.

"I would like to inform you that we have detected a new type A virus which has different antigenic feature in Van and Bitlis provinces in October [2015].

"According to our analyses this virus is close to the one existing in Saudi Arabia in the rate of 99 per cent and to the one in India in the rate of more than 99 per cent.

"Our FMD institute produced vaccine for this new strain. Within 15 days these vaccines will be used in outbreaks and risky areas. All control measures have been taken on site.

"Best regards,
Cihangir G Gumustepe
OIE Focal Point for Animal Disease Notification
Section Coordinator of Combat against Animal Diseases
Animal Health and Quarantine Department

Saudi Arabia reported to the OIE on 19 Oct 2015 an FMD outbreak in 2 herds of cattle and sheep on the same farm in the province Riyad. Reportedly, the outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype A designated "a new strain," had started on 13 Sep 2015, was confirmed on 19 Oct 2015 and the event declared resolved on 7 Oct 2015. The report included the following epidemiological comments: "After the detection of the outbreak, 45 000 heads of cattle and sheep were vaccinated, samples collected and sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Riyadh, and also to the OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD, The Pirbright Institute (United Kingdom)." The report states the date of serotyping by the Pirbright laboratory as 16 Oct 2015 (see ProMED-mail post 20151019.3727949). Obviously, reporting was belated, probably synchronised with the date of serotyping. It is not clear which vaccine was applied and on which ground the outbreak was declared "resolved."

According to the information available on the website of the world reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright (WRLFMD), a sample from Saudi Arabia, signed "15/09/2015 A SAU/1/2015", was received on 15 Sep 2015. It included 2 samples; both were serotyped A and -- according to the information currently available on the website -- belong to topotype "Asia" while the lineage is "unnamed." The full report, with genotyping results and a list of reference/close FMDV-A strains, is not yet available on the website. On 19 and 23 Oct 2015, 2 additional samples were received, their serotyping reportedly "pending" at present (http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm).

According to the EuFMD most recent monthly report (September 2015), the FMDV-A circulating in the region during 2014 was "A/ASIA/IND (genotype 18)". Full information and, in particular, the sequencing results and a dendogram, are anticipated.

At present, Europe is threatened by 2 FMDV strains: on its south-west, by the serotype O strain circulating in Morocco; and on its south east, by the new serotype A strain; both, it seems, are closely related to Indian strains.

The reported availability of a "vaccine for this new strain," produced by the Turkish FMD institute, as early as several weeks after its identification, is of significance. Further details on this (emergency, homologous?) vaccine will be appreciated. Has the batch undergone safety and matching tests? - Mod.AS
