The Valencian Farmers Association AVA-ASAJA has warned that this is the 2nd consecutive year that the fungus _Nakataea oryzae_ [is spreading in their] region.

This new plague was detected last year [2015] in some farms that had obvious problems of rot that did not correspond to any pathogen identified so far. The Valencian Institute of Agricultural Research (IVIA) concluded that the damage [was due to the] fungus _N. oryzae_ which has never before been seen with such virulence in Valencian rice fields.

[There is currently no] active substance that is effective against the disease. AVA-ASAJA notes that attacks of this fungus have been stopped in all those fields where last year [2015] the Department of Agriculture authorized the burning of rice straw, while the inoculum has [survived and] has continued to spread in fields [without] incineration.

Other cultural practices have not proven [to be effective] in many cases. Remains buried at shallow depths favour [survival of] the inoculum. Removal of straw is currently an unaffordable cost for most farmers.

This serious threat adds to the havoc caused this year [2016] by the fungus _Pyricularia_ [rice blast; see ProMED-mail post 20150903.3620399], weeds and aphids, warns AVA-ASAJA, who predicts "huge losses" if a specific plan to combat stem rot of rice is not [put into action].

[The fungus _Nakataea oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe salvinii_ or _Sclerotium oryzae_) causes stem rot of rice. The disease occurs in circular to irregular areas in fields and leads to premature death and lodging (collapse) of plants. Stalks develop black lesions, weaken at the water or soil line and then break, making harvest difficult. The presence of black sclerotia (fungal survival structures) is characteristic for the disease. Plants infected early yield poorly, and a high percentage of plants is killed. Wounds (for example due to mechanical or insect damage) may act as entry points for the fungus.

The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), and water (floating sclerotia). It survives between crops as sclerotia on straw or in soil. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures, including crop rotation, fluctuating water levels, and removal of pathogen reservoirs (such as burning the rice stubble, as mentioned above). Some fungicides may reduce disease incidence if sprayed early enough. However, use of resistant cultivars is considered the best means of stem rot control.

The fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ referred to above (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_) causes rice blast. Several outbreaks have been reported from the Valencia region in previous years (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20150903.3620399 & 20100906.3194). Symptoms of blast disease may, amongst others, also include rotting of stems and molecular methods are needed for an unambiguous distinction between the two pathogens. Thus, it is feasible that coexistence of both fungi may have remained undetected in Valencia previously.
