[It seems January 2019 has become a more active month for confirmations of MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia. With the addition of these 3 newly confirmed cases, it brings the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported by Saudi Arabia in January 2019 to 14, compared with 5 cases in December 2018, 7 cases in November 2018 and 9 cases in October 2018. In September 2018 there were 13 cases reported including 4 secondary cases (2 household contacts and 2 healthcare acquired). Interestingly, during the month of January 2019 there are 5 secondary community acquired cases that were reported - 3 in household contacts and 2 unspecified community acquired cases.

Today's report involves the occurrence of 2 secondary community acquired cases reported from Wadi Aldwasir city in Riyadh region. A primary community acquired case in an individual with a history of contact with camels was reported from Wadi Aldwasir city on 29 Jan 2019 and may well have been the index case in this at present small cluster of secondary community acquired cases. I wonder if these cases were healthcare acquired cases or perhaps household contacts but not labeled as such in the current report.
