confined to the buffer zones established around the outbreaks.
Surveillance measures continue to be implemented, with the municipalities of
Eldorado, Iguatemi, Itaquirai, Japora and Mundo Novo remaining under a ban. In
the latter municipalities, there continues to be a ban on the movement and
marketing of FMD-susceptible animals and their products and by-products, with
21 control posts having been set up.
To date, 810 rural holdings have been inspected and placed under a ban,
involving a total of 135 616 animals. A total of 23 outbreaks have been
detected and 5103 FMD-susceptible animals slaughtered and destroyed.
The report on animal movements during the past 60 days in the municipalities
currently under a ban was sent to all units in the Federation, and the
holdings that received these animals are under intensive surveillance.
2. Suspected outbreaks in the State of Parana:
On 21 Oct 2005, the Animal Health Department received reports of suspected
vesicular disease in the State of Parana in 4 holdings in the municipalities

involving the inspection of 89 101 FMD-susceptible animals. 11 control posts

and by-products was made legally enforceable.
