Global health agencies have plan to fight avian flu
-----------------------------------------------
International health organizations have come up with a plan to control H5N1
avian influenza within a decade and want more than USD 100 million in
donations to fund it, according to reports from a conference in Malaysia.

The plan was prepared by the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in
cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), according to an
Agence France-Presse (AFP) report today [5 Jul 2005].

Joseph Domenech, the FAO's chief veterinary officer, was quoted as telling
reporters at the conference in Kuala Lumpur, "it's an international crisis,
it has to be an international vision for awareness, surveillance and early
response."

The plan calls for spending USD 102 million to fight the disease in animals
over the next 3 years, the AFP report said. The plan is now being
circulated among potential donor countries, which called for more
information on disease-control strategies when they were 1st asked for
contributions in February 2005, Domenech said. [see item 2 in 20050226.0609].

Domenech said donor countries have pledged less than USD 30 million so far
for containing avian flu over the next 3 years, according to a Reuters
report yesterday [4 Jul 2005]. He said the European Union has pledged
another 50 million euros [USD 59.531 million] for the period 2007-2011.

According to AFP, the plan advocates more research on the H5N1 virus,
better surveillance for disease in animals, openness in the way poultry
producers and governments report information about the virus, and the
appropriate use of vaccination, culling, and diagnostic tests.

Under the plan, initial efforts would focus on Southeast Asia, East Asia,
and South Asia, but efforts in the rest of Asia and in Africa, Europe, and
America would begin in October [2005].

Authorities will have to use poultry vaccination programs in some places,
Domenech told reporters. "In some countries heavily infected, there is no
way to get rid of the disease with pure stamping out methods, and
vaccination must be used," he said. Experts say vaccinating poultry for
avian flu viruses can sometimes backfire by turning birds into asymptomatic
carriers of the viruses.

In a statement yesterday [4 Jul 2005], the FAO said, "in some countries or
part of countries, such as in Viet Nam, where the virus is widely spread,
massive vaccination could be the only way to reduce infection in poultry to
protect humans."

The FAO said the Malaysia meeting would assess current practices and
regulatory measures in the production and marketing of live animals in Asia
for their potential effects on human health.

The 2-day meeting in Kuala Lumpur was organized by the FAO, OIE, and WHO.
In his opening statement at the meeting, Domenech said the avian flu
situation remains critical and needs more attention, according to the FAO
news release issued yesterday [4 Jul 2005].

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza must be considered an endemic disease
and must be controlled at source in animals," Domenech stated.

According to an AFP report yesterday [4 Jul 2005], Domenech called on China
to be more open about its efforts to control avian flu and urged the
country to curb the use of human antiviral drugs in poultry. He called the
use of human flu drugs by Chinese farmers "a big concern."

The Washington Post reported recently that Chinese farmers had used the
antiviral drug amantadine in poultry for years. The H5N1 virus is resistant
to amantadine, and the Post story said experts attributed that resistance
to the use of the drug in poultry. Chinese authorities said they did not
approve of that practice.

AFP quoted Domenech as saying at the meeting, "the situation is still not
clear, and FAO appeals to the Chinese authorities to provide current
information regarding the use of such drugs."

International Conference Draws Up Strategy to Fight Avian Influenza
---------------------
International animal and human health experts today unveiled a multi-point
plan designed to reduce the risk of the H5N1 avian influenza virus
spreading from poultry to humans, and appealed to the international
community to come forward with funds to make it work and help stave off the
risk of an influenza pandemic. (Logo:

The strategy was drawn up at a 3-day conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
attended by experts from around Asia, as well as by senior representatives
of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The plan will be the basis for urgent actions by affected states and will
be made available to the international community to help donors focus on
the areas of highest need.

The conference took place against the backdrop of a growing threat from the
avian influenza H5N1 virus, which has so far infected 108 people in Asia,
killing 54 of them and raising fears of an influenza pandemic. The virus,
which delegates were told is taking an ever-tightening grip in a number of
Asian countries, has so far led to the slaughter of over 140 million
chickens in an attempt to halt its spread.

The meeting agreed that the avian influenza situation in Asia was extremely
serious but determined that there was still a window of opportunity to ward
off a pandemic.

Delegates concluded that priority should be given to the situation in
small-scale and backyard farms, the scene of the majority of human cases
since the avian influenza outbreak became known in early 2004.
Recommendations covering this type of small-scale farming included:


1. To educate farmers and their families about the dangers of high-risk
behaviour and how to change their farming practices.
2. To ensure the segregation of different species, including chickens,
ducks and pigs, and to eliminate intermingling between these animals and
humans.
3. To provide adequate compensation and/or rewards for farmers to encourage
them to report suspected avian influenza outbreaks in their flocks and to
apply control measures.
4. To pursue the vaccination of poultry flocks as part of a multi-element
response to the avian influenza threat in high-risk areas.

''We agreed that it is vital to urgently change or even end a number of
farming practices that are dangerous to humans,'' said Dr Joseph Domenech,
Chief Veterinary Officer with the FAO. ''These include the way chickens,
ducks and pigs are raised in close proximity to each other, often with no
barriers between them and humans. Another area of concern is wet markets,
where animals are often slaughtered in unsanitary conditions. These
activities constitute a high risk to people who are exposed to contaminated
animals or products, such as blood, faeces, feathers and carcasses.''

These practices increase the danger of an interspecies transmission of
avian viruses, with the risk of an exchange of genetic material and the
emergence of a new virus that could endanger human health.

Dr Shigeru Omi, Regional Director of the Western Pacific Region of the
World Health Organization, welcomed the strategy and said it would give the
world a fighting chance to beat the H5N1 virus. ''We have no illusions
about hard the job will be,'' he said, ''but we are not powerless. This
plan gives us a real chance to make a mark on history -- as long as we work
together with maximum energy and commitment.''

Dr Dewan Sibartie, Deputy Head of the Scientific and Technical Department
of OIE, explained that it had been imperative to come up with a plan that
would work. He added: ''The acceptance of vaccination by WHO and the
international scientific community as an important additional tool in the
control of the disease in animals is particularly welcome, provided that
the vaccine used complies with OIE standards and that vaccination is
carried out under the supervision of OIE and veterinary services.''

The conference agreed that implementing the recommended measures would be
beyond the financial means of most of the affected countries and called on
the international community to help with funding. ''What this action plan
will cost is nothing compared with the financial and economic consequences
of an influenza pandemic,'' said Dr Sibartie.

An FAO and OIE strategy for the control of avian influenza in Asia will
cost around USD 100 million to support surveillance, diagnosis and other
control measures, including vaccination. ''Without international support,
poor countries will not be able to battle bird flu,'' said Dr Domenech.

WHO estimates the cost of an effective response on the public health front
at about USD 150 million, mainly for capacity building in affected
countries, including emergency support in the areas of laboratory
diagnosis, vaccine development, surveillance and public education. Some of
the funds would be earmarked for antiviral drugs and personal protective
equipment for people most at risk of infection.

[An OIE press release included the following statement by its
Director-General, Dr. Bernard Vallat:

"The OIE again claims that more efforts and resources be directed to
containment of the virus in animals in rural areas. A minor part of the
resources legitimately allocated by countries for the prevention of the
human pandemic (for example for antivirus and vaccine stocking) could be
sufficient for financing sustainable, concrete actions at [the] local level
to eliminate the virus at the animal source. This is likely to include
support for compensation for losses suffered by farmers and should also
encompass education on safe poultry keeping and marketing of live animals.

National Veterinary Services in the entire region should be perfectly
organized and be given infrastructures and appropriate public resources for
the early detection and rapid response to animal disease outbreaks. Also,
they should be given means to carry out and control the vaccination of
birds when it occurs." - Mod.AS]
