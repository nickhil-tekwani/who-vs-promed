An outbreak of syphilis cases among young people is alarming health officials in Johnson County. Dr Craig Moorman, the Johnson County health officer, says the county has 25 confirmed or suspected cases of the disease. He tells the Daily Journal (http://bit.ly/RSHbxg) that most of those infected are in their mid-teens to mid-20s.

Indiana has seen increases in cases of primary and secondary syphilis in recent years. The number of reported cases jumped from 140 in 2008 to 175 in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A majority of those cases have occurred in Marion County, which saw a 3-year outbreak starting in 2007 that prompted concerns that Indianapolis was at risk of repeating its dubious 1999 distinction of leading the nation in new syphilis cases. The 1999 outbreak prompted an extensive education and screening campaign.

Moorman said his department began noticing the increase in cases after being notified by the Bell Flower Clinic, which is part of the Marion County Health Department. Lisa DeVault, the Johnson County Health Department's director of nursing, said people need to contact their doctor quickly if they believe they might be infected. "It's very crucial to get treatments within the 1st year of being diagnosed. Otherwise, there's long-term effects," DeVault said.

Short-term symptoms of syphilis can include sores, rashes, hair loss, headaches, and other flu-like symptoms. Pregnant women can pass the disease on to their unborn children, causing birth defects or stillbirths, DeVault said. Untreated cases have been known to cause dementia and death. Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics. That treatment is most effective if administered within the 1st year of infection, DeVault said.

[Johnson County, where this infectious syphilis (primary and secondary) outbreak is reported to be occurring, is adjacent to Marion County to the north, which is coterminous with the city of Indianapolis, the Indiana state capital and its largest city with a population of 829 718. Franklin, with a population of 23 712, is a city in Johnson County that is about 20 miles (32 km) south of Indianapolis.

In 1998, when infectious syphilis was nationally at the lowest rate ever reported (2.6 cases per 100 000 population, or 6993 total cases), half of all new cases were reported from only 28 counties. At the time, Marion County, Indiana ranked 7th in the nation with 161 cases of infectious syphilis with a rate that was greater than 7 times the national rate (http://www.cdc.gov/stopsyphilis/factPDF/marion.pdf).

Although the number of cases in Marion County peaked at over 400 cases in 1999, the number of cases subsequently decreased to less than 50 cases per year between 2002 and 2007, as a result of a campaign to control syphilis. However, in 2008, cases of infectious syphilis once again increased and continued to increase yearly. The epidemiology of infectious syphilis in Marion County was reported in a power-point presentation by Janet Arno, MD and Jutieh Lincoln, MPH of the Marion County Public Health Department, on 9 Feb 2011 and is available at http://www.mchd.com/Syphilis/2008/pdf/mc_syphilis_outbreak_08_to_10.ppt. This presentation is summarized as follows:

Between 2008 and 2010, the outbreak shifted from mostly white Americans to mostly African Americans and from middle-aged to younger adults; males (especially men who have sex with men or MSM) accounted for most cases, but the proportion of females and heterosexuals increased. High-risk behavior contributed to the outbreak, such as drug use during sexual intercourse, sexual intercourse with unknown persons, use of the Internet to meet partners, and sexual intercourse without condom. Cases increasingly concentrated in central Marion County and lower income areas.

The infectious syphilis rate in Marion County for African Americans was reported to be nearly 39 times greater than the rate for white Americans; 91 percent of cases were among African Americans (79 percent of cases nationally (http://www.cdc.gov/stopsyphilis/factPDF/marion.pdf).

We are not told the details of the epidemiology of the current outbreak of infectious syphilis in Johnson County, but it would be important to know if it is similar to or different from that of Marion County so that appropriate control efforts can be initiated.
