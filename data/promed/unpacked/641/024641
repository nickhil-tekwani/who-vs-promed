The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found residues of the weed killer glyphosate in samples of U.S. honey, according to documents obtained by the consumer advocacy group U.S. Right to Know through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some samples showed residue levels double the legally allowed limit in the European Union.

There is no legal tolerance level for glyphosate in honey in the U.S., so any amount of detectable glyphosate in honey could technically be considered illegal. Some of the honey tested by the FDA had glyphosate residues at 107 parts per billion, well more than the 50 parts per billion set as a maximum allowed in the European Union, the documents state.

Records obtained from the FDA, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by U.S. Right to Know detail a range of revelations about the federal government's efforts to get a handle on rising concerns about glyphosate. In addition to honey, the records show government residue experts discussing the prevalence of glyphosate found in soybean samples and the belief that there could be a lot of "violation for glyphosate" residue levels in U.S. crops.

Glyphosate, the key ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, is the most widely used herbicide in the world, and concerns about glyphosate residues in food increased after the World Health Organization in 2015 said its cancer experts determined glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen. Other international scientists have raised concerns about how heavy use of glyphosate is impacting human health and the environment.

Even though the FDA annually examines foods for residues of many pesticides, it has declined to test for glyphosate residues for decades. It was only in February of this year [2016] that the agency said it would start some limited testing for glyphosate residues. That came after many independent researchers started conducting their own testing on various foods 2 years ago, finding glyphosate in an array of products, including flour, cereal and oatmeal.

[Glyphosate is a chemical also known as RoundUp and is very widely used. There are crop seeds genetically modified to produce RoundUp ready plants. While some testing has shown that glyphosate sprayed directly on a bee produces little toxicity, there is scant published research regarding the length of time that RoundUp nectar from seeds or plants treated with glyphosate has been collected by bees, and whose bee offspring may have over several or many bee generations developed a sensitivity to this chemical. There are discussions [presently no firm proof] that this may be a factor in colony collapse disease. While there is ongoing research and work on this idea, the publications are difficult to find.

While this chemical may or may not ever be proven to have a link to colony collapse disease, it has clearly been shown to be in honey. Glyphosate is not a chemical bee producers would spray on their hives. So this may not be an artificial contamination but rather something the bee is bringing back to the hive and is capable of being in the honey.

Parts per billion sounds like a small amount, but, over time, even these small amounts do add up and take a toll. The European Union has put regulations on this chemical in honey, One has to wonder what levels will be set for the USA, when will they be set, and how much money will be poured into more research on this topic. - Mod.TG]
