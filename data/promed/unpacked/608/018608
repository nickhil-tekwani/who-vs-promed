Bovine anthrax outbreak, General Madariaga, Province of Buenos Aires
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On [1 Feb 2014] the laboratory was sent 2 metatarsal bones for diagnosis, and _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated from both bones. The affected animals were from a herd of 350 yearling heifers (18 months old in fact), of which 15 had died. The affected estancia [ranch] has just had 20 days of summer rain following a period of severe drought. The animals had not been vaccinated.

There was some non-coagulating haemorrhage from the affected animals. When the veterinarian arrived at the estancia, the carcasses had already been skinned, and none of the farm hands had worn any protective gloves or other clothing. So he instructed them of the need for disinfection, and at the 1st suspicion of a cutaneous infection to go see their doctor. The carcasses were covered by thick plastic tarpaulins in the standard "Tapado Controlado" manner.

[In my experience, those are some darn lucky gauchos.

The function of rain in the epidemiology of anthrax is to float the spores up to the soil surface. There is some evidence that it might also encourage a limited amount of germination and multiplication, before resporulation occurs. The rain softens the soil, and so cattle consume soil while grazing on the new emerging, tasty forage.
