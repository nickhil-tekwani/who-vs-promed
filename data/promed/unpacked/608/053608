Echinococcosis (hydatid cysts) in the fox population, France
------------------------------------------------------------
The veterinary adviser to hunting in this area [Normandy] has informed me
that there is an outbreak -- perhaps endemic -- of echinococcosis in the
fox population in eastern, north eastern, and central France.
Echinococcosis is caused by the ingestion of meat infected by the larvae of
_Echinococcus granulous_ (a tapeworm) or by ingestion of eggs [excreted] in
the stool of an infected animal.
This disease is a zoonosis. The adult worm can also be found in the
intestines of dogs, cats, wolves, moose, sheep, and I think also cattle.
The embryos penetrate the intestinal wall and the portal circulation
carries them to the liver where cysts are formed.
When the cyst is eaten by a suitable host the scolices are released into
the gastrointestinal tract where they develop into adult (tape)worms. The
infection is passed on in the parasite's eggs in the excrement of the
infected animal/human.
Mebendazole and albendazole have been used widely in treatment.
French citizens have been told, over the radio and on the television, to
pay attention and wash [thoroughly] their home-grown and other vegetables.

[According to the most recent available report from France to the OIE
(Office International des Epizooties) about Echinococcosis/hydatidosis
(2004), the parasite is endemic, and surveillance in bovines and ovines is
(was...) carried out in abattoirs.
Romig and colleagues provided useful background in their review: The
present situation of echinococcosis in Europe (Parasitol Int 2006; 55
Suppl: S187-91), whose abstract follows:
"Abstract
--------
"The taxonomy of Echinococcus is presently undergoing major changes, the
paraphyletic _Echinococcus granulosus_ being split into several distinct
species. In this review, an attempt is made to assess the present
epidemiological situation in Europe separately for each species
(_Echinococcus multilocularis_, _Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto_,
_Echinococcus equinus_, _Echinococcus ortleppi_, and _Echinococcus sp._).
"For _E. multilocularis_, an increasing density of infected host animals is
apparent in central Europe, and, possibly, a range increase has occurred.
Prevalence rates in foxes have risen in many agriculturally dominated
landscapes of France, The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Slovakia and
Poland, but the life cycle is now also established in many urban areas,
where red foxes occur with high population densities. _E. granulosus s. s._
(the former 'sheep strain') is still frequent and a public health problem
in many parts of the Mediterranean region and re-emergence after failed
control campaigns is observed or suspected in Bulgaria and Wales. No recent
data on the cattle-transmitted _E. ortleppi_ and the horse-transmitted _E.
equinus_ are available, but their relevance for human health seems to be
minor. The same may apply to the 'pig strain' and the newly described
'European cervid strain,' which both belong to a cluster of genotypes whose
taxonomy is not yet resolved (_Echinococcus sp._)." - Mod.AS
From the human health point of view, _E.multilocularis_ has a focus in
eastern France and it is important to be sure it really is _E.granulosus_
here. _E.multilocularis_ has been spreading northwards in Germany for
several years, and we found the 1st 2 infected foxes in Denmark more than 5
years ago, but there have been no new reports since to my knowledge. - Mod.EP]
