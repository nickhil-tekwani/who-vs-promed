At least 13 people in Washington and four in Oregon have been sickened by a
salmonella infection that health officials linked to an unpasteurized orange
juice from Arizona.
Patient interviews revealed the orange juice, distributed by Sun Orchard Co.
from its Tempe, Ariz., plant, was used at most of the locations where the
Oregon and Washington individuals are thought to have been infected, state
and federal health officials said Friday.
Of the 13 Washington cases, at least eight people drank fruit drinks that
contained the juice.
"Genetic fingerprinting tests indicate that people in Washington and Oregon
got the illness from the same source," said Dr. John Kobayashi,
Washington's chief communicable disease epidemiologist.
_Salmonella_ is a bacteria that causes diarrhea, cramps, headache, fever,
vomiting and dehydration. Treatment consists of rest and drinking plenty of
fluids. While salmonella infection is highly unpleasant, it is usually not
life-threatening.
Sun Orchard is voluntarily recalling a product labeled "Fresh Squeezed
Orange Juice" from Arizona, California, Washington and Oregon.
The FDA and the company have found no salmonella in tests of the juice but
the company is recalling it in the interests of safety, said Betty Weiss,
Sun Orchard accounting manager.
The juice, shipped in gallon, half-gallon or quart clear plastic containers,
had a "use by" date between June 23 and July 8, Weiss said.

[Unpasteurized fruit juices seem to be implicated in tranmission of enteric
pathogens such as _E. coli_ 0157 and _Salmonella_ sp. with increasing
frequency. It would be interesting to know the results of the strain
characterization described in this report. - Mod.ES
