[1] Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region - Hong Kong alert

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [Fri 7 Jul 2017] monitoring a notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission about one additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) which was recorded from [30 Jun 2017 to 6 Jul 2017] in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It strongly urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The 35-year-old male patient, who was known to have sold and slaughtered live chickens at a market, had onset on [23 Jun 2017] and subsequently passed away on [30 Jun 2017].

Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The CHP's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below while handling poultry:

- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not
blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume them immediately.
- Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.

Abstract: We describe the epidemiology of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H7N9) based on poultry market environmental surveillance and laboratory-confirmed human cases (n=9) in Guangdong, China. We also compare the epidemiology between human cases of high - and low-pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) (n=51) in Guangdong. Case fatality and severity were similar. Touching sick or dead poultry was the most important risk factor for HPAI A(H7N9) infections and should be highlighted for the control of future influenza A(H7N9) epidemics.

Abstract:
Background: We conducted a phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell-grown inactivated H7N9 influenza vaccine for pandemic preparedness purposes.

Methods: Between [7 Apr 2015] and 27 May 2016, healthy adults aged 20-60 years were enrolled sequentially in phase I (n=40) and phase II (n=160) from 3 hospitals in Taiwan and randomized to receive 2 doses of whole-virus H7N9 vaccine (15 or 30μg hemagglutinin antigen (HA) with or without an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) at 21-day intervals. Safety up to 180 days and changes in hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers at 21 days after each vaccination was determined.

Results: Of the 200 randomized subjects, 193 (96.5 percent) received 2 doses of the study vaccine and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis for safety, and 190 (95 percent) were included in the per-protocol analysis for immunogenicity. Most adverse events were mild and transient; no death or vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Overall, higher immune responses were observed in the groups administered with 30μgHA formulation than in the other 2 groups administered with 15μgHA formulation. The highest immune response was observed in subjects who received 2 doses of the adjuvanted vaccine containing 30μgHA with HI titer, sero-protection rate, sero-conversion rate, and sero-conversion factor of 36.2, 64.6 percent, 64.6 percent and 5.7, respectively.

Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the H7N9 influenza vaccine containing 30μgHA with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was immunogenic and safe in adults aged 20-60 years.
