Detection of Schmallenberg virus in different culicoides spp. by real-time RT-PCR [received for publication 15 Jun 2012; early view (online version of record published before inclusion in an issue.]

Summary
-------
To identify possible vectors of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), we tested pools containing heads of biting midges (culicoides) that were caught during the summer and early autumn of 2011 at several places in Belgium by real-time RT-PCR. Pools of heads originating from following species: _C. obsoletus complex_, _C. dewulfi_ and _C. chiopterus_, were found positive, strongly indicating that these species are relevant vectors for SBV.

Results and Discussion
----------------------
Among the 134 and 44 pools of heads of parous females caught respectively in the region of Antwerp and Luik [Antwerpen and Liege] that were tested for the presence of SBV, 12 pools (5 from the region of Antwerp and 7 from the region of Luik) were found positive in the rRT-PCR detecting the S segment with Ct values varying from 28 to 38. These positive pools consisted of _C. obsoletus complex_, _C. obsoletus s.s._, _C. dewulfi_, _C. chiopterus_ and _C. pulicaris_. For all species except _C. pulicaris_, at least one pool was also positive in the rRT-PCR detecting the L segment that was performed to confirm the positive status of the pools. The pools with a Ct value of above 35 in the rRT-PCR detecting the S segment that were not confirmed with the rRT-PCR detecting the L segment likely represent low SBV-positive pools because all negative controls were continuously negative for SBV and the internal control sequences. The lower sensitivity of the rRT-PCR detecting the L segment in comparison with the rRT-PCR detecting the S segment probably explains why these pools were not confirmed for the L segment and, therefore, suggest that the rRT-PCR detecting the L segment is not suitable to confirm weak positive pools of culicoides.

It seems, however, appropriate that further evidence needs to be obtained before _C. pulicaris_ can be considered as a putative vector for SBV because for the moment, only one pool of this species showed a positive signal in the rRT-PCR detecting the S segment with a high Ct value of 37.9, which could not be confirmed by the rRT-PCR detecting the L segment.

The finding that pools of _C. obsoletus complex_, _C. obsoletus s.s._, _C. dewulfi_ and _C. chiopterus_ species were positive for SBV is a strong indication that these species can play an active role in the transmission and spread of SBV. This is further strengthened by the fact that the examined pools consisted exclusively of heads, suggesting that these midges act as real amplification vectors because the virus has reached their salivary glands and was not simply SBV positive after a blood meal on viraemic animals.

Our results are in agreement with recent results obtained by Danish colleagues that found 2 pools containing midges belonging to the _C. obsoletus_ group caught in Denmark, close to the German border, positive for SBV [see 20120313.1068612]. The 3 species that are identified here as local vectors for SBV have also already been identified previously as vectors for BTV.

Our results show that SBV already circulated in culicoides in Belgium during August and September 2011. This coincides with the period that the regional Animal Health Care centers (ARSIA and DGZ) in Belgium started receiving notifications of problems such as milk drop and diarrhoea on cattle farms where other endemic viruses (e.g. BVD, BTV, IBR) had been excluded. Further on, SBV was also retrospectively confirmed in serum samples collected from 2 Belgian cattle farms in September (ProMED-mail, 2012).

Although the number of culicoides tested is limited, our results indicate that during September and October 2011, a considerably high percentage of culicoides was SBV positive. If one considers that each positive pool of _C. obsoletus s.s._ caught in the region of Antwerp only contained one positive midge, this would result in an infection rate of 3.61 per cent in this species in the month of September 2011 in this region. Furthermore, a minimum of 3 of 110 culicoides caught in the region of Luik during October 2011 were positive. This relatively high number of positive midges could explain the fast and wide spread of SBV during the summer and autumn of 2011.

[The Belgian research team (in one South African and 3 Belgian institutions) deserve to be commended for their excellent work, which sheds awaited light upon the vector side of SBV. Apparently, the same 3 species of culicoides midges which had carried BTV-8 are responsible for the spread of SBV since the summer of 2011, within and beyond the territories which had been affected during 2006-2008 by BTV-8. The enigmatic route by which both viruses initially reached their European launch base in Benelux and Germany, remains to be unraveled.
