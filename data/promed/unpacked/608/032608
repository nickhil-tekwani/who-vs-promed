The Dutch food safety board has ordered a 7000 kilo consignment of beef to be withdrawn from the market because it may be contaminated with anthrax. Anthrax ["Anthrax" is the disease. They identified _Bacillus anthracis_ in the meat. - Mod.MHJ] has been found in 2 cows from a Slovakian farmer who supplied the abattoir (and) after the meat arrived in the Netherlands.

The NVWA said it does not yet know if the meat, which comes via a Polish slaughterhouse, has already reached the supermarket shelves, news agency ANP reports. However, there is only a very small chance the meat is contaminated [???] and that people could become ill, the food safety body said.

The meat has been delivered to 19 companies in the Netherlands and 26 elsewhere.

[I suspect that this is a knock-on from the outbreak in Presov, Slovakia, in late September 2014 and reported earlier this month (October 2014) to OIE which involved 3 beasts. We have seen no other OIE immediate anthrax notifications involving Slovakian farms. While processing the meat in the Polish slaughterhouse, cross-contamination of other cuts would be expected. A mess. - Mod.MHJ
