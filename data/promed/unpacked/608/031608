Alert issued on rare cattle disease
-----------------------------------
The state Health Department is warning Mexican-Americans living in
Southeast Arkansas about an outbreak of brucellosis, a rare disease that
causes fever, chills and long-term exhaustion.
The department issued alerts in English and Spanish on Thursday, asking
people showing symptoms of the disease to be tested. Dr. Sandra Snow,
medical director for the Department of Health's communicable disease
department, said health officials believe a group of Mexican-Americans
contracted the disease in Mexico.

[Humans contract brucellosis via contact with infected animals (e.g.,
cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses) or by consumption of contaminated milk
or dairy products. Patients usually recover, even if not treated, but this
disease can have a prolonged recovery from disabling weakness, arthralgia,
and fatigue. There are 3 species of _Brucella_ that commonly infect humans
and livestock (_B. melitensis_, _B. abortus_ & _B. suis_). It would be of
interest to know which species is involved in the cases described in this
communication. - Mod.ES
