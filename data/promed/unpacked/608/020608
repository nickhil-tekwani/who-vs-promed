CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in
many states and the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA)
National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) to investigate 2 outbreaks.
The 1st is an outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Altona infections, and the 2nd is an outbreak of human _Salmonella
[enteric_ serotype] Johannesburg infections. Both of these are rare
types of salmonella, and patients in both outbreaks have a similar
geographic distribution. Investigators are using the PulseNet system
to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. In
PulseNet, the national network of public health and food regulatory
agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA is analyzed from bacteria
obtained through diagnostic testing of ill people.

_S._ Altona outbreak investigation
----------------------------------
As of 27 Jun 2011, a total of 49 individuals infected with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Altona have been reported from 16 states. The
number of patients identified in each state is as follows: Georgia
(1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (5), Maryland (4), Michigan (1), Minnesota
(1), New Hampshire (1), New York (2), North Carolina (8), Ohio (9),
Pennsylvania (5), Tennessee (3), Virginia (4), Vermont (1), Wisconsin
(1), and West Virginia (2).

Among those for whom reporting dates are available, illnesses began
between 25 Feb 2011 and 6 Jun 2011. Infected individuals range in age
from less than one year old to 86 years old, and 39 per cent are 5
years of age or younger. 49 per cent of patients are male. Among the
44 patients about whom information is available, 12 (27 per cent) were
hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, patients answered questions about contact with animals
and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 33 (77 per
cent) of 43 patients interviewed reported contact with live poultry
(chicks, chickens, ducklings, ducks, geese, and turkeys) before
becoming ill. Of those who could recall the type of live poultry with
which they had contact, 32 identified chicks, ducklings, or both, and
25 (86 per cent) of 29 patients with available vendor information
reported purchasing chicks and ducklings from multiple locations of a
nationwide agriculture feed store, Feed Store Chain A. Ill persons
reported purchasing live poultry for either backyard flocks to produce
eggs or as pets.

In May and June 2011, laboratory testing yielded _S._ Altona bacteria
from multiple samples: 3 samples from a chick and its environment
collected from an ill person's household in Ohio, 3 samples collected
from chick and duckling displays at 2 locations of Feed Store Chain A
in North Carolina, and 3 samples from a chicken and 2 ducks collected
from an ill person's household in Vermont. Findings of multiple
traceback investigations of live chicks and ducklings from homes of
patients have identified a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio as the
source of these chicks and ducklings.

_S._ Johannesburg outbreak investigation
----------------------------------------
As of 27 Jun 2011, a total of 22 individuals infected with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Johannesburg have been reported from 12
states. The number of patients identified in each state is as follows:
Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Georgia (2), Kentucky (2), Maine (1), New
York (3), North Carolina (3), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (1), Tennessee
(2), Vermont (2), and West Virginia (1).

Among those for whom reporting dates were available, illnesses began
between 19 Mar 2011 and 24 May 2011. Infected individuals range in age
from less than one year old to 55 years old, and 82 per cent of
patients are 5 years of age or younger. 36 per cent of patients are
male. Among the 17 patients with available information, 6 (35 per
cent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Ptients were interviewed about contact with animals and foods
consumed during the week before becoming ill. 14 (74 per cent) of 19
reported contact with live poultry before becoming ill. Of those who
could recall the type of live poultry with which they had had contact,
12 identified chicks, ducklings, or both, and 9 (75 per cent) of 12
ill persons with available vendor information reported purchasing
chicks and ducklings from multiple locations of the same nationwide
agriculture feed store identified in the outbreak of _S._ Altona
infections, Feed Store Chain A.

Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live chicks and
ducklings from homes of ill persons have identified the same single
mail-order hatchery in Ohio identified in the outbreak of _S._ Altona
infections as the source of these chicks and ducklings.
