[1] Egypt - 37th human case, WHO confirmation

As of Mon 25 Jun 2007, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has
confirmed a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The
case has been confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory
and by the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory, US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3
(NAMRU-3).
The case is a 4 year old boy from Qena Governorate. He developed symptoms
on 20 Jun 2007 and was admitted to hospital on 21 Jun 2007. He is receiving
treatment and is in stable condition. Initial investigations into the
source of his infection indicate exposure to dead poultry.
Of the 37 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 15 have been fatal.

As of Mon 25 Jun 2007, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a
new case of human infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 3 year old girl from
Riau Province developed symptoms on 18 Jun 2007 and has since recovered.
Investigations into the source of her infection indicate exposure to sick
and dead poultry.
Of the 101 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 80 have been fatal.

[These reports are the official confirmation of the human cases of H5N1
avian influenza reported previously in ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza,
human (102): Egypt, Indonesia 20070623.2033.
It remains true that the majority of human cases of H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection are a consequence of contact with, exposure to, or
consumption of virus-infected domestic poultry, and that person-to-person
transmission has been rare or absent. The abilities to infect and transmit
efficiently among humans, properties essential for a novel influenza A
virus to cause a pandemic, may be more complex than supposed initially.
In the current issue of the Journal of Virology, Hui-Ling Yen and
colleagues describe experiments designed to evaluate the pandemic potential
of H5N1 influenza viruses possessing "avian-like" or "human-like"
receptors, properties assumed to be determinants of relative pathogenicity
(see: Avian influenza, human (178): receptor mutations 20061116.3279; Avian
influenza virus (03): virus receptor distribution 20060322.0893; Influenza
virus: receptor specificities 20051222.3658; Influenza virus, receptor
specificity 20040331.0877).
"A ferret contact model using experimental groups comprised of one
inoculated ferret and 2 contact ferrets has been used to study the
transmissibility of 4 human H5N1 viruses isolated from 2003 to 2006. The
effects of viral pathogenicity and receptor binding specificity (affinity
to synthetic sialosaccharides with 2,3 or 2,6 linkages) on transmissibility
were assessed. A/Viet Nam/1203/04 and A/Viet Nam/JP36-2/05 viruses, which
possess "avian-like" 2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) receptor specificity,
caused neurological symptoms and death in ferrets inoculated with 1000 50
percent tissue culture infectious doses. A/Hong Kong/213/03 and
A/Turkey/65-596/06 viruses, which show binding affinity for "human-like"
2,6-linked SA receptors in addition to their affinity for 2,3-linked SA
receptors, caused mild clinical symptoms and were not lethal to the
ferrets. No transmission of A/Viet Nam/1203/04 or A/Turkey/65-596/06 virus
was detected. One contact ferret developed neutralizing antibodies to
A/Hong Kong/213/03 but did not exhibit any clinical signs or detectable
virus shedding. In 2 groups, one of 2 naive contact ferrets had detectable
virus after 6 to 8 days when housed together with the A/Viet Nam/JP36-2/05
virus-inoculated ferrets. Infected contact ferrets showed severe clinical
signs, although little or no virus was detected in nasal washes. This
limited virus shedding explained the absence of secondary transmission from
the infected contact ferret to the other naive ferret that were housed
together."
The authors suggest that despite their receptor binding affinity,
circulating H5N1 viruses retain molecular determinants that restrict their
spread among mammalian species.
