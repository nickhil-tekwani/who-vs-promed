Newcastle Disease (ND) in Sydney Region, New South Wales
Further to my updated advice of 17 Dec 1999, I am providing the following
additional information.
Evidence of the presence of virulent viruses with amino acid sequences at
the cleavage site of the F protein of RRQRRF has been detected in three
poultry flocks in the area previously described as the Newcastle Disease
Free Zone with vaccination. This area is now designated as a Newcastle
Disease Infected Zone with vaccination and is described as the Mangrove
Mountain Control Area.
No virulent viruses have been isolated from these 3 flocks which have shown
little in the way of overt clinical disease. The diagnostic tests used at
the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong (AAHL), a designated OIE
reference laboratory for Newcastle disease, to demonstrate the virulent
characteristics are various combinations of the following tests:
encephalomyelitis;
RRQRRF by PCR testing of paraffin wax embedded brain and fresh brain, lung
and/or
tracheal tissue pool impression smears of the brain of chickens exhibiting
signs of CNS (Central Nervous System) based disease.
Virus isolation is still progressing in some cases.
In the absence of overt clinical disease, these flocks had been routinely
processed prior to these results becoming available. The farms are being
subjected to thorough decontamination procedures. In addition to the above
findings, a variant ND virus identified by AAHL with the cleavage motif
RRQGRF (one amino acid different from the specified virulent sequences),
designated PR32, had an ICPI of 1.60. As PR 32 is a novel virus which did
not produce any demonstrable clinical disease, AAHL is repeating the ICPI
next week.
The map[not attached or visible here - Mod.TG shows the Newcastle Disease
Infected Zone with vaccination (termed on the map as the Mangrove Mountain
Control Area) and a new surrounding Cumberland Surveillance Zone
encompassing the Greater Sydney region. Control over the movement of
product form the vaccination zone with audit of the movement protocols has
been implemented.
Vaccination within the vaccination zone was completed on Monday 20
December. Vaccination of restocked chickens is proposed to continue for the
next six months, at this stage, as farms are restocked.
