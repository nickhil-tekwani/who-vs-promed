The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 18 Jan 2019 the presence of virulent Newcastle disease (VND) in a small flock of backyard exhibition chickens in Utah County, Utah. This is the 1st case of VND in Utah, APHIS said.

According to APHIS, this case is believed to be connected to the current VND outbreak in California, as 3 of the birds at the premises were recently moved to Utah from Los Angeles County, CA. Since May 2018, 299 cases of VND have been confirmed in southern California, primarily in backyard exhibition birds, but also recently in 3 commercial egg operations.

APHIS said it is working with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) to respond to the finding. Federal and state partners are also conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area.

UDAF confirmed that exhibition poultry (i.e., privately owned/non-commercial chickens) imported from California at the beginning of January [2019] and placed with a small domestic flock (250 birds) in Utah County have tested positive for VND.

UDAF said it received a report of a possible case of VND in Utah County earlier this week [week of Mon 14 Jan 2019] and quarantined the site. VND in the birds was confirmed 17 Jan 2019 by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Iowa.

In Utah, the disease is currently contained to one domestic flock and has not been detected in any commercial poultry flocks, UDAF said.

"The disease is spread when healthy birds come in contact with bodily fluids from infected birds and contaminated surfaces," UDAF state veterinarian Dr. Barry Pittman said.

This disease can be transmitted through manure, egg flats, crates, vehicles, or farming materials or equipment, or through people who have handled these materials and their clothing, hands, and shoes, UDAF said.

[This article is concerning because this disease spreads so easily. While exhibition backyard flock may mean it is a show chicken, such as for a county livestock show, and while there are backyard flocks used for eggs and some meat production, and for showing in such local shows, the euphemism of backyard flocks is most often applied to fighting cocks.

The very fact this disease has been transported from southern California to Utah is very concerning. While USDA says they are working with UDAF, there has yet to be a plan announced on how to handle the situation in California. This is not encouraging for any possible containment of this situation. Consequently, I am not hopeful a plan for Utah and California is forthcoming. In fact, it appears to be getting rapidly worse. A return to 2003 or worse seems to be moving rapidly closer. - Mod.TG
