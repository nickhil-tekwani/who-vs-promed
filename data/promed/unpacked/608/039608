An old disease has become new again, with the growing emergence of positive cases of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle herds across the United States.

"Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease, which means it can spread between animals and humans," explained New Mexico State Veterinarian Dr Ralph Zimmerman. "When it spreads from humans to animals, we call it a reverse zoonotic event."

Zimmerman told the audience of the 2020 High Plains Dairy Conference that zoonotic diseases are on the rise worldwide. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 3 out of every 4 new infectious diseases in people also can be spread by animals.

The potential for TB to spread from humans to animals is especially concerning because about 1/3 of the world's human population is infected with TB. Cattle are a susceptible animal species, but the bacterial infection can be contracted by all mammals, including pigs, goats, deer, and other wildlife.

Exposure to wildlife is a potential form of transmission to cattle herds. In northeast lower Michigan, the deer population has been a concerning source of TB for many years. Recently, TB infections from Michigan deer have been shown to infect humans as well. In just the past 2 years, 5 DNR workers and 3 hunters have contracted TB, likely via their interaction with infected deer.

Zimmerman said TB infections can spread through respiratory droplets or saliva of infected hosts; via exposure to contaminated saliva, urine, or manure at feeding and watering sites; and from drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. Infected TB hosts can be in either an "active" state of sickness, in which they are visibly sick and contagious, or a "latent" infection period, in which the animal or person appears totally healthy and cannot infect others.

Vertical transmission to calves is a serious threat in infected herds feeding unpasteurized milk. Also, people consuming raw dairy products is a common practice in many parts of the world, including the countries of origin of a large share of U.S. dairy farm workers. In another presentation at the 2020 High Plains Dairy Conference, Dr Anabel Rodriguez, Assistant Professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, shared research findings on TB knowledge and infection risk factors among dairy workers in West Texas.

Of the 225 workers surveyed, about a 1/3rd reported consuming raw dairy products, either in their non-U.S. home country (81.4%) or while working on a US dairy farm (18.6%). Of the 140 workers in the study who were tested for TB, 10% tested positive for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).

The USDA's National Tuberculosis Eradication Program provides for TB surveillance by routine testing of animals at slaughter, as well as pre-movement health screening of animals before they are transferred across state lines. A slaughter check at a Minnesota packing plant recently detected TB in a beef cow from a herd in South Dakota, the 1st confirmed case of TB in the state since 2017.

TB infection in a herd can be financially devastating, according to Dr. Keith Poulsen, Director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. "Not only does the disease take a toll on animal health and productivity, but it can endanger workers and limit animal sales by the farm," Poulsen explained. "Herds confirmed infected will be placed under quarantine with routine, required testing and limited animal movement, probably for several years."

Quarantine might affect neighboring herds as well, depending on their proximity to the confirmed herd. And Poulsen pointed out that quarantine also could impact nearby bull studs selling genetics all over the world.

Zimmerman advised producers to adopt as many of the following tips as possible to protect herds and people from TB:
- Keep a closed herd, and raise replacement stock.
- Buy animals from an accredited TB-free herd.
- Test new animals prior to purchase; isolate them for 60 days, and retest before commingling.
- Restrict/eliminate contact between your herd and other herds.
- Disinfect trailers or facilities which housed newly purchased animals or animals not originating from your herd.
- Keep on-farm visitors away from your herd.
- Keep fences in good condition to separate your herd from wildlife.
- Have a comprehensive new employee hiring protocol that includes TB testing.
- Pasteurize waste milk fed to calves.
- Do not allow humans to consume unpasteurized milk from your farm.

In Wisconsin, Poulsen is championing an effort to bring health services to dairies to test and vaccinate workers for TB, as well as provide health screenings and other vaccinations. The Badger Partners in Health and Safety is working collaboratively with nursing schools and private funding sources to bring these services to migrant and under-served dairy farm workers in the state.

["Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious and communicable granulomatous disease caused by the acid-fast bacilli bacteria of _Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). It is commonly a chronic, debilitating disease, but occasionally may assume an acute, rapidly progressive course. _M. bovis_ is a widespread zoonosis, global in magnitude, and affecting nearly all species of vertebrates (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, buffalo, and camelids.) The disease is spread by direct contact, inhalation of infected droplets expelled from infected lungs, and ingestion of contaminated feed or milk. In most countries, TB is a notifiable disease. Overall, TB has an important worldwide impact on animal industries and human health. Control measures are based on prevention and eradication.

"Surveillance is a key element for the management of preventions and control programs. Surveillance for TB serves the purpose of enabling Veterinary Services to obtain an accurate picture of the scope of the disease in the US livestock populations; in the event of a disease outbreak, the course TB follows in livestock and wildlife populations for a given area over time; and permits timely intervention if the trend observed deviates from what is expected.

"Clinical description
Animals (cattle, bison, goats, and/or captive cervid) infected with _M. bovis_ are difficult to diagnose on clinical signs alone, even in advanced cases. Clinical signs may mirror the extent and location of lesions in the animal, plus any underlying toxemia, and be actualized as progressive emaciation; lethargy; weakness; anorexia; and a low-grade, fluctuating fever. A respiratory form may be manifested as bronchopneumonia with a chronic intermittent, moist cough with dyspnea and tachypnea. Also, superficial lymph node enlargement may be present."

"_M. bovis_ is most commonly found in cattle and other animals such as bison, elk, and deer. In people, _M. bovis_ causes TB disease that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, and other parts of the body. However, as with _M. tuberculosis_, not everyone infected with _M. bovis_ becomes sick. People who are infected but not sick have what is called latent TB infection (LTBI). People who have LTBI do not feel sick, do not have any symptoms, and cannot spread TB to others. However, some people with LTBI go on to get TB disease."

"Most people are at very low risk for being infected with _M. bovis_. People at higher risk include individuals who work with cattle, bison, or cervids (such as deer or elk), or products from these animals such as hides, milk, or meat. Examples of occupations or hobbies that might put people at increased risk include ranching, dairy farming, working in a slaughterhouse or as a butcher, and hunting. People who drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or consume dairy products made from raw milk are also at greater risk. People who might be at higher risk of _M. bovis_ infection should talk to their healthcare providers about whether they should be regularly screened for TB infection. Screening tests include the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (blood test)."
