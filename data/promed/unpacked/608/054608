_Alternaria alternata_ pv. _citri_ (brown spot of Minneola tangelos) came
to [EPPOÂ´s] attention because it was described in 1989 in Israel, as an
unusual disease of citrus.
Where: Australia (first report in 1966), Israel (in 1989), South Africa (at
least since the early 1980s) Turkey (in 1995), USA (Florida, in 1976). [But
see para. on " Possible identity" below - Mod.JW]
On which plants: Minneola tangelos (_Citrus reticulata_ cv. Dancy x _C.
paradisi_ cv. Duncan). Dancy and Ellendale mandarins, Murcott tangor
(mandarin x sweet orange), Nova and Idith mandarin hybrids, Calamondin
(mandarin x kumquat (Fortunella)), and Sunrise and Redblush grapefruits.
Damage: Infected fruit show sunken, dark brown spots (quality is reduced)
and many of them drop prematurely. Leaves present brown necrotic areas, and
in severe cases apices of young shoots can be completely defoliated.
Possible identity: _Alternaria alternata_ pv. citri. This disease observed
in Israel was thought to be similar to 'brown spot of Emperor mandarins'
which was first reported in Australia in 1966 (Pegg, 1966) and to
'Alternaria brown spot' of Dancy tangerines, and of Minneola and Orlando
tangelos which was then reported in Florida (US) in 1976 (Whiteside, 1976).
It is now considered that Alternaria brown spot is caused by _Alternaria
alternata_ pv. citri, although there is discussion on the validity of
pathovars for _Alternaria alternata_. In the literature, the disease has
sometimes been attributed to _Alternaria citri_, but the latter causes
quite other symptoms and has a different host range.
Pathway: Citrus host plants for planting (fruits with leaves?, fruits?)
from countries where it occurs.
Possible risks: Disease of citrus (although it does not attack all citrus)
which can affect yield and quality. Already present in Israel and recently
found in Turkey. Control reported as difficult (some fungicide resistance
is reported). The fungus can overwinter in lesions on leaves and stems, so
it is likely to be transmitted by propagating material. EPPO RS 98/179
