Indonesia's avian influenza death toll may have risen to 12 with the
death of a 48-year-old man in Central Java who was strongly suspected
of being infected with the virus, a health official said today [Fri
30 Dec 2005]. The man was admitted to the Tidar General Hospital in
the Central Java town of Magelang suffering high fever and
respiratory problems, said Nurul Safariah, Head of the City's Health
Agency. She said the man died after 10 hours of treatment.

"We have sent his blood samples to be tested by the national bird flu
monitoring center in Jakarta, which will further send the samples to
the (World Health Organization-affiliated) lab in Hong Kong,"
Safariah told Agence France Presse (AFP). She added that blood
samples had been taken also from the victim's relatives and neighbors
for further testing. Health authorities here test suspected cases
locally before sending positive results to facilities overseen by the
WHO abroad for verification.

The [H5N1 avian influenza] virus has killed more than 70 people in
Asia since 2003. Scientists warn that continued contact between
infected birds and humans may eventually result in the virus mutating
into a form that could be easily passed on by humans, sparking a
pandemic with a potential toll of millions.

Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous nation, was accused of
covering up initial outbreaks of bird flu. Most victims in the
archipelago nation have so far hailed from densely populated Jakarta
and its surrounds, where many people live in close proximity to
poultry, providing ideal conditions for the virus to pass to humans.

[As of 31 Dec 2005, if this new suspected human case of A/H5N1 avian
