Iraq: Avian Influenza Situation - As of 30 Jan 2006
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Iraq has confirmed the country's 1st case
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case
occurred in a 15-year-old girl who died on 17 Jan 2006 following a
severe respiratory illness. Her symptoms were compatible with a
diagnosis of H5N1 avian influenza. Preliminary laboratory
confirmation was provided by a US Naval Medical Research Unit located
in Cairo, Egypt.
The girl's 39-year-old uncle, who cared for her during her illness,
developed symptoms on 24 Jan 2006 and died of a severe respiratory
disease on 27 Jan 2006.
Both patients resided in the town of Raniya near Sulaimaniyah in the
northern part of the country, close to the border with Turkey.
Poultry deaths were recently reported in their neighborhood, but H5N1
avian influenza has not yet been confirmed in birds in any part of
the country. Poultry samples have been sent for testing at an
external laboratory.
A history of exposure to diseased birds has been found for the girl.
The uncle's source of infection is under investigation.
The Ministry of Health has further informed WHO of a 3rd human case
of respiratory illness that is under investigation for possible H5N1
infection. The patient is a 54-year-old woman from the same area who
was hospitalized on 18 Jan 2006.
Samples from all 3 patients have been sent to a WHO collaborating
laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic confirmation and
further analysis. An international team, including representatives of
other UN agencies, is being assembled to assist the Ministry of
Health in its investigation of the situation and its planning of an
appropriate public health response. WHO staff within Iraq have been
directly supporting the government's operational response, which was
launched shortly after the girl's death.
Iraq is the 7th country to report human H5N1 infection in the current
outbreak. The 1st human case occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003.

Turkey: Avian Influenza Situation & Assessment of the Outbreak - WHO Update 7
-----------------------------------------------
A WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom has now
confirmed 12 of the 21 cases of H5N1 avian influenza previously
announced by the Turkish Ministry of Health. All 4 fatalities are
among the 12 confirmed cases. Samples from the remaining 9 patients,
confirmed as H5-positive in the Ankara laboratory, are undergoing
further joint investigation by the Ankara and UK laboratories.
Testing for H5N1 infection is technically challenging, particularly
under the conditions of an outbreak in which large numbers of samples
are submitted for testing and rapid results are needed to guide
clinical decisions. Additional testing in a WHO collaborating
laboratory may produce inconclusive or only weakly positive results.
In such cases, clinical data about the patient are used to make a
final assessment
Assessment of the outbreak
--------------------------
The outbreak was investigated by international teams coordinated by
WHO, including teams of experts drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert
and Response Network. Teams in Ankara and Van province have now
completed their work, which has included an overall assessment of the
epidemiological situation, the effectiveness of control measures, and
the risk of further human cases. Staff departures took place over the
weekend [28-29 Jan 2006]. Mechanisms of close collaboration with the
Ministry of Health, established during the outbreak, will remain in place.
Epidemiologists in Van investigated several clusters of childhood
cases in families from the Dogubayazit district, where the majority
of patients, and all fatal cases, resided. Field investigations,
including interviews with family members, have found that almost all
cases had a documented history of direct exposure to diseased or dead poultry.
The investigation found no clear evidence of human-to-human
transmission and no evidence that the virus is now spreading more
easily from birds to humans. The vast majority of cases have occurred
in children aged 15 years or younger. This age pattern remains
puzzling, as adult members in some families were engaged in such
high-risk behaviors as the slaughtering of obviously ill birds yet
did not develop infection. This observation further supports the
possibility, raised previously during field investigations in Asia,
that some as yet unidentified genetic or immunological factor may
influence the likelihood of human infection.
Monitoring of patient contacts and of staff at hospitals treating
patients found no evidence of infection in these groups, further
supporting the conclusion that, in Turkey as elsewhere, the virus is
not spreading easily from person to person.
The WHO team found that patients received a high quality of clinical
care. The rapid detection of cases, facilitated by high public
awareness of the disease, may have contributed to the lower fatality
seen in Turkey compared with other countries reporting recent cases.
On 16 Jan 2006, WHO established a virtual network of clinicians
experienced in the management of H5N1 infection and other severe
respiratory diseases, allowing Turkish doctors to confer, in real
time, with experts elsewhere. 3 teleconferences have been held. At
present, all evidence, including laboratory and radiological
findings, suggests that the disease seen in Turkey is similar to that
seen in the Asian outbreaks. In all outbreaks, severe pneumonia and a
rapid progression to respiratory failure have been characteristic
features in severe cases of infection.
Data on cases in the Turkish outbreak show that patients were
hospitalized between 31 Dec 2005 and 13 Jan 2006. Dates of symptom
onset indicate that all infections were acquired prior to the
implementation of control measures. These have included heightened
surveillance for poultry outbreaks, culling operations, intensive
public information campaigns, contact tracing and prophylactic or
post-exposure administration of oseltamivir, and good infection
control practices in hospitals managing patients or investigating
possible cases.
In poultry, outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza are
now confirmed or under investigation in numerous provinces across the
country. Intensive culling operations are under way; some 1.3 million
birds have been culled to date. As in many parts of Asia, the poultry
outbreaks in Turkey have involved mostly free-ranging backyard
flocks. Control measures under this type of poultry production system
are more difficult and time-consuming to implement than those
involving outbreaks in large commercial farms. Full control of the
disease in birds is likely to remain a goal for some time to come,
particularly in view of the recurring risk that migratory birds may
introduce the virus.
Experience with this disease over the past 2 years in Asia has shown
that the risk of sporadic human cases persists as long as the virus
continues to circulate in birds. For this reason, some additional
human cases may occur, but the numbers are expected to be small. This
risk will diminish as culling operations further reduce the presence
of the virus in its animal reservoir and thus limit opportunities for
human infections to occur. High public awareness of risks to avoid
reduces these opportunities even further.

[The WHO report on the situation in Iraq adds an additional suspected
human case of avian influenza virus infection to the confirmed case
of H5N1 virus infection in the teenage victim. The death of the
girl's uncle, previously discounted as due to avian influenza, has to
be reconsidered also as a suspected case of avian influenza.
The report from Turkey confirms that all 4 fatal cases are included
among the 12 externally confirmed cases and that the likely number of
cases will not exceed 21. Data on the human cases in the Turkish
outbreak reveal that these 21 patients were hospitalized between Sat
31 Dec 2005 and Fri 13 Jan 2006. Dates of symptom onset indicate that
all these infections were acquired prior to the implementation of
disease control measures, a decidedly encouraging piece of
information. - Mod.CP]
