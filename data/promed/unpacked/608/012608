Bob Bender, coordinator of Michigan's bovine tuberculosis eradication group
formed in February, was cited as saying that an outbreak of tuberculosis in
white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the state had likely spread
to a small cattle herd in that area.
The story notes that one beef cow on an Alpena county farm was confirmed
Tuesday to have had bovine tuberculosis after testing positive in
preliminary tests and being destroyed for an animal autopsy, or necropsy.
The remaining 19-head cattle herd was being tested, he said. Bender was
quoted as saying, "The assumption is that the disease is so prevalent in
the deer population that that's probably what's infecting the cattle, but
we don't know that for sure."
Michigan has been designated by USDA as a bovine TB accredited free state
since 1979 and if another animal comes up positive the state will lose its
TB free status.
