Disease dooms rainbow trout
A virus forces officials to kill fish for 3rd straight year
--------------------
For a 3rd straight year, an outbreak of an incurable disease has forced
officials for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to destroy rainbow
trout being raised at Leaburg Hatchery.
Hatchery workers on Wednesday were ordered to kill about 50 000 trout being
held at the state hatchery on the McKenzie River off Highway 126 east of
Eugene.
As with similar outbreaks in 2002 and 2003, the culprit is exposure, or
infection, of the rainbow trout with infectious hematopoietic necrosis,
commonly known as IHN. In September 2002, almost a quarter-million trout
were destroyed at Leaburg. In October 2003, 33 000 rainbows were euthanized.
IHN is a naturally occurring virus that is endemic throughout Oregon,
Washington and Northern California. It initially attacks the blood-forming
tissues of the kidney. Younger fish suffer the effects of the disease.
External symptoms of the virus include lethargy, darkening of the skin and
bleeding at the base of the fins. According to biologists, adult fish carry
-- and shed -- the virus into the water, but don't die from the disease.
In 2002, biologists said that IHN got into the hatchery from adult
steelhead shedding the virus into the water upriver from the hatchery water
in-takes on the McKenzie as a result of a large run of steelhead and low
seasonal flows on the river.
Officials at the hatchery said that trout that test non-infected at the
hatchery will be released ahead of schedule -- and at
smaller-than-planned-size -- to prevent them from also contracting the
infection.
Officials said that the killing of the fish is in line with Fish and
Wildlife's Fish Health Management Policy. The policy lists procedures and
approaches to reduce disease agents and fish losses in the state.
The trout being euthanized have been raised in a pond where fish were
diagnosed in mid-June 2004 with the virus.
Past experience -- such as the 2002 outbreak at Leaburg -- shows that
hatchery fish losses can escalate dramatically from this disease, which has
no known treatment. Officials said that hatchery staff, fish pathologists
and other Fish and Wildlife staff members are working toward a solutions to
prevent future outbreaks at the hatchery. Those include cleaning the ponds
where the fish are raised, and trying to prevent the virus from getting
back into the hatchery via the water source.
The trout had been scheduled for planting throughout the Willamette Valley
during the fall. Officials said they will evaluate the impact of the fish
losses on trout stocking plans.
The rainbow trout are being killed with the chemical MS-222 (tricaine
methane sulfonate). It is in the novocaine family of drugs and has been
approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association panel on euthanasia
as an acceptable and humane way of killing fish that will not be eaten by
people. The fish will be frozen and sent to a landfill to contain the
spread of the disease.
Fish pathologists will continue to sample and monitor the remaining fish at
the hatchery.
Officials said that if IHN infects more trout, additional steps will be
taken to contain the disease.
The hatchery's operations are paid for by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
