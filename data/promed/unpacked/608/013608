Ghana: Anthrax Breaks Out in U/East 3 Deaths Already Recorded
-------------------------------------------------------------
Following the death of 3 persons at Biembog, near Woriyanga in the
Garu-Tempane district, through the outbreak of anthrax, the Upper
East Regional office of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA),
has deployed a team of veterinary officers to the area, for a mass
vaccination exercise against the disease.

Dr. Thomas Anyorikeya, the Regional Veterinary Officer, told The
Chronicle in an interview on Sunday [13 Apr 2008], that anthrax was
endemic in the Garu-Tempane district and its environs, especially
Biembog, where 3 people, including a child, have died after consuming
the carcass of infected animals. He explained that since February
this year [2008], there has been a routine vaccination exercise in
all the then 8 districts, now 9, in the region against the disease.
He said on 24 Mar 2008, a bull died at a certain Kaka's house at
Biembog, and the family members consumed the carcass. After consuming
the carcass, some felt ill and were rushed to the Woriyanga Clinic.
They were diagnosed as having anthrax, and when questioned by the
health workers, whether or not they had consumed a carcass, they
denied it.

On 28 Mar 2008, one of the patients died of the disease, before his
family members admitted that they had consumed the carcass of an
infected animal. The health workers then reported the matter to the
MOFA. Later 2 additional deaths were recorded.

Dr. Anyorikeya said when the District Director reported the case to
the regional office, more vaccines were immediately sent to the area,
for them to vigorously embark on a mass vaccination exercise. The
Regional Veterinary Officer, who mentioned respiratory problems,
boils on the skin and diarrhoea, as some of the symptoms of anthrax,
said there were enough vaccines to carry out the exercise. He said it
was GH20p per animal, and urged farmers to bring out their animals
for the exercise. According to him, farmers who could afford upright
payment would pay, but those who may not afford will be given 2 weeks
to settle their debts. He said only cattle, sheep, goats and pigs
will be vaccinated and advised farmers, who do not have money, to
sell their guinea fouls to enable them settle the bills for the
vaccination.

Dr. Anyorikeya expressed worry about the inability of some farmers,
who still owe the ministry, after the 2006 vaccination exercise, to
settle their debts. He has since led a team of veterinary officers,
from all the district capitals in the region, to Garu, to begin a
mass vaccination exercise, starting from Mon 14 Apr 2008.

The Regional Director of the MOFA, Mr. Roy Ayaraga, observed that
livestock played a very important role in Northern Ghana, stating
that it was through livestock that farmers were able to cope with
situations; e.g., after last year's flood disaster. It was against
this background that government implemented a livestock development
programme, under the MOFA, to stress on the importance of livestock.
The Regional Director said his outfit was poised to improving
livestock feeding, breeding and watering in the region. These were
all aimed at improving productivity and creating a higher market
value.

Mr. Ayaraga disclosed that the ministry had trained community
livestock workers, who were mainly farmers, to handle common
complications affecting livestock, while they report the much more
serious ones to veterinary officers. The MOFA has also given some
ligneous seeds to farmers, to sow for the purposes of improving
pastures in livestock.

He warned that people, who negligently caused harm, by preparing
carcasses of their animals, and selling them to the public, would be
prosecuted when caught. Mr. Ayaraga urged the people in the region,
to report any incidence of dead animals, to the nearest veterinary
officers or community livestock workers, for a post-mortem to be
conducted.

[We wish Dr. Thomas Anyorikeya every success in getting his region's
livestock vaccinated. Anthrax is most common in the Northern Region,
Upper East, and Eastern regions and is seen in parts of the Volta and
Central Regions. The incidence of this disease has been dropping in
Ghana for some years. - Mod.MHJ]
