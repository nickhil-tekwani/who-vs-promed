Cases of mumps are on the rise in Cumbria. Young adults are being
reminded to check whether they have received both doses of vaccine
against measles, mumps and rubella. So far this year [2011], 14 cases
of mumps have been confirmed across Cumbria, already an increase on
the 10 recorded for the whole of last year [2010]. Health bosses are
keen to prevent a large outbreak similar to that of 2009, when 97
cases were recorded.

Measles is also more likely to spread where groups of young people
from different areas begin living in close proximity, such as in
university and college halls of residence. Anyone who is not sure
whether they have had both doses can contact their GP surgery and ask
for a booster MMR injection.

Dr Nigel Calvert, associate director of public health for NHS Cumbria,
said: "In the last few years, there has been an increase in the number
of cases of mumps, particularly in teenagers and young adults. This
can be a concern because mumps is a virus which can easily spread and,
in some cases, affect fertility. In addition, there is also concern
about the rise in cases of measles among young people living in close
proximity in other areas of the country."

[Close to 950 000 cases of mumps were reported in Europe from 2000 to
2008, with the highest incidence in the 5-9 years and 10-14-years-old
age groups. In 2008, the hospitalisation rate was 12 percent in
countries that reported these data (n=14 348).

Mumps is primarily a respiratory infection, and as such is transmitted
by aerosol and respiratory droplets. The invasion of the respiratory
tract is frequently accompanied by viremia that results in organ
involvement with a preference for the salivary glands. The most common
and characteristic clinical presentation of mumps is an acute and
tender parotid swelling which develops 16-18 days after exposure in up
to 70 percent of cases. The swelling may be unilateral or bilateral
(30-40 percent of cases) and the inflamed swollen parotid gland lifts
the earlobe up and out in a characteristic fashion. The submandibular
and sublingual glands may also be involved and swollen. Mumps may
present as a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in young
children.

Asymptomatic and subclinical mumps virus infections are common and may
represent up to 20 percent of all infections. Serious complications,
including encephalitis, may precede or follow the parotitis and can
also occur without any apparent involvement of the salivary glands.
Central nervous system (CNS) infection is common with mumps, and up to
50 percent of patients have been shown to have asymptomatic
pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Immunisation against mumps has been associated with a marked decline
in the incidence of mumps disease in many European countries as well
as in the United States, but there are also indications that vaccine
effectiveness may be lower than what the vaccine efficacy studies
indicate. There is large variation in the reported incidence of mumps
across Europe. Countries with the highest incidence report figures
almost 100-fold of those of countries with the lowest incidence.
