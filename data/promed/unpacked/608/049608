Four suspected cases of anthrax in cattle near Lunéville
--------------------------------------------------------
The cattle died on a farm in the municipality of Hoéville in Lunévillois [Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region] between Saturday night and Monday [13-15 Aug 2016]. The farmer and his neighbours are complaining that it took very long to take the samples and send them to the lab (only on Wednesday, 17 Aug 2016) and that the renderers didn't collect the carcasses immediately. They collected them yesterday, Friday [19 Aug 2016]!

Samples have been sent to the reference laboratory at Maison-Alfort and the results should be available sometime next week. The farm is under restrictions as is the usual surveillance and quarantine procedure when anthrax is suspected.

The event in the Moselle area has started earlier this month [August 2016].

Moselle: Cases of anthrax detected in several farms
---------------------------------------------------
25 cattle have already died from the disease. The authorities have started vaccinating several hundred animals.

Several cases of anthrax have been detected in recent days on 5 farms in Moselle [Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine region], where authorities have started vaccinating hundreds of animals, including sheep and cattle, as we learned Saturday [20 Aug 2016] from the prefecture.

In 3 farms, analyses since the beginning of the month on dead animals revealed that the animals were suffering from anthrax, said the prefecture of Moselle in a statement. These 1st cases were identified in the eastern department of pastures in Saint-Jean-de-Bassel and Fénétrange, which were added to the plots Berthelming, Gosselming and Langatte. "At 1st, the animals were subjected to antibiotic treatment. Now, vaccination is implemented in confirmed outbreaks as well as herds which are on adjacent land parcels contaminated," said the prefecture.

The rate of decline in mortality: Authorities have started vaccinating 3 flocks, including a herd of 225 animals -- the operation to be completed in the "course of the coming weekend" -- and a flock of sheep and another 20 cattle. "To date, 25 cattle have succumbed to the disease. However, the rate of mortality has slowed sharply in recent days," observes the Moselle prefecture. "Given the new cases, careful monitoring of state services is still required until all are vaccinated." The 5 affected farms are monitored by the Departmental Directorate of Protection of the Population of Moselle and the Regional Health Agency (ARS), which monitor the breeders, veterinarians and employees of the rendering company.

Anthrax is a disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ which primarily affects animals but can also reach humans, in particular in contact with or through ingestion of infected animals. Most mammals are susceptible, but anthrax affects mainly ruminants. Treatment of infected animals is done with antibiotics, but vaccination is the most effective way to limit the spread of the disease.

[Profound thanks to Sabine for her translation.

When dealing with anthrax outbreaks, samples must be taken promptly, not least because the full response can depend on what the laboratories find and report. When you suspect anthrax, immediately treat any suspect incubating animals with long-acting antibiotics, and the rest vaccinate; any antibiotic treated stock should be vaccinated some 10 days later. And get those carcasses burnt or removed also quickly. The longer they lie around, the more severe is any soil contamination and this ensures outbreak revisits. This farm's neighbours were complaining about the stink from these 4 carcasses. Not good enough! - Mod.MHJ
