While more than 10 percent of cattle in Punjab suffers from brucellosis, a disease which is contagious and causes miscarriages in animals and pregnant women, dairy farmers in Punjab are simply unaware of it, say experts.

"It is a disease which causes abortions in animals during 6 to 9 months of pregnancy and if spread to humans, women get the same problem," said Dr J P S Gill, director, School of Public Health and Zoonosis, GADVASU [Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University], talking to Newsline.

Not only cattle, but also horses, sheep, goats, pigs and other animals get infected. During pregnancy the infection attacks the uterus, he said.

The 1st ever 2-day annual meeting of Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, on this disease began at GADVASU on Tuesday [29 Oct 2013].

Dr S R Rao, advisor, Department of Biotechnology, was present at the meeting and said that "temperature, night chills, joint pains, bodyache are common symptoms in human beings of this disease."

Dr Gill told Newsline that brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to human beings through direct contact and consumption of raw milk and milk products. "It is still an uncontrolled serious public health problem in many developing countries, including India. In livestock, brucellosis results in reduced productivity, abortions and infertility, leading to considerable economic losses," said Dr Gill.

Asked about the measures to control it, he said that to date there is no treatment for it. "While foreign nations slaughter animals, here it is not allowed. All we can do is to isolate animal from farm. In humans, antibiotics can only control the spread. That too only if damage has not reached beyond a level. If [it has] reached the joints, then it is irreversible," he said.

[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from _B. abortus_.

Clinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.

Though both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are known to be endemic in India (Ref), only _B. abortus_ is mentioned in India's annual reports to the OIE. The bacteria _B. melitensis and _B. suis_, both highly pathogenic for humans, are included in the list of diseases "for which no information has been provided."

According to India's most recent annual report to the OIE, a total of 7 cases of bovine brucellosis, in 5 new outbreaks, have been recorded in cattle during 2012 throughout the entire country. This is an astonishingly low figure for a disease known to be endemic. The deficient surveillance, which leads to under-reporting, is particularly concerning when a zoonotic disease is at stake. In such a situation, high prevalence of human disease should not surprise.

The brucellosis-related control measures applied in India are, reportedly, limited to "testing" and "quarantine." The above media report indicates that slaughter of infected animals is the only available means of control. Why preventive cattle vaccination has not been applied, remains to be clarified. Similarly, information on the situation regarding _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ is requested.
