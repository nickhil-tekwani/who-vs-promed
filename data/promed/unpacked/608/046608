_Escherichia coli_ 0157:H7 Outbreak in Western Wyoming.
Since July 1, 1998, the Wyoming Department of Health has identified 61
culture-confirmed cases of _E. coli_ 0157:H7 infection among residents of
Alpine, Wyoming, a small town located approximately 60 miles south of
Jackson. The majority of cases occurred between June 28 and July 10; there
have been no additional cases diagnosed since July 14. Twenty-one patients
have required hospitalization.
Epidemiological studies conducted jointly by the Wyoming Department of
Health and CDC have implicated the local municipal water supply as the
source of the outbreak. In addition, the cover story of the August 3,
edition of Time magazine, entitled "The Killer Germ," describes the
investigation and highlights the work of CDC epidemiologists and State and
local health officials on the epidemic.
