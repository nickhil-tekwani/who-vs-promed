In the last 15 months, 15 outbreaks of Chagas' disease (CD) have been
recorded in the northern Brazilian states of Para, Amazonas, and
Amapa. This month [August 2007], there have been outbreaks in Breves
and Abaetetuba (Para), totaling 15 cases including one suspected death.
Just one year ago PAHO [the Pan American Health Organization]
certified Brazil free of CD transmission by the insect that lives in
holes in the walls of mud-and-wattle houses.
Since June 2006, 116 people have caught the disease after drinking
fruit juices typical of the region, mainly those made from the
berries of the acai and bacaba palms, in which the vector had been
accidentally ground up. According to the Evandro Chagas Institute [in
Belem, Para], an average of only 12 cases of CD a year had been
attributed to oral infection between 1968 and 2005. Aldo Valente,
chief of parasitology at the Institute, reports that for every case
of CD reported there are at least 20 unrecorded.
CD is caused by the protozoan parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_,
transmitted by a triatome insect [known as the "kissing bug" -
Mod.JW]. Symptoms are fever, malaise, headache, and pain in the
joints, swollen eyes, liver and spleen, and cardiac changes.
In 2006, 3 other outbreaks of oral transmission, totaling 21 cases,
were recorded in the northeast of the country.

[Hopefully the commercially produced acai (pronounced "asa'i") juice,
that is now all the rage in the USA, and can also be found in health
food shops and those that cater to local Brazilian communities in the
UK, is being produced under more hygienic conditions.

ProMED-mail reported extensively on the outbreak of foodborne Chagas
disease in Santa Catarina and Amapa in 2005. The source in Santa
Catarina was sugarcane juice and in Amapa "acai." The new reports
show that foodborne Chagas disease is a present problem.
Chagas disease is a zoonosis with a reservoir in wild life and the
vector the triatomid bug also present. Foodborne infection can only
be controlled by hygienic measures making sure that fruits
contaminated with triatomid bug feces are not used for human
consumption. - Mod.EP
The Brazilian Amazon (Amazonia) covers the entire northern section of
Brazil (states of Amazonas, Para, Rondonia, Tocantins, Acre, Amapa,
and Roraima), plus the northern and southwestern parts of Mato Grosso
State (Midwest), and half of Maranhao State in the northeast. The
Para, Amazonas, and Amapa states can be located on the map of Brazil
