Viet Nam: 2 children in central province test positive for avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A commune in central Viet Nam has been severely hit by avian influenza,
with 195 patients showing symptoms and 2 children testing positive with the
virus, reported a top provincial official. 2 siblings from the province's
Chau Hoa commune of Quang Binh province had tested positive for the H5N1
strain of avian influenza [virus], said Mai Xuan Thu, vice chairman of the
provincial People's Committee, on Sun 20 Mar 2005. The older sister, aged
13, died from [avian influenza virus infection] on 9 Mar 2005, while the
brother, aged 5, is in serious condition at the Hue Central Hospital. [The
following 2 reports indicate that diagnostic samples were not taken from
the elder sister, presumed to have died of avian influenza virus infection.

Meanwhile, there are 195 other local residents who have shown symptoms of
the flu, said Ms. Thu. It is not yet clear whether these people, some of
whom had reportedly eaten sick chickens, have the symptoms of the deadly
bird flu or normal influenza. Of the 195 patients showing symptoms, 108 are
from Kinh Chau village, while the rest live in other villages in Chau Hoa
commune.
The outbreak hit the province's Kinh Chau village in Chau Hoa commune just
ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, which started on 9 Feb 2005. The
province is currently trying to stop the spread of the influenza by culling
all poultry in the commune.

[This report was also received independently from Terry Allen
<tallen@igc.org>. Although 2 siblings are reported to have tested positive
for avian influenza virus in this region of Central Province, this event
does not confirm the occurrence of person-to-person transmission of
infection. Infection from a common source remains a possibility. (The test
of the report is ambiguous and suggests that perhaps a younger sister has
not succumbed to the infection). Also, the cause of death of the elder
sister and the severe illness of the brother are not necessarily related,
in view of the prevalence of a so far undiagnosed outbreak of respiratory
infection in the general population of the area. Further information and
independent confirmation of the diagnosis are awaited. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: 5-year-old boy diagnosed with avian influenza virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
The Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology announced yesterday [Sat
19 Mar 2005] that a 5-year-old boy from Quang Binh Province is indeed
infected with the H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu. The boy, from
Tuyen Hoa District, was admitted to Hue Central Hospital on Tuesday [15 Mar
2005] with typical bird flu symptoms: high fever, coughing, and respiratory
problems. He is being treated in an isolation ward with respiratory support
equipment.
The boy's sister was hospitalized with a high fever and died on 9 Mar 2005.
According to Quang Binh Health Department doctors, she had severe
pneumonia. She was not tested for the virus, said the institute's deputy
director, Professor Pham Ngoc Dinh. There have been 51 cases of avian
influenza diagnosed across Viet Nam, and 33 have died from the disease,
Dinh said. He added that no new cases have been found in Thai Binh, the
hardest-hit northern province. The family ate chicken, and the sister came
down with a fever only 2 days later. When local health officials made an
inspection, they found that 300 out of 500 chickens raised in the locality
had died.
In another development, the Market Watch Team of northern border Lang Son
Province seized more than 1.6 tons of chickens illegally imported through
local border gates. All seized chickens, which were not quarantined, have
been culled.

Viet Nam: new case of avian influenza virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
Specimens from a 5-year-old boy from Viet Nam's central Quang Binh province
have just tested positive to [the H5N1 serotype of avian influenza virus],
raising the total number infected in the country to 25 since mid-December
2004, the newspaper Saigon Liberation reported on Fri 18 Mar 2005. The
testing by the Institute of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi on 17 Mar 2005
showed that the boy from Tuyen Hoa district is infected with bird flu, the
paper quoted Hoang VanMin, head of the provincial Veterinary Bureau, as saying.
In late February 2005, the boy's family, who live in a bird flu-hit area,
slaughtered a chicken given by one of their relatives for meal, and several
days later, the family's 3 children suffered a sudden illness, he said. One
day after being admitted to a hospital in Quang Binh, the boy's 13-year-old
sister died. Now, the boy is receiving treatment at a hospital in the
neighboring city of Hue after being hospitalized on 15 May 2005.
On 17 Mar 2005, a person from Quang Binh's Quang Trach district was
admitted to a hospital in the district with the bird flu symptoms of fever
and breathing difficulty, Min said. A total of 25 local people have been
reported to have contracted H5N1 since mid-December 2004, of whom 13 have died.
Avian influenza, which has killed and led to the forced culling of over 1.5
million fowl in 35 cities and provinces in Viet Nam since January 2005, is
cooling down, as 24 out of the 35 localities have detected no new affected
spots for at least 3 weeks so far, according to the Department of Animal
Health.
