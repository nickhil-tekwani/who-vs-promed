The mass food poisoning incident involving an Indian rojak stall at
the Geylang Serai temporary market has claimed its 2nd victim. A
59-year-old woman who was hospitalized in Alexandra Hospital died on
Wed 8 Apr 2009. The hospital said she was admitted with food
poisoning on Sat 4 Apr 2009. The incident has also killed another
woman, a 57-year-old canteen assistant, and caused a 38-year-old
expectant mother to miscarry.

So far, 146 people have been affected by the food contamination, 48
of whom were hospitalized. The Health Ministry says it appears that
the transmission, caused by a cross-contamination of rojak and raw
seafood ingredients harboring the _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ bacteria,
has ceased. Laboratory investigation confirmed 12 cases tested
positive for _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, including the 1st death.

Meanwhile, the Geylang Serai temporary market, which houses about 300
stalls, was closed for routine cleaning on Wed and Thu 8-9 Apr 2009.
The last time spring cleaning took place there was in October 2008.

[This organism is one of the "other pathogenic vibrios." A halophilic
(salt-requiring) organism, it has been recognized as the major cause
of acute diarrheal illness in Japan and has caused significant
outbreaks of food borne disease along both the Atlantic Ocean and
Gulf Coast areas of the US. It is also a very significant pathogen in
other areas of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Unlike the
organism causing classic cholera that causes disease via an
enterotoxin, _V. parahaemolyticus_ appears to be invasive as well as
producing a toxin. The diarrheal illness is preventable by adequately
cooking the food vector (particularly shrimp or crab), keeping the
food refrigerated and not rinsing the food with contaminated
seawater, and preventing contamination of other foods with the
seafood. It does not transmit well from person-to-person, probably
related to a high inoculum required for infection.

Most cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ do not require specific
antimicrobial therapy, as they are self-limited. Other halophilic
vibrios such as _V. vulnificus_ and _V. alginolyticus_ are not
generally associated with diarrhea but instead cause soft tissue
infection and/or bacteremia.

Rojak
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojak>
is a fruit and vegetable salad dish commonly found in Malaysia,
Singapore and Indonesia (where it is called rujak). The term "rojak"
is Malay for mixture and is also used as a colloquial expression for
an eclectic mix, and in particular is often used to describe the
multi-ethnic character of Malaysian and Singaporean society.
