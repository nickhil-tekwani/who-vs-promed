Bird flu remains a constant threat and could worsen: countries need to step
up control efforts more emphasis on animal health issues needed
---------------------------------------------------
The new wave of Avian Influenza outbreaks in Vietnam and Thailand clearly
shows that the avian virus remains endemic in Asia and that affected
countries need to do more to keep it under control, FAO and the World
Animal Health Organisation (OIE) said today in a joint statement. Recent
experience shows that it may be impossible to eradicate the virus soon.
"The disease will be present for several years in the countries that
experienced outbreaks during 2004", the 2 agencies said.
"Avian Influenza is an on-going emergency disease that spreads across
borders. It has serious implications for the public and animal health
sector in the affected countries," FAO/OIE said. "The international
community has to realize that some poor countries in Asia living with the
bird flu virus must receive more support to intensify precautionary
measures and to contain the risks associated with the disease," the 2
agencies said.
Control at source
----------------
The immediate challenge is to control Avian Influenza at source in the
infected countries and stop the possible spread of the virus to other
regions. "The battle against bird flu can only be won if more efforts and
resources are directed to containment of the virus in animals in rural
areas," FAO/OIE said.
Water birds, particularly ducks, are considered as a reservoir of
infection. The chances for spillover from ducks inhabiting the vast
wetlands to poultry production units in villages or on commercial farms
need to be significantly decreased. Strict biosecurity measures need to be
applied throughout the poultry production chain, from farms and
smallholdings to distribution channels, markets and retailers.
In order to contain the bird flu epidemic, infected countries such as Viet
Nam and Indonesia need the support of the international community to
strengthen the veterinary infrastructure and implement effective control
strategies, based on better biosecurity, modernised industry practices and,
where appropriate, vaccination, FAO/OIE said.
Since February 2004, donors have provided around 18 million US dollars for
emergency activities and capacity building, but much more resources are
urgently needed.
FAO/OIE warned that the tsunami disaster may worsen the bird flu situation
in Asia due to the large-scale movement of poultry. FAO is sending an
expert mission to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and The Maldives this week to assess
the loss to the livestock sector and future rehabilitation needs.
A regional FAO/OIE meeting on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza will be
held in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam (23-25 Feb 2005) to discuss the status
of bird flu and future control efforts.
An international conference drawing together renowned scientists and risk
managers will be organized in Paris (7-8 Apr 2005) at OIE Headquarters to
discuss the global dimension of bird flu. The meeting is jointly organized
by FAO and OIE in collaboration with WHO and is expected to propose new
international guidelines for better controlling Avian Influenza in animals,
based on the latest scientific information.

Vietnam to halt poultry raising in bird flu-hit areas
------------------------------------------------------
Vietnam is instructing localities nationwide to temporarily cease the
raising of poultry in bird flu-stricken areas, in a move to stop the spread
of the disease, according to local newspaper Youth on Tuesday [1 Feb 2005].
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat has just asked
bird flu-hit cities and provinces to halt the raising of fowls in communes
or districts stricken by the disease, and to cease the development of
waterfowls, mainly ducks, in unaffected areas. He has also urged local
research institutes to vaccinate poultry on a trial basis.
2 major reasons are cited for the minister's decision: bird flu has so far
in 2005 spread to 32 cities and provinces nationwide, killing and leading
to the forced culling of more than one million fowls, and many ducks,
especially in the southern Mekong Delta, are infected with the bird flu
virus strain of H5, but still look healthy.
In response to the decision, the municipal authorities in Ho Chi Minh City
have decided to stop the raising of ducks in the city for one year,
starting from early February 2005. The city will slaughter healthy ducks,
freezing them, and cull all others infected with H5 by 7 Feb 2005. Raisers
are to receive financial assistance of 15 000 Vietnamese dong (VND) (nearly
one US dollar) for each duck culled.
Regarding chickens, the municipal authorities have banned the raising of
the fowls in the inner city. The city will keep closer surveillance on
chicken farms, and offer interest-free loans to local companies so that
they can turn live chickens into frozen meat.

Vietnam city to kill ducks in bird flu fight
-----------------------------------------------------
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest, will slaughter all its ducks to try to
stop the renewed spread of bird flu, which has killed 12 people recently
and infected poultry in half the country.
The southern city, home to 10 million people, is next door to the Mekong
Delta where a 3rd wave of bird flu outbreaks erupted in December 2005.
Of the 12 deaths since then, 10 were southerners and 9 of them lived in the
delta. They took the death toll from the Asian bird flu since the end of
2003 to 44 -- 32 in Vietnam and 12 in Thailand.
Nguyen Thien Nhan, deputy chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City government, had
given officials until Sunday to slaughter 150 000 ducks while a private
firm will process 60 000 ducks for consumption, a local official told
Reuters on Tuesday.
"We will soon be out making it happen," said the official at the city's
Animal Health Department.
The city has around 210 000 ducks, which can carry the H5N1 virus without
showing symptoms. Half are raised outdoors on small farms, allowing a
potentially rapid spread of the virus.
Animal health officials said last week 31 of 148 samples taken from ducks
in the city showed the presence of the virus.
Health workers and market inspectors will ensure no ducks are raised
locally for a year and all ducks being transported into Ho Chi Minh City
will be seized for destruction, often by burning, the Saigon Giai Phong
newspaper said.
By 30 Jan 2005, the H5N1 virus had killed or resulted in the slaughter of
more than 1 million poultry in 31 of Vietnam's 64 provinces, the
Agriculture Ministry said.
During 2004, the epidemic wiped out 17 percent of Vietnam's poultry stock
of 250 million.
Most human bird flu victims have caught the virus from infected poultry,
but experts fear it could mutate into a form that is passed easily between
people, unleashing a global human flu pandemic that could kill millions.
Vietnam, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World
Organisation for Animal Health will hold a 3-day regional meeting on bird
flu in Ho Chi Minh City starting on 23 Feb 2005, the FAO said.
There are also fears bird flu might have broken out again in Cambodia. Test
results from a 25-year-old Cambodian woman who died in southern Vietnam are
expected soon.
If confirmed, she would be the 1st Cambodian to be infected and killed by
the H5N1 virus, which produces a high fever, coughing and acute pneumonia
and kills about 80 percent of people it infects. [see ProMED-mail posting
