[Qinghai, China's northwestern province, experienced its 1st ASF outbreak in December 2018, becoming China's 22nd province infected by ASF. Since then, the disease has spread to all remaining territories of China and further to Viet Nam (all provinces), Cambodia, North Korea and, most recently, Laos.

The first event in Qinghai started on 10 Dec 2018 (20181212.6206513), was lab confirmed on 12 Dec 2018 and was reported to the OIE on 14 Dec 2018 (20181215.6210622). No additional outbreaks were reported at that time, and on 25 Feb 2019 China submitted to the OIE a report declaring this event resolved as of 23 Jan 2019. The report included the following detailed commentary:

"After ASF occurred in Datong Hui and Tu Autonomous County, Xining City, in Qinghai Province. Control measures such as blockade, killing and disposal and disinfection were applied, in accordance with the requirements of the Contingency Plan for ASF and Technical Regulation on ASF Control (Trial). After affected pigs were killed in the affected areas, a total of 943 additional domestic pigs were killed around the outbreak and disposed of in biosafety manner. No new outbreaks and positive samples have been found for the 6 consecutive weeks of surveillance and monitoring. Local animal husbandry and veterinary authorities organized laboratory tests and on-site assessments in the affected areas, of which results were in compliance with the regulations on the blockade lift in the affected areas, and the ASF outbreak was solved. The local government decided to lift the blockade at 00:00 clock on 23 Jan 2019. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs requires the local animal husbandry and veterinary sectors to continue to strengthen the surveillance and monitoring and take active prevention and control measures, so as to prevent the recurrence of ASF."

While the current event is new, requiring an immediate notification, in fact it is a recurrence. Such recurrences are, unfortunately, observed throughout China, where the circulation of the ASF virus continues. - Mods.AS/CRD
