3 new outbreaks of yersiniosis (_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_) have been
reported in the Novosibirsk region of Siberia during March-April 2005.
Epidemiologists are conducting an investigation in the village Suzun among
children at a school where 42 cases of yersiniosis were found between 18-21
Apr 2005, according to preliminary data. All the children had eaten food
from the school canteen. Another outbreak was reported in Novosibirsk at
Navy College, where 18 students that were living in hostel were infected. A
3rd outbreak was reported among the students of an agricultural college in
Kolivan, where the infection affected 9 students that were living in a hostel.
The cause of all 3 outbreaks is thought to be related to the sanitary
conditions in the canteens of the facilities. The disease was thought to be
spread via vegetables (cabbage, onions, carrots) that were stored
improperly. In all of the storage facilities, experts discovered a lot of
mouse excrement.
In 2004, the yersiniosis rate was 29.35 infected per 100 000 of the
population, that is 7.4 times higher that national Russian average (3.96
per 100 000).

[Infection with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis, with reservoirs in
many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer and a variety of birds. Most
individuals affected are children or young adults. The most common
presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis presenting with
fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain which can be confused with
acute appendicitis.
The diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of
the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful,
but cross-reactions are found between Yersinia and other enteric organisms,
including some salmonellae. The manifestations of illness and mode of
diagnosis in these outbreaks are not stated. - Mod.LL]
