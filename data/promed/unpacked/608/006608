Abstract
--------
Filoviruses, especially Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are notoriously pathogenic and capable of causing severe haemorrhagic fever diseases in humans with high lethality. The risk of future outbreaks is exacerbated by the discovery of other bat-borne filoviruses of wide genetic diversity globally. Here we report the characterization of a phylogenetically distinct bat filovirus, named Mengla virus (MLAV). The coding-complete genome of MLAV shares 32-54 percent nucleotide sequence identity with known filoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places this new virus between EBOV and MARV, suggesting the need for a new genus taxon. Importantly, despite the low amino acid sequence identity (22-39 percent) of the glycoprotein with other filoviruses, MLAV is capable of using the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) as entry receptor. MLAV is also replication-competent with chimeric MLAV mini-genomes containing EBOV or MARV leader and trailer sequences, indicating that these viruses are evolutionally and functionally closely related. Finally, MLAV glycoprotein-typed pseudo-types transduced cell lines derived from humans, monkeys, dogs, hamsters and bats, implying a broad species cell tropism with a high risk of interspecies spillover transmission.

[The biological and epidemiological significance of the discovery of Mengla virus in _Rousettus_ bats in China awaits future research to determine if there are antibodies in humans, dogs, other bat species, and a variety of vertebrate animals in the locality where the virus-containing bat was captured, as an indication of past infection. The nucleotide sequence similarity placing this new virus between EBOV and MARV suggests that testing febrile humans or individuals with undiagnosed hemorrhagic disease in that locality could be of interest.
