These are times of great change in citrus virus diseases, considering their
rapid dissemination and new research on diagnosis and control. New
diseases are occurring and some are devastating, i.e. witches broom of
limes in Oman and in the United Arab Emirates; citrus variegated chlorosis
in Brazil, a new whitefly-transmitted disease in Turkey and more than 10
totally new diseases which have appeared on citrus. New severe stem
pitting strains of citrus tristeza are spreading and the greening disease
continues to limit the life of citrus trees to 5 to 8 years in some
countries. The brown citrus aphid _Toxoptera citricida_ is now present in
nearly all of the islands in the Caribbean and has recently entered
Florida. It threatens to spread into all of Central and North America. It
is now present in the Madeira Islands and is an ultimate threat to enter
Europe and North Africa. With its entry, all trees on the sour orange
rootstock will ultimately be killed as has been its history in the past.
The International Organization of Citrus Virologists (IOCV) is the one
organization dedicated to personal contact and the dissemination of
knowledge in the fight against citrus virus and virus-like diseases. In
addition to the IOCV Proceedings, there are new books and handbooks
available such as 'Virus and virus- like diseases of citrus in the Near
East: A handbook for detection and diagnosis of graft-transmissible
diseases of citrus" and the recently published "A historical review of the
major graft-transmissible diseases of citrus". Also available through IOCV
are name lists of research workers and their telephone, fax numbers and
e-mail addresses, all to be published shortly.
You are invited to participate in the exchange of knowledge through the
IOCV, and your membership is encouraged. For more information contact
Chester N. Roistacher, Secretary of the IOCV.
