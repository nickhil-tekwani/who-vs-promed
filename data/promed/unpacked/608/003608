[These cases have no implications for international travel; they are
reported by ProMED-mail as a reminder that plague foci are still
present in the world. Plague is endemic in Mongolia, and human cases
of bubonic plague are reported every year, mainly in country dwellers
who have been hunting marmots for their fur. Marmots are large,
burrowing rodents similar to groundhogs (woodchucks) in the USA. -
