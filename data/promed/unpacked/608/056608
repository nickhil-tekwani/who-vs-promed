Researchers have identified a novel virus they suspect is killing 3 types of freshwater turtles in the St Johns River, mostly softshells.

To keep tabs on the turtles' status, they're urging the public's help in reporting the ongoing die-off, which has so far killed an estimated 300 turtles.

"It's been ongoing since last March [2018]," said Michelle Kerr, a spokeswoman with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).

That's when FWC 1st got reports from the St Johns River region of sick and dead Florida softshell turtles and Florida cooters.

So far, 18 turtles collected by the FWC from the St Johns River watershed suggest a viral infection contributed to the turtle deaths, the state agency announced. Virologists discovered a novel virus linked with 3 species of diseased Florida turtles: the softshell, peninsula cooters, and Florida red-bellied cooters.

Sick and dead turtles have been found along the St Johns River watershed from the headwaters near Palm Bay in the south, to Crescent Lake and Palatka in the north. Other reports of dead turtles have come in from Cocoa Beach, Lake Apopka, Eustis, and Windermere.

To determine the cause of the turtle deaths, the FWC began a collaborative investigation with the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine (UF-CVM) Wildlife Aquatic Veterinary Disease Laboratory (WAVDL), UF-CVM Aquatic Amphibian and Reptile Pathology Program, Office of Protected Resources (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries), and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Bronson Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (BADDL).

Researchers found no toxins in the turtles tested, including those produced by harmful algae blooms.

Investigators plan additional studies of the viral disease, its distribution in Florida, and its effect on turtle populations.

[Finding an association between a syndrome and an infectious agent is the 1st step for establishing disease causation. Further studies should fulfill other complementary criteria to confirm this novel virus as the etiological agent that is causing this die-off.
