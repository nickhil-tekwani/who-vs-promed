Dangbo: unidentified epidemic has already caused 100 deaths in Dekin
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For about a month the people of Dekin, a town in the municipality of
Dangbo [department of Oueme], have witnessed, impotent, the
disappearance of dozens of their sons and daughters. An unidentified
epidemic, which has resulted in up to 6 deaths per day, has occurred
without the knowledge of the public health [authorities] in Benin.

Fever, vomiting, and simultaneous bleeding from the nostrils, followed
by strange breathing sounds, and finally the victims' heart stops.
These are the visible symptoms of the disease, as yet unidentified,
which turned into an epidemic, spreading panic in Dekin, a lakeside
and landlocked town in the Dangbo commune. According to relatives of
the victims, this has been going on for a month. Dozens of young
people of this town, aged 4 to 20 years, have died within 24 hours of
the onset of the symptoms described above, without attracting the
attention of the authorities in charge of public health in Benin. In
addition, several victims, including those whose bodies may have
developed resistance against the disease, are still languishing on
beds at the clinic in town. But they may succumb in the days to come
if nothing is done, because the clinic (and town) does not have
adequate staff to administer care to patients in a suitable manner.
The existing staff in the health center consist of health attendants
[not nurses or doctors]. In addition, some people lack drinking water
and are forced to share water sources with animals.

According to a Beninese private television station report on Monday
morning [27 May 2013], more than 100 people, mostly children aged 4 to
17, have died in the past 4 weeks from a disease not yet identified in
Dekin in the commune of Dangbo, located about 50 km [31 mi] south east
of Cotonou, Benin's capital.

"During the past 4 weeks Dekin has recorded more than 100 deaths from
an epidemic manifested by vomiting blood and a strange respiratory
sound coming from the patient," according to the television report.

In addition to the fatal cases, according to the same source, this
town in the southeastern part of Benin also has other critically ill
cases hospitalized in the local clinic, which has neither a nurse nor
a doctor.

"Only a midwife plays the role of doctor in the health center for this
town of more than 10 000 people," the source said.

[The limited description of the outbreak provided in the 2 newswires
above suggests there is a febrile illness with hemorrhagic
manifestations and pulmonary compromise leading to respiratory
distress and rapidly progressing to death, predominantly affecting
children between the ages of 4 and 17. While reading these newswires,
this moderator was reminded of the outbreak of Marburg fever that
affected primarily children in Angola in 2005 (see prior ProMED-mail
reports listed below).

The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic fever in Benin would
include more "common" etiologies such as leptospirosis, yellow fever,
malaria, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and dengue, among others.

The more "exotic" viral hemorrhagic fevers such as _Ebolavirus_,
_Lassavirus_, and _Marburgvirus_ have not been reported from Benin.
Lassa fever has been identified in West African countries including
Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea.

In addition, a returning traveller with Lassa fever had a history of
travel to Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso prior to onset of
illness (Gunther S, Emmerich P, Laue T, et al. Imported Lassa fever in
Germany: molecular characterization of a new lassavirus strain. Emerg
Infect Dis. 2000; 6(5): 466-76;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627947/). It is known
that rodents of _Mastomys_ species are ubiquitous in Africa, leading
to a situation that might be ripe for introduction of Lassa fever
virus into Benin. (For a map showing the countries where Lassa fever
has been identified, see http://vhfc.org/lassa_fever.

The stated absence of highly trained healthcare personnel in the area
may be contributing to the panic that is occurring in the affected
zone.

According to Wikipedia, Dangbo is a town, arrondissement [district],
and commune in the Oueme Department of south eastern Benin. The
commune covers an area of 340 sq km (131 sq mi) and as of 2002 had a
population of 66 055 people. A map of the location (available at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangbo) shows that Dangbo is located
very near the border with Nigeria. For the interactive
HealthMap/ProMED map of Benin, see http://healthmap.org/r/71my.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this outbreak
from knowledgeable sources in the region. - Mod.MPP]
