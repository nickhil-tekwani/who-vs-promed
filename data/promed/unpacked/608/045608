A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza - H5N6 - has been confirmed in Korea's southern Jeju island. It's the 3rd such confirmation since the turn of winter.

The environment ministry says the virus, discovered in wild bird droppings last week, is highly-contagious.

And in another development, there are signs of a new strain of avian influenza; as the bird flu virus detected at a poultry farm in Gochang, Jeollabuk-do Province earlier this month, seems to be a combination of highly pathogenic strains spotted in Europe last year [2016]. The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency says the virus may have been carried by birds flying in from Europe.

Analysis shows it's different from the virus detected in last year's [2016] outbreak in Korea.

[HPAI H5N6, a zoonotic avian influenza strain, has been reported since May 2014 in wild birds and domestic poultry in several countries in East and South East Asia, causing financial losses and cases in humans. A total of 17 human infections with A(H5N6) viruses, as of 20 Nov 2017, have been reported as confirmed by China's health authorities.

The South Korean HPAI H5N6 epizootic started on 16 Nov 2016; so far, without reported human infections.

It has been suggested that migratory birds were important in the spread and genetic diversification of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs (see 20170918.5324107). Clade 2.3.4.4 viruses were detected in birds in 40 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. The clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from Africa and Europe were primarily of the A(H5N8) subtype; those in Asia were primarily A(H5N6). - Mod.AS
