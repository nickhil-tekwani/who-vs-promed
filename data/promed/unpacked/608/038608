Foot-and-mouth disease situation, FAO monthly report, November 2013
POOL 3 -- West Eurasia & Middle East: Palestine
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In Jericho, West Bank an outbreak of FMD serotype O virus was detected in a flock of 200 sheep, with about 30 percent morbidity (diagnosis confirmed by the FMD laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute).

The virus belongs to topotypes ME-SA, genotype/strain PanAsia-2FAR-09 and is 98.59 percent identical at VP1 with viruses detected in Turkey in 2013. This 1.41 percent VP1 difference suggests considerable virus circulation has occurred between the outbreaks detected in Turkey and that in Palestine. This highlights the need for more surveillance in countries in the neighbourhood of Turkey, Israel, and Palestine to determine the FMD situation more accurately.

FAO WRLFMD Genotyping Report, IAH-P-EP-MEG-FOR-005-3, Israel (3 cattle samples collected 17 Nov 2013)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Serotype: O
WRLFMD Ref No: ISR/1/2013 [there are 2 additional samples: ISR/2/2013, ISR/3/2013]
Batch No: WRLFMD/2013/00028
Location: Majdal Shams, Golan, Hazafon, Israel
Date collected: 17 Nov 2013
Date received by WRLFMD: 4 Dec 2013
Date received for sequencing: 17 Dec 2013
Species: cattle
Region sequenced: VP1
Report date: 20 Dec 2013
Reported by: NJ Knowles
Checked by: K Bachanek-Bankowska
Topotype: ME-SA
Genotype/strain: PanAsia-2FAR-09

Comments: this sequence differs from O/PAT/13/2013 and O/PAT/14/2013 by 11 nt (1.72 percent) [see item 2]

Most closely related viruses:
virus name // percent identity // percent difference // topotype // strain
O/TUR/12/2013 // 98.75 // 1.25 // ME-SA // PanAsia-2FAR-09

[Similar results were obtained with the other 2 samples from infected cattle in Majdal Shams]

Most closely related (2) reference viruses:
virus name // percent identity // percent difference // topotype/strain
O/IRN/31/2009 // 98.12 // 1,88 // ME-SA // PanAsia-2FAR-09
O/IRN/18/2010 // 94.37 // 5.63 // ME-SA // PanAsia-2BAL-09

[Similar results were obtained with the other 2 samples from infected cattle in Majdal Shams.

[The aerial distance between the infected cattle holding in Majdal Shams (Israel), northern Golan area, adjacent to the border with Syria/Lebanon, and the infected sheep holding in Jericho (Palestinian territory), about 20 km (12.4 mi) northeast of Jerusalem, adjacent to the Jordanian border, is about 150 km (93 mi). Both can be seen on the map at http://www.science.co.il/images/maps/Israel-Districts.pdf.

Contact between the 2 holdings has not been detected and is rather unlikely. It is more reasonable to look out for virus circulation within the countries adjacent to both outbreaks (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon). Wildlife (in particular wild boar), which is abundant along the said borders and in particular along the Jordan River, deserves to be taken into consideration as well, and ideally sampled and tested.

According to the WRLFMD genotyping reports, the isolates from the 2 outbreaks are closely related to each other and share the same closest reference strain, namely O/IRN/31/2009 (difference with the Israeli strain 1.88 percent, with the PA strain 1.72 percent).

Annual vaccination of cattle, sheep, and goats against FMD is compulsory in Israel and in the Palestinian territories. Reportedly, ring revaccinations have been recently applied around the 2 outbreaks. No additional outbreaks have been detected so far. Does this reflect the efficacy of the vaccine in use? This will become clearer during the coming months. FMD has a seasonal pattern in Israel; when present/circulating, peaks are generally expected during April/May.

The serotype O component in the FMD vaccine, used in Israel during 2013, was composed of the following 4 strains: O1 3039, O1 Manisa, O 4625, and O1 Israel 2007 (Neve Ur). - Mod.AS
