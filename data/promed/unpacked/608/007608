New South Wales [NSW] Health has warned of a current outbreak of mumps across the state, urging members of the public to check their vaccination status. Dr Vicky Sheppeard, the director of communicable diseases for NSW Health, said there have been 15 reported cases of the disease in May [2013], clustered in several areas. It's highly likely more cases have not been reported. She said that the disease can be very serious for affected adults. "Complications can include swelling of the testicles in males, and rarely inflammation of the brain, the lining of the brain and spinal cord, pancreatitis and hearing loss," she said. A mumps infection during pregnancy can result in miscarriage, and the ovaries and testicles can also be affected.

While most children are vaccinated against the disease, Dr Sheppeard said that many adults would not have any resistance to it, as the required 2 doses weren't routinely offered until the 1990s. "Many people in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s will not be immune, so it is particularly important they check their status with their doctor and get vaccinated if they are not sure," she said.

"To prevent the spread of mumps, children and adults should have 2 doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine." Symptoms of the disease include fever, loss of appetite, and tiredness and headaches, followed by swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands, especially near the jaw. Up to one-third of sufferers, however, have no symptoms. Mumps can be caught by breathing in the virus after a sufferer coughs or sneezes, or by direct saliva contact. It can then take 2 to 3 weeks to develop, and affected people are infectious a week before and up to 9 days after the glands have swollen. There is no specific treatment for mumps.

[The consequences of mumps infection in adults include pain and swelling of the testicles (orchitis), which affects one in 5 of all males who get mumps after puberty. The swelling of their testicles normally begins 4 to 8 days after the swelling of the parotid gland. Occasionally, swelling can occur up to 6 weeks after the swelling of the glands. The swelling is usually very sudden and affects only one testicle. Just under half of all males who get mumps-related orchitis will notice some shrinkage of their testicles and an estimated 1 in 10 men will experience a drop in their sperm count.

Viral meningitis can occur if the mumps virus spreads into the outer protective layer of the brain which is known as the meninges. It occurs in one in 7 cases of mumps. Unlike bacterial meningitis, which is regarded as a potentially life-threatening medical emergency, viral meningitis causes much milder, flu-like symptoms, and the risk of serious complications are low. Sensitivity to light and vomiting are common symptom of viral meningitis. The symptoms of viral meningitis usually pass within 14 days.

One in 20 females who gets mumps after puberty will experience swelling of your ovaries (oophoritis), which can cause symptoms of lower abdominal pain, high temperature, and sickness. The symptoms of oophoritis are usually short-lived. One in 20 cases of mumps leads to pancreatitis. The most common symptom is the sudden pain in the centre of the upper abdomen. Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include sickness, diarrhoea, fever, and less frequently jaundice.

Rare but potentially serious complications of mumps include encephalitis (1 in 1000 cases) or permanent hearing loss (1 in 20 000 cases).
