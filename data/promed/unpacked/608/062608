Mexico's health authorities say cholera has killed one person and sickened at least another 9 in central Mexico.

Mexico's Health Department says 2 cases were detected in Mexico City and the rest in the nearby state of Hidalgo, where one person died. The department on Fri 27 Sep 2013, declared a health emergency for Hidalgo. Authorities said it's the same cholera strain that is sickening hundreds of people in Caribbean countries, including Cuba and the Dominican Republic.

Mexico City health authorities say they have intensified their surveillance of water treatment plants and water tanks and have launched a campaign to educate people about preventing infection.

After weeks of heavy rains in Mexico, the number of cholera cases has risen to 44. The Mexican Ministry of Health reports that in the state of Hidalgo 33 suspected cases are being examined.

The infectious disease has so far claimed one life. According to Health Minister Mercedes Juan, there is no talk of an epidemic. Last week [week of 23 Sep 2013] an emergency program was implemented and doctors were sent to the affected region in the center of the country.

The 1st case of cholera had already occurred before the beginning of severe weather, but the shortage of clean drinking water in flooded areas could worsen the situation.
