Suspected Ebola Patient in Mityana, Uganda
------------------------------------------
Panic gripped Mityana Hospital following a report of a case of
suspected Ebola fever yesterday, Sun 8 Nov 2009. The patient was
brought to the hospital at midday. The medical workers immediately set
up an isolation centre where the suspect was quarantined to receive
treatment. Muamin Kalule, the senior nursing officer in charge of the
isolation centre, said the patient had manifested signs of the deadly
haemorrhagic fever, which included vomiting, abdominal pain and
bleeding. "These are the signs for Ebola [haemorrhagic fever] so we
have to take extra care," she said.

The patient, who hails from Mawanda village in Kakindu sub-county,
said she had been having a fever for the past 4 days after eating
antelope meat. Kalule, however, disagreed that the patient could have
developed the symptoms from the meat, saying other family members who
had eaten the food were in good health. She said the district
surveillance officer, Dennis Mono, had taken samples to Kampala and
they were waiting for the results [of diagnostic tests], which are
expected today [9 Nov 2009].

The director general of health services, Dr. Sam Zaramba and the
Mityana health officer, Dr. Fred Lwasampijja, said they were not aware
of the suspected outbreak.

[Mityana is a town in central Uganda. It is the largest town in
Mityana District and the district headquarters are located there. It
can be located in the map at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mityana>. Kakindu sub-district, the home
of the patient, which is some distance from Mityana can be located in
the interactive map of Uganda at:

Apart from the signs and symptoms of a haemorrhagic fever, there is no
compelling reason at this point to identify an Ebolavirus as the
causative agent. The results of diagnostic tests in Kampala are
awaited. - Mod.CP]
