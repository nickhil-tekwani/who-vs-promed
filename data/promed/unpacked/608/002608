Suspicion of food poisoning in several schoolchildren in Saint-Laurent-Nouan
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several children and adults from schools in Saint-Laurent-Nouan suffered from vomiting and digestive problems after having lunch in the canteen on Tuesday [15 Mar 2022]. An investigation is being carried out by the ARS [Regional Health Agency].

On Tuesday afternoon [15 Mar 2022], children in 3 schools in Saint-Laurent-Nouan, Les Perri√®res, Les Grands vergers and Les P'tits castors, went to lunch as usual in the school canteen. On the menu were celery remoulade, white beans, brie and a fruit cocktail. In the afternoon, several of them, as well as adults, suffered from vomiting and digestive disorders, symptoms that could suggest food poisoning.

"We alerted the Regional Health Agency, which came to carry out analysis," said Mayor Michel Laurent. "It is not yet clear where this problem may come from, whether it concerns hygiene or the products that have been served. We have carried out a cleaning of all our premises and we have sent messages to all parents to keep them informed of the situation."

On the ARS side, "out of 232 meals served, we currently have 6 sick children and 5 adults. Nevertheless, investigations are still underway to find out the number of people affected and to take all the samples," adds Christophe Lugnot, chief of staff. The parents of students are waiting for the results before "thinking about the follow-up to be given" to this case.
