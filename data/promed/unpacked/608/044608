Red alert for brassica diseases
-------------------------------
Brassica growers are facing high risks of pest and disease pressure
this season. The Brassica Alert disease and pest forecasting system
has already hit high risk for the key diseases alternaria, ringspot,
and white blister by mid-July [2010].

Andy Richardson of the Allium & Brassica Centre which produces the
Brassica Alert forecasts reports that a high level of disease risk
across the whole region early in the season will require growers take
action now, to minimise the risk that diseases will continue to
develop as the autumn progresses.

He adds that, with better tailoring of fungicide programme timings,
the system has proven extremely effective over the past 4 seasons. It
has, on average, enabled growers to deliver higher yields of
marketable produce using fewer treatments over the course of the season.

[Ringspot
---------
Ringspot disease on _Brassica_ crops is caused by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella brassicicola_. Symptoms are small dark spots on
leaves, which become larger lesions with concentric rings of growth
and a definite margin. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid
conditions. The pathogen is spread by splashing water, mechanical
means, and insects and overwinters in plant debris and biennial seed
crops. The disease is managed mainly by timely fungicide applications.

White blister
-------------
White blister caused by the fungus _Albugo candida_ affects most
plants of the brassica family including a range of cabbage crops,
radishes, and oilseed rape. There are several races each of which
infects a limited range of brassica species. Symptoms include
blisters on the underside of leaves followed by corresponding
circular discolourations on the upper leaf surface, and these
symptoms may continue to develop after harvest reducing potential
storage time. Systemic infections can cause abnormal growth and
distortion of plants leading to a significant reduction in
marketability and also affecting seed production. Fungal development
is favoured by high humidity.

The pathogen can be spread by wind, water, seed, on plant material
(for example seedlings for transplanting), and by mechanical means,
including common insect pests. For example, diamond back moths
(_Plutella xylostella_) carrying spores on their wings are thought to
have been responsible for the spread of the disease to Tasmania when
they were blown across by wind (ProMED-mail post 20021217.6081).
Disease management includes clean planting material (hot water
treatment may be effective for seed disinfestation), cultural
practices (such as reduction of free moisture, removal of weed
reservoirs), and fungicides. Germplasm with varying levels of
resistance or tolerance to different pathogen strains is available,
and new crop varieties are being developed.

Alternaria leaf spot
--------------------
The fungus _Alternaria brassicicola_ causes black spot disease (also
called dark leaf spot) on virtually every important cultivated
brassica species including cabbages, oilseed rape, and mustard. It is
of worldwide economic importance resulting in up to 50 percent yield
reduction. Symptoms include necrotic lesions on leaves, but all other
parts of the plant can also be affected including pods, seeds, and
stems. The disease is of particular importance post-harvest. The
related species _Alternaria brassicae_ causes similar symptoms
including dark leaf spots and dark stem lesions immediately after
germination and can result in "damping-off," or stunted seedlings.
The fungus causes major disease in oilseed rape and often spreads to
and causes damage in other brassicas. Both pathogens are seedborne
and spores are spread by wind, splashing rain, mechanical means, and
with contaminated materials. Disease management as for white blister.
