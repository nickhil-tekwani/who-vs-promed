Anthrax reported after a decade in Medak
----------------------------------------
Veterinary doctors surmise that the virus [sic; bacterium] could have spread from carcasses of sheep. Veterinarians are of the opinion that the anthrax could have been carried by sheep and goats which came from Maharashtra.

After almost a decade, the presence of the dreaded bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ (anthrax) was reported in Medak district. While 2 white oxen succumbed to the virus, another 3 (a cow, buffalo and ox) got infected but were saved due to the pro-active measures by the Animal Husbandry Department authorities.

According to sources, about 10 shepherds from Maharashtra entered Gopulapuram village in Munipally mandal of the district via Karnataka on 1 Mar 2012 along with about 1000 sheep and some goats. The animals were kept for penning on a field for 2 days. 4 sheep died and the shepherds left their carcasses at different places and moved forward to graze the animals.

After a week, 2 oxen in the village died with high fever and 3 cattle were infected. The impact was so fast that the animals died even before the farmers could monitor their body conditions. They then informed the veterinary doctor Santosh Kumar who rushed to the village to take stock of the situation. While one animal died on 8 Mar 2012, the other succumbed the next day.

"Once infected, the animal dies within 24 hours by oozing tarry coloured blood from natural orifices. Immediately after learning about the incident, our teams rushed to the village, collected samples and sent them for analysis to the Veterinary Biological Research Institute at Hyderabad," said Dr. V. Lakshma Reddy, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry.

Special teams were deputed to Gopulapuram, Budhera, Polkampally, Gorreghat, Munipally and Karmapally villages to ascertain that no animal was sick in them. They visited almost all houses and checked the health of the cattle. Sale of sheep, goat and cattle meat was banned in these villages for the next 3 weeks. The sale will be permitted only after blood samples of some animals in these villages have tested negative.

More than 8500 animals were already vaccinated by Tuesday and another 12 000 vaccine doses were kept ready for any emergency. "We will continue vaccination in Gopulapuram village for the next 3 years with intervals of 8 months," said Dr. Deepankar, a veterinary doctor in the department.

Based on information furnished by local people, the officials came to the conclusion that the [bacteria] could have been carried here by the sheep and goats, which came from Maharashtra.

[Anthrax is routinely reported by OIE in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andra Pradesh in significant numbers, and especially in the latter 2 states. Medak, in Andra Pradesh, is on the eastern border of north-eastern Karnataka. Where this itinerant flock of sheep and goats got infected is impossible to say but they could have been shedding carcasses en route for a week or so. Lateral spread of infection can occur from animals licking the salty blood from recently dead animals; I saw a similar situation in the UK with outbreaks every 8 days.

Drs Santosh Kumar, Deepankar, and Lakshma Reddy are to be congratulated on their rapid and thorough response.
