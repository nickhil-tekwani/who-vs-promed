[It is now 9 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report, there are 10 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 3 in Guangdong and 7 in Heilongjiang. It has now been 19 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 10 days or so... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? Are these cases related to importations? There were a total of 118 newly confirmed cases of which 108 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 82 160 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3341 deaths, representing an increase of 118 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (11 Apr 2020) report, and 2 newly reported death (both in Wuhan.). An additional 6 suspected cases were newly reported, all in imported cases, 4 in Heilongjiang, 2 in Shanghai. 4 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 108 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1378. There are an additional 72 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 61 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 12 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1064. 307 of these are importations from abroad. There is no mention of originally asymptomatic cases that have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on, 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing.. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 25 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (11-12 Apr 2020) when there were 32 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 537 confirmed cases, including 217 deaths were reported today, up from 10 512 cases and 214 deaths yesterday [12 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 13 consecutive days and below 50 for 6 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 64.7% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.7% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Seoul reported 8 (32.0%) newly confirmed cases 7 were imported cases, 1 was locally acquired; Daegu and Gyeonggi each reported 3 cases (12.0%), in Daegu all locally acquired, in Gyeonggi 2 were imported and 1 was locally acquired; Gyeongbuk reported 4 newly acquired cases (16.0%%), all locally acquired. Quarantined imported cases represented 24% of the newly confirmed cases, with 6 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. Of interest is that 16 (64%) of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases and 9 (36%) were locally acquired. 12 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

The English language update https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030 of 13 Apr 2020 is noteworthy for the graphic and tabular presentations of the epidemiology of the disease in South Korea. There are epidemic curves, growth curves, and regional statistics. The update for 12 Apr 2020 (same URL) combined with the daily reports demonstrates that South Korea is shifting to an importation driven epidemiologic picture with occasional clusters of locally acquired infections.

[4] Iran: 71 686 total cases, 4474 deaths
Date: Sun 12 Apr 2020
Source: Independent [edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/coronavirus-iran-lockdown-update-business-reopen-hassan-rouhani-a9461806.html


Iran this weekend [10 Apr 2020] has begun easing a nationwide shutdown and resuming what it described as "low-risk" economic activities despite the effects of a coronavirus pandemic that continues to kill scores and infect hundreds a day.

Iran, the country worst hit by the pandemic in the Middle East, has removed restrictions on travel between provinces in place since [27 Mar 2020] and begun rolling out a programme to allow businesses to reopen.

The loosening of restrictions comes despite publicly voiced worries by a leading health ministry official, who warned that more than a quarter of coronavirus transmissions in Iran have been traced to contact on public transportation as people head to their jobs, regardless of how much social distancing is possible within workplaces.

But Iran's president Hassan Rouhani insists the country is ready to begin resuming economic activity, boasting that the country was handling the impact of the disease better than some European countries.

"There is a very big difference between the situation in Iran and Europe," Mr Rouhani said in a televised address on Sunday [12 Apr 2020]. "Our situation in combating this dangerous virus is relatively good, and in comparison with others, it is better."

With 71 686 coronavirus confirmed infections and at least 4474 deaths attributed to Covid-19, Iran has been the epicentre of the worldwide pandemic in the Middle East.

But the virus soon spread to the upper echelons of the country's political and religious elite. Hospitals became overwhelmed, with at least 50 doctors and nurses dying of Covid-19, and Iran wound up imposing a lockdown on much of public life.

The weeks-long shuttering of most businesses and government offices has badly battered the country's economy, already weakened by low global oil prices.

But the number of new infections has been trending downward in recent weeks, suggesting the outbreak was past its peak. Mr Rouhani announced Saturday [11 Apr 2020] that some unspecified businesses would be allowed to open this week and in the capital, Tehran, starting next week.

Neither Mr Rouhani nor others have specified what sectors of the economy would be open, though schools and universities would remain for now closed, and there is no suggestion the lucrative religious pilgrimage tourism that officials say exacerbate the spread of coronavirus would resume.

Mr Rouhani said any business or trade association that wanted to reopen should apply online to the Health Ministry and await a confirmation code that would allow it to resume. He also insisted that buses and trains be disinfected according to health ministry protocols.

Healthcare workers inside Iran have told The Independent the numbers of infections and deaths are no longer accelerating, and that stringent social distancing measures and a shuttering of public life appear to have eased loads in emergency rooms and intensive care units.

Asked about reopening the economy, Iran's deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi cautioned that the government's plan was a "cause for concern," predicting that the crisis would continue until at least mid-May and that the illness would persist until the autumn.

"Early reopening, if it leads to a new shutdown, will have an even more devastating economic effect," he said in a news conference on Saturday [11 Apr 2020].

The number of deaths has also increased from 4357 to 4474, an increase of 117 deaths in the 24-hour period.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of 4000s and 5000s.

As of today [12 Apr 2020], totals of 166 019 cases and 16 972 deaths have been reported, up from 161 852 cases and 16 353 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 185.5, slowly decreasing over the past 6 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 185.5 today [12 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 166 019 cases, approximately 75 771 (45.6%) have been hospitalized and 7554 (4.6%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7217806,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]

Summary (as of 12 Apr 2020, 12:00 AM)
- In total, 120 479 COVID-19 cases and 2673 deaths due to COVID-19 have been electronically reported to the Robert Koch Institute in Germany.
- All 16 federal states are affected. The incidence (cases per 100,000) of COVID-19 is highest in Bavaria (247), Baden-Wuerttemberg (218), Saarland (208) and Hamburg (203).
- Most cases (69%) are between 15 and 59 years old; men (49%) and women (51%) are almost equally affected.
- 86% of deaths, but only 17% of all cases, occurred in persons aged 70 years or older.
- Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.
- As of [10 Apr 2020] countries and regions are no longer classified as international risk areas.

Clinical aspects
----------------
Information on symptoms is available for 92 361 of the notified cases. The most common symptoms are cough (51%), fever (42%) and rhinorrhoea (22%). Pneumonia was reported in 2180 cases (2%). Hospitalisation was reported for 14 129 (15%) of 92 098 COVID-19 cases with information on hospitalisation available.

The 2673 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Germany concerned 1592 (60%) men and 1076 (40%) women (sex was unknown in 5 cases, age was unknown in 2 cases). The median age was 82 years. Of all deaths, 2304 (86%) were in persons 70 years or older, but only 17% of all cases were in this age group. Reports on COVID-19 related outbreaks in nursing homes are increasing. In some of these outbreaks, the number of deaths is relatively high.

SARS-CoV-2 infections among staff working in medical facilities
--------------------------------------------------------------
Of notified cases with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least 5500 were reported among staff working in medical facilities as defined by §23 of the German Protection Against Infection law (IfSG), such as hospitals, outpatient clinics and practices, dialysis clinics, or outpatient nursing services. Among these 5500 persons 72% were female and 28% male. The median age was 42 years.

Estimation of the reproduction number (R)
-----------------------------------------
The reproduction number, R0, is the mean number of persons infected by a case. R0 can only be estimated and not directly extracted from the notification system. The current estimate is R= 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.0-1.6) and is based on electronically notified cases ([10 Apr 2020] 12:00 AM) and an assumed mean generation time of 4 days. Cases with disease onset on the preceding 3 days were excluded from the estimation as their low number due to incomplete reporting would lead to an unstable estimate. For more details on the methodology see Epid. Bull. 17 | 2020 Online vorab: 9. Apr 2020 [in German; https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2020/Ausgaben/17_20_SARS-CoV2_vorab.pdf?__blob=publicationFile]

ICU patients: 2405 at present, 1859 (77%) on mechanical ventilation
Discharged from ICU 2978 as of now, 864 (29%) deaths.

Measures taken:
- All arriving travellers in Germany are to remain in quarantine for 14 days (https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/neue-einreiseregeln-1739634; in German).
- RKI teams are currently supporting outbreak containment measures with a focus on outbreaks in retirement and health care homes as well as hospitals in several federal states.
- As of [23 Mar 2020], gatherings of more than 2 persons (with the exception of families and household members) are banned in all federal states. Restaurants and businesses concerned with body care were closed. In public spaces, all persons must maintain a distance of 1.5 metres [5 ft] to other individuals (https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/coronavirus/besprechung-der-bundeskanzlerinmit-den-regierungschefinnen-und-regierungschefs-der-laender-1733248; in German)

[In terms of reported numbers of confirmed cases, Germany is number 5 globally behind the USA, Spain, Italy, and France.

That being said, Germany continues to have a very low crude reported fatality rate (CFR) of 2.2%. One factor explaining the low observed CFR has been attributed to more widespread testing and capture of milder and asymptomatic infections. Another factor was a careful attention to protection of the high risk population -- those over 70 years of age. Of concern now is the increase in outbreaks in nursing homes and hospitals and the increased mortality observed in these outbreaks.
