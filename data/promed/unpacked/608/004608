A 16-year old boy is battling for life at a private hospital in Karachi after he was diagnosed on [Fri 23 Aug 2019] with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare disease caused by _Naegleria fowleri_, a microorganism also referred to as brain-eating bug, health officials said.

"[MS], 16, a resident of the Mahmoodabad area of the city has been diagnosed with _Naegleria fowleri_ infection. He is still alive and undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Karachi," an official of the Sindh health department told The News on [Fri 23 Aug 2019].

According to the experts, PAM is a disease of the central nervous system. PAM is caused by _Naegleria fowleri_, a free-living ameba. It is a rare disease with a very high mortality rate as only 4 of 145 patients of PAM in the United States between 1962 and 2018 survived.

According to health department officials, 11 people have so far died in 2019 in Karachi due to PAM caused by the brain-eating bug. [MS] is the year's 12th patient of the disease. They said _Naegleria fowleri_ infects the brain when a person ingests water through his or her nostrils while making ablution or when water enters into the nasal cavity while swimming in non-chlorinated swimming pools or lakes.

Officials said the boy infected with the deadly microorganism was unable to talk or respond to and they had formed a team of experts that would investigate the case and ascertain the cause of infection so that precautionary measures could be adopted.

Doctors at the private hospital near Kalapul where the teenager has been admitted said the condition of [MS] was "not good" as he had been put on life support and they were trying their best to save his life.

"Patient [MS] was brought in unstable condition to us and medical investigations revealed that he is infected with _Naegleria fowleri_. Currently, he is on ventilator," a doctor said on condition of anonymity.
