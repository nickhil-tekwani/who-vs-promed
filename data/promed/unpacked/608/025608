The director of al-Karkh health department said on Tue 18 Sep 2007 that the

addition to 2 other suspected cases.
"The preliminary tests were positive. It is an elderly man from (Abu Etham
village) of al-al-Taji district near Kadhimiyah in al-Karkh neighborhood,"
Dr Jaleeln al-Shemri told the independent news agency Voices of Iraq (VOI).
"Two more suspected cholera cases arrived at the hospital 2 days ago and
submitted to all necessary tests," he added.
A senior official from the Ministry of Health announced earlier on Tue 18

[The previous ProMED-mail posting gave the number of documented cholera
cases as 1150, with all of the cases from 3 northern provinces of the
Kurdistan part of Iraq. It is unclear whether the Baghdad case or cases are
related to this outbreak further north. Baghdad (the capital of the country
and its own governate) can be found on a map of Iraq at

Two people died, while 45 others fell ill from diarrhea in Sitio Upper
Tubuan, Barangay Lahangkob, North Upi in the province of Shariff Kabunsuan,
the Bureau of Public Information office of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (BPI-Armm) reported Wed 19 Sep 2007.
BPI-Armm said an Emergency Medical Response (EMR) group had been formed
after the Provincial Health Office of Maguindanao reported the alarming
case to the Regional Health Office of the Armm.
The EMR, headed by the Department of Health (DOH)-Armm, together with the
regional, provincial, and rural health units and district hospital staff,
responded by visiting the affected area on Sun 16 Sep 2007. After
conducting check-ups and epidemiologic investigations of about 300 families
in the area, at least 47 cases of diarrhea were confirmed during the
consultation.
"The response team collected stool specimens through rectal swabbing,
especially from children, and conducted epidemiologic investigations to
identify the source of infection," Julie Villadolid, DOH-Armm information
officer said.
Dr Tahir Sulaik, regional secretary of DOH-Armm, expresses distress over
the alarming increase of diarrhea cases at Tiruray tribe in the area,
which, initial reports said, already had 72 cases from 3 to 16 Sep 2007. He
said: "This is so alarming. For only half a month, the figure is already
close to 100."
The response team checked environmental sanitation, especially the hygiene
of the residents, and found that poor hygiene and lack of sanitation
facilities contributed to the occurrence of the disease.

[3] Diarrhea, dysentery - Zimbabwe (Matabeleland North)
Date: Mon 17 Sep 2007

A diarrhoea and dysentery outbreak has hit Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's 2nd largest
and water-starved city, amid reports that about 400 residents have been
treated for the diseases since August 2007. Bulawayo is facing a serious
water shortage that has seen residents go without water for periods of up
to 4 days.
Bulawayo City Council spokesman Phathisa Nyathi confirmed the outbreak of
the 2 diseases and warned residents against using water from unprotected
sources. "We have recorded high numbers of diarrhoea cases in the city
since we started experiencing water problems, and very recently, we also
got reports of cases of dysentery breaking out in the city," Nyathi said.
The outbreak of diarrhoea and dysentery in the city comes hardly a month
after the council warned residents of possible disease outbreaks due to the
water shortages.
Zimbabwe's 2nd city has faced perennial water problems for more than 2
decades, during which both residents and the city fathers have pinned their
hopes on an ambitious project to draw water from the Zambezi river.
Boreholes, which have been providing the residents with most of their water
needs, have also dried up in some parts, leading to the surfacing of black
market water dealers.
