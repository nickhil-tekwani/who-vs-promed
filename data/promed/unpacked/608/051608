Readers who were with us last year will remember the confusing mixed
outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and a syndrome including
encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, heart problems and pulmonary edema
(leakage of fluid into the lungs) that claimed the lives of a number of
children in Sarawak a year ago.
To put the facts in perspective, it is necessary to know that HFMD occurs
annually in Sarawak -- and in many other countries -- principally in
children under 10, and is seasonal. The season in Sarawak begins shortly.
The infection produces vesicles (blisters) on the hands and feet and ulcers
in the mouth. It is very rarely fatal. It is transmitted by direct contact
with nose and throat secretions and feces of infected individuals, and by
aerosol. It is caused by Human coxsackieviruses A4, B5, B9, B10, and
particularly B16; by Human coxsackieviruses B2 and B5; and by Human
enterovirus 71 (EV71). EV71 was isolated from a number of cases of HFMD
during the Malaysian outbreak.
Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne disease, affects all ages, and
is often fatal. It attacks the brain, and is caused by a flavivirus, a
virus of a different family (Flaviviridae) from the Coxsackieviruses and
enteroviruses (family Picornaviridae). Mosquitoes acquire JE virus from
wildlife or pigs and transmit it to humans. No isolations of JE virus were
made during the Malaysian outbreak, so it is unlikely that any of the
encephalitic symptoms seen were due to JE virus.
Viral carditis, or viral myocarditis, may be caused by a variety of Human
coxsackieviruses of both groups A and B, including Human coxsackievirus B5
(CB5). The symptoms are heart failure due to inflammation of the heart
muscle. Laboratory tests on cases in Sarawak were reported to have shown
antibodies to CB5. However, some fatal cases showed no inflammation of the
cardiac muscle.
It appears that most of the fatal cases were not due to EV71 or
CB5 alone, and that none was due to JE virus. We understand that several
isolates of a possibly new virus of yet another virus family were made from
fatal cases by CDC and others. It would be a public service to release
details of this agent.

[The epidemiologic evidence for etiologic attribution in these cases is
scant. Withholding information and absence of full discussions of
laboratory results will, in the long run, prove to be counterproductive. -
