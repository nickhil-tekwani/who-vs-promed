Dozens of employees with the New Mexico Department of Health have been sickened with a type of food poisoning at their own holiday luncheon, according to a Santa Fe New Mexican report this week. Of the approximately 200 employees of the health department that attended the catered event at the Harold Runnels Building, some 70 people were struck with gastrointestinal symptoms. The caterer has been identified as the Kick Ass Sandwich Shop in Santa Fe, which was discovered not to have a permit to cater the event. This prompted the New Mexico Environment Department to issue the restaurant with a notice of violation.

The etiology of the outbreak appears to be _Clostridium perfringens_. _C. perfringens_ is a type of bacterium that can be found in a variety of foods, particularly meats, meat products, and gravy. Emetic toxins produced by _C. perfringens_ bacteria are characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea, which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1 or 2 weeks.

According to local media, the Kick Ass Sandwich Shop was opened earlier in 2016 and was called Bad Ass Sandwich Co; however, they changed their name after a Utah-based coffee company with a similar name filed a trademark infringement lawsuit.

[Oops, unfortunately this cluster of foodborne illness occurred at a Health Department party. As a reminder, unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness where the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease, the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. - Mod.LL
