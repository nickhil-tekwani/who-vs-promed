_Salmonella enteritidis_ PT 1 outbreak in a hotel on Mallorca
---------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of _S. enteritidis_ phage type (PT) 1 infection on the Balearic
island of Mallorca has been reported. The hotel, in the resort of Calas de
Mallorca on the Eastern coast of Mallorca, provides 'all inclusive'
catering for British holidaymakers.
The outbreak is believed to have been a result of a meal eaten on the
evening of 2 June 1998, and cases first presented with stomach complaints
on 3 and 4 June.
Twenty-five cases were admitted to hospital and _S. enteritidis_ PT1 has
been isolated from 284 of the 1,320 guests who were at the hotel at that
time (PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, unpublished data).
Two hundred and twenty-four of the strains have an additional marker of
resistance to nalidixic acid. Local public health officials are
investigating. Mousse and tomato sauce were implicated in an
epidemiological study, but no leftovers were available for microbiological
testing. Deficits in food handling and the cold chain were identified and
control measures have been implemented.
This is the second outbreak of _S. enteritidis_ PT 1 reported from Mallorca
in recent years: in 1996 it was identified in raw shell eggs used to make
omelets.
Reported by the Gastrointestinal disease section (gastro@phls.co.uk), PHLS
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, London, England. Additional
details from Salvador de Mateo (smateo@isciii.es), Servicio de Vigilancia
Epidemiologica, Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia Madrid, Spain.
