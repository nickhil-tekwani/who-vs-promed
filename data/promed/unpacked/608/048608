Latest available situation summary, 22 Jan 2015 [as of 19 Jan 2015, Guinea and Sierra Leone, 20 Jan 2015, Liberia]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total in the 3 epidemic countries (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone):
21 759 cases [13 587 confirmed]
8668 deaths [confirmed deaths not available from Liberia]

[70 more cases and 42 more deaths in the week since 18 Jan 2015. These numbers indicate the epidemic is clearly slowing down. - Mod.LK]

Ebola situation report -- 18 Jan 2015
-------------------------------------
Case incidence continues to fall in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with a halving time of 1.4 weeks in Guinea, 2.0 weeks Liberia, and 2.7 weeks in Sierra Leone. A combined total of 145 confirmed cases were reported from the 3 countries in the week to 18 Jan 2015: 20 in Guinea, 8 in Liberia, and 117 in Sierra Leone.

Mali has been declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD) after completing 42 days since the last case tested negative for EVD.

Surveillance and information sharing will be increased in the border districts of Guinea-Bissau, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal adjacent to the 3 intense-transmission countries.

Each of the intense-transmission countries has sufficient capacity to isolate and treat patients, with more than 2 treatment beds per reported confirmed, probable and suspected case. The planned numbers of beds in each country has now been reduced in accordance with falling case incidence.

Similarly, each country has sufficient capacity to bury all people known to have died from EVD.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone report that between 89 percent and 99 percent of registered contacts are monitored each day, though the number of contacts traced per EVD case remains lower than expected in many districts. In the week to 11 Jan [2015], 53 percent of new confirmed cases in Guinea arose from known contacts; in the period between 1 Jan [2015] and 15 Jan [2015], 53 percent of new confirmed cases in Liberia arose from known contacts. Equivalent data are not yet available for Sierra Leone.

There are currently 27 laboratories providing case-confirmation services in the 3 intense-transmission countries. 5 more laboratories are planned in order to meet demand. The mean time between sample collection to sample testing in the 21 days to 18 Jan [2015] was 1.37 days in Guinea, 2.03 days in Liberia, and 2.32 days in Sierra Leone, although several districts in Guinea have yet to report data.
Case fatality among hospitalized patients (calculated from all hospitalized patients with a reported definitive outcome) is between 57 percent and 59 percent in the 3 intense-transmission countries, with no detectable improvement since the onset of the epidemic.

A total of 828 health worker infections have been reported in the 3 intense-transmission countries; there have been 499 reported deaths. The incidence of health worker infections has fallen in Liberia and Sierra Leone, but rose in Guinea throughout December.

As an indication of community engagement, 71 percent of districts in Guinea and 100 percent of districts in Sierra Leone have a list of key religious leaders who promote safe and dignified burials. No data are available for Liberia. Incidents of community resistance to safe burials and contact tracing continue to be reported in all 3 countries, although they are most common in Guinea.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been in excess of 21 000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases (Annex 1) of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (table 1), with more than 8600 deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 20 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 8 in Liberia, and 117 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 18 Jan [2015].

A stratified analysis of cumulative confirmed and probable cases indicates that the number of cases in males and females is similar (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are almost 4 times more likely to be affected than are children.

A total of 828 health worker infections have been reported in the 3 intense-transmission countries; there have been 499 reported deaths (table 3).

[2] Splintered outbreaks

Splinter Ebola Outbreaks Hinder Fight Against Virus: UN
-------------------------------------------------------
West Africa's Ebola epidemic has morphed into several micro-outbreaks of varying intensity and with the potential to reignite more widespread contagion, a United Nations official said. The pattern of spread has become more nuanced and complex, occurring over a wider area, David Nabarro, the UN Secretary-General's special envoy on Ebola, said in a report by the Global Ebola Response Information Centre. The 36-page publication, dated January 2015, outlines progress to date and changes in the global response needed to end the deadly scourge, which began in December 2013 in a remote area of Guinea, near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. ... -- more

The Ebola Scourge
-----------------
"Ending the outbreak will not be easy because the disease is being transmitted in 3 countries with a collective land area greater than the United Kingdom," Nabarro said. "Success can only be achieved if communities themselves understand the nature of the outbreak and act in ways that reduce their likelihood of becoming infected."

The intensity of the epidemic has now reached a plateau and is starting to decline in some places, the report said.

The overall disease reproduction rate, which gauges the propensity for an infection to spread in the community, fell below 1.0 last month [December 2014], from about 1.4 in September [2014], the report said. At the peak of the epidemic in the 3rd quarter of last year [2014], new Ebola cases were doubling every 3 weeks in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the 3 worst-affected countries.

'Sustained Commitment'
----------------------
"Reaching zero cases and enabling durable social and economic recovery will require sustained commitment from a global coalition of supporters throughout 2015," UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the foreword of the report, titled "Making a Difference -- The Global Ebola Response: Outlook 2015."

By mid-December [2014], there were more than 2000 beds in Ebola treatment centers, compared with fewer than 350 in mid-August [2014], when patients were being turned away because of lack of capacity, Nabarro said. Available beds now exceed the number of Ebola patients recorded each week, though treatment capacity is unevenly distributed in all 3 most-affected countries.

"Many deaths are still unreported, and communities in some areas are still reluctant to adopt safe burial practices or seek treatment," he said. "The virus is lurking close by and in coming months it may make a comeback if we become complacent and let down our guard." Local community involvement is crucial, said Sakoba Keita, head of Guinea's Emergency Operations Centre. ... -- more

[A number of reports looking retrospectively at the Ebola epidemic appear to be coming out now saying that cases are decreasing in most areas. See 22 Jan 2015 Ebola update (22): summary, current needs, costs, technology, S. Africa, susp. 20150122.3109442 [1] for a WHO report. However, it is important that vigilance be maintained as a single case can lead to a flare up. - Mod.LK]

[A 35-year-old man suspected of having Ebola appears to have most likely died from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF]. This disease is caused by a tick-borne virus -- Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family. Sources said another person, who worked with the deceased at the private hospital where he was being treated previously, died due to similar complications on Sun [18 Jan 2015]. Like Ebola, CCHF is a highly infectious disease in hospital settings due to infectious blood and bodily fluids, as well as contaminated medical equipment. - Mod.LK]

Rapid communications. Abstract [edited]: We describe 2 Ebola virus (EBOV) RT-PCR discordant mother-child pairs. In the 1st, blood from the breastfeeding mother, recovering from EBOV infection, tested negative twice but her urine tested positive. Her child became infected by EBOV and died. In the 2nd, the breastfed child remained EBOV-negative, although the mother's blood tested positive. We highlight possible benefits of EBOV RT-PCR testing in urine and breast milk and the need for hygiene counselling when those fluids are EBOV-positive. - Mod.LK]
