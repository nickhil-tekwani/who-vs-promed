[The UK Department of Health web-site has been revised, and the
monthly new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics are now
appended to the table "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK by
Calendar Year (since 1990)," which can be accessed at
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/10/94/42/04109442.pdf>.
The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health web-site, or, by reference to a previous
ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK:
update Mar 2002 20020305.3693).

The incidence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated CJD
(new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- in the UK appears to have
reached a plateau, or is perhaps in decline. Therefore, since many of
the reports appearing in the update are only peripherally related to
the situation in the UK, the opportunity is being taken to drop the
designation UK from the title of this thread.

Also, data on other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and
GSS) are now included where they have some relevance to the incidence
and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease Statistics - As of 1 Jul 2005
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Fri 1 Jul 2005] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:

Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:

Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 107
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 42
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 150

Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 156

(The next table will be published on Mon 1 Aug 2005)

[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 3 Jun
2005, the total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD
remains unchanged at 150, and the number of probable vCJD cases still
alive also remains unchanged at 6. Therefore, the overall total
number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains
unchanged at 156. These data are consistent with the view that the
vCJD outbreak in the UK is now in decline. The number of deaths due
to definite or probable vCJD in the UK during the 1st 6 months of
2005 is 2. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004.

As of 1 Jul 2005, so far in the UK for the year 2005, there have been
60 referrals of suspected CJD; and there have been 19 deaths from
sporadic CJD, one from GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome),
one from familial CJD, one from iatrogenic CJD and 2 from vCJD. Data
for years since 1990 can be accessed at

[2] Portugal: 12-year-old boy is 1st Case of vCJD

Portugal; 12-year-old Boy is 1st Probable Case of vCJD
-----------------------------------------------
The Portuguese Direccao-Geral da Saude (Directorate-General for
Health) was recently informed of the 1st probable case of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in Portugal with laboratory evidence
(tonsil biopsy). [See also: CJD (new var.) - Portugal: 1st case;
France 20050611.1630. - Mod.CP]

The patient is a 12-year-old boy currently living with his parents
and receiving specialist medical care. The case meets the European
and Allied Countries Collaborative Study Group of CJD's (EUROCJD)
definition of probable vCJD
<http://www.eurocjd.ed.ac.uk/def.htm>
and has been confirmed by the United Kingdom's National CJD
Surveillance Unit. The patient does not have a history of travel to
the United Kingdom.

[3] Ireland: Suspected case of vCJD in Dublin hospital

Ireland: Suspected Case of vCJD in Dublin Hospital
-----------------------------------------------
A patient in a Dublin hospital is suspected to be suffering from
variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, Health Minister Mary
Harney said. Harney, who is also deputy prime minister, said in a
statement the "probable case" was awaiting confirmation.

"She has been assured that every possible safeguard and preventative
measure had been taken by the relevant agencies, the hospital
management and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service," the statement
said. The statement appealed to the news media "not to identify the
hospital and to respect the privacy of the family at this very
difficult time."

Last November [2005], a young Irishman was diagnosed with the fatal
degenerative brain disease that can be transmitted through blood and
infected meat. Previously, a woman who had lived in Britain was also
diagnosed with the disease in the Republic.

Up to the middle of June [2005], 33 cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, had been discovered [in
cattle] in Ireland this year. The BSE figures are showing a steady
decline. During the equivalent period last year [2004], 68 cases were
discovered, compared to 102 in 2003 and 176 in 2002. Since January
2001, all Irish cattle aged over 30 months that are destined for
human consumption are tested for BSE.

[In order to assess whether this is a case of indigenous infection or
not, it will be necessary to establish whether the young man had
visited or worked in the United Kingdom at any time prior to the
appearance of signs and symptoms of vCJD. - Mod.CP]
