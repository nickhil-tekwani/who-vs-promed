'Rabbit fever' disease could affect pets
----------------------------------------
Wild rabbits in the Dewey area are contracting tularemia and dying, according to Yavapai County Community Health Services (YCCHS). The disease, also known as "rabbit fever," was confirmed by the state laboratory after testing a dead rabbit this past week.

"We usually see one or 2 cases of tularemia in animals each year," said Stephen Everett, epidemiologist for YCCHS. People and pets who spend time outdoors can contact tularemia if they are bitten by deerflies, ticks or other insects or by handling infected rodents or rabbits, he said.

Tularemia is a treatable, naturally occurring illness in the United States, with about 120 [human] cases reported each year. Most occur within the western and south-central states. A germ that animals (especially rodents, rabbits and hares) carry causes the disease, which can be passed on to domestic animals and people. Family pets with outdoor roaming privileges can carry ticks into the home and may expose humans to tick-borne illnesses. Rarely, tularemia can spread to humans through contaminated food or water or by inhaling the airborne germ. It is not known to spread from person to person.

People can avoid tularemia by applying DEET-based insect repellent to exposed skin while spending time outdoors. People can also apply tick medicine and tick collars to cats and dogs to protect the pet and the owner. Pet owners should also avoid touching any dead animal that their cat may have brought home. Hunters should wear rubber gloves when skinning game to protect themselves from contaminated blood getting in an open wound.

Symptoms in humans include sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, progressive weakness and, in severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia. Symptoms vary from person to person and generally show up 3 to 5 days after exposure, but sometimes as late as 14 days later.

Those who think they may have contracted tularemia should contact their doctors at the 1st sign of illness and tell them if you have had exposure to sick or dead animals, if you are pregnant or if you have a weakened immune system. Also, note any changes in pet behavior and consult a veterinarian if the pet develops unusual symptoms.

[To quote my colleague Larry Lutwick: "_Francisella tularensis_, the bacterium that causes tularemia, is considered a category-A bioterrorism agent. Cases associated with the skinning of rabbits usually involve glandular (lymph node) or ulceroglandular (skin and lymph node) infection. Large outbreaks, especially in eastern Europe or Asia, can be associated with water exposure.

Pneumonic tularemia can cause a severe and fatal pneumonia when the organism is spread by aerosol, as might occur in a biological attack. However, pneumonic tularemia also occurs without the involvement of bioterrorism, as demonstrated by posts below in New York City as well as outbreaks on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Unlike pneumonic plague, pneumonic tularemia does not spread from person to person."

It's that time of year again. While the Arizona report has this disease correctly concentrated in the western and south central states it occurs across the northern tier and along the Atlantic coast states though in smaller numbers. To get an idea of this latter distribution just do a posting recall on "tularemia AND usa". But even in the high incidence areas all we usually see is just the occasional and sporadic dead rabbit. Then suddenly there will be a summer when one suddenly has 10 or more square miles of dead jack rabbits. What triggers it from being a background to a foreground situation is obscure. Over the years the Texas veterinary public health surveillance teams have been running tick safaris. Their collection of _F. tularensis_ strains will vary from the lethal to the essentially apathogenic. The epidemiology and ecology of this disease awaits clarification. - Mod.MHJ
