[see
Rabbit hem. dis. virus, transmission by insects 970930192410]
Regarding the rabbit calicivirus disease outbreak in Australian rabbits
[caused by rabbit hemmorhagic disease virus] the following statement was made:
"The question remains as to whether there is active virus replication
(biological) in insects that are transmitting the virus or whether there is
mechanical transmission. There being no evidence to date that this or any
other calicivirus replicates in either arthropods or in cell cultures from
arthropods, .... -- Mod CHC"
My virus taxonomy is a little rusty, but what is the current thinking about
amyelosis chronic stunt virus of the navel orangeworm? Is this no longer
considered a candidate for the _Calciviridae_?

[Quite right. Amyelosis chronic stunt virus is an unassigned virus in the
family _Caliciviridae_. Thanks for the correction. The potential
implications for RHDV are obvious but may be incorrect. -- Mod CHC]
