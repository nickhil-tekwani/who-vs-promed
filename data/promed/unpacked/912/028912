[1] Merck: Molnupiravir
Date: Sun 17 Oct 2021

The plan to roll out Merck & Co's (MRK.N) promising antiviral pill to treat COVID-19 risks repeating the inequities of vaccine distribution, potentially leaving the nations with the greatest need once again at the back of the line, international health groups say.

For example, only about 5% of Africa's population is immunized, creating an urgent need for therapeutics that could keep people out of hospitals. That compares with more than a 70% inoculation rate in most wealthy nations.

Merck on [11 Oct 2021] applied for U.S. emergency clearance of the first pill for COVID-19 after it cut hospitalizations and deaths by 50% in a large clinical trial. The medicine, made with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, could gain authorization as soon as December [2021].

The U.S. drugmaker has taken the unusual pandemic step of licensing several generics of its antiviral molnupiravir before its branded version was even authorized for marketing.

But international health officials said even that is not enough for the medicine to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers, while noting shortcomings and red tape among global organizations that could further slow distribution.

Merck this year [2021] plans to produce 10 million treatment courses of the pill, which is taken twice a day for 5 days, and another 20 million next year [2022].

In addition, its licensing deals with 8 Indian drugmakers will allow cheaper generic versions for 109 low- and middle-income countries including in Africa, a move international groups acknowledge is a positive concession.

But as wealthy nations secure molnupiravir supply deals - the United States has already locked up 1.7 million courses with an option for 3.5 million more by [January 2023] at about USD700 per course - concerns grow over who might be left out.

Merck said it has worked on the technology transfer needed to start generic manufacturing, in contrast to vaccine makers who continue to resist calls to waive patents or allow for generic versions to boost supplies.

But a recent report prepared for the United Nations' Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator program tasked with buying COVID-19 therapeutics for poor countries cited concerns that U.N. agencies were not moving quickly enough to secure adequate volumes of potential new treatments ahead of time, including Merck's drug.

Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, has 24 companies signed up and willing to make the drug if Merck agrees to expand the licenses.

"If you're not in the license, you're relying on Merck, and it looks to us that that could mean a potential supply shortfall as well as overpricing," said Peter Maybarduk of Public Citizen, who sits on the MPP governance board. He suggested that could lead to wealthy countries outbidding poor nations for the medicine.

It is unclear how many generic pills will be available or when. The licensed Indian manufacturers including Aurobindo Pharma (ARBN.NS), Cipla Ltd (CIPL.NS), Dr. Reddy's Labs (REDY.NS), Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Sun Pharmaceuticals (SUN.NS), and Torrent Pharmaceuticals (TORP.NS) declined to provide details on production plans.

In addition, manufacturing for low-income countries in many nations also requires World Health Organization (WHO) approval, a regulatory process that typically takes months.

Merck said it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country's ability to pay. A spokesperson confirmed it is in discussions about expanding licenses for generic molnupiravir "to build sufficient global supply of quality-assured product to meet orders globally."

But middle-income countries will be hard pressed to negotiate against the richest nations, another MPP official said.

The governments of Australia, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia said they already had deals or were negotiating supply contracts with Merck. The EU is considering buying the pill after Merck applies for authorization in Europe.

The 8 generic manufacturers chosen by Merck all have WHO pre-qualified facilities to allow them to supply buyers like the Global Fund, according to Paul Schaper, Merck's executive director of global public policy. They will set their pricing and decide how much they plan to manufacture.

"What we are anticipating and hoping for is that they will compete with each other on pricing," Schaper said.

[2] Delta variant AY.4
Date: Sun 17 Oct 2021
Source: Bloomberg News [abridged, edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/u-k-covid-case-load-prompts-gottlieb-call-for-urgent-research


Former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called for "urgent research" following a surge in UK cases with the new delta variant.

"We need urgent research to figure out if this delta plus is more transmissible, has partial immune evasion," he said in a tweet. "There's no clear indication that it's considerably more transmissible, but we should work to more quickly characterize these and other new variants. We have the tools." -- Scott Gottlieb, MD @ScottGottliebMD

UK reported its biggest one-day COVID case increase in 3 months just as the new delta variant AY.4 with the S:Y145H mutation in the spike reaches 8% of UK sequenced cases. We need urgent research to figure out if this delta plus is more transmissible, has partial immune evasion? [see more of Dr Gottlieb's Twitter in the comment below. - Mod.LK]

Gottlieb's comments come as the UK reported the highest daily jump in new cases on [Sun 17 Oct 2021] since mid-July [2021] -- around when Prime Boris Johnson authorized the removal of most COVID-related restrictions in what was dubbed "Freedom Day."

Weekly deaths from the virus have topped 800 for each of the past 6 weeks, higher than in other major western European nations, according to Bloomberg's coronavirus tracker. To date, the U.K. has recorded almost 140 000 COVID-related fatalities.

"The [delta plus] variant has been in the UK since about July 2021, but it has been slowly increasing in prevalence. There's no clear indication that it's considerably more transmissible, but we should work to more quickly characterize these and other new variants. We have the tools.

"This is not a cause for immediate concern but a reminder that we need robust systems to identify, characterize new variants. This needs to be a coordinated, global priority for COVID same as similar international efforts have become standard practice in influenza." (Scott Gottlieb, MD, @ScottGottliebMD)

The delta variant continues to evolve and should be characterized, especially in light of the increasing number of cases in the UK. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 9 countries including the UK (44 989), Russia (34 303), Turkey (24 114), USA (17 947), India (14 289), Romania (11 546), Iran (11 396), Ukraine (11 288), and Thailand (10 863), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4024 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 15 Oct 2021 to late 16 Oct 2021). A total of 57 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 35 of the 57 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 4 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 3.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 14.3% decrease in daily reported cases and 19.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 300 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 241.47 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.91 million reported deaths - Mod.UBA]
