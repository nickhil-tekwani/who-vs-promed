As a result of the detection and confirmation of a case of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) [presumably in an equine animal] in the La Esperanza area of the Hibachara locality in Piojo municipality (south of Atlantico [department; state equivalent]), the ICA [Colombian agricultural and livestock institute] has decreed a preventive quarantine in 7 municipalities and 71 neighborhoods in the north of [neighboring] Bolivar [department].

This decision was taken on 28 Dec [2012] based on resolution 155 signed by Cristobal Monterrosa, ICA Section Director, but it was communicated to this agency only last Friday night [11 Jan 2013].

This measure ends in 30 calendar days, on 28 Jan [2013], but it can be extended if new cases are found. ICA stated that the quarantine covers all of the municipalities of Clemencia, San Cristobal, San Estanislao, Santa Catalina, Santa Rosa, Soplaviento, and Villanueva, all at the southern border with Atlantico department. It also covers the localities of Arjona, Cartagena, Mahates, and Turbaco.

According to ICA's ruling, movement of horses, mules, and donkeys from these areas is prohibited.

VEE is a disease that shows the following signs among others: disorientation, walking in circles, depression, blindness, lowered head, lack of appetite, and fever. It is recommended that owners of these animals report any suspected cases to ICA.

The issuance of this situation comes at a time when many horse owners are requesting permission to participate in the mounted procession of the Virgin of La Candelaria [2 Feb 2013].

[Although imposition of a quarantine over a relatively broad area may seem extreme, it is, in fact, prudent. Horses can develop a very high VEE viremia. Early in the infection they may show no signs, other than fever. There is the temptation that when VEE hits an area, owners of equine animals, especially unvaccinated, valuable ones, may quickly (and sometimes clandestinely) move their viremic animals out of the area to escape the outbreak, but spreading it as a result. Equine animals are the amplifying hosts of epizootic VEE virus (subtypes IAB and C).

The northern coastal plain of Colombia has historically been an area of significant VEE epizootics with high mortality in unvaccinated equine animals and significant morbidity among humans. Equine case fatality may reach 80 per cent, and surviving animals may have serious neurological sequelae. Although there is an effective attenuated live VEE virus vaccine commercially available, because cases and outbreaks are sporadic, owners of equine animals may forget to vaccinate them, or just neglect to do so, which is unfortunate. The loss of one animal may well exceed the cost of vaccination.
