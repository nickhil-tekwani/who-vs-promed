Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 42 000 / 500 / 100 / 25 000 / 0 / 0

[As mentioned in the epidemiological comments, Israel is on the migration route of wild birds coming from Europe to Africa; avian influenza (AI) outbreaks are mostly synchronized with the migration season.

"Wild birds normally carry AI viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not usually get sick, which allows them to carry the viruses long distances along their migration flyways" (https://www.oie.int/en/disease/avian-influenza/). - Mod.CRD
