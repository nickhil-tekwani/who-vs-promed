A comment from the arthropod-borne disease lab, Suffolk county, New York
-----------------------------------------------
Suffolk County, Long Island, New York has picked up some 20 isolations of
Flanders virus in _Culex_ spp., in 2004, during the course of its arbovirus
surveillance. This virus is non-pathogenic to humans and is named after a
community in Suffolk County. I agree with the assessment that part of the
reason that we are seeing more of this virus is improved surveillance,
including more use of Vero cells in the State lab to screen for all
arboviruses. The finding of live Flanders virus in our samples gives
additional assurance that our Arthropod Borne Disease Lab is handling the
mosquitoes correctly.

[Dr. Ninivaggi's remarks reinforce the view that increased surveillance for
West Nile virus is resulting in detection of several pathogenic, and
nonpathogenic, viruses, which, previously, would have escaped detection.
Flanders virus is an unclassified member of the family _Rhabdoviridae_,
which has been isolated from mosquitoes throughout the USA, Canada, and
Mexico. It is not known to be associated with any animal, or human,
disease. It is not related to Jamestown Canyon virus, which belongs to the
family _Bunyaviridae_. - Mod.CP]
