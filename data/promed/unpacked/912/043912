A total of 6 New Jersey non-racing horse farms, including 5 in
Monmouth County, were under quarantine Thursday [1 Apr 2010] because
of a possible outbreak of a deadly equine virus.

Except for a farm in Millstone, the Monmouth County farms are all in
Howell according to the state Department of Agriculture, whose
Division of Animal Health announced the quarantine Thursday [1 Apr
2010]. The 5th farm is in Gloucester County, according to the
agriculture department.

The disease, called the [equine herpes], is not harmful to humans and
other animals, but it can spread quickly to horses and is often fatal
to them, according to the agriculture department.

"Quarantines are necessary to ensure that this serious disease does
not spread,'' said state Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H Fisher.
"Our investigation is continuing as we work to protect the health and
safety of horses in New Jersey and other states.''

The agriculture department noted tests, so far, have not confirmed the
disease. But the quarantines went into effect after 2 horses showed
clinical signs of the disease and were euthanized and another with
similar signs died, according to the department.

One of the farms is connected in some way to all the other farms under
quarantine, Lynn Richmond, an agriculture department spokeswoman. The
quarantines were put in place over various days within the last week
or so, and are expected to remain in place for weeks, Richmond said.

[Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically
distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2
of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide
and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary
infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis.
Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas
with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in
weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and
geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and
horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is
determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and
possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in
abortion.

Outbreaks with specific strains of EHV-1 infection result in
neurologic disease. Clinical signs vary from mild incoordination and
posterior paresis to severe posterior paralysis with recumbency, loss
of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin in the
perineal and inguinal areas. In exceptional cases, the paralysis may
progress to quadriplegia and death. Prognosis depends on severity of
signs and the period of recumbency. Neurologic disease associated with
EHV-1 is thought to occur more commonly in mares after abortion
storms, but it has been reported in barren mares, stallions, geldings,
and foals after an outbreak of EHV-1 respiratory infection.

For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases,
management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New
horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated for
3-4 weeks before commingling with resident horses, especially pregnant
mares. Management-related stress-inducing circumstances should be
avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant mares
should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings, yearlings,
and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory disease or
abortion, affected horses should be isolated and appropriate measures
taken for disinfection of contaminated premises. No horse should leave
the premises for 3 weeks after recovery of the last clinical case.

Parenterally administered modified live vaccines are licensed in some
countries but banned in others. An inactivated vaccine is the only
product currently recommended by the manufacturer as an aid in
prevention of EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during
moths 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Humoral immunity induced by
vaccination against EHV-1 and EHV-4 generally persists for only 2-4
months. Antigenic variation within each virus type means that
available vaccines do not cover all strains to which horses can be
exposed. Vaccination should begin when foals are 3-4 months old and,
depending on the vaccine used, a 2nd dose given 4-8 weeks later.
Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 3-6 months
through maturity. Vaccination programs against EHV-1 should include
all horses on the premises.
