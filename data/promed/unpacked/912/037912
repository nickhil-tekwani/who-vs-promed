The National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) has intensified
efforts to save Nigeria from losing its status as the world's largest
producer of cocoyam by finding solutions to the disease presently
ravaging farms across Nigeria and even beyond.

Cocoyam leaf blight is threatening production, but NRCRI said that
they have commenced research into how the disease could be controlled.
Already, Abia, Ebonyi, Benue and Imo states have been affected by the
disease. "Nigeria is worried about this outbreak," they said.

The head of NRCRI, Nwosu, explained that the disease is caused by the
fungus _Phytophthora colocasiae_ and described the outbreak as
disastrous because "what we've seen in the fields, it can result in
100 percent loss to farmers." The crop is grown for low income
earners. There is growing concern that it could [also] affect other
root crops like yam and cassava.

Nwosu said that the scourge was a sub-regional crisis as it has [also]
been reported in Togo and Ghana. When it appeared in Cameroon, that
government promptly wrote Nigeria to find a lasting solution. NRCRI,
therefore, urged the federal government to declare the disease a
disaster and said that they would partner State Agricultural
Development Programmes (ADP) to reach farmers with short and long term
remedies. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture said that in the next 12
or 24 months, government would come up with remedial measures.

Re: taro disease in Cameroon, ProMED-mail post 20100715.2365
-----------------------------------
For the moment, we can say that the preliminary DNA sequence analysis
using the ITS region [internal transcribed spacer region, routinely
used to examine relationships among races of _Phytophthora_ - Mod.DHA]
shows more than 99 percent matches to the _Phytophthora
colocasiae_/_P. citrophthora_ species aggregate. We are continuing our
analysis in an effort to separate these closely related species.

A ProMED-mail post [20100715.2365] on an outbreak of taro leaf blight
in Cameroon produced a lot of comments from members.

The experiences of the Pacific after the outbreak of the disease in
Samoa in 1993 are relevant. At first, spraying was advocated, as well
as cultural practices, such as cutting off diseased leaves, but
neither worked well. Fungicides were too expensive except for the
wealthiest farmers, and leaf pruning proved futile in the high Samoan
rainfall. The only chance of overcoming the problem was to breed for
resistance. This was done in Samoa and also in Papua New Guinea, but
it took a few years to get donor support. Today, the disease is no
longer a threat to taro production [in Samoa].

Cameroon would do well to study the events that occurred in Samoa
after the outbreak, which have been documented in several papers. The
country might also wish to note some of the comments from PestNet
members that are provided [as links via the source URL].

There was surprise that donor support could be not obtained; there was
also a mention of the crops that farmers grew in Samoa to substitute
for the loss of taro. Furthermore, there are pathogen-indexed plants
available in tissue culture from the SPC [Secretariat of the Pacific
Community], and the only issue to be resolved is that of IP.
Presumably, any varieties sent to Cameroon would be under the
International Treaty on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.

[Taro [_Colocasia esculenta_] leaf blight caused by the fungus
_Phytophthora colocasiae_ was 1st reported in Java in the early
1900's. Since then, it was found in various parts of Asia and the
Pacific, but this appears to be the 1st record of the disease in
Africa. Both leaves and tubers of the crop are used, with yield losses
of 30-50 percent reported previously, but item 1 above now reports
total crop losses in Nigeria. The disease also lowers the quality of
the reduced harvest.

Symptoms include purple-brown water-soaked lesions on leaves oozing a
clear yellow liquid; lesions enlarge and eventually destroy entire
leaves in 10-20 days, leading to reduced photosynthesis and vigour of
the plant. Disease development and spread is favoured by free water
collecting on older leaves, high temperatures and high humidity.

The pathogen can be spread by wind, splashing rain and mechanical
means (including insects and human activities). Spores survive in
plant material for several weeks, and, therefore, infected planting
material is a common means of pathogen spread over long distances and
between seasons. Disease management using an integrated approach has
been successful in the Pacific, as reported in item 3 above, including
cultural methods (such as crop rotation, intercropping), fungicides,
phytosanitation and use of cultivars with reduced levels of
susceptibility.

Varying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to the
suggestion that different strains of _P. colocasiae_ may exist, in
addition to differences in the genetic background of local taro
varieties. Some of these strains appear to be able to infect some
other aroid crops (for example _Alocasia_ species) as well, but
further information is needed on whether non-aroid crops like yam
(_Dioscorea_ species) and cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) could be
affected by these pathogens, as is suggested in item 1 above.
