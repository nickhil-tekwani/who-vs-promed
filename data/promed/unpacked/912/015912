Measles outbreak in Switzerland - an update relevant for the European
football championship (EURO 2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since November 2006, Switzerland has been experiencing the largest
measles outbreak registered in the country since the introduction of
mandatory notification for this disease in 1999. The 1st 8 months of
this outbreak have already been described in this journal [1]. From
November 2006 to 13 Feb 2008, 1405 measles cases were reported by
physicians or laboratories in Switzerland (1106 of them in 2007). Of
these, 976 cases (69 percent) occurred in the cantons of Lucerne (29
percent of the total), Basel-Land (16 percent), Zurich (11 percent)
Bern (7 percent), and Aargau (7 percent). The incidence for the whole
country and all ages, calculated for this 15-month period, was 19
cases per 100 000 inhabitants (15 cases per 100 000 for the year
2007). For children under the age of 16 years living in the canton of
Lucerne, it was 500
per 100 000.

Outbreak description
--------------------
The ongoing outbreak began among school-age children in the canton of
Lucerne. Its origin remains unknown. The disease then spread
progressively to all Swiss cantons, with large differences in
incidence rates and a great variety of settings (See Figures 1 and 2
in the original text). Measles virus (MV) of genotype D5 was detected
in saliva or throat swabs from 56 patients living in 10 cantons. Most
of the MV sequences obtained from these cases were identical, and
some showed only one or 2 nucleotide differences from the major
variant. The 1st sample was taken in November 2006 in the canton of
Lucerne, while the last was collected in November 2007 in the canton
of Basel-Land. In addition, one genotype A-related vaccine virus was
found in a woman vaccinated post-partum with the
measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine and presenting 13 days after
vaccination with a typical measles rash. B3 virus was isolated from 2
cases who had recently been abroad. One had returned from Italy 4
days prior to rash onset, the other from Ethiopia 2 days prior to
onset of symptoms.

The monthly number of cases has increased steadily from November 2006
to a first peak in August 2007 with 170 reported cases (data
illustrated by a histogram). The number of cases then decreased to a
minimum of 60 in December 2007 before reaching a second peak in
January 2008 with 233 cases. Since October 2007, most cases were
registered in the cantons of Basel-City and especially Basel-Land in
northern Switzerland (64 percent of total cases since the beginning of 2008).

About half of the cases (693 or 49 percent) have been confirmed,
either by detecting measles-IgM antibody or the measles virus RNA by
RT-PCR (555 or 40 percent), or by an epidemiological link with a
laboratory- confirmed case (138 or 10 percent). Due to the increasing
proportion of cases who have not provided a sample for laboratory
testing or information about an epidemiological link, these
proportions have decreased since the 1st half of the outbreak,
whereas the proportion of cases fulfilling only the clinical case
definition (fever and rash, as well as cough or rhinitis or
conjunctivitis) has increased to 43 percent. The proportion of cases
for whom clinical data are not yet available or who did not
completely fulfil the case definition has remained unchanged (8 percent).

There has been a slight majority (51 percent) of males among the
cases. The patients' median age has been 11 years. The median age has
increased recently: in late 2006 and 2007, 29 percent of the patients
were 15 years old or older, compared to 53 percent since the
beginning of 2008. The incidence rate was highest in the 5- to
9-year-old group. A total of 6 percent of the 1319 cases with
detailed information were vaccinated against measles, 85 percent were
unvaccinated, and the vaccination status of the remaining 8 percent
was unknown.

The proportion of vaccinated patients has been low for all ages (data
presented as a figure in the original text). There were 104 cases (8
percent of 1319 cases for whom information about hospitalisation and
complications were available) who required hospitalisation. A total
of 6 cases were reported with encephalitis or suspicion of
encephalitis (0.5 percent), all among children. No deaths have been reported.

Control measures
----------------
In Switzerland, the cantons are responsible for outbreak control
measures. Various measures were implemented by the cantonal medical
authorities in response to this ongoing outbreak, including targeted
and general information for the public, contact tracing,
recommendation to complete immunisation if necessary (2 MMR doses for
people without proof of immunity born after 1963), and exclusion from
school for non-immune siblings of cases [1]. To our knowledge, no
supplementary immunisation activity has been organised specifically
in response to the outbreak, and it is not known to what extent the
recommendation to carry out catch-up vaccinations has been followed.
The nature and intensity of the measures taken has also varied between cantons.

Discussion
----------
This ongoing nationwide outbreak of measles in Switzerland is
characterised by its long duration (15 months to date), a peak in the
summer, its spatial heterogeneity in incidence, and a high incidence
compared to other European countries. The outbreak has mainly
affected unvaccinated children of school age, but also unvaccinated
young adults. Transmission occurred primarily in families and schools.

The unusual length of this outbreak is probably the result of the
proportion and distribution of susceptible persons in the population,
allowing the infection to spread gradually without necessarily
leading to a rapid exhaustion of the pool of susceptible individuals.
The national measles vaccination coverage of 86 percent for the 1st
dose at the age of 2 and of 70 percent for the 2nd dose (introduced
in 1996) seems to be high enough to prevent an explosive and large
outbreak of shorter duration. However, it is not sufficiently high
for an interruption of sustained MV transmission with only minimal
control measures. Moreover, vaccination coverage stagnated at around
82 percent between 1991 and the beginning of this decade, allowing
for the accumulation of a large number of susceptible individuals.

A detailed analysis of the temporal and geographical distribution of
cases shows that this large national outbreak is broken down into
successive local and regional clusters with partial overlap. Due to
insufficient vaccination coverage combined with a high heterogeneity
between the cantons (from 69 percent to 94 percent) and due to the
time elapsed since the last large outbreak in 2003 that had about 700
reported cases, measles virus can progressively spread to new
regions, in particular among communities of people preferring
alternative medicine and education methods (homoeopathy and
anthroposophy). The circulation of the same genetic variant of MV
since November 2006 indicates a single nationwide outbreak. This
imported D5 MV has its origin in South-East Asia and has been
continuously transmitted within Switzerland over a period of at least
15 months. It can therefore be considered as "newly endemic" at present.

Such a long outbreak or successive outbreaks of short duration are
not unusual in settings where unvaccinated individuals accumulate
over time due to poor uptake of vaccine. In 1999-2000, the
Netherlands experienced an almost year-long measles outbreak with
about 3300 cases, which started among unvaccinated individuals in
areas with low vaccination coverage; however, there was only sporadic
spread to communities with high vaccination coverage [2]. A very
large outbreak raged in Italy in 2002 and again in 2003, after a few
quiet months [3]. Bolker and Grenfell have hypothesised that an
intermediate vaccination coverage could decorrelate the timing of
regional outbreaks in the same country [4], with a consecutive
extension of the total duration of the outbreak. Measles elimination
(interruption of endemic disease transmission) has been achieved in
countries that have a sustained high coverage with 2 doses of measles
vaccine [5,6].

In areas where it remains endemic, measles is considered a seasonal
disease with epidemic peak usually in late winter or early spring.
Its temporal pattern seems to be influenced by school holidays, even
after the introduction of measles vaccination [7]. The dry indoor
humidity could also explain the peak during the cold season in the
northern hemisphere [8]. Surprisingly, the current outbreak began in
mid-autumn, a period that usually has a very low incidence in
Switzerland, and peaked during July to September, although the number
of cases usually sharply decreases after the spring peak. Despite the
summer closure of schools, 56 percent of patients were of school-age
during that period.

Most cases were concentrated in north, east and central Switzerland,
with a relatively low incidence in the western and southern part of
the country, corresponding to the French- and Italian-speaking
region. The incidence was only 3 per 100 000 in this region compared
to 26 per 100 000 in the German-speaking region, with vaccination
coverage of about 92 percent and 85 percent, respectively. However,
the correlation between measles vaccination coverage and the
incidence rate remained moderate at a cantonal level.

Switzerland has endorsed the goal to eliminate indigenous measles and
rubella in the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO
EURO) by 2010 [9,10]. Nevertheless, Switzerland experienced the
highest measles incidence rate of central and western Europe for
2007, with 15 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. According to EUVACNET reports
[<http://www.euvac.net>], during the 1st 3 quarters of 2007
Switzerland notified 29 percent of all measles cases from the 32
European countries that report to EUVAC.net, and as many as 42
percent for the 3rd quarter alone. It thus constitutes a potential
source of imported measles for other countries in Europe and
elsewhere. Importations have already been reported in Germany,
causing an outbreak in Lower Bavaria [11], in Denmark (one sporadic
case), in England (two sporadic cases), and in the United States (3
imported cases in 2007 and one in 2008 that has led to an outbreak in
a community with a high (circa 10 percent) level of exemption from
school vaccination requirements due to personal beliefs [12]. The
Swiss federal office of public health urges unvaccinated Swiss people
born after 1963 to receive 2 doses of an MMR vaccine and invites
foreign visitors to be vaccinated before travelling in Switzerland.
This recommendation is particularly important for people intending to
visit large events such as the European football championship (EURO
2008) in June 2008.
