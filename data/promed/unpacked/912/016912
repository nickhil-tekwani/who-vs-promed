A dog in Charleston County (South Carolina) was confirmed to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans. This is the first confirmed animal detection of SARS-CoV-2 in South Carolina.

A private veterinarian decided to test the dog, an 8- or 9-year-old shepherd mix, after one of its owners was confirmed to have COVID-19, according to Clemson Livestock Poultry Health director and state veterinarian Dr Boyd Parr. Veterinary findings indicated the dog had a chronic health condition, a release from Clemson University states. The US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the virus in the dog on 9 Jul 2020.

"Based on current knowledge, there continues to be no evidence pets play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 to people," Parr said. "It remains a good idea to restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you do with other people, if you are infected with COVID-19 in order to protect them from exposure to the virus as recommended by the CDC."

The dog had to be euthanized due to his chronic condition [which was unrelated to COVID-19 - Mod.TG], Parr said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend routine testing of animals but says the decision to test an animal "should be made in consultation with and approval of both appropriate state animal health and public health officials."

[There is no evidence that companion animals can transmit COVID-19 to humans. Nevertheless, caution is urged. Take care of your pets, as clearly we can transmit this virus to them. If you are confirmed to have the virus, be cautious around your pets. No kissing, no hugging near your face, to help prevent transfer of the virus to your pet.

An excellent article is found in COVID-19 update (231): USA (NY) animal, dog conf. 20200602.7420541.

Excerpt from: OIE, Q&A on the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [abridged, edited] (https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/):
"Currently there is no evidence that (in-contact companion animals) play a significant epidemiological role in this human disease. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus."

Hopefully, additional similar observations will allow considering the epidemiological role of companion animals (dogs AND cats) in human COVID-19 as negligible; at present, it cannot be viewed as such. Additional gathered experience, including PCR and serologic test results of in-contact company animals, is warranted. - Mods.TG/AS
