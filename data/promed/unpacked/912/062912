I presume that the slaughter of animals you refer to in Ngamiland was
because of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, not FMD, but are the buffalo
being driven back because of FMD or CBPP or both?
[Thanks Martyn for bringing this subject up again and requesting
clarification. Maybe someone from Botswana or someone elsewhere in a the
Southern African region could clarify. Our newest AHEAD subscriber is from
Namibia so maybe he or she could help. It would be good to know which
disease(s) is (are) involved and what control measures have been used. -
