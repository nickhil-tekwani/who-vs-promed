Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials confirmed equine infectious anemia [EIA] in a quarter horse on a Kaufman County premises on 20 Jan [2022]. This is the first confirmed case of EIA in Texas this year [2022].

The horse was confirmed positive after testing was performed to meet regulatory requirements. The premises has been quarantined and will not be released until the TAHC's requirements are met. TAHC staff are working closely with the owner and local veterinarian to monitor potentially exposed horses and implement biosecurity measures.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the Equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often in-apparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health. EIA is a reportable animal disease in all states.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer.

"Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include:
- jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes)
- rapid breathing, rapid heart rate
- swelling of limbs
- bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes
- blood-stained feces

"Horses surviving the acute phase of the disease become chronic, in-apparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress - illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical."

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood-feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen.

"There is no treatment for EIA. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized."

"Reducing exposure to biting flies through management practices may reduce the spread of infection. To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes or IV sets; use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for EIA and other blood-borne infections like equine piroplasmosis.

"Surveillance and testing are the best methods of prevention. Since EIA control efforts began over 40 years ago, the reactor rate has fallen from 4% to 0.004% in 2017 among tested animals. USDA recommends testing every equid annually.

"There is no vaccine approved for use in the US."
(https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/eia)

It is unfortunate there is no vaccine in the US. Equine owners have pleaded for a vaccine for decades now and wonder why their cries are ignored. Equine groups have often lamented the lack of technology or funding, but there seems to be no answers from those who research, fund, or develop vaccines.

However, there may now be a form of treatment, or certainly some hope on the horizon. Readers are requested to see Equine infectious anemia: potential treatment 20211209.8700153. - Mod.TG
