2002/072 Surveys on _Ralstonia solanacearum_ and _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in Estonia
In Estonia, systematic surveys on _Ralstonia solanacearum_ [Rs] and
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] (both EPPO A2
quarantine pests) were initiated by the Estonian Plant Protection
Inspectorate in 2000, and continued in 2001 and 2002 (on potato
harvest 2001). All samples were tested at the Plant Health Laboratory
of the Estonian Control Centre of Plant Production by
immunofluorescence (IF). The results of the survey for the [2001]
potato harvest ... [as follows]:
- Seed potato production: [127 samples from 110 ha - no Rs or Cms was found].
- Ware potato production: 720 ha ... (8749 tons) ... were inspected
and sampled. 485 samples from 336 lots at 150 production sites were
tested. Cms ... was found in 54 samples from 23 lots at 18 production
sites. No Rs ... was found.
- Imported potatoes: all consignments of seed potatoes and ware
potatoes were tested and no ... Rs was found. 4 consignments
originating from Ukraine were found infested by Cms ... .
Phytosanitary measures in accordance with EU Directive 93/85/EEC are
being applied in order to prevent any further spread of Cms ... and
to eradicate it.
The situation of Cms ... in Estonia can be described as follows:
Present, found only in ware potatoes at a few production sites, under
eradication.
The situation of Rs ... in Estonia can be described as follows:
Absent, confirmed by survey.

[Rs causes bacterial wilt in potato and other solanaceous crops and
weeds. The pathogen is very well adapted to survival in soil. There
are at least 3 races of Rs: race 1 infects a wide range of
solanaceous plants (e.g. bell pepper, egg plant, potato, and tomato);
race 2 infects banana; and race 3 infects primarily potato and a few
other hosts. The disease is difficult to manage, although there are
resistant cultivars of tomato and egg plant. It is almost impossible
to rid a field infested with Rs. Planting resistant crops such as
cucurbits is a recommended option in such instances. According to
plant pathologists at the International Potato Center (CIP) in Peru,
control of bacterial wilt is very difficult because of its wide host
range, its survival in soil, and its biological variation. Management
of the disease depends on an integrated combination of control
measures. These include use of pathogen-free and/or -suppressive
soils, disease-free seed, short crop rotations, roguing of volunteer
plants, and resistance or tolerance. Chemical control is not possible
at present.
The Cms bacterium causes potato ring rot, one of the most serious
diseases of potato, which is spread by infected tubers and machinery.
Infected solanaceous weeds can be significant sources of inoculum. -
