China is making a count of the number of pigs dead from blue ear
disease and will publish the figure soon, a senior official with the
country's Ministry of Agriculture said today [30 May 2007].
"It's true that China has blue ear disease, but it's not true, as
some foreign media have reported, that the disease has killed 20
million pigs," Li Jinxiang, vice director general with Veterinary
Bureau of the ministry, told China Business News yesterday [29 May
2007]. "These reports are groundless," Li said. [On 29 May 2007,] the
Financial Times linked China's recent pork price hike with the
outbreak of blue ear disease, also known as porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome [PRRS]. It also said that many pigs had died
from foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], which was another cause of the
price hike. "However, the report provided no evidence except some
guess-work figures from a so-called 'insider'," Li told the newspaper.
The disease may lead to dead fetuses or abortion, and piglets have
almost no resistance to the disease. The mortality for infected
piglets is 50 percent.
[In 2006,] an outbreak of blue ear disease was one of the causes of a
short supply of live pigs, a statement by the State Council said [on
20 May 2007.]
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, in April [2007], live pigs
nationwide were priced 71.3 percent higher than a year earlier
[2006], and pork, 35.5 percent higher, largely due to tightened supply.
[On Mon 28 May 2007,] Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, asked local
governments at all levels to ensure the supply of pork and maintain
market order amid rising concerns over the soaring price of pork.
The disease is under control, Li said. Pork prices in northern
China's Liaoning and Jilin provinces have seen some drops.

Yesterday [29 May 2007], an official from the Ministry of Agriculture
denied foreign media reports that pig blue ear disease and other
illnesses have caused the deaths of 20 million pigs. In a report
yesterday [29 May 2007,] on the price of pork in China, England's
Financial Times said that although the price of corn and other feed
has risen, the main culprits are the spread of blue ear disease and
the more common foot-and-mouth disease. The article also quoted "an
industry executive" who said, "I have heard it has killed as many as
20 million hogs."
Jinxiang Li, Vice Chief of the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary
Bureau, told China Business News that although there is in fact pig
blue ear disease, [with regard to] the report's statement that the
disease has killed as many as 20 million pigs, "This is impossible."
Jinxiang Li said [the Ministry of Agriculture] is already looking
into it and the mortality rate from pig blue ear disease is not this
high. At present, the Ministry of Agriculture is putting the data in
order and will release it at the appropriate time.
Blue ear disease is an infectious disease characterized by a
reproductive disorder, premature delivery, miscarriage, and
stillbirth in hogs, as well as abnormal breathing in piglets.
Morbidity can reach 100 percent among piglets with mortality of about
50 percent. Miscarriage and stillbirth in sows can be above 30
percent. The threat to the pig industry is high.
In the summer and fall of 2006, pig a "high fever disease" occurred
in some parts of China. Later, it was confirmed that the disease [was
the highly pathogenic pig blue ear disease.] It has had a certain
level of disturbance on pig stocks.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture's "National Agricultural
Products Wholesale Market Information Net" survey, national wholesale
pork prices averaged 12.99 RMB/kg [USD 1.69882], up 35.5 percent from
the same period. [RMB (renminbi), literally "people's currency", is
the official currency in the mainland of the People's Republic of
China (PRC), whose principal unit is the yuan. - Mod.AS]
Yesterday [29 May 2007], the General Office of the State Council
issued a notice to ensure pork supply. The notice stated that the
rise in pork prices is mainly due to the effect of last year's [2006]
epidemic. Stocks of sows and pigs fell at the end of the year,
leading to a reduction in supply. The notice requested all areas to
strengthen disease prevention and control and encourage development
of standardized farming to ease market effects due to fluctuations in
pork production.
Information from the Ministry of Agriculture states that the number
of sick pigs is now substantially reduced and the epidemic is cooling
down. Recently, agricultural departments launched supervision and
inspection work to prevent and control the highly pathogenic pig blue
ear disease.
[On 29 May 2006], Xinhua reported that pork prices in Liaoning and
Jilin Provinces are stable and trending down.

Since Spring Festival this year [2007], high fever disease-type blue
ear disease of unknown origin has occurred in some parts of China,
with [numerous cases of] miscarriage among sows and high mortality
among piglets. Nationally, stocks of meat pigs declined 20-25 percent
and, as a result, pork prices are steadily rising.

[The flood of newswires, originating from various (official,
semi-official, unofficial, central, provincial, and foreign) sources,
with contradictory pieces of information on the so-called swine high
fever disease (SHFD), could be put on hold -- for the benefit of all,
but particularly of the Chinese economy and China's reputation --
if/when detailed, 1st hand, authoritative results of laboratory
investigations from all affected provinces become available.
Preferably, the testing should cover the entire spectrum of disease
agents that have been mentioned as potential contributors to SHFD.
The diseases mentioned in China's OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health) notification of September 2006, (ProMED-mail posting
20060924.2732), were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS), classical swine fever (CSF), porcine circovirus (PCV-2),
Aujeszky's disease, _Streptococcus suis_, pasteurellosis, and porcine
contagious pleuropneumonia (PCP). The additional potential disease
agents, indicated by external experts, were avian influenza (AI),
African swine fever (ASF), and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), of which
the serotypes Asia 1 and O are known to circulate in China and some
of its neighbours).
Notably, PRRS has reportedly been causing, recently, considerable
losses in Northern Viet Nam as well. - Mod.AS]
