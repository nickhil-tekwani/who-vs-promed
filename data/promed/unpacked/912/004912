[1] England, racing resumed

Dr Richard Newton of the Animal Health Trust (AHT) has spoken amid rising instances of a virulent strain among the general horse population. The BBC has learned that 8 times as many flu cases have been reported among UK horses in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019 as in the whole of last year [2018]. Racing resumed on Wednesday [13 Feb 2019] after a 6-day shutdown.

"What we worry about is that the racing network is highly connected," said Newton, AHT head of epidemiology and disease surveillance, a world-renowned expert on equine diseases.

The AHT is a charity that has worked around the clock to analyse all the samples at its laboratories in Newmarket.

A total of 16 locations in England and Scotland suffered an outbreak of equine flu between 1 Jan and 12 Feb 2019. It has been spreading across northern Europe, with the Republic of Ireland, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands all affected.

Newton said the virus was "the quickest-spreading" he has seen.

Flu has been found in only 2 racing yards despite more than 3000 samples being analysed, Newton told BBC Sport. He said there was concern that the highly contagious disease might hit the breeding season, which started on Thursday [14 Feb 2019].

At the height of fears over the virus spreading, 174 racing stables -- more than a quarter of the total in Britain -- were placed in lockdown.

Flu is endemic among horses in the UK, but the shutdown was "necessary" because of escalating fears over the Florida clade 1 strain of the virus, which originated in North America, and the potential impact on the Cheltenham Festival, which runs from 12-15 Mar 2019.

Newton said, "We know we are not out of the woods yet, but we have a much better handle on the extent of the problem. Horse flu doesn't tend to kill horses, but it kills horse events."

The crisis was sparked after 3 horses tested positive at the Cheshire stables of Grand National-winning trainer Donald McCain. Three further positives followed, but the shutdown and tighter biosecurity measures may mean there is long-term gain for racing from the short-term pain.

"A great deal of the emphasis now is on trainers to help themselves and be prepared to do their own shutdowns," Newton said. "We are talking about athletes here building up to the prime of their career. Flu getting into a yard will set those animals back."

There were 3 positive tests among British non-thoroughbreds on Tuesday [12 Feb 2019] alone, compared with 2 in the whole of 2018.

Some trainers have criticised the shutdown -- Nigel Twiston-Davies called it a "massive overreaction" -- as well as the new rules that require all horses competing in races to have been vaccinated within the past 6 months, rather than a year.

"We did feel it was probably only a matter of time before it was detected in vaccinated horses and thoroughbreds," said Newton. "It might have been that Donald McCain was not the only trainer inadvertently sending flu-infected horses to races. We have been trying to make the right decisions to minimise any long-term impact."

"What we know from our experiences around the world is that if you don't act quickly, it can get away from you. Stopping all racing in the UK is not a decision you take lightly, but this is a highly infectious virus, and it was breaking through the vaccine."

[2] Scotland, a single case

A stable has gone into lockdown after the 1st case of equine flu in Scotland was identified among one of its animals.

Giorgia Burns Eventing yard in Lanarkshire implemented a quarantine after a horse arrived at the yard showing signs of the disease. Vets later confirmed the unvaccinated animal had contracted the virus, prompting the stable's owner, Giorgia Burns, to isolate the horse and begin disinfecting the yard. No other horses at the yard have shown signs of the disease.

The confirmed case comes on the day British horseracing re-opens after a 6-day shutdown following the outbreak. Two infected horses in England have had to be put down, and the British Horse Authority has introduced stringent new vaccination requirements to halt the spread of the disease.

Ms Burns said that the horse had arrived at her yard with a runny nose last Wednesday [6 Feb 2019], one of the classic symptoms of the disease.

She said: "We called the vet in straight away, but I was optimistic that it wasn't equine flu. We went into lockdown as a precaution anyway, with no horses coming in or out.

"It's now been confirmed that it is the flu, so we've had the vets back to re-vaccinate the rest of our horses and have been carrying out a deep clean of the stables as we are supposed to do. We expect to be given the all-clear next week [week of Mon 18 Feb 2019], so it will only be a 2-week shutdown. I'm just grateful this happened at this time of the year and not at the peak of the season."

She broke the news on Facebook, saying, "We have followed a strict disinfectant and quarantine regime, and any yards I went to I either went 1st thing in the morning or last thing at night after a shower and change of clothes and shoes. I have decided after today's [Thu 14 Feb 2019] results I will now take further precautions and not leave my own yard until it's all resolved. Anyone who knows me will know how devastated I am and the huge financial and emotional strain this has put on me."

The infected horse originally came from the Turlood Stables in Lesmahagow, owned by Billy and Katy Stewart. However, Mrs Stewart said the horse had been checked by a vet before leaving and had been clear of the virus, but she was uncertain when it had left her yard. "There is no flu on our yard," she said.

[Equine influenza [EI], an OIE-listed disease, is not notifiable in the UK. In the country's last available annual disease situation report to the OIE (2017), the disease was included among the diseases "present in the country," under the status "infection/infestation." In previous detailed annual reports, the disease was reported as present, without epidemiological statistics presented.

The identification of EI virus strain H3N8 Florida clade 1, apparently new to the UK, as the causative agent of the current event may deserve being discussed as warranting notification to the OIE according to chapter 1.1 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Article 1.1.3.1.c ("1st occurrence of a new strain of a pathogenic agent of a listed disease, infection, or infestation in a country, a zone, or a compartment") or Article 1.1.3.1.d ("a sudden and unexpected change in the distribution or increase in incidence or virulence of, or morbidity or mortality caused by, the pathogenic agent of a listed disease, infection, or infestation present within a country, a zone, or a compartment"). - Mod.AS
