As of Thu 11 Jan 2018, there have been a total of:
1769 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
717 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 per cent],
1031 recoveries, and
21 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases which occurred during this period. As of the time of preparation of this report, information on today's [Fri 12 Jan 2018] update is still pending. - Mod.MPP]

[It appears as though detection of MERS-CoV infections has increased since the beginning of 2018, with 13 newly confirmed cases reported in the 1st 11 days of the month of January. In fact, this increase in reporting of newly confirmed cases seems to have begun during the last 10 days of December 2017 when there were 6 newly confirmed cases reported after a 2-week hiatus during which time no newly confirmed cases were reported. These newly confirmed cases reported during the end of December 2017 included 2 cases from Makkah region, 2 from Riyadh region and one each from Al Qaṣīm and `Asīr regions. The 13 newly confirmed cases reported since 1 Jan 2018 include 6 from Riyadh region, 2 from `Asīr region and one each from Al Qaṣīm, Ash Sharqīyah - Eastern, Al Jawf, Najran, and Tabūk regions. One case was reported in a healthcare worker from Riyadh, the remainder of the cases were classified as primary cases with 4 of the 12 remaining primary cases having a history of direct contact with camels.

So a key question that comes to mind is what is responsible for the recent increase in reported cases?

[2] Research: Experimental treatment, phase 1 trials

MERS antibodies produced in cattle safe, treatment well tolerated in Phase 1 trial
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An experimental treatment developed from cattle plasma for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection shows broad potential, according to a small clinical trial led by National Institutes of Health scientists and their colleagues. The treatment, SAB-301, was safe and well tolerated by healthy volunteers, with only minor reactions documented.

The 1st confirmed case of MERS was reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Since then, the MERS coronavirus has spread to 27 countries and sickened more than 2000 people, of whom about 35 percent have died, according to the World Health Organization. There are no licensed treatments for MERS.

SAB-301 was developed by SAB Biotherapeutics of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and has been successfully tested in mice. The treatment comes from so-called "transchromosomic cattle." These cattle have genes that have been slightly altered to enable them to produce fully human antibodies instead of cow antibodies against killed microbes with which they have been vaccinated -- in this case the MERS virus. The clinical trial, conducted by NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, took place at the NIH Clinical Center.

In the study, 28 healthy volunteers were treated with SAB-301 and 10 received a placebo. Six groups of volunteers given different intravenous doses were assessed 6 times over 90 days. Complaints among the treatment and placebo groups - such as headache and common cold symptoms - were similar and generally mild.

The researchers believe they may be able to use transchromosomic cattle to rapidly produce human antibodies against other human pathogens as well, in as few as 3 months. This means they could conceivably develop antibody treatments against a variety of infectious diseases in a much faster timeframe and in much greater volume than currently possible.

This research was supported by HHS contract awards HHSN261200800001E, HHSN272201100022I, and HSO100201600020C.

[At ProMED we are hesitant to report on phase I trials as we are aware of how many promising treatments and vaccines after phase I trials do not go on through subsequent phases successfully. While the below summary looks promising, it is important to note that this phase 1 clinical trial involved a total of 28 subjects, a sample size that would not detect serious adverse events occurring at an unacceptable rate such as 1 per 10 000 or 20 000 individuals.

The publication referred to is: J Beigel, et al. Safety and tolerability of a novel, polyclonal human anti-MERS coronavirus antibody: a phase 1 randomised, double-blind, single-dose-escalation study. The Lancet Infectious Diseases. DOI: 10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30002-1 (2018).

Summary
"Background
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe respiratory illness with an overall mortality of 35 percent. There is no licensed or proven treatment. Passive immunotherapy approaches are being developed to prevent and treat several human medical conditions where alternative therapeutic options are absent. We report the safety of a fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) produced from the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with a MERS coronavirus vaccine.

Methods
"We did a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We recruited healthy participants aged 18-60 years who had normal laboratory parameters at enrolment, a body-mass index of 19-32 kg/m2, and a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min or more, and who did not have any chronic medical problems that required daily oral medications, a positive rheumatoid factor (â¥15 IU/mL), IgA deficiency (<7 mg/dL), or history of allergy to intravenous immunoglobulin or human blood products. Participants were randomly assigned by a computer-generated table, made by a masked pharmacist, to one of 6 cohorts (containing between 3 and 10 participants each). Cohorts 1 and 2 had 3 participants, randomly assigned 2:1 to receive active drug SAB-301 versus normal saline placebo; cohorts 3 and 4 had 6 participants randomised 2:1; and cohorts 5 and 6 had 10 participants, randomised 4:1. Participants received 1 mg/kg, 2Â•5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg of SAB-301, or equivalent volume placebo (saline control), on day 0, and were followed up by clinical, laboratory, and pharmacokinetic assessments on days 1, 3, 7, 21, 42, and 90. The primary outcome was safety, and immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. We analysed the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788188.

Findings
"Between June 2, 2016, and Jan 4, 2017, we screened 43 participants, of whom 38 were eligible and randomly assigned to receive SAB-301 (n=28) or placebo (n=10). 97 adverse events were reported: 64 adverse events occurred in 23 (82 percent) of 28 participants receiving SAB-301 (mean 2Â•3 adverse events per participant). 33 adverse events occurred in all 10 participants receiving placebo (mean 3Â•3 adverse events per participant). The most common adverse events were headache (n=6 [21 percent] in participants who received SAB-301 and n=2 [20 percent] in those receiving placebo), albuminuria (n=5 [18 percent] vs n=2 [20 percent]), myalgia (n=3 [11 percent] vs n=1 [10 percent]), increased creatine kinase (n=3 [11 percent] vs 1 [10 percent]), and common cold (n=3 [11 percent] vs n=2 [20 percent]). There was one serious adverse event (hospital admission for suicide attempt) in one participant who received 50 mg/kg of SAB-301. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in the 50 mg/kg dose (27â498 Î¼gâÃ--âdays per mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with efficacy in a preclinical model.

Interpretation
"Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants. Human immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle could offer a new platform technology to produce fully human polyclonal IgG antibodies for other medical conditions."

Important to read is the accompanying commentary below, highlighting the preliminary nature of these findings. (references available at the source URL.)

"Recent headlines, including outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in urban west Africa, the intercontinental transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) from the Arabian Peninsula to South Korea, and the emergence of Zika virus as a fetal neurotoxic agent, highlight the global threat posed by emerging infectious diseases in an increasingly connected world.

"In use since the late 1800s, convalescent blood products are some of the oldest instruments in the expanding toolbox of immune therapies for infectious disease. Passive transfer of convalescent human sera has been investigated for protection against coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome), arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin), filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg), and pandemic influenza viruses (H5N1, H1N1). [1] However, positive findings have not been substantiated by controlled trials. Few immunoglobulins are licensed for infectious disease and passive transfer is not without some attendant risks (appendix [available at original publication]). Heterologous equine and ovine immune globulins can induce hypersensitivity; Fab and F(ab')2, which have shorter in-vivo half-lives, lessen hypersensitivity, suggesting this hypersensitivity is largely mediated by foreign FC. Although human IgG is desirable, the risk of transmitting unidentified pathogens and costly donor screening protocols are barriers to use of fractionated human immune plasma products. For example, clinical studies of anti-MERS intravenous immunoglobulin reported difficulty identifying human plasma donors because of low neutralising titres in convalescent patients and the generally short-lived nature of neutralising antibody responses after coronavirus infection.[2]

"In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, John Beigel and colleagues report results from a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of the safety and tolerability of SAB-301, a fully human polyclonal IgG developed from plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with MERS spike protein nanoparticles. [3] The transchromosomic cattle used to produce SAB-301 were developed over the course of a decade in a remarkable feat of genetic engineering (figure). In research studies, multiple vaccine platforms have generated antigen-specific human IgG in transchromosomic cattle. Hyperimmunisation of transchromosomic cattle with anthrax protective antigen yields human neutralising antibodies that protect mice against anthrax challenge.[4] Additionally, DNA vaccination yields human neutralising antibodies with demonstrated efficacy after passive transfer to rodent models of Ebola virus and hantavirus infection. [5] ; [6] Immunisation with recombinant nanoparticles used in the production of SAB-301 or with gamma-irradiated whole-killed virions induced anti-MERS neutralising human IgG in transchromosomic cattle, which reportedly reduce lung viral load in a non-lethal murine MERS challenge.[7]

"In their study, Beigel and colleagues show that human participants who received infusion of SAB-301 developed anti-MERS neutralising antibody titres that correlated with serum SAB-301 concentrations. These titres were achieved without clinically significant hypersensitivity or adverse events at infusion rates below current intravenous immunoglobulin guidelines. The SAB-301 terminal elimination half-life appears to be within range of a typical human antibody. SAB-301 is enriched in human IgG1Îº, which could exhibit important in-vivo effector-mediated functions in addition to demonstrated in-vitro neutralising capability.[8] The effect of bovine processes on SAB-301 human IgG development is unclear. Comparative immunology of human beings and cattle point to several key innate immune factors--namely, anatomical (eg, a primary lymphoid organ in the bovine intestine referred to as an ileal Peyer's patch[9]), cellular (eg, abundant bovine circulatory Î³Î´ T cells with unique capabilities[10]), and molecular (eg, bovine pattern recognition receptor function[11]) factors, which could lead to distinct adaptive immunity. Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation,4 could lead to dissimilar effector functions between transchromosomic IgG and human IgG, and will require additional work to be understood. Transchromosomic cattle reportedly make 150-600 g of human IgG per animal per month,[7] thus more than 6500 cows would be needed to produce an immediate 50 mg/kg dose of unfractionated human IgG for one million adults. Potent, functional, antigen-specific antibody generation through optimised vaccination protocols will be crucial for environmental and economic feasibility of this platform. The therapeutic and protective efficacy of SAB-301 in human infection or lethal animal challenge has not been reported, underscoring that this is an early technology requiring further clinical investigation.

"Vitality in the field of antibodies deployed against infectious diseases is supported by the concomitant rise in systems for rapid delivery of rigorously selected and highly potent monoclonal antibodies as proteins, DNA, or RNA, as well as vectored delivery. Additional technologies addressing the need for sustainable, potent antibody therapies include engineered bispecific antibodies and half-life extension modifications. The study of transchromosomic cattle with the ability to produce polyclonal antibody responses against emergent pathogens advances a platform worthy of further consideration, possibly in outbreak situations as well as for protection of at-risk populations." - Mod.MPP]
