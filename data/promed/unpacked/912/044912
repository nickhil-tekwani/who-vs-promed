Testing turns up mop-top virus in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley
----------------------------------------
Testing for Potato mop-top potato virus [PMTV] has turned up a positive
result in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley.
Freeman Libby of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says the latest
discovery has prompted a joint potato management plan between Canada and the
United States. Libby won't say where the farm is located, but will only
confirm the finding, made after tests carried out in October 2002.He says
new seed certification measures should help farmers manage the risks
associated with several pests found on both sides of the border, including
mop-top.
Potatoes infected with mop-top can still be safely consumed, but the virus
can decrease crop yields and affect the use of infested fields for over a
decade.

[This is the second report of PMTV in Canada. The fact that it has now been
recorded in a second province suggests possible spread to other locations.
Mop-top has been recorded in Asia, Europe, and in North and South America.
The disease is difficult to control, primarily because the resting spores of
the fungal vector (_Spongospora subterranea_) can harbor the virus for many
years. Once established in a field, PMTV can persist for up to 18 years in
the absence of potatoes. There are no PMTV-resistant or tolerant cultivars
available. Disease management involves exclusion and strict sanitation.
