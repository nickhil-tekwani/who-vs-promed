[The previous outbreak reported is the caprine outbreak in Giorgiu listed below; see 13 Sep 2017 Anthrax - Romania (05): (GR) caprine, human, OIE 20170913.5314003, not porcine, and not Botosani. The June 2017, outbreak in Botosani involved cattle.

This affected pig was in a "holding", not grazing. And it is summer, while contaminated swine feed is more commonly a winter problem. Pigs are mildly resistant to anthrax so I suspect that an animal died on this farm, was butchered, and the viscera was fed to the pigs, and because of their resistance, only one pig was affected. - Mod MHJ
