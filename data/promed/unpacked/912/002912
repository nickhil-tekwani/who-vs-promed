Belize citrus industry threatened by disease
--------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture in Belize is taking steps to eradicate
the citrus greening disease, which has been detected in northern,
eastern, and southern Belize. Citrus has been the major income earner
in the country and every effort is being made to eradicate the disease.

Director of research of the Citrus Growers' Association (CGA) Stephen
Williams said that, if the spread of the disease is not controlled,
it can be devastating to the citrus industry. He said that within the
next 2 weeks, experts from Florida will visit Belize to develop a
strategy to fight the problem.

The CGA is currently holding surveys and workshops, mainly in the
southern districts, to sensitise citrus growers as to what to look
for and how to respond if they detect the disease.

Williams said that because it was detected in three regions, "We
decided that we should do some surveys for the disease in Belize. And
it is only recently that we have actually discovered that the disease
is present in the country."

[Huanglongbing (HLB) [also called citrus greening, yellow dragon
disease], is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. In
Asia and most of the Americas, it is caused by the fastidious
phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus.
However, the species may comprise several different variants, even
within a given region.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small,
irregularly shaped, pale fruits with bad taste. Affected trees become
stunted and may die prematurely. _Ca._ L. asiaticus is transmitted by
the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often
spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. The vector is
specific to _Citrus_ and close relatives, and thus the disease is
confined to these crops. Disease management requires an integrated
approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock,
elimination of inoculum, and vector control in orchards and non-crop
reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is showing
some promise (see ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

Two other species, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis)
and _Ca._ L. americanus, and their specific vectors exist in the
respective areas. Citrus greening has not been reported from the
Mediterranean region or Australia. While _Ca._ L. americanus is
closely related to _Ca._ L. asiaticus, it has been reported mainly
from Brazil and is unlikely to be the cause in Belize.
