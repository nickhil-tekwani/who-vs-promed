Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore
------------------------
Singapore has a laboratory-confirmed case of SARS coronavirus (CoV)
infection. This single case is in a 27-year-old postgraduate medical
student who worked in a virology laboratory in Singapore. The patient
developed fever, was hospitalized and isolated, and his fever has now
resolved. Contact tracing is continuing, but it has not identified any
secondary cases arising from this infection.
It is well recognized that most viruses can cause a range of illness from
mild to severe. The goal of WHO's SARS guidance in the post-outbreak period
is to rapidly identify threats to global public health. Consequently, WHO's
case definitions are designed to provide early warning and give health
officials direction for responding to a new outbreak of SARS. The Singapore
case is mild, isolated, and has not produced secondary cases, and therefore
is not regarded as a public health concern.
WHO continues to applaud Singapore's public health officials for the
openness with which they have responded to this event and the rapid
precautions taken to contain a possible threat.
Since there is a suggestion that this case may have resulted from a
laboratory accident, WHO will be addressing the issue of laboratory safety
at its meeting of SARS scientific advisors in October 2003 in Geneva.
To conclude, in relation to SARS, Singapore continues to be a safe
destination for travellers, and travellers from Singapore pose no risk to
other countries.
This event is not an international public health concern.

[The occurrence of this single case in Singapore not only raises a number
of questions, but it also may be an anecdotal case report providing answers
to some other questions.
If this is a case of a laboratory accident, the questions raised deal with
safety issues for those laboratories dealing with the SARS-associated
coronavirus (Co-V). According to the information available, the case in
question visited a laboratory that had handled the SARS Co-V 3 days prior
to his visit. How did this infection occur? What was the laboratory
contamination method that allowed for transmission of the virus
approximately 3 days after the virus was worked with?
Again, according to the information available, the date of onset of the
febrile disease was 26 Aug 2003, the date of admission to the first
hospital 3 Sep 2003, and the tentative date of identification of the SARS
Co-V as the etiologic agent approximately 8 Sep 2003. The case description
mentioned the onset of a dry cough after the day of admission to hospital
(approximately 3 Sep 2003). There are currently 25 individuals who had
contact with this patient prior to implementation of SARS recommended
isolation measures, with dates of exposure presumed to be ranging from 26
Aug 2003 through approximately 8 Sep 2003. The high index of suspicion of
the Singapore health sector, combined with the rapid implementation of
control measures, including case isolation, contact tracing, and home
quarantine, may well have averted further transmission of the SARS Co-V in
Singapore.
That being said, if there are no further cases associated with this
incident, one wonders whether mild infection with the absence of
significant pulmonary involvement produces a "dead-end" infection that is
not transmitted to others, as the viral load excreted by these infected
individuals may be too low for continued transmission. Similarly, in the
absence of a significant aerosolization of the virus, either as droplets,
fomites, or fine aerosol "mist" (as seen with the use of nebulizers), a
laboratory accident transmission may not produce a high enough viral load
to result in serious disease in immuno-competent individuals.
We await further information on the investigation of this case, on
international laboratory validation of the laboratory diagnostics
performed, and on the outcome of the identified contacts, both those with
person-to-person contact with this case prior to diagnosis, as well as
other laboratory personnel potentially exposed to the SARS Co-V in the same
time frame. The end of the observation period will be 28 Sep 2003 (20
days, or 2 incubation periods after exposure to the virus). - Mod.MPP]
