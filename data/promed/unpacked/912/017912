Message from down in the trenches of American Medicine:
I know health conditions are bad in the 3rd world, but 2 MORE weeks to
get an etiologic diagnosis?
If I'm right, the first public news of an epidemic disease in
Afghanistsan was in ITAR-TASS on 15 Feb 99. That's 19 days ago!
Now another 14 brings the total to 33 days from the first public
recognition of the problem to the identification of its etiology!
And "No doctors, no medicines?" But even if 10 000 Albert
Schweitzers lived in Afghanistan, what would be their chances of
curing the sick or stopping the epidemic if they didn't know the
cause?
Clearly, all of us "experts" around the globe must learn a little more
about "Meatball Medicine." For example, can we co-operate in some
sort of a scheme to deploy at least one expert to the site of the
epidemic on the second day after it is reported. Then, can he quickly
survey the situation and take a representative number of cultures and
serologic specimens, dispatching them to the appropriate labs by air
on the 3rd day? Can ALL the countries in the world provide a
helicopter for that purpose, to get the specimens to the nearest
international airport?
Can the recipient labs really bear down on FAST turnaround time for
their efforts, realizing that every day's delay means that some more
people have died. Some academic purists will object to that, but in
that situation, speedy results FAR outweigh a learned report 6 months
or 2 years later. The dead won't care much HOW learned the report is.
Even some rapid "screening tests" may be very useful clinically. For
example a 5 minute Gram stain on a spinal fluid may be sufficient to
give a strong indication of Neisserial meningitis. The academically
correct additional procedures can come AFTER the patient has been
started on antibiotics. If the diagnosis should prove wrong, then the
patient is no worse off than he would have been with NO diagnosis and
NO treatment. On the other hand, the stain COULD mean the difference
between Life and Death.
In recent years, industry has flooded the market with a spate of rapid
"screening tests" for this and that, some of them fairly good and some
not so good. Surely some of us "experts" can decide which is which,
and which might be useful under epidemic conditions. For example,
our emergency room physicians have recently heard of a rapid test for
Influenza A, results available in under an hour. They asked me
whether it was really useful or maybe dangerous, and I didn't know the
answer.
Globally, we have the experts and we have the expertise. We also
have quite a few international health organizations in quite a few
different countries with quite a few different political and financial
problems, and we have WHO at the planetary level.
Is there any way of harnessing ALL this potential and organizing it
into just ONE task force capable of INSTANTLY deploying the necessary
expertise to ANY beleaguered country?

[We sympathise with Paul´s heartfelt cry, but as usual politics & wars get
in the way of the ideal reaction. The international team got visas &
transportation to the affected area as fast as bureaucracy allowed, and
similarly got the specimens out as fast as they could. As Paul knows, once
the specimens hit the lab, even working round the clock may not give a final
diagnosis in less than 2 weeks. WHO said on 2 Mar 1999
"It will take at least two weeks to make a precise diagnosis," so we should
be hearing the result any day now.
We have to strive for the ideal world but, unfortunately, we´re not there
