[1] Cholera - Mozambique (Nampula)

There have now been 18 confirmed cases of cholera in the northern
Mozambican province of Nampula since the outbreak of the disease on
Saturday [22 Mar 2008]. Of these cases, 7 were admitted to the
cholera treatment ward on Monday [24 Mar 2008], reports Tuesday's
issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias".

The outbreak in Nampula city began in just 2 residential
neighborhoods, Namicopo and Muatala, but has now spread to at least 3
others (Napipine, Mutuanha, and Muhala-Expansao). One case was
reported from an overcrowded Nampula prison. The head of the
community health services in the Provincial Health Directorate,
Antonio Salimo, expressed serious concern that the epidemic could
spread very easily among the inmates of the jail, given its
unhygienic conditions.

Salimo added that Memba district has been reporting cases of diarrhea
among adults, and it is feared that these are cholera cases. Samples
were sent for analysis in the provincial laboratory. Health
authorities have dispatched more health staff to that coastal
district, and brigades have also been reactivated for awareness
campaigns about hygiene habits and water treatment.

[2] Cholera - Namibia (Ohangwena)
Date: Tue 25 Mar 2008

<http://allafrica.com/stories/200803250365.html>


The number of confirmed cholera cases in the Ohangwena Region had
risen from 8 to 13 by yesterday morning [24 Mar 2008]. Oshana
Regional Health Director, Dr Naftali Hamata, told New Era yesterday
that suspected cholera cases continue to rise. By yesterday [24 Mar
2008], there were 533 suspected cases, 13 confirmed, 14 cases were
being treated in hospital and healthcare tents while deaths remained at 3.

More suspected cholera cases are being reported in flooded areas in
the north, with health officials blaming the rise on contaminated
water. The last 2 weeks saw a shortage in water purification tablets
supplies at most health centers. Health officials are expected to
distribute water purification tablets and sachets to learners at
different schools in the region.

Hydrologist Guido van Langenhove said the satellite images showed
that heavy rains were received in both Angola and Namibia during the
weekend. The report says although the rains were received over
shorter periods than before, the water levels at the 2 recording
sites between Omafu and Okalongo have shown a slight increase again.

were still undergoing treatment at 5 centers in the capital city, the
only area still experiencing the waterborne disease.

Dr Banda said Lusaka had recorded 253 cases since January 2008 out of
which 31 people were still admitted. The 31 were admitted in Matero,
Chipata, Kanyama, Chawama, and George townships. Since January 2008,
only one patient has died at Matero Center while the rest, apart from
the 31, had been successfully treated and discharged.

Officials of the Ministry of Health, led by minister Nguyen Quoc
Trieu, went to Hai Phong on Sun 23 Mar 2008 to evaluate the
situation. They visited An Duong Market, Hai Phong Water Plant, and
Viet Nam-Czech Hospital. Health minister Nguyen Quoc Trieu said the
ministry will assist Hai Phong in terms of human resources,
medicines, and chemicals to combat the cholera epidemic.

While the number of cholera patients in Hai Phong increased, Hanoi
and Ha Tay did not record any new patients last week.

According Dr Le Anh Tuan, director of the Hanoi Department of Health,

Panic has struck Gajapati district as 7 persons died due to an
unknown disease. It has been learned that persons suffering from the
disease complain of fever accompanied with dysentery and the patient
dies immediately. The locals have been panic-stricken by the effect
of the disease.

The disease came to light when 4 persons in Jhiliki village, a few
kilometers away from Adhaba under Mohana block, died mysteriously. A
50-year-old woman and an infant in Jhiliki village fell prey to the
disease on 18 Mar 2008 and on 20 Mar 2008, 2 others died in the same
village. Similarly, 3 persons of a near about tribal hamlet also died.

However, chief district medical officer (CDMO) Nageswar Patra denied
any such new disease and confirmed that the 4 deaths in Jhiliki
village were natural deaths. He said a team of doctors visited the
village and provided health cares, including medicines.

[The rapidity of progression to death in a diarrheal illness suggests
cholera. In December 2007, ProMED-mail reported (Cholera, diarrhea &
dysentery update 2007 (64) 20071213.4015) variants of _V. cholerae_
O1 biotype El Tor in this area that have some characteristics of the
classical biotype. Described by Nair et al (1) from the International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Research in Bangladesh, the strains were
obtained from patients with cholera from the Matlab Hospital and they
are often referred to as the Matlab variants.

Formally, the 2 established biotypes can be distinguished from one
another by a number of properties including hemolysis of sheep red
blood cells, agglutination of chicken red blood cells, the
Voges-Proskauer reaction, as well as susceptibility to polymyxin B
and to biotype-specific viral bacteriophages. Nair, et al, described
3 Matlab types based on the hybrids of these phenotypic traits. A
hybrid strain has also been found in Mozambique (2), which had
genetic relatedness to the Matlab strains (3).

Importantly, the Matlab variants have been shown to have all the
necessary genes to initiate a pandemic (3).
