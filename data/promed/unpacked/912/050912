PLAGUE, PRAIRIE DOGS - USA (MT) (02): SUSPECTED

We have sought confirmation from the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and
Parks (Keith Aune), the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
(Bill Layton), and the Acting State Veterinarian (Tom Linfield). None
were aware of any confirmed plague in Prairie Dogs in Montana in 2003.
This is not to say that such a die-off has not occurred at Broadus,
but no samples were referred to any state laboratory for confirmation
of cause of death.
