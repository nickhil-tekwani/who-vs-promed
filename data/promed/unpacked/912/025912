[Naryn is the largest oblast (region) of Kyrgyzstan and in the center of the country. At-Bashy district lies along the southern border of the country. It is not densely populated. The oblast is currently considered to be the poorest region in the country, but also the most typically Kyrgyz. It boasts beautiful mountains, alpine pastures, and Son-Kul Lake, which, during summer months, attracts large herds of sheep and horses with their herders and their yurts (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naryn_Region).

Kara-Tal is a mountainous area; it must be very demanding to live and to run livestock there (see https://tinyurl.com/yxbvoxv7).

From all accounts so far, this was a singular case of anthrax and properly dealt with by the owner and the veterinary service. - Mod.MHJ
