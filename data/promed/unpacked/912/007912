Dengue in Pune is not a new thing, there have been cases of dengue since
1975-76. I have been personally involved now in the organisation of a few
doctors to report their cases to KEM Hospital where I am working.
This year we have seen haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome in a few
cases, which has not been seen earlier.
At our hospital we have done serodiagnosis only, by the Pan-bios kit. The
NIV [National Institute of Virology, India has not yet reported any
isolation. However, my student has reported to me visualization of dengue
virus in the tissue culture fluid of C6/36 cells by a cross-reacting
antibody. This work was done by him at the NIV.
