FATALITIES, OSTRICHES - USA (FLORIDA)

A quarantine has been imposed on Headbury Ostrich Farm in central Pasco
country, Florida, after state agriculture officials found 25-30 ostrich, emu
and rhea carcasses, some of which had been partially burned by farm
managers. Over 20 other birds appeared to be dehydrated for lack of water,
were thin and had droopy feathers.
The cause of the fatalities could, the officials said, be neglect, some
sort of parasite, disease, or a combination of the three. "We don't know
what we're dealing with," said Jimmy Carter, a state animal disease control
officer, but added that several of the sick birds will be taken to a state
lab in Kissimmee for diagnosis.
No other birds or animals or persons on neighboring properties have been
reported sick, but a resident in the area said the problem had been going on
for 3 months, with more deaths recently.

once robust ratite industry have taken a nosedive recently. If anyone
