Discovery of fungal disease leads to lockdown of PEI farm
---------------------------------------------------------
[The finding of the pernicious potato wart or canker disease caused by
_Synchytrium endobioticum_ led to the lockdown of a Prince County farm
this week by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The disease poses
no threat to human health. [The grower spotted diseased tubers during
harvesting. [If affected potato fields are properly isolated, it's a very
stationary disease, said Don Love of CFIA in Charlottetown on Thursday.
[Diseased potatoes are deformed and unmarketable. Once [the soil is
infested getting rid of [the disease is [difficult because the fungus has
a lifespan of 40 years or more. The area of investigation comprises less
than an acre on a farm in western PEI. The farm is now under a
prohibition order [but a quarantine of neighbouring farms and crops is not
expected. The CFIA issued a [prohibition-of-movement order on the farm and
is investigating the first recorded [incidence of the disease in PEI.
Potato wart is a soil-[borne disease, not spread by insects or wind. The
federal investigation is focusing on the history of the field, the seed
source, farming practices and possible non-farming contamination. Tonnes
of seed potatoes were imported [into PEI this year, but Love doesn't expect
to find the contamination there since the CFIA conducts virus tests on seed
[and warty potatoes would have been easily detected.
While the site has been potato land for decades, climate conditions and
possibly even deeper plowing practices are also being investigated.
Its presence on PEI should set off alarm bells according to Dr. Michael
Hampson, one of the leading experts in the field and [a retired plant
pathologist formerly with Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada. He suspects the
[pathogen came to PEI in the transportation of potatoes or soil.
Potato wart is not uncommon elsewhere in the world. The world's largest
potato exporter, Holland, has dealt with the disease for years with field
isolation and resistant potato strains. Both Pennsylvania and Maryland have
potato wart and even claim to have eradicated the fungus.
Love suggested that the best way to control [the disease is to [permanently
remove the field from potato production and plant trees in that field.

[Potato is the only cultivated crop infected by _S. endobioticum_, although
some wild Solanum species in Mexico are hosts of the pathogen. Until now,
potato wart in Canada occurred exclusively in Newfoundland. Field-grown
potatoes and soil from Newfoundland are prohibited from being exported to
other provinces of Canada. The discovery of the disease in PEI will
undoubtedly call for surveys to determine its distribution in the
province. - Mod.DH
