A total of 2 people in Albany County [New York State (NYS)] have tested positive for _Legionella_ -- and one of them has died. The exact cause of death has not been confirmed.

The Albany County Department of Health has launched an investigation, linking both cases to the Promenade Assisted Living facility in Albany. Water samples there have tested positive for the bacteria [_Legionella_ species] that cause Legionnaires' disease.

Legionnaires' disease is transmitted by breathing in water containing the bacteria. It is not spread from person to person [see moderator comments below]. It can result in pneumonia, particularly in elderly persons.

Albany County says it is working to minimize risk to other residents at the Promenade facility.

The New York State Department of Health released the following statement to NewsChannel 13:

"To help prevent future cases of legionellosis, the State Department of Health has been in contact with the county health department and Promenade at University Assisted Living to provide technical assistance and guidance. The facility has decided to put in place water restrictions, which the Department supports. We will continue to closely monitor the situation."

Additional information
------------------------
The investigation involves water sampling (final results are still pending) and interviews with staff from the facility to understand how the water system in the facility is currently being operated. No further cases of legionellosis have been reported at this facility.

From 2010 to 2012, legionellosis was seen in 13 NYS residents and 6 residents from other states with exposure to the Best Western Hotel [which is what the building used to be.] Some cases were identified as associated with the hotel retrospectively.

In NYS, including New York City, between 500 and 1000 cases of legionellosis are diagnosed annually. More legionellosis cases are usually identified in the summer and early fall, but legionellosis can happen any time of year.

_Legionella_ are found naturally in the environment, usually in water. The bacteria grow best in warm water, like the kind found in hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, and decorative fountains that are not properly maintained. Most cases of legionellosis are sporadic and not part of an outbreak. We are often not able to definitively determine the source of the _Legionella_. Please contact the facility directly for more information.

[_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacteria that embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of a building plumbing system's pipes and containers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. _Legionella_ can also be found in potable water.

Humans usually acquire these organisms by inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ from contaminated water sources. Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors wafted on air currents downwind from their source. In fact, during the outbreak of pneumonia among Legionnaires meeting at a hotel in Philadelphia in 1976 that was subsequently thought to be due to inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella pneumophila_ within the hotel, some passersby on Broad Street in front of the hotel, who had never entered the hotel, developed what was called at the time "Broad Street pneumonia" (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm). Aerosols containing _Legionella_ can be generated from contaminated water by cooling towers, fountains, showers, and misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments.

The disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated or hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med 2016;374(5):497-8. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, debilitated people who could be prone to aspitrate should be prohibited from taking showers, and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ becomes undetectable by culture of the water supply.

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 2 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary _Legionella_ antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping. The news report says that _Legionella_ have been identified in water samples from the assisted living facility where the 2 people with Legionnaires' disease resided. Genotyping of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

The Promenade at University Place (https://blog.timesunion.com/ishoplocal/promenade-at-university-place-the-capital-regions-new-senior-living-community/143/) occupies a former Best Western Sovereign Hotel located at 1228 Western Ave., Albany, NY that had been converted into 170 residential units each with a private bathroom, cooking facility and sleeping area for "seniors," that offers 3 meals per day and assistance with activities of daily living and personal care (https://www.townofguilderland.org/sites/guilderlandny/files/uploads/master_application_-_guilderland_ida_albany_place_development_final.pdf).
