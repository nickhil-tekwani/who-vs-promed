South Dakota: First West Nile Virus Case in State
-------------------------------------------------
SIOUX FALLS: A dead crow was found infected with the West Nile virus
in South Dakota, the farthest west the disease has been detected,
officials said on Fri 26 Jul 2002.
The bird was found on Monday in Aberdeen in northeastern South
Dakota, said Dr. Lon Kightlinger, state epidemiologist. The virus has
now been detected in 32 states and the District of Columbia.
The virus is transmitted by mosquitos. Since its detection in New
York City in 1999, more than 150 people have been infected with the
virus and 18 have died nationwide, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has spread south and west
over the past 3 years. Authorities advise people to use mosquito
repellent and wear long-sleeved clothes.
