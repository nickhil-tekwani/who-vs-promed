BAKERSFIELD, 9:14 p.m. PDT 5 Oct 2001 -- Valley Fever is primarily a
disease of the lungs that is common in the southwestern United States and
northwestern Mexico. [Patients contract it from breathing in fungal
spores, which grow during spring rains. When summer hits and the winds pick
up, the spores are carried through the air. That's when people get infected.
Researchers said that this year the Bakersfield area is in the midst of a
Valley Fever epidemic. Last year at this time, 300 new cases had been
diagnosed. So far this year, that number is well above 500. Experts said
that a monsoon-like rain that came through parts of the valley in July
could be part of the reason behind the sharp increases in cases.
Gov. Gray Davis has until 15 Oct 2001 to sign legislation that would continue
state support of the efforts to eradicate Valley Fever. Otherwise, it will
be vetoed, [TV station KERO 23 reports.

[Valley fever is another name for coccidioidomycosis, which is caused by
_Coccidioides immitis_, a fungus found in soil. The disease is endemic to
the western USA and periodic outbreaks are seen. The clinical picture
includes cough, chest pain, myalgias, and headaches. Erythema nodosum is
seen in approximately 20 percent of cases. Disseminated disease can result
in diffuse granulomatous abscess formation in skin and other tissues, and
can be fatal. Renal failure can result from granulomatous disease of the
kidneys.
According to GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Net
<http://www.cyinfo.com/> ) Coccidioidomycosis was first reported in the
United States in 1893 - as fatal infection acquired in California's San
Joaquin Valley, one of the areas where the disease is most common. Other
areas include Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, southern Nevada, and Utah. The
highest incidence occurs in late summer and early fall - large outbreaks
frequently follow dust storms. An estimated 100 000 infections occur in the
United States annually, and 1 in 200 infections progresses to disseminated
disease. The mean incidence in California during 1986 to 1990 was 450 per
year. Kern County accounted for 52% of California cases during 1981 to 1990
and 70% during 1991 to 1993. In all, 1208 cases were reported nationwide in
1991; 4516 in 1992; 4137 in 1993. - Mod.MPP
[Fisher et al. (J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Feb;38(2):807-13) have shown that
"epidemics" of coccidioidomycosis in the southwestern USA are related to
environmental factors such as periods of drought followed by periods of
increased rainfall. It is noteworthy that southern California was greener
than normal this spring and summer due to rainfall patterns, so perhaps
this increased incidence should be expected in the context of climatic
patterns. - Mod.ES
