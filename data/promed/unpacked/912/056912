From: Nicolas Troillet <nicolas.troillet@mail1.vsnet.ch>

The authorities of the Canton Valais (Western Switzerland) have recently
been notified of an outbreak of neurological disease among wild chamois and
"bouquetins" in a remote region of the Alps. Since September 15, hunters
observed at least seven animals suffering from a progressive palsy
affecting first the posterior limbs and leading to death in about a week.
Autopsies performed until now failed to reveal any etiology but a viral
encephalitis is suspected by veterinarians who are still working on this
problem.
The question has been asked of a possible transmission to humans (it is the
hunting season) or domestic animals (cattle might be in contact with
affected wild animals). Does somebody out there have an idea for the
etiology, or any suggestion about public health measures that should be
undertaken?
[Any information would be appreciated. Mod.-pc].
