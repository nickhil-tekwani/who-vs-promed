A new outbreak of dengue affects various parts of Santiago de Cuba,
according to the local press.
The correspondent of Cuba Press in that province, Haydee Rodriguez
Rodriguez, reported that the affected areas are districts in Sorripes, the
periphery of Caney, and to a lesser degree, the locality of Boniato and
other areas of the provincial capital.
Health authorities made arrangements for intensive spraying by airplane.
In addition, they will treat the inside and outside of homes for
mosquitoes, as well as putting larvacides in water tanks. The official
weekly, Sierra Maestra, explained in its edition of Saturday, November 1,
that the cases are small outbreaks and not an epidemic such as the one that
afflicted the city last summer.
The local government exhorted the populace to cooperate with the
eradication of the agent of transmission of the disease.
The residents of Santiago receive water periodically, and recent delays in
delivery have made it necessary to store water in open containers resulting
in potential breeding grounds for the mosquito vector.
