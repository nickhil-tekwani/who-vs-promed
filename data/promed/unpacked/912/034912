Alert has been sounded in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal after
a large number of polio cases were reported in these states. While the
disease is on its way out in the rest of the country, the polio eradication
programme has been ineffective in these states. In a series of meetings in
Delhi on Monday and Tuesday, officials from the Union health and family
welfare ministry, World Health Organisation, United Nations Children's Fund
and Rotary International chalked out several new measures to tackle the
disease in the four states.
The new measures are:
* Beefing up the routine immunization machinery.
* District collectors will once again be involved in the programme to raise
motivation levels.
* Vernacular media will be used for publicizing the programme.
* Emphasis on pockets of minority concentration where many myths exist. One
of them is that the vaccine causes impotency.
* Greater involvement of schoolchildren in getting parents to bring their
babies for immunization.
