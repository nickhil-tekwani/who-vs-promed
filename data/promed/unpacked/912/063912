Further information relating to prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The following 2 comments are in response to the preceding post [see above.
1. The examined forestry workers in the mentioned study belong to a high
risk population who acquire the tick bites during occupational activities
rather than during vacations.
2. In Germany, the only available vaccine is Encepur manufactured by
Chiron-Behring. The Baxter vaccine (TicoVac) is no longer available on the
market due to side effects.
For the interested reader, we can offer the following abstract of an
article [R Oehme, K Hartelt, H Backe, S Brockmann, P Kimmig. Foci of
tick-borne diseases in southwest Germany which describes part of the
research that the Baden-Wurttemberg State Health Office has conducted
during the past years. The work was presented at VI International
Potsdam-Symposium on tick-borne diseases in Berlin, Germany (26-27 Apr
2001) and will be published in an issue of the International Journal of
Medical Microbiology.
The abstract reads as follows: "The presently known tick-borne diseases in
Germany include Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) Central
European Type, Q fever, babesiosis, and presumably Ehrlichiosis. Blood
samples of 4368 forestry workers in the State of Baden-Wurttemberg (B-W),
southwest Germany, were tested for presence of antibodies against _Borrelia
burgdorferi sensu lato_, TBE virus, and _Ehrlichia spp._ (genogroup _E.
phagocytophila_). Furthermore 12 327 ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) collected in
various areas of B-W were analyzed by PCR [polymerase chain reaction and
genotyping for the prevalence of respective pathogen RNA and DNA. The human
seroprevalence rates of antibodies to _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ ranged
from 18 per cent to 52 per cent, for TBE virus from 0 per cent to 43 per
cent and for _Ehrlichia spp._ from 5 per cent to 16 per cent in various
counties of the State. The foci of _B. burgdorferi_ and TBE virus as
indicated by antibody prevalence in humans are only partly overlapping with
each other. The highest rates of TBE virus antibodies are in concordance
with available clinical data. However, antibody prevalence up to 27 per
cent in areas with no reports of clinical cases were found, suggesting that
TBE occurs throughout the State of B-W. The prevalence of _Ehrlichia spp._
antibodies suggests that Ehrlichiosis could play a further role in German
tick-borne diseases, but as long as no clinical data are available, this
will remain unclear.
Investigations of ticks for TBE virus (n = 9189) by nested PCR showed
prevalence rates from 0 per cent to 2.3 per cent and for _Ehrlichia spp._
(n =1963) from 2.6 per cent to 3.1 per cent. Examination of ticks (n =
3138) for presence of _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ DNA was performed by PCR
and revealed prevalence rates from 13.9 per cent up to 24 per cent.
Furthermore 1106 samples positive for _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ were used
for genotyping. _Borrelia afzelii_ DNA was found in 407 ticks (36.8 per
cent), followed by _B. garinii_ (21.9 per cent), _B. valaisiana_ (13.7 per
cent), and _B. burgdorferi sensu stricto_ (9.9 per cent). Double infection
was found in 6.4 per cent and triple infection in 0.8 per cent of the
ticks. 10.5 per cent of the positive samples could not be classified.
Prevention of tick-borne diseases has to focus on behavioral intervention
to reduce individual tick exposure by proper behavior in the environment,
as large scale control of the tick population seems impossible and thus
reduction of Lyme borreliosis and TBE through control of this population is
unlikely. Vaccination against TBE virus should not only be recommended for
high endemic areas but also for persons with a high individual risk."
