The coronavirus epidemic in Iran has cost 26 lives, the health ministry announced Thursday, 27 Feb [2020], with a vice president becoming the latest top official to be infected as the spread appeared to accelerate. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that the tally of infections had risen to 245 with 106 more cases confirmed, the highest number for a single day since Iran announced its 1st infections on [19 Feb 2020].

The Islamic republic has the highest death toll from the virus outside China, where COVID-19 1st emerged. Among the latest coronavirus sufferers is one of Iran's 7 vice presidents, Massoumeh Ebtekar, who oversees women's affairs. Ebtekar is being treated at home, and members of her team have been tested, state news agency IRNA reported.

Mojtaba Zolnour, head of parliament's national security and foreign affairs committee, also contracted the virus, appearing in a video posted by Fars news agency saying he was in self-quarantine.

In Estonia, the 1st case of a person being infected with the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] has been found, stated Estonian Social Affairs Minister Tanel Kiik on Thursday [27 Feb 2020], as cited by Estonian public broadcaster ERR. Kiik broke the news on ETV magazine show Terevisioon and unveiled that the affected individual is an Iranian national resident in Estonia who had arrived in Estonia by bus from Riga, Latvia. The passengers on the [same] bus are currently being identified and contacted, Kiik explained, yet he could not say how many people had been on the bus and had had contact with the infected person. To keep the infection under control, the individual is currently in isolation in an unnamed hospital in Estonia, according to Kiik, as quoted by the ERR.

[While one is tempted to conclude that this Iranian national was returning to Estonia after spending time in Iran, until there is further confirmation of the exact travel route this individual took it is safest to just speculate but not conclude. That being said, I have placed this report under the section on related to travel from Iran.

[The current tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 650, including 17 deaths, up from 400 cases and 12 deaths reported yesterday (26 Feb 2020). From the list of regions affected, there is the addition of Abruzzo and Puglia.

Italy is a major tourist point for other Europeans, with Lombardy being a major commercial hub. In addition, Italians are highly mobile and travel throughout Europe, and it is a major tourist location for Europeans and the Americas. See section [6] below for imported cases from Italy to other countries in Europe, a sign of this mobility.

[Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a projected population of almost 206 million inhabitants by the end of 2020 (https://tradingeconomics.com/nigeria/population primary source, the World Bank). During the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, Nigeria had an imported case with ultimate spread to involve 19 laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 states (Lagos and River states). The Nigeria Ministry of Health was able to interrupt transmission and prevent a major outbreak taking hold in the country. I am relating this piece of history as a lead in to the strength of the Nigerian MoH and the recently formed Nigerian CDC.

The identification of a suspected case and confirmation of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 within 48 hours of the return of this individual to Nigeria speaks to the rapid response of the Nigerian MOH when confronting potential outbreaks.

Denmark has confirmed its 1st coronavirus infection in a man who recently returned from a ski holiday in the Lombardy region in northern Italy, the Danish Health Authority said on Thursday [27 Feb 2020]. After testing positive on Wednesday [26 Feb 2020] night, the man was put in isolation in his own home together with his wife and son, who both tested negative for the virus. "We are taking the new situation very seriously. The work of containing and tracing has begun," Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said in a statement.

The case will not change the country's current risk assessment, published on Tuesday [25 Feb 2020], which finds a low risk of a countrywide epidemic, the Danish Health Authority said, but added it expected more cases of infection in Denmark.

A Dutch person who traveled to the Lombardy region of Italy is the 1st in the Netherlands to have tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus strain, Dutch health agency RIVM announced Thursday [27 Feb 2020] evening. The man, which BD reported as a 56-year-old from Loon op Zand, Noord-Brabant, was placed in quarantine, authorities confirmed. The man has been at the Elisabeth-TweeSteden hospital in Tilburg since Wednesday [26 Feb 2020]. His condition was not revealed. Health service GGD [Municipal and Regional Health Service] launched an investigation to map out who the patient has been in contact with and investigate how the disease might have been transmitted further.

"These people, referred to as 'contacts,' are monitored and must record their temperature twice a day, and report this to the GGD. They must also report other symptoms that they have," the RIVM stated. "These measures will reduce the chance that the disease spreads in the Netherlands."

The Health emergencies Coordination Group, at the end of today's [27 Feb 2020] meeting, confirmed the 1st case of infection with a new coronavirus (COVID-19) in a San Marino citizen, which was widely expected to happen due to the characteristics of the virus; this circumstance did not therefore surprise the table for the management of this emergency. It is an 88-year-old person with chronic polypathology, previously hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department of the "Infermi" Hospital in Rimini on [25 Feb 2020], due to an already compromised clinical picture. The confirmation of the positivity to the new coronavirus was communicated this morning [27 Feb 2020] to the ISS Health Department. The epidemiological investigation shows that the patient did not travel abroad or even to the red areas of northern Italy.

At this moment, a health team is reconstructing all the close contacts of the person considered at risk. The doctor who assisted the positive patient with COVID-19 was placed in home quarantine together with his family members; and everyone is doing well right now. A substitute medical practitioner has already been identified by the Primary Care Department. Citizens are informed that the patient has never visited the Health Center of Borgo Maggiore and that the hospital environments where he passed through for the 1st checks have been sanitized.

Citizens are reminded that in case of respiratory ailments, accompanied or not by fever, it is necessary to contact their doctor or the Medical Guard by telephone and not to go to the Emergency Department or Health Centers.

Coronavirus has also entered Lithuania. An emergency press conference was held at the Government from Thursday [27 Feb 2020] to Friday [28 Feb 2020] to announce the 1st case of coronavirus in Lithuania. Currently, the patient is isolated at the Republican Hospital of Siauliai, where the infrastructure is available to treat such conditions. The patient has mild symptoms, currently no fever, and she is being treated. The woman has been under observation since her return to Lithuania from Italy, just as other travelers returning from the affected areas.

The government says the Ministry of Health, along with specialists from the National Center for Public Health (NVSC) and other relevant authorities, has taken all necessary measures to prevent the spread of the infection in the country. The hospital monitors 3 patients' family members and assesses their state of health before they have developed symptoms of COVID-19. Also, people who have been in contact with the infected person are being identified, their health is being assessed, and no symptoms have been reported yet.

-----
- Nine new Member States (Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Norway, Pakistan, Romania, and North Macedonia) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO and the World Tourism Organization released a joint statement regarding responsibility and coordination on tourism and COVID-19.

- OpenWHO, a web-based learning platform, has launched the free online courses Introduction to Emerging Respiratory Viruses, Including Novel Coronovirus, in Portuguese (https://openwho.org/courses/introducao-ao-ncov) and Health and Safety Briefing for Respiratory Diseases - ePROTECT in French (https://openwho.org/courses/eprotect-infections-respiratoires-aigues) today [27 Feb 2020].

- WHO is utilizing an international network of expert laboratories to provide support in the detection of the COVID-19 virus globally. For more information, please see the Subject in Focus below.

Subject in Focus: Laboratory Network and Detection
On [9 Jan 2020], WHO published interim laboratory guidance for detection of the novel coronavirus (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-testing-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-in-suspected-human-cases-20200117). This guidance is continually updated as more data becomes available and includes advice on sample collection, diagnostic testing, and pathogen characterization. Specific interim guidance on biosafety in the laboratory (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331138/WHO-WPE-GIH-2020.1-eng.pdf) has also been published. An update to the guidance for the international shipment of specimens will follow soon. WHO is utilizing an international network of expert laboratories to provide support in the detection of the COVID-19 virus globally.

The diagnostic landscape of this outbreak is changing quickly. The 1st COVID-19 cases were detected using genomic sequencing, but multiple RT-PCR commercial and non-commercial assays have since been developed. As the international case load increases, there is an urgent need to rapidly scale up diagnostic capacity to detect and confirm cases of COVID-19. WHO has taken a 3-pronged approach to enhance global diagnostic capacity for the COVID-19 virus:

1) Developing a WHO network of 15 COVID-19 reference laboratories with demonstrated expertise in the molecular detection of coronaviruses. These international laboratories can support national labs to confirm the COVID-19 virus and troubleshoot their molecular assays.

2) Strengthening national capacity for detection of the COVID-19 virus so that diagnostic testing can be performed rapidly without the need for overseas shipping. Existing global networks for detection of respiratory pathogens are being utilized including, notably, the National Influenza Centers that support the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.

3) Ensuring ongoing test availability. WHO has procured a commercial assay (manufactured under ISO:13485) with strong performance data and shipped to over 150 laboratories globally as an interim measure for Member States requesting support. The main goal is to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for detection of the COVID-19 virus. Support is now also provided to ensure the quality of testing through the implementation of an External Quality Assurance mechanism.

Public health efforts are targeted at both interrupting further transmission and monitoring the spread of COVID-19. As reports of asymptomatic cases increase, the need for reliable serology testing is becoming more urgent. There are a number of groups working on this and developments are being monitored.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China continues to grow and is now 36 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, Italy, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Canada, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Iraq, Afghanistan, Algeria, Switzerland, Austria, Croatia, and adding Denmark, Georgia, Greece, North Macedonia, Romania, and Pakistan). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but other personnel on the ground working with the ship have been infected. More confirmations have not been reported from the cruise ship, but confirmations on returning evacuees from the cruise ship have been reported by the USA, UK, Hong Kong, Israel, Australia, and Japan.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 3664 including 57 deaths, with reports coming from 46 countries.

At the same time, the daily number of reported cases and fatalities reported by China keeps decreasing from levels that were 2000-3000 cases daily to less than 500 cases per day.

It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
