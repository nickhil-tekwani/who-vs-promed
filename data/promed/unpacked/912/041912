Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Canada
--------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 23 Oct 2009 from Dr Brian Evans,
Executive Vice President, Office of the President, Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 9 Oct 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 16 Oct 2009
Report date: 23 Oct 2009
Date submitted to OIE: 23 Oct 2009
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 80 percent
Mortality: 0 percent
Zoonotic impact: pandemic influenza H1N1
Causal agent: pandemic H1N1 virus
Serotype: other
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Waterloo-Wellington county, Ontario
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Oct 2009
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: birds
Susceptible: 7300
Cases: --
Deaths: --
Destroyed: --
Slaughtered: --
Affected Population: turkey breeder production (grandparent). There
are 2 barns on the premises: barn no. 1 has 3500 hens; barn no. 2 has
3500 hens and 300 toms.

Outbreak statistics
Species: birds
Apparent morbidity rate: **
Apparent mortality rate: **
Apparent case fatality rate: **
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: **
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: in barn no. 1, birds are at week 52. The
morbidity is related to the egg drop. During a period of one week,
the egg production dropped from about 1800 eggs/day to about 300
eggs/day (about 80 percent). The production now seems to increase.
Very little clinical evidence of disease other than the drop in egg
production. A slight increase in mortality was reported (about 10
birds over 3 day weekend) but may not be associated to the pandemic
H1N1.

In barn no. 2, a drop in egg production was noted on 21 Oct 2009.

Initial testing on samples submitted on 12 Oct 2009 was done at the
Animal Health Laboratory, University of Guelph, Ontario. Confirmation
at the CFIA [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] National Centre for
Foreign Animal Diseases in Winnipeg. The closest matches for the H1
and M fragments are all pandemic H1N1 2009 (450/450bp, 100 percent
identity and 245/245, 100 percent identity respectively to a number
of human clinical samples).

The full length of the N1 gene was sequenced and the closest matches
are all of the pandemic H1N1 2009 type. The identities were 1400/1402
(greater than 99 percent), gaps = 0/1402 (0 percent).

Conclusion: together with the RT-PCR results, the partial sequences
of the H1 and M genes and the N1 sequence confirm diagnosis of
pandemic H1N1 2009.

The samples have also been inoculated in eggs and may provide some
isolates for further analysis.

The premises has an intense biosecurity protocol. The producer has
voluntarily quarantined his flock in an effort to prevent further
virus dissemination. This approach is consistent with the national
policy on the presence of pandemic H1N1 virus in swine and poultry.

Ontario Public Health authorities are following up with individuals
who had contact with the flock in an effort to determine their
exposure and possible sources of infection. At this point, there is
no evidence to suggest the flock was infected from an animal source.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of
affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
