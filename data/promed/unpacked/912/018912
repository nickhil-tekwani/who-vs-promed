Effect on Sheep and Cattle Trade: Request for Information
---------------------------------------------------------
The following is a transcript from the ABC National Rural News (Wed 11 Oct
2000) which is broadcast daily to all states on ABC Regional Radio's
Country Hour and on ABC Radio National.
"An outbreak of deadly Rift Valley Fever in Northern Africa has halted the
sheep and cattle trade between Saudi Arabia and countries like Somalia,
Ethiopia and the Sudan. With trade between these countries at about 2
million head a year, Australia's export industry is confident of stronger
sales into the region. Livecorp Chief Executive, Kevin Sheill was quoted as
saying that increased orders for Australian livestock are expected in
November. Rift Valley Fever, its a viral disease that can cause high
mortality in cattle, sheep and goats and actually can be transmitted to
humans. A number of countries in the region have closed their borders to
trade from North Africa and Australian cattle will be recognized along with
our sheep for their disease freedom and therefore one would expect that it
would flow both into the sheep and to the cattle markets."

[There have been no independent reports of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever
in Northern Africa. The governments of Saudi Arabia and Yemen have banned
the importation of livestock from the horn of Africa, the suspected place
of origin of the virus responsible for the current outbreak in the Arabian
peninsula. It is possible that this report is a simple misunderstanding.
However, clarification from any source would be welcome. - Mod.CP
