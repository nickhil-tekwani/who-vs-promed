A suspected case of bubonic plague has been reported in western Mongolia, reported Xinhua news agency, based on a local media report on Tuesday [30 Jun 2020], which cites the country's National Centre for Zoonotic Diseases (NCZD).

"A 27-year-old resident of Tsetseg soum in Khovd [Hovd] province was taken to a hospital on Sunday [28 Jun 2020] after eating marmot meat. Preliminary test results revealed on Monday [29 Jun 2020] that he... (had contracted) the bubonic plague," the NCZD said in a statement, adding that the official result of the test will be released on Tuesday evening [30 Jun 2020].

The man is in critical condition, the NCZD added, urging citizens not to eat marmot meat. A couple died of bubonic plague in the western Mongolian province of Bayan-Ulgii in April 2019 after eating raw marmot meat.

The bubonic plague is a bacterial disease that is spread by fleas living on wild rodents such as marmots.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_Marmota monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot) comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse."

While foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described (e.g., Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011; 139(5): 728-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases [current case plus 2 from April 2019] were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LL
