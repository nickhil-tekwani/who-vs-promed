Comment on: Rabies - Indonesia (05): (BA) canine, human 20131221.2129946
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to the Jakarta Post article of 20 Dec 2013 on rabies in Bali (the subject of "Rabies - Indonesia (05): (BA) canine, human 20131221.2129946"), some clarifications are in order. The article states that the Bali provincial administration has been forced to postpone its 2015 rabies-free target due to the re-emergence of rabies cases throughout Bali and a human rabies death in September of this year [2013]. The article goes on to state that "rabies still infects numerous dogs in Gianyar, Bangli and Buleleng regencies," suggesting that rabies is only an issue in a minority of the island's districts.

In fact, in 2013, there have been confirmed canine rabies cases (over 30 cases in the government labs through November of this year) in 7 of Bali's 9 regencies -- not just 3. These include Badung, Bangli, Buleleng, Gianyar, Jembrana, Karangasem and Klungklung. It is highly likely that multiple dead dogs never make it into the labs for testing, so the number may be significantly higher.

Of note is that dog culling continues throughout the island, in spite of the joint Government of Indonesia-FAO initiative of the past 2 years aimed at combatting rabies through mass anti-rabies vaccination of dogs, along with PEP for humans (details of the initiative available at http://www.pmaconference.mahidol.ac.th/dmdocuments/2013-PMAC-Poster-P8-Pudjiatmoko.pdf).

The stated joint FAO-Indo approach "entails addressing viral circulation in dogs as the primary means of bringing the disease under control and reducing human cases. In order to achieve control of rabies in humans, the rabies control strategy on which the Bali programme is based focuses on vaccinating dogs, verifying coverage, and maintaining coverage between campaigns. Dogs are vaccinated using single dose long-lasting vaccine, with an emphasis on outside dogs and puppies."

Unfortunately, however, ARV [anti-rabies vaccine] rates of dogs in Bali's various districts have not reached anywhere near 70 percent and, as previously mentioned, dog culling remains rampant, along with a "cage and chain or kill" approach advocated by some local authorities, sabotaging efforts to establish the herd immunity necessary for eradicating the disease.
