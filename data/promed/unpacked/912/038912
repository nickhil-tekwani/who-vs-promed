Physicians say a new kind of tick-borne infection that's similar to Lyme disease can mislead doctors into thinking it's a different condition. _Borrelia miyamotoi_ can cause flu-like symptoms that are similar to Lyme disease, researchers found.

"In the few case reports available for patients in the US, symptoms of _B. miyamotoi_ infection have included fever, fatigue, body aches, joint pain, and headache," said Dr Bobbi Pritt, director of clinical parasitology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Pritt was not involved in the research. Researchers also think infection may cause dementia in the elderly, especially those who have conditions that weaken the immune system. Lab tests also show low blood platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes, Pritt said. However, scientists have developed a blood test that detects signs of the disease, and the infection has been fairly simple to treat so far.

It's not clear how widespread the infection has become in the areas of the United States like the Northeast, where ticks commonly spread disease. At the moment, scientists think the infection, caused by bacteria known as _B. miyamotoi_, is fairly uncommon. Still, "researchers are reporting that it's in 1 to 4 percent of ticks from Massachusetts and Rhode Island," said Dr Philip Molloy, medical director of Norwood, Massachusetts-based Imugen Inc. The company's tests are producing a better picture of the infection's spread by identifying more cases, said Molloy, co-author of a new report about the detection of the disease.

Scientists have known about _B. miyamotoi_, which is found on deer ticks (also known as blacklegged ticks), for more than a decade. But researchers have only started finding it in people over the last couple of years, and they suspect it may infect a few thousand Americans annually.

Lyme disease appears to be much more prevalent -- striking perhaps 30 000 Americans a year -- and much more of a health threat because of the potential for lasting complications.

The new report says 2 people, in Massachusetts and New Jersey, were initially thought to have human granulocytic anaplasmosis, one of several diseases caused by germs that ride on ticks. But the patients didn't quickly respond to treatment with the antibiotic doxycycline, and tests showed they didn't have the disease. However, tests did show signs of _B. miyamotoi_. The patients, one of whom may also have had Lyme disease, eventually responded to treatment with doxycycline. Both recovered, although one -- an 87-year-old man -- was ill for weeks. The patients sought treatment in 2011 and 2012.

The report says physicians should consider _B. miyamotoi_ to be a possibility when patients have symptoms similar to those of human granulocytic anaplasmosis but don't seem to suffer from that disease. For the moment, there are no guidelines about how to treat the infection. "The most we have is 'a doctor gave a patient this, and they got better.' There's no formal antibiotic treatment," report co-author Molloy said. However, all patients thought to have been infected with _B. miyamotoi_ in the United States have recovered with the use of antibiotics, said Pritt, the Mayo Clinic specialist.

Molloy said his firm now offers a blood test that detects signs of infection with _B. miyamotoi_. He expects doctors will learn how to properly treat the disease as the tests confirm more cases.

What to do? Tick specialists recommend that people who may be exposed to ticks in the woods or elsewhere follow these precautions: Use an insect repellant with DEET, permethrin, or picaridin; wear pants and tuck them into your socks; avoid going to areas with many ticks; and check yourself, your family, and pets carefully for ticks.

Ann Intern Med. 2013; 159(1): 21-7 (http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1700642) that concludes: "tick-exposed patients acutely presenting with signs of HGA [human granulocytic anaplasmosis] but who have a delayed response to doxycycline therapy or negative confirmatory test results for HGA should be analyzed carefully for evidence of _B. miyamotoi_ infection [by molecular diagnostic assays]." An editorial on this subject also appeared in the same issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine (Branda JA, Rosenberg ES: _Borrelia miyamotoi_: A Lesson in Disease Discovery. Ann Intern Med. 2013; 159(1): 61-2; http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1700645.)

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comment in ProMED-mail post Tick-borne borreliosis - USA: (South. New Engl., NY) _B. miyamotoi_ 20130118.1504740:

"Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, is a multisystemic disorder caused by spirochetes belonging to the _Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex, a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf). At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex (_B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi sensu stricto_) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans, although _B. burgdorferi sensu stricto_ is the only pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe, but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies. Vectors of _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex.

"The relapsing-fever group of borrelia, which includes _B. miyamotoi_, is genetically diverse and causes a disease characterized by a high temperature that cyclically remits. _Borrelia hermsii_ is the most frequent cause of tick-borne relapsing fever in the USA. This spirochete is transmitted to humans by the soft tick _Ornithodoros hermsi_, which unlike hard ticks, transmit spirochetes through a brief (less than 30 minutes' duration) and painless nocturnal bite. Humans typically are exposed to these ticks during an overnight stay in rodent-infested dwellings at elevations greater than 2000 feet (610 m). In the USA, a majority of the reported cases are from California and Washington. Louse-borne relapsing fever, an illness similar to the tick-borne disease, is caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_, which is transmitted from human to human by the body louse and is spread under conditions of crowding and poor personal hygiene. It remains endemic in parts of central and east Africa and the South American Andes, but has occasionally been imported into the USA.

"In the USA, _B. miyamotoi_ has been detected in _Ixodes scapularis_, in Russia and Japan in _Ixodes persulcatus_ (Fukunaga M, Takahashi Y, Tsuruta Y, et al: Genetic and phenotypic analysis of _Borrelia miyamotoi_ sp. nov., isolated from the ixodid tick _Ixodes persulcatus_, the vector for Lyme disease in Japan. Int J Syst Bacteriol 1995; 45(4): 804-10; http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/45/4/804.long), and in western Europe, _Ixodes ricinus_, the same tick species that spread _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex, the causative agents of Lyme disease.

"As described in patients in the USA by Krause et al in the New England Journal of Medicine article (Krause PJ, Narasimhan S, Wormser GP, et al: Human _Borrelia miyamotoi_ Infection in the United States. N Engl J Med 2013; 368(3): 291-3; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1215469), _B. miyamotoi_ has also caused in patients in Russia an acute febrile illness with fever as high as 39.5 deg C (103.1 deg F) and usually does not cause the bull's eye shaped rash that characterizes Lyme disease (Platonov AE, Karan LS, Kolyasnikova NM, et al: Humans Infected with Relapsing Fever Spirochete _Borrelia miyamotoi_, Russia. Emerg Infect Dis 2011; 17(10): 1816-23; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310649/). In Gugliotta JL, Goethert HK, Berardi VP, Telford SR: Meningoencephalitis from _Borrelia miyamotoi_ in an Immunocompromised Patient. N Engl J Med 2013; 368(3): 240-5 (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1209039), _B. miyamotoi_ apparently has caused progressive dementia without fever in an immunocompromised patient. These recent articles point out that _B. miyamotoi_ may be the cause of an acute febrile illness or meningoencephalitis associated with dementia in regions where _Ixodes_ ticks are endemic."

Anaplasmosis, a disease caused by _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, a rickettsia-like Gram negative, obligate intracellular bacterium also transmitted by the deer tick, _Ixodes scapularis_, should be suspected in patients with the acute onset of unexplained fever, chills, muscle aches, and headache, often in association with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and/or increased liver enzyme levels with a history of possible or known tick exposure in an endemic region within the prior 3 weeks. This clinical picture is similar to that described in the news report above for disease due to _Borrelia miyamotoi_. - Mod.ML
