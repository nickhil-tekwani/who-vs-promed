Public health officials are investigating iced tea among other menu items at a Stephens County barbecue restaurant as the possible source of a major _Escherichia coli_ [O157] outbreak that has sickened as many as 18 people. 11 people have been confirmed to have _E. coli_ infection, and 7 others are probable cases, though their illness has not been confirmed by lab results, state officials say. There have been no other infections reported since 8 May 2013.

"The risk is gone," said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health. "We are looking at everything on the menu."

Investigators are looking at the possibility of "cross contamination", in which harmful bacteria are transferred to food from other foods, cutting boards, utensils or other objects if they are not handled properly.

Several of the cases are severe and have required hospitalization. 5 people have been diagnosed with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a kind of kidney failure that is a serious complication of _E. coli_ infection. The HUS patients are recovering, said Dave Palmer, public information officer for the local public health district. Stephens County borders South Carolina in north east Georgia.

All of the patients reported their illnesses between 4-8 May 2013. Those infected with _E. coli_ EHEC generally show symptoms 3-4 days after they've eaten the contaminated food, said Palmer [although it can be up to 10 days. - Mod.LL].

Drenzek said public health officials learned of the outbreak after a DPH epidemiology surveillance officer noticed a cluster of cases -- 4 patients in a week -- in lab reports from the Stephens County Hospital. The Stephens County Health Department had also received complaints about the BBQ Shack after some customers reported being ill after eating at the restaurant.

Public health investigators interviewed all the patients who were sick, as well as some diners who ate at the restaurant but did not become ill, tracking them down using credit card receipts. Food samples and environmental swabs taken from the restaurant on 16 May 2013 tested negative for any pathogens.

"Sometimes we're not able to definitively say what's the source," Palmer said. "That's the hard part with foodborne investigations."

[As previously stated, whether the total cases is 11 or 18, the risk of HUS is generally 5 to 10 per cent of total cases. This suggests that substantially more cases may have occurred. - Mod.LL
