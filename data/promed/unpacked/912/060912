Information received on 31 Oct 2005 from Dr. Gabriel Predoi, Director
General, National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, Bucharest:

End of previous report period: 22 Oct 2005 (see Disease Information,
18 [43], 386, dated 28 Oct 2005).

End of this report period: 31 Oct 2005.

The avian influenza virus detected in a heron, found dead in Vaslui
County on 21 Oct 2005, was confirmed to be of H5N1 subtype.

Conventional amino acid sequencing has revealed a motif of
PQGERRRKKRGLF, a sequence consistent with high pathogenicity and the
same cleavage site sequence as in the Novosibirsk (Russia), Qinghai
(People's Republic of China), Turkey and previous Romanian isolates.

Preliminary phylogenetic analysis (approx. 300 bp) places the
Romanian isolate in the same grouping as the above viruses, with the
closest matches being 100 percent with the chicken Romania Av 1210/05
and also the Turkey virus.

Final report: no.

[Both these locations are in the Black Sea vicinity. There were 2
geese and one swan in the 2nd report from Constanta (lat 44.18, long
28.65), which is located quite close to the Black Sea, whereas the
heron was found a little further inland at Vaslui (lat 46.60, long
28.07). With these findings -- and those from swans in Croatia and
the similarity of the virus isolated in Romania with the isolates
from Novosibirsk and Qinghai -- a pretty convincing preliminary
picture of spread by migratory birds emerges. Unfortunately, the
viruses isolated from these migratory birds are also similar to those
isolated from virus in Romanian chickens and chickens in Turkey.
Therefore, we have tracking of the virus from Central Asia to
migratory birds in the Black Sea as well as to chickens in the
region. - Mod.PC]
