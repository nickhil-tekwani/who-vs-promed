Norovirus Outbreak on British Cruise Ship
-----------------------------------------
Hundreds of British tourists on a British-flagged cruise ship have
come down with gastroenteritis as the vessel heads towards the Greek
port of Piraeus, Greece's Merchant Marine Ministry said on Thu 30 Oct
2003. The Ministry named the ship as the Aurora in a statement but
did not say who owned it. A Ministry spokeswoman told Reuters at
least 430 people aboard the ship, carrying 1900 mostly British
tourists and 837 crew members, were affected. "The 430 people on
board the Aurora are having severe stomach problems," she said. She
said they were suffering from norovirus infection.
The ship, which left the English port of Southampton on 20 Oct 2003,
was expected to arrive as scheduled at the port of Piraeus at 0500 hr
GMT but health officials said passengers would not be allowed to
leave the ship in the port. "It has been decided after consulting the
company managing the ship that the vessel will only dock at Piraeus
to take in supplies and then leave. The passengers will not get off
the ship," a Health Ministry spokesman told Reuters.
Merchant Marine Minister Giorgos Paschalidis told reporters the ship
had docked at Spanish, Italian, and Croatian ports before heading for
Piraeus, near Athens. "We have been in constant contact with the
company managing the ship and the ship's captain since yesterday and
we are monitoring the situation," he said.
P&O Cruises, based in Southampton, southern England, had a cruise
ship called the Aurora on an Adriatic cruise bound for Piraeus on
Thursday, according to the company's web-site. P&O Cruises are part
of Carnival Corp (CCL.N), the world's biggest cruise group.

Doctors Board Illness-hit British Cruise Ship
---------------------------------------------
Doctors boarded the British cruise ship Aurora when it anchored off
the Greek port of Piraeus on Fri 31 Oct 2003 with hundreds of British
tourists hit by a stomach bug [norovirus infection] on board. Greek
officials said the ship was effectively in quarantine and no
passengers or crew would be allowed to leave. Greek officials said
the ship was carrying 1900 tourists and 837 crew members. A P&O
spokeswoman said: "As far as I am aware all the passengers are
British."
The Aurora, which left Southampton on 20 Oct 2003 on a 17-day round
trip, was anchored several hundred metres off Piraeus. There was no
sign of passengers on the decks of the ship, which was scheduled to
continue its cruise to Gibraltar after taking on the supplies.
Several coastguard launches surrounded the Aurora at a distance of
about 100 metres to ensure no other ships approached the liner.
"To help with the treatment of ill passengers several doctors have
gone on board and medical and sanitation supplies are also being
loaded," a Health Ministry spokesman said. "It has been decided after
consulting the company managing the ship that the vessel will take in
supplies and then leave. The passengers will not get off the ship,"
the Health Ministry spokesman said.
The P&O spokeswoman told Reuters in London the infection, identified
by Greek officials as a norovirus infection, is believed to have been
brought on board by a passenger at Southampton. "The symptoms are
diarrhea and vomiting. They last just 24 hours and there is a
complete recovery," the spokeswoman said, adding not all 430 people
had been affected at the same time. "This has been over a 10-day
period," she said. "We are undertaking extensive sanitation programs
to control the spread of this and we are asking our passengers...to
wash their hands after leaving the bathroom -- normal hygiene
measures."

Norovirus-stricken Aurora Now on Route for Gibraltar
----------------------------------------------------
About 400 holiday-makers on the P&O ship were affected by a highly
contagious stomach bug, although all but 30 are now thought to have
recovered. Earlier on Fri 31 Oct 2003, Greek doctors boarded the
superliner worth 200 GBP after authorities refused to let passengers
and crew disembark at the port of Piraeus, near Athens. A P&O
spokeswoman told BBC News Online that somebody had died during the
cruise, but that it was entirely unrelated to the outbreak.
The disease is believed [to be a result of norovirus infection],
which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting for up to 2 days and strikes
where there is inadequate sanitation -- mostly in hospitals and
schools or on cruise ships.
P&O said the ship, which is based in Southampton, will continue its
cruise as planned, with 1800 passengers and 600 crew on board. The
buffet, thought to be the food outlet most at risk from
person-to-person transmission of the virus, has been closed. The
spokeswoman said that spirits on board remained high and that nobody
had been seriously ill with the infection.
A passenger stated that: "Before we came we had a letter warning us
that norovirus infection was about and to take the necessary
precautions. Now it was pretty obvious reading between the lines that
it was onboard before we came. I don't think it is just P&O, I think
a lot of the ships have it.
"The P&O staff are doing their utmost, anytime they can they are
washing the walls, washing handrails, tables, and even the chairs. A
spokeswoman for P&O said that: "We are treating it as an [outbreak of
norovirus infection], which lasts 24 hours. "To control this we have
comprehensive procedures in place and are taking the health and
well-being of our passengers as a priority."
The company believes the disease was brought on board by a passenger
at Southampton, where the cruise began on Mon 20 Oct 2003. During a
stop in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik on Wednesday, health inspector
Ivo Miloglav ordered the sick passengers to remain in their cabins.
They had not been permitted to disembark during the ship's previous
stop, in Venice, Italy, he added.

[This is the second outbreak of norovirus infection reported on a
cruise ship this season. The first occurred earlier in October and
affected a ship from New Orleans cruising in the Caribbean region
(see preceding update). Epidemiological studies in past seasons have
established that norovirus infection was introduced usually by
passengers and/or crew and that ships could be successfully
decontaminated both during and between voyages. The high-density
conditions on cruise ships provide a suitable environment for the
spread of norovirus infection. Consequently cruise ships can be
considered sensitive indicators of the prevalence of norovirus
infection in the general population. The occurrence of noroviruses on
cruise ships operating out of both UK and US ports suggests that
there may be widespread outbreaks of "winter vomiting " disease on
land in the coming months.
This appears to be the first instance of placing a cruise ship in
quarantine during a cruise. - Mod.CP]
