More than 500 people in the Netherlands have now contracted salmonellosis linked to smoked salmon, and at least one of these patients has died, reported Dutch health officials Sat 13 Oct 2012.

According to The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands, 2 fatalities have been connected to the outbreak. One has been confirmed to be a result of the patient's salmonellosis and the other is under investigation. Both people who died were over 80 years old, reported New England Cable News.

The Dutch health agency says approximately 550 people are now thought to be affected by the outbreak, which has been tied to smoked salmon produced by Netherlands-based Foppen but manufactured in a facility in Greece. Foppen issued a recall of the implicated salmon 1 Oct 2012 after its product was named as the potential source of the outbreak, which at the time was known to have sickened around 300 people.

The company's fish is sold globally, and was distributed in the USA by Costco Wholesale under the Foppen and Kirkland Signature brands. Costco contacted all customers, approximately 250 000, who purchased this smoked salmon after it was made aware of the problem.

The Kirkland Signature has since been released onto the market again, as it was not manufactured at the plant in Greece where the contamination was found. The recalled Foppen brand salmon has been destroyed. No illnesses have been linked to the product in the USA to date, although Costco did receive reports of illnesses after customers were notified of the recall.

CDC says it is investigating an uptick in _S._ Thompson infections but so far has no evidence of a common food source for the bacteria.

[About 550 cases with at least one death have been reported in this prominent outbreak of _S._ Thompson in the Netherlands. Since salmonellae are not usually found in fish, as in past outbreaks, contamination is likely to have occurred after harvesting the fish.

Regarding the USA, ProMED-mail has previously reported (from eFoodAlert http://efoodalert.net/2012/10/03/smoked-salmon-and-salmonella-thompson/) that "CDC, FDA, and USDA are cooperating in an ongoing investigation of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Thompson illnesses that may be linked to a concurrent outbreak in the Netherlands. The US investigation began last month (September 2012) into 85 cases of a single genetic type of _S._ Thompson that were reported by 27 states since 1 Jul 2012, according to CDC spokesperson Lola Russell. 10 people have been hospitalized; there have been no deaths. This is a fairly common strain of _S._ Thompson, and CDC would normally expect to see approximately 30 "background" cases during the same period." - Mod.LL
