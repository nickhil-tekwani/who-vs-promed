A total of 3 members of a family in New Zealand remain "unresponsive" in hospital and could face paralysis or tremors for life after suspected food poisoning from a wild boar they shot on a hunting trip. A husband and wife, and his mother, were found by paramedics lying unconscious on the floor of their home after eating dinner, which included cooked meat from a boar shot by the husband. Their children, aged 7 and one, did not eat the meat and did not fall sick.

A family friend, said the 3 adults became ill within half an hour of eating the meat on [Fri 10 Nov 2017] night and then began vomiting every 15 minutes. The wife called emergency services and fainted through the conversation. The 3 were then rushed to hospital and put on life support after suffering severe food poisoning. Another family friend, said he visited the 3 on [Wed 15 Nov 2017] night, and they remained "unresponsive". "He's not able to talk, or even respond to any of his surroundings," he told Radio New Zealand. "So we really don't know what's going on."

The quick onset of the illness has prompted New Zealand's National Poisons Centre to suggest the cause may have been botulism, a rare and potentially fatal condition caused [toxins produced] by the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium. Medical specialists treating the 3 reportedly indicated it could take up to 2 months for the poison to clear their bodies and that they could face long-term damage including paralysis or tremors. The couple moved from India about 5 years ago and [MD] was visiting.

The spores of the bacterium are found in soils and can be ingested via food that is not properly cooked, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, weakness and paralysis.

Dr Adam Pomerleau, the director of the centre, said that symptoms of botulism typically develop 12 hours or more after eating contaminated food but could appear quicker if the dose was "very high". An antitoxin exists but it would need to be given as quickly as possible. "If it does turn out to be botulism, the faster the antitoxin is given, the better their improvement," Dr Pomerleau told the New Zealand Herald.

Health authorities said the cause of the illnesses was under investigation but there was not believed to be any "broader contaminated game". The meat has been sent for testing and a toxicology report is due on [Fri 17 Nov 2017].

"We do not have any evidence to determine any broader contaminated game meat, or that there is a risk to public health," Dr Richard Vipond, from the local Waikato health authority, told NZ Newswire.

Health authorities said the husband and his mother were in a stable condition while [MB] is still in a critical condition in the high dependency unit at Waikato hospital, south of Auckland. Relatives of the family are rushing from India to care for the 2 children, who are being looked after by a local church group.

A New Zealand family are seriously ill in hospital, with a wild boar they hunted and ate being investigated by doctors as one possible cause. Friends of the family wrote in a Facebook post that [a man], his wife and mother collapsed after eating the meat. Health officials said there is no evidence of any "broader contaminated game" or any risk to public health. Two children who did not eat the meat are unaffected.

But the 3 adults in the family had cooked and eaten the boar, before being found on the floor of their home in Waikato by emergency services last [Fri 10 Nov 2017], friends of the family said. [A friend of the family] told the BBC that doctors are waiting on a toxicology report and that "the nature of the contaminant is unknown".

In a Facebook post appealing for help, [a friend] and other friends of the family wrote of the severity of their condition, adding that officials had sent samples of all food items found in the family's home for testing. The family moved to New Zealand from India 5 years ago and [the father of this family], a hunting enthusiast, had earlier shot the wild boar which they eventually ate.

"We are still investigating potential sources for the illness in this case," said Richard Vipond, a medical officer at the Waikato Health Board, in a press release.

He added that those who hunt or handle game meat should follow the guidelines set out by the Ministry of Primary Industries to reduce any risk of contamination. [The father and his wife] are reportedly stable in a ward, but [the elder mother] remains in critical condition, according to Dr Vipond.

The Indian High Commission told the New Zealand Herald that embassy staff are working with family and friends.

Newshub has learned 3 people from the same family, who were suddenly struck with paralysis, are being treated for suspected botulism. Waikato Hospital doctors have told family friends they're sure the patients are suffering from botulism, but are awaiting test results to confirm it.

The couple and the husband mother ate cooked wild boar which was shot and killed by the husband. Within half an hour, the trio began throwing up [the above report reported 15 minutes - Mod.LL]. Emergency services found them unconscious and rushed them to hospital, where they remain paralysed.

The suspect meat has been sent to Australia for tests, but the results are at least 2 weeks away.

"While we don't know the exact cause and source of this illness, we now believe it is botulism," a Waikato DHB spokesperson says. "The 3 patients are responding to botulism anti-toxin and are recovering in hospital.

"We have sent samples off to a specialist centre in Queensland for testing, but it may take several weeks before we get the results. We have no evidence to believe there is any public health issue."

Symptoms of botulism typically become apparent within 12-36 hours. However, if the toxin is particularly potent, the symptoms, which include vomiting and paralysis, could come on quicker.

"The fact that this happened so quickly suggests a toxin, and suggests something pretty potent or there in large amounts," says University of Auckland microbiologist Dr Siouxsie Wiles.

Dr Liam Pomerleau, from the Otago University's National Poison's Centre, says botulism affects the peripheral nervous system.

"What the toxin does is it gets into the cells and blocks the transmission from nerve cells to muscle cells, and that results in a paralysis," he says. "Once the cells have been affected by the toxin, it can take a long time for them to regenerate."

The family ate a form of pork curry and another food item - not the pork - may have caused the sickness.

[In my mind, the very rapid onset of symptoms (15 minutes) after ingestion of the suspected food (the cooked boar meat) speaks against this being botulism. The onset of symptoms of botulism usually occur 18 to 36 hours after exposure (range, 6 hours to 8 days)

A 2008 publication regarding a 2006 outbreak of severe botulism caused by commercially produced carrot juice (Sheth AN, Wiersma P, Atrubin D, et al: International outbreak of severe botulism with prolonged toxemia caused by commercial carrot juice. Clin Infect Dis. 2008;47: 1245-1251 - see abstract below)

Abstract:
"Investigators reviewed medical records and interviewed patients and family members. Foods from patients' homes and samples of the implicated commercial beverage were tested for botulinum toxin and _C. botulinum_ by standard methods.

Results: The patients presented with cranial neuropathies and flaccid paralysis; all patients required mechanical ventilation. The 3 Georgia patients had consumed carrot juice from the same bottle before illness onset. An additional case in Florida and 2 in Ontario, Canada, were subsequently identified in patients who had consumed carrot juice. Serum samples obtained from 5 patients tested positive for botulinum toxin type A-in one patient, 12 days after illness onset, and in another patient, 25 days after illness onset. Carrot juice produced by one manufacturer, recovered from patients' homes in Georgia, Florida, and Ontario, yielded type A toxin. The juice contained no added sugar, salt, or preservative; inappropriate refrigeration likely resulted in botulinum toxin production.

Conclusion: This outbreak was caused by commercially produced, internationally distributed carrot juice that was contaminated with botulinum toxin. When toxemia persists, treatment for botulism should be considered even if diagnosed weeks after illness onset. The implicated pasteurized carrot juice had no barriers to growth of _C. botulinum_ other than refrigeration; additional protective measures for carrot juice are needed to prevent future outbreaks. The US Food and Drug Administration has since issued industry guidance to reduce the risk of _C. botulinum_ intoxication from low-acid refrigerated juices."

In the report, it stated
"For the 3 Georgia patients, whose time of carrot juice consumption was known, the times from consumption to onset of neurological symptoms were 14, 15, and 25 h, and the times from consumption to intubation were 31, 36, and 33 h, respectively; all 3 patients received treatment with antitoxin <24 h after presentation. The Florida patient and one Ontario patient were treated with antitoxin 12 and 44 days after symptom onset, respectively, when the diagnosis of botulism was made and serum test results identified persistent toxemia. The second Ontario patient did not receive treatment with antitoxin, because toxemia was not present at the time of diagnosis.

Only one year after illness onset, 2 patients (33 percent) had been discharged home, 2 (33 percent) were in rehabilitation facilities, and one (17 percent) was still hospitalized. One patient died 90 days (12.9 weeks) after illness onset; the patient had been unresponsive since hospital admission, and ventilatory support was withdrawn. Of the 5 surviving patients, 3 were no longer ventilator dependent and had durations of intubation of 54, 90, and 129 days; the other 2 surviving patients remained ventilator dependent."

The severity of the cases is impressive but the incubation period, when able to be measured, was still 14 hours or more. ProMED would like more information about this outbreak and the etiology.

Additionally, I would think that if this was botulism, a response as reported in the 3rd post, would not have occurred yet. As if there was that much toxin to cause paralysis so fast, since the bound toxin is not neutralized by the antitoxin, it would take quite a while for any improvement. Also, this 3rd report, potentially implicated other foods but it is not stated with the children mentioned in the other posts here ate any of these. - Mod.LL]

[This does not seem like botulism. The onset is much too rapid. The US CDC does document a case of botulism occurring in as short as 4 hours. However, this is rare, as the usual onset is generally 18-36 hours post ingestion. Furthermore, we are not told what else was served at the meal. It is possible that some of the vegetables, or other home preserved edible was served and could have been potentially contaminated with some other bacteria or toxin.

It is unlikely that tick borne diseases would affect several individuals in the same household at the same time. However, there is an allergy to red meat (beef, pork, deer, moose, etc) capable of developing after an individual has been bitten by a Lone Star tick and likely other ticks as well. Anaphylaxis can develop rapidly, even after a small exposure to red meat. As we are not told a lot about the time of reaction of the people involved, this may be another differential. Under certain circumstances it could be mistaken for botulism to an untrained eye.

Botulism is caused by a spore-forming obligate anaerobic bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_. It was once known as sausage disease, because the 2 meats most associated with this condition are sausage and ham. It can be found in other meats especially smoked meats as well as inappropriately persevered vegetable, notably home canned products. Smoked meats set up the perfect environment for this bacterium to flourish, as it does not reach a temperature capable of killing the bacterium.

We are not told how the meat was prepared in this case in New Zealand but time of onset, a half hour, would likely be the shortest ever recorded, it confirmed. Furthermore, with rapid medical assessment there is an antitoxin, which can be lifesaving. We are not told any antitoxin has been administered to these people.

_C. botulism_ typically causes a descending paralysis. This article does not mention any clinical signs. The lack of any mention of antitoxin, or clinical signs, and the extreme rapidity of onset, all should cast strong doubts on the theory of botulism. However, a recent media article did mention a very rapid response to anti-toxin, which is very unusual. This situation paints a picture of extremely rapid deterioration from what is allegedly believed to be botulism and an equally rapid response to the antidote. The extreme rapidness of onset and response, is further reason for doubt as this being botulism.

Most patients with botulism present with cranial nerve dysfunction; difficulty swallowing, dysarthria, blurred vision and diplopia are among the most common early complaints. Weakness of the upper extremities usually follows these problems related to cranial nerves, followed by lower extremity weakness. Myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are the major differential diagnostic concerns in cases of possible botulism. The Miller Fisher variant of the Guillain Barré syndrome, while quite rare, closely mimics the cranial nerve findings of botulism, and since it may follow a diarrheal illness the prospect of a food-borne disease is apparent. Tick paralysis involving Dermacentor ticks produces a similar disease.

There are no routine laboratory tests that will aid in the diagnosis or differential diagnosis of botulism. The best bedside study is repetitive nerve stimulation at high frequency (20 Hz or greater). Patients with presynaptic acetylcholine release defects (botulism or the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome) will have an incremental muscle response to this stimulation. Patients with myasthenia gravis (a post-synaptic disorder) classically have a decremental response. However, at the lower frequencies (e.g., 4 Hz) used for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, patients with botulism may show no change, or even a decrement, so high frequency stimulation must be requested when botulism is considered.

While the presentation does not resemble botulism, the diagnosis is confirmed by recovery of toxin from the serum or stool; this is still done using a mouse assay. In suspected inhalation botulism, toxin may also be recovered from nasal secretions. Anaerobic cultures of food or stool which grow C. botulinum are supportive, but since the spores are ubiquitous, they are not diagnostic. Anaerobic cultures of debrided wound tissue would also be diagnostic.

[In summary, if this is proven to be due to botulism, by identification of the toxin in either the patients and/or in the food, the description of the time of onset of the symptoms would make this reportable as 15-30 mins post ingestion is highly unusual. - Mods. LL/TG/MPP
