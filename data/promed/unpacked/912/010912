Canine rabies in France
-----------------------
Following the diagnosis of rabies in a dog on the outskirts of Paris
last month [February 2008], the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is
advising that any person who had significant exposure to dogs in 3
regions of France (see below) in recent weeks should seek prompt
medical assessment to determine whether post-exposure prophylaxis
(PEP) is required. There is a low, but ongoing, risk of rabies in
people who have been bitten or scratched, or had mucous membranes or
broken skin licked by any dog in the risk areas during the relevant
periods (see below).

Health professionals are also being advised to review records of
those who have previously presented with dog bites suffered in the
relevant regions, and may have been reassured, to reassess whether
post-exposure prophylaxis might now be required.

The geographical areas and corresponding periods of risk are now
considered to be:
- Gers (Auch city and surroundings), from 1 Nov 2007
- Grandpuits, Seine-et-Marne (approx 30 miles SE of Paris) from 15 Dec 2007
- Calvados (Lisieux city and Thury Harcourt village and their
surroundings), from 15 Dec 2007.

The dog (dog 3 below) was diagnosed with rabies on 26 Feb 2008 by the
national reference laboratory, the Pasteur Institute. The viral
strain identified belonged to genotype 1, African 1 lineage,
originating from Morocco. Local investigation revealed the following
likely chain of infection, involving 2 further dogs, from 25 Oct 2007:

Dog 1: [mixed breed collie] Imported from Morocco in late October to
Gers, near to Toulouse and Aquitaine (in south west France) and died
there 12 Nov 2007 [estimated period of viral excretion end October to
12 Nov 2007]. Dog incinerated, no samples available.

Dog 2: [black cross Labrador] Contact with dog 1 in Gers, then
travelled with family back to Grandpuits on 29 Nov 2007. Died 5 Jan
2008 [estimated period of viral shedding 15 Dec 2007 to 5 Jan 2008].
Dog incinerated, no samples available. It stayed in the Seine-et-
Marne area until it was euthanized on the 5 January 2008, except for
3 days (15-17 December) when it was in Calvados district (Normandy).

Dogs 1 and 2 both died with symptoms that retrospectively are
compatible with rabies.

Dog 3: [young mixed-breed female] in same family as dog 2, lived in
Grandpuits, Seine-et-Marne district. The 1st symptoms appeared on 15
Feb 2008 and it died 19 Feb 2008 [estimated period of viral shedding
1-19 Feb 2008]. Confirmed diagnosis, reported 26 Feb 2008.

To date France is considered to be free of terrestrial rabies. French
authorities are yet to confirm whether this status will change.
However until further information is available travellers to the
affected areas of France are advised to avoid contact with animals
where possible and to seek early medical assessment in the case of
bites, scratches or licks from dogs.

[The risk of contracting rabies by people who have been bitten or
scratched, or had mucous membranes or broken skin licked by any dog
in the risk areas during the relevant periods is low but finite.
Travelers to the areas specified should avoid contact with domestic
and stray cats and dogs and other susceptible animals until the alert
has been cancelled. It will be interesting to see how this incident
affects the rabies-free status of France.
