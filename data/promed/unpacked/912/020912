Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever,
resurfaced in Honnavar taluk [district subdivision] this year [2009].
This was confirmed by taluk medical officer Usha Hasyagar and medical
officer in charge of the Honnavar KFD centre, Vaishali Nayak.

The blood samples of 9 villagers tested positive for the disease,
they said. According to them, 24 villagers have been suffering from
an unknown disease for a few days. Meanwhile, 14 monkeys were found
dead in the forest region near Bailgadde, Mavinhole, Hirebail,
Chikkolli, Darbejaddi, Tolsani, Jinnod and Sigadi villages in the
taluk.

A vaccine is available in the primary health centres at Kharva and
Gersoppa villages, Nayak said. Sources in the health department said
that officers have been appointed in Honnavar taluk to control the
disease. Health workers would visit every house in the affected
villages to create awareness about the disease.

[Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur forest disease
virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_. KFDV was
identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the
Kyasanur forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) state, India. The main
hosts of KFDV are small rodents, but shrews, bats, and monkeys may
also carry the virus. KFD is transmitted from the bite of an infected
tick (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector). Humans can get
this disease from a tick bite or by contact with an infected animal,
such as a sick or recently dead monkey. Larger animals such as goats,
cows, and sheep may become infected with KFD, but they do not have a
role in the transmission of the disease. Furthermore, there is no
evidence of the disease being transmitted via the unpasteurized milk
of any of these animals. It occurs principally in the Shimoga and
Kanara district of Karnataka, India and is common in young adults
exposed during the dry season in the forest.

After an incubation period of 3-8 days, the symptoms of KFD begin
suddenly with fever, headache, severe muscle pain, cough,
dehydration, gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems.
Patients may experience abnormally low blood pressure and low
platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts. After 1-2
weeks of symptoms, some patients recover without complications.
However, in most patients, the illness is biphasic, and the patient
begins experiencing a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the
3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain). The diagnosis is made by virus isolation
from blood or by serologic testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
serologic assay. There are approximately 400-500 cases of KFD per
year with a case fatality rate of 3-5 percent.

Some of this information has been extracted from the CDC fact sheet (see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf>).
The above report mentions the local availability of a vaccine. A
vaccine has not been generally available in the past; further
information would be welcomed.
