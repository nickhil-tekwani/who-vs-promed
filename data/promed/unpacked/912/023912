Two people were exposed to a rabid cat found in the Midlands, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) said Thursday [16 Jul 2020]. The cat -- with wounds of unknown origin -- was found 24 Jun 2020, DHEC officials said in a news release. The animal was discovered near John G. Richards Road and Cottage Lane in the Liberty Hill area of Kershaw County, according to the release.

The people have been told to seek medical care, health officials said.

DHEC said if a pet is found with unknown wounds it could have been exposed to rabies.

On Monday [13 Jul 2020], the cat was taken to DHEC's lab, which confirmed the next day [14 Jul 2020] it had rabies, officials said.

This cat is the 2nd animal in Kershaw County to test positive for rabies in 2020, DHEC said. There have been 68 cases of rabid animals reported in South Carolina this year [2020]. In 2019, one of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina was in Kershaw County, according to the release.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals plenty of space," DHEC's Director of Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division David Vaughan said in the release. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it. Contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator. The possibility of exposure to rabies can occur anywhere, anytime. If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office. An exposure is defined as a bite, a scratch, or contact with saliva or body fluids from an infected, or possibly infected, animal."

Getting pets vaccinated for rabies is the best way to protect against the disease, DHEC said.

If an owner thinks their pet has been exposed to rabies, DHEC officials said they should call during normal business hours or call the after-hours number at other times.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed one person in Charleston County was exposed to a raccoon that tested positive for rabies. The raccoon was found near Chaplins Landing Road and Water Way Lane in the Hollywood area, the agency said. The person exposed has been referred to their healthcare provider.

David Vaughan, the director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division, says you should always give wild and stray animals plenty of space to avoid the risk of getting rabies.

"If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it," he said. "Contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator. The possibility of exposure to rabies can occur anywhere, anytime. If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office. An exposure is defined as a bite, a scratch, or contact with saliva or body fluids from an infected or possibly infected animal."

If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider your pet could have been exposed to rabies and contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Charleston office. To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

DHEC says keeping pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease.

This raccoon is the 15th animal in Charleston County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 70 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020].

Since 2011, South Carolina has averaged approximately 130 positive cases a year.

In 2019, 19 of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Charleston County.

[3] North Carolina: fox, human exposure

A North Carolina woman had a scary encounter with a rabid fox in her own home Sunday night [19 Jul 2020].

[JL] said she was in her bed when she saw the fox come through her dog's doggie door on the patio. She recalled seeing the ears of the fox glide across her room before she came face-to-face with the animal when it jumped on her bed.

"I was praying I would live," [JL] recalled, from the moment the fox jumped on her bed.

It grabbed her by the foot and would not let go until she pried it off of her. She then held it by its neck for more than 12 minutes waiting for police and paramedics to arrive.

"I don't know what else you could do. Maybe throw a pillow at it, or a blanket at it, or something like that," she said.

On Wednesday [22 Jul 2020], animal control confirmed the fox had tested positive for rabies.

[JL] has endured several shots, including a rabies vaccine. She is still in a lot of pain, but is thankful her dog and other neighborhood pets were not hurt.

"I left that door open to the house so she could get in. I don't anymore," she said.

Neighbors in the area told the news station they have seen more foxes coming closer to people's property. Animal control leaders explained it could be the case for a lot of neighborhoods.

The warm weather could be causing more foxes to move around from their natural habits. January through March is typically mating season, so more baby foxes could be walking into neighborhoods. Foxes could also be moving around to find food.

Guilford County Animal Control says this is the 8th case of rabies in 2020.

[This last article should cause us all to look at pet doors that are left open, especially in the night or evening, in a new light. Perhaps it would be best to simply let your pet in and out, as unwanted animals may also avail themselves of this handy entrance to your home. It does not have to be nighttime; this could happen at any time.

Regardless of the risk for rabies, bite wounds can cause serious injury such as nerve or tendon laceration and infection. Your doctor will determine the best way to care for your wound and will also consider how to treat the wound for the best possible cosmetic results.

For many types of bite wounds, immediate gentle irrigation with water or a dilute water povidone-iodine solution has been shown to markedly decrease the risk of bacterial infection. [If you are allergic to iodine, do not use the povidone-iodine solution mentioned here.

Wound cleansing is especially important in rabies prevention since, in animal studies, thorough wound cleansing alone without other postexposure prophylaxis has been shown to markedly reduce the likelihood of rabies.

You should receive a tetanus shot if you have not been immunized in 10 years. Decisions regarding the use of antibiotics and primary wound closure should be decided together with your doctor.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient-assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities.
