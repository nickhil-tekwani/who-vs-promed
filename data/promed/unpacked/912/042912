A mosquito found in a residential area of Menlo Park [California] tested positive for yellow fever.

The discovery prompted a response from vector control, which trapped 3 adult mosquitoes carrying the disease, along with 14 infected larvae.

Yellow fever is typically found in the Southeastern United States.

So far, there had been no reports of humans contracting yellow fever in the area.

[2] San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District response

This [above] information is false. I know because I'm writing from the Vector Control District that serves Menlo Park (San Mateo County). _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found, but no virus has been detected at this time.

[The above unfortunate and inaccurate report on yellow fever in California's San Francisco Bay area requires immediate correction. There is no yellow fever virus in the USA in California or in the southeastern states. The vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, is present, but the yellow fever virus is not.

ProMED thanks Brian Weber for his 1st hand observation and comments. He mentioned that the district has an ongoing intensive surveillance and control campaign to eradicate _A. aegypti_ from the district. ProMED wishes them success.

A map showing the location of the 3 counties in California where _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected can be accessed at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/california.shtml, and a map of California at http://healthmap.org/r/85zY. - Mod.TY]
