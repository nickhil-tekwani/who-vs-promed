The mysterious skin disease, which has affected 215 people in Viet Nam's central Quang Ngai province, is caused by aflatoxin, a toxin produced by fungus in mouldy rice, reported by local Viet Nam News on Tuesday [19 Mar 2013] quoting sources from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health (MOH).

Phan Trong Lan, deputy head of MOH's Preventive Medicine Department, told local media that last Thursday [14 Mar 2013] scientists took samples of rice from families of those infected at Reu village in Ba To district where the disease started to rise, for tests.

Results showed that 100 percent of the infected patients ate mouldy rice, which was contaminated with the toxin 9 times higher than the safe level. The toxic agent even causes liver cancer in [humans].

The local residents' habits of rice-eating were also surveyed. Accordingly, they dry grain before use, but store it in timber barns and do not care about the rice's quality, which often decreases due to moisture.

The disease, which causes the skin to peel off, was first reported in the province in 2011 and it was believed to have been controlled last August [2012]. However, it re-occurred from 19 Feb 2013, infecting 17 and killing one, so far this year.

So far, the disease has affected a total of 215 people of whom 23 died, mainly from Ba To district of central Quang Ngai province, about 730 km [450 mi] south of capital Hanoi, according to MOH.

[The news article above concerns an outbreak in several villages in Ba To, and Son Ha districts, in Quang Ngai province, Viet Nam, on which ProMED previously reported last year (2012) and again this year. Those affected developed an acute febrile illness with loss of appetite and respiratory symptoms followed by a desquamating rash on the hands and feet described as "palmoplantar keratoderma" (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1108406-overview#aw2aab6b), accompanied by liver dysfunction and, in some patients, by multi-organ failure and death. Ulcers on the hands, feet, mouth, back, and abdomen, eye disease, stiffness of the limbs, and miscarriage were also described. Mainly children and young adults have been affected.

The disease is said to have started in April 2011, subsided somewhat between November 2011 and February 2012, and picked up pace again in March and April 2012. This pattern has repeated itself again this year (2013), having abated in the fall of 2012 and recurred in this past month. The disease seems to have relapsed in several patients whose disease remitted last year. The numbers of patients affected and the death toll has varied in the news reports, but one of the news reports says that the disease has caused 24 deaths since beginning in 2011.

Pictures of the rash on the hands and feet of the affected Vietnamese villagers are available at http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2012/4/100698 and http://www.eyedrd.org/2012/04/breakout-of-unknown-skin-disease-has-claimed-27-lives-in-central-vietnam.html.

Prior reports said that WHO and the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) experts had failed to find a cause for this outbreak, but the disease seems to follow a seasonal pattern and recurred after resumption of eating moldy rice and has now been attributed to aflatoxin poisoning. Aflatoxins are produced by many species of _Aspergillus_ species, especially _Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_, that can colonize and contaminate grain before harvest or during storage, especially in a high-humidity environment. High-level aflatoxin exposure produces acute hepatic necrosis, resulting later in cirrhosis and carcinoma of the liver. In developed countries, commercial crops are routinely screened for aflatoxin and food supplies that test over the regulatory limit are considered unsafe for human consumption and destroyed. People living in developing countries may be may be exposed to aflatoxin in food that is not routinely tested for the presence of aflatoxin (http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hsb/chemicals/aflatoxin.htm). An outbreak of acute aflatoxicosis with a case fatality rate of 39 percent occurred in 2004 in Kenya that was attributed to consumption of aflatoxin-contaminated maize; high levels of aflatoxin (up to 8000 ppb) in maize samples were collected from patient households. Similar outbreaks have been reported in other developing countries (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5334a4.htm).
