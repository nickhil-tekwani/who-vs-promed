I haven't had time for a complete review, but this article seems promising:
Fischman HR. J Am Vet Med Assoc 1976 Dec 1;169(11):1207-1. Consideration of
an association between geographic distribution of caves and occurrence of
rabies in foxes.
Establishing a causative relationship for the association between geographic
distribution of caves and the occurrence of rabies in foxes in the United
States will require the demonstration of a plausible biological mechanism
and proof from carefully designed epidemiological studies. Considerable data
implying biological plausibility exists in the form of rabies as an enzootic
disease in bats, bat predation by ground animals, bat migratory patterns,
and several possible virus transmission routes to the fox. Further data
showing development of rabies in the fox following appropriate bat contact
are needed. Evidence leading to the acceptability of a causal relationship
should distinguish between spurious, causal, and indirect hypotheses. An
alternative hypothesis is whether cave areas are superior fox habitats and
harbor far greater populations of foxes than do non cave areas.

At this late date I cannot cite the reference but it appeared in the USA
medical [literature during the 1940's. The case cited was that of an
engineer who was inspecting a Texas cave to appraise the possibility of a
guano mining operation for use as fertilizer. Several of the large caves in
Texas have bat colonies numbering in the millions. The engineer was
definitely not bitten by a bat but did contract rabies which proved fatal.
It was mentioned that he had a "lesion" on his neck prior to entering the
cave but otherwise nothing unusual was noted. It was conjectured at that
time that the infection came from aerosolized bat urine.

I have no information concerning bat urine as a source of infection, but I
do have experience with cave bats and urine [from about 10 years ago. You
get the aerosol effect and in some situations (cave entrances for example
with thousands of bats) it feels like a gentle but steady rain. I am not
aware of a rabies threat posed by this source.

I am not sure of the citation, but I remember reading years ago (10-12)
that it could aerosolize from the guano in caves and that there was a report
(or a couple of reports, can't remember which) of some spelunkers that died
after exposure by this method.

Why through the urine? Probably it could be through the aerosolized spittle
it's more logical.

In response to recent postings on regarding the risk of human rabies from
aerosolized bat urine and other "cryptic" bat exposures I offer these
comments.
Although I am not qualified to address the question of rabies virus titers
in bat urine, to my knowledge, the only instances of aerosol transmission of
rabies virus under natural (i.e., non-laboratory) conditions occurred in
Frio and Lava Caves in Texas during the 1950s and 1960s. Actually,
researchers speculated that the source of aerosolized virus was more likely
bat saliva aerosolized by the bats' vocalizations rather than urine
droplets. At any rate, what is important to note is that the conditions in
these caves (caverns of limited size with high humidity and a million or
more resident free-tailed bats) hardly approximate that of a human dwelling
in which one or a few bats are present.
As interesting as these old reports are, I have a concern that ProMED-mail
readers (especially clinicians) may take home the wrong message from these
postings about cryptic bat exposures i.e., that being in the same room as a
bat automatically constitutes an exposure to rabies (possibly via aerosol)
and may justify post-exposure prophylaxis - not so.
As one who attended the meetings of the National Association of State Public
Health Veterinarians and the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists when this issue was discussed, I recall that the clear sense
of these groups and of the epidemiologists present from the CDC was that the
bat virus variant-induced cases of human rabies with no history of a bat
bite were in all likelihood caused by bites &/or scratches which were so
minor as to go unnoticed, forgotten, or disregarded by the victims.
I can paraphrase the current CDC recommendation on bat exposures as follows:
Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered even in the absence of a
demonstrable bite or scratch, when there is a reasonable probability that
physical contact with a bat may have occurred, and the person cannot
explicitly rule out the possibility of contact with the bat's teeth or
claws. This recommendation is meant to address circumstances like the
sleeping adult who awakens to find a bat attached to his sheets, the parent
who finds a bat hanging from his baby's crib bars, a bat in the same room
with a mentally incompetent person, etc. Obviously, if the bat in question
is tested and found negative, no prophylaxis would be indicated.
There are some in vitro data which suggest that certain bat strain rabies
viruses behave in ways that may permit infection to result from seemingly
"minor" exposures (e.g. good growth in human fibroblasts compared to other
rabies strains). Such findings may explain the epidemiology of these human
rabies cases with cryptic bat exposure.

I think it is quite unlikely that rabies would be transmitted via bat urine.
While there may well be species differences, rabies virus has not been
isolated from un concentrated urine from humans with lab confirmed rabies
(virus was isolated from the urine sediment in one of two patients for whom
it was attempted). The data [that I refer to are summarized in Rev. Inf.
Dis. 1987;9(3):511-518.
Transmission to humans via aerosol is fairly well documented in two
laboratory accidents in which the victims were exposed to high
concentrations of virus.
Transmission of rabies via aerosol is suspected to have occurred in Frio
Cave here in Texas. The original investigation report notes that the air in
the cave was noticeably wet with an aerosol. However, I have always assumed
that the infectious component of that aerosol was respiratory secretions
from the bats, not urine. Incidentally, the victims of this cave had active
cases of dermatitis, so the exposure could have been through non-intact skin
rather than by inhalation.

A number of human rabies cases associated with a bat variant of rabies virus
but no known bat bite has led to speculations of a more nebulous route of
exposure. Our experience in Colorado suggests that most of these cases
probably got rabies the old-fashion way, they got bitten by something rabid.
The lack of a bite history is just that, a lack of the history, not of a
bite.
Bats have been the only endemic rabies host in Colorado for over two
decades. During this period 15% (range 11-20%) of bats submitted annually
tested positive and between 10-20 persons underwent post-exposure
prophylaxis for potential exposures. We have recently compiled 20 years of
human/bat exposure data which we are planning to submit for publication in
the next couple of months. Without going into great detail until this data
can be properly peer-reviewed, there are a few findings that are applicable
to this ProMED-mail discussion.
Most of our bat/human encounters could be classified into one of twelve
general scenarios. Approximately half of all exposures were preventable,
usually resulting from a person handling a bat. Several factors contributed
to an exposed person not seeking medical attention.
1) The bite wounds were very minor, resembling not much more than a
pin-prick. There were cases were a person watched a bat bite them and yet
within a couple of hours no wound was visible. In some cases the physician
questioned whether a break in the skin had actually occurred or was severe
enough to require treatment.
2) Lack of knowledge, or a belief to the contrary, that bats represent a
rabies risk. Conservation groups have been actively publicizing the
benefits of bats while dismissing or downplaying the rabies risk. A CO state
agency reference booklet on bats includes the statement that "They {bats}
are not reservoirs of rabies" and provides statistics downplaying the
risk.
They were several cases in which persons bitten by a bat did not seek
medical attention until relaying the story to someone aware of the risk.
This resulted in treatment delays of up to a month. Last year a woman with a
definite bite declined treatment despite extensive efforts to change her
mind. She elected to treat herself with herbal teas. This only represents
cases we eventually heard about, we have no estimate on how many unreported
exposure have occurred.
3) Fear of treatment or getting in trouble, especially true for children and
adolescents. In one incident a group of children passed around a rabid bat.
One boy steadfastly denied handling it, although the other children all said
he not only handled but that it bit him. Had other children not been
around?
These treatment barriers, a potentially long incubation period due to a low
viral inoculum, a study demonstrating efficient viral replication of
silver-haired bat rabies virus in the dermis (Morimoto, K, et al,
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), May, 1996) and the
difficulty in obtaining a accurate history postmortem, provides a
reasonable explanation for human cases in which a bite history was not
obtained. This would also be consistent with the accumulated knowledge on
rabies virus transmission. If bat urine/guano is found to be associated with
rabies transmission we will have to add rabies vaccine to our school
immunization law as we have bats flying overhead in every community in the
state.

I am always amazed that certain basic studies have not been done with
important infectious disease agents, including rabies. I received a message
from someone at CDC/Atlanta telling me that studies of the infectivity of
bat urine have not been done.
What is needed is a logical, organized, and thorough study of bat urine,
saliva, feces, etc. I don't even know whether bats urinate WHILE they
are flying. Anyway, the work is not being done. I suggest that someone
with appropriate facilities and experience submit a grant proposal to
obtain funding for such a study.
