Crenshaw Co. woman undergoing rabies treatments after bobcat attack
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wounds on [the victim's] arm and hip are evidence of what she went through during a terrifying encounter with a wild animal. A rabid bobcat attacked her in her front yard, biting her twice as she tried to get it off of her. "I'm very sore, I'm hurting," she said. "It's rough but I'm dealing with it. I'm tough."

It happened Monday [13 Jul 2015] around noon at her home on Sweetwater Road in the Sardis community, located several miles off of Highway 331 between Highland Home and Luverne in Crenshaw County [Alabama].

When she looked out the window, she initially thought she saw a stray dog in the front yard with her own dogs. When she got a better look at the animal, she realized it was a bobcat and sprung to action, worried about the safety of her dogs outside. She says she underestimated what she was up against as she ventured near the animal to save her beloved pets. "I wasn't as scared as what I should have been. I should have been a lot more terrified and I wasn't. I wasn't thinking that the cat was sick, nothing like that. I didn't think. I just wanted my dogs back inside," she said.

The bobcat took off towards a drainage pipe that runs under her driveway, and she worked to get her dogs out of harm's way. Then, she and her best friend went to track the bobcat because they knew something wasn't right with it appearing in the middle of the day. She says she was worried that it could attack her pets and she wanted it away from her home. "It's not normal for a cat to be in the yard, not afraid. Normally, a cat runs, especially in the day time," she said.

Her screams alerted her best friend, and he came running to help. As he went to one end of the drainage pipe to locate the bobcat, the animal ran out the other end of the pipe and attacked [the victim]. "This cat came straight out of this drainage pipe and just jumped full force and latched onto my arm. And I'm screaming, turning, moving every way I can trying to get it off of me," she said. "[My friend] is terrified to shoot because he doesn't want to shoot me. He just starts beating it with the stock of the gun. He knocked him off of me and as soon at the cat came off, he landed on his hind legs and jumped straight back on me and I threw my hands up and it latched onto my hip." With her adrenaline pumping, she says she didn't feel any pain when the bobcat's teeth and claws tore into her arm and side.

"[My friend] gets him off of me and tells me to run so I take off running and he shoots him. He shot him 4 times with a .22. But every time he shot him, this cat just started coming at him. Then [his] gun just locks up on him. He can't shoot anymore. He just hit him again and again with the gun and stunned him. He ran and got a pistol and shot it," she said. "All of this happened in 10 minutes from the time I saw him out the window to the time he was dead." The bobcat, estimated to be around 30 pounds, later tested positive for rabies and [the victim] is undergoing rabies treatments. She says she will receive 9 shots in 14 days.

The attack has left residents in the area on guard and on the lookout for any animals that look suspicious. The short-tailed cats are common in Alabama but attacks are rare, officials said.

A neighbor spotted the bobcat earlier Monday [13 Jul 2015] at his father-in-law's house next door to [the victim's] home. [The neighbor] was alarmed when he saw the animal clawing and jumping at a glass door trying to attack a little dog inside. "You usually don't see bobcats during the day or even at all but especially not up around houses in the middle the of day. And then usually when they see people they get spooked," he said. [The neighbor] and his father-in-law tried to locate the bobcat and even went down to [the victim's] house to check the area but they lost sight of it. He says the close-knit community is rallying around [the victim] as she recovers from the attack.

"I know that on Facebook, a lot of people are praying for her and voicing their support and people have gone by to check on her," he said. If she wasn't turned to her side, it would have got her on her neck so she was very lucky. Everybody down here is about to start carrying weapons in their vehicles just for that reason."

Authorities are asking residents to be on alert in the wake of the incident. "A message from Sheriff Powell to the people of Crenshaw County, he wants people to keep an eye out and if they see something that looks odd, just call the game warden or call the sheriff's office and we'll check it out. We don't want anyone else getting bit or hurt, especially children," said Mike Johnson, chief investigator for the Crenshaw County Sheriff's Office.

[The victim], meanwhile, is healing from her wounds and her horrifying ordeal. "I'm blessed. My dogs weren't hurt and they're blessed. It was very scary. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't get it out of my head," she said. "I hope this never happens to anyone else -- no kids, no dogs, nobody."

[This attack carried all the marks of a probable rabies infected animal: species out in the open at a time and place of its normal behavior; aggressive instead of quietly and quickly retreating -- but remember, not all infected animals are "rabid." Some will be paralytic and comatose. Something to be aware of when tempted by a possible taxidermy trophy.

Crenshaw County is in south central Alabama, not far from the Florida border; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/alabama_90.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
