A 59-year-old man from Jalan Batu Kawa-Matang is the 7th person to be infected by rabies, which has claimed the lives of 5 people in the state.

The man was reportedly bitten by a dog at his residential area on [Mon 27 Nov 2017]. He only sought treatment for his injuries at a private clinic here, which did not refer his case to any government health facilities for vaccination.

Health Ministry director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the man started developing body aches and weakness in his legs before he was admitted to a private hospital on [Wed 24 Jan 2018].

"He was admitted to the Sarawak General Hospital (SGH) the following day. The case showed symptoms of hydrophobia, hallucination and aggressiveness.

"Results from a lab test on [Fri 26 Jan 2018], showed that the man had contracted the virus," he said in a statement today [Sat 27 Jan 2018].

Hisham reminded private hospitals and clinics to adhere to the guidelines on handling patients suffering from bites of dog and other animals in the wake of the outbreak, which was detected on [Fri 30 Jun 2017].

State Natural Disaster Management Committee secretariat said private clinics and hospitals must refer cases of people bitten by dogs and other animals to government health facilities.

This was to allow patients to receive proper treatment or anti-rabies vaccination if necessary.

"Sarawak Health Department will issue a notice to remind private hospitals and clinics to immediately refer cases of people bitten by dogs and other animals to the health authorities for further checks and treatment.

"The department will also issue a warning letter against a clinic, which had failed follow the guideline," said the secretariat in reference to the clinic which had treated the latest rabies victim.

Hisham and the secretariat did not elaborate on the actions that could be taken against private hospitals and clinics, which failed to follow the guideline.

A total of 4 of the 5 rabies victims, were children age between 4 and 7. The 5th casualty was a man, 52, from Kampung Remun, Serian.

The 6th infected person, a 7-year-old boy from Kampung Kuala in Gedong, Serian, is currently in critical condition and has been placed on life support at the SGH since [Thu 3 Aug 2017].

To date, the secretariat said a total of 28 areas in the Serian, Samarahan, Sri Aman, Kuching and Sibu divisions had been declared as rabies-affected spot.

"Active Case Detection exercise by the State Health Department to detect cases of people with history of being bitten by dogs and other animals is on-going.

"As of now, a total of 6158 cases of people with dog bite history have been detected and they have been given the proper treatment," said the secretariat.

[The discovery of rabies circulating in East Malaysia, a territory regarded earlier as rabies-free, was unfortunately made by human sentinels. The Sarawak General Hospital in Kuching notified on [Thu 22 Jun 2017] rabies in 3 children from the village Serian. This led the veterinary authorities to perform surveillance in the dog and cat populations in Serian. According to their findings, as initially notified to the OIE on [Tue 11 Jul 2017] (see 20170712.5170101), out of the 461 owned dogs, 29 were found rabies positive; out of the 782 owned cats, 3 were found rabies positive. The diagnosis was based upon direct fluorescent antibody (FAT) test, performed on all samples on [Sat 8 Jul 2017] by Malaysia's National laboratory, namely the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI).

Since then, the event continued, affecting animals and, unfortunately, costing additional human lives. The Malaysian authorities submitted 3 follow-up reports so far, the most recent one on [Fri 3 Nov 2017]. The summary of the event, as of the said date, is the following:

Total outbreaks = 42 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/ Slaughtered
Cats/ 3533/ 10/ 0/ 20/ 0
Dogs/ 4664/ 129/ 1/ 134/ 0

Epidemiological comments: The affected districts have a border with Kalimantan, Indonesia.

On top of the surveillance activities and population management, particularly of unowned animals, rabies vaccination of all owned dogs and cats in East Malaysia as a preventive measure was undertaken. The number of vaccinations in Sarawak, as of 3 Nov 2017, was reportedly as follows:

Species/ Number Vaccinated/ Details
Dogs/ 33 384/ Mass vaccination
Cats/ 7904/ Mass vaccination

The above and additional information, including a map showing the locations of the 42 outbreaks, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000024800_20171106_172020.pdf

It may be assumed that vaccinations and other control measures have been continued since; an update is anticipated.
