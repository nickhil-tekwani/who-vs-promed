CDC recommends that consumers do not eat any products produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. Restaurants, and retailers should not sell or serve them.

On 28 Aug 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. conducted a voluntary recall of mung bean sprouts due to possible _Listeria monocytogenes_ contamination after FDA isolated the pathogen from samples as a result of a routine assignment.

During FDA inspections of the Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. facility in August and October 2014, investigators observed unsanitary conditions, many of which were present during both inspections.

Whole genome sequences of the _Listeria_ strains isolated from mung bean sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. and environmental isolates collected at the production facility were found to be highly related to sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from 5 people who became ill from June through August 2014. These 5 ill people were reported from 2 states: Illinois (4) and Michigan (1). All ill people were hospitalized. Two deaths were reported. The 2 people interviewed reported eating bean sprouts.

Although limited information is available about the specific sprout products that the ill people consumed, the whole genome sequencing findings, together with the sprout consumption history of 2 patients and inspection findings at the firm, suggest that these illnesses could be related to products from Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. This investigation is ongoing, and new information will be provided when available.

Investigation
-----------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from mung bean sprouts and sprout irrigation water samples obtained during a routine assignment on 13 Aug 2014 at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. Based on this finding, FDA conducted an inspection of the facility from 12 Aug 2014, through 3 Sep 2014, and isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 25 environmental swabs obtained during the inspection. FDA also issued a report with 12 inspectional observations, citing the firm for numerous unsanitary conditions and poor equipment maintenance.

On 28 Aug 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. agreed to conduct a voluntary recall of mung bean sprouts and notified customers by telephone. Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. ceased production of sprouts on 28 Aug 2014, and resumed production on 15 Sep 2014 after _Listeria monocytogenes_ was not identified in finished product. From 7-31 Oct 2014, FDA re-inspected the facility and identified _Listeria monocytogenes_ in 9 environmental swabs. FDA investigators issued another report to the firm, noting 12 inspectional observations involving unsanitary conditions and poor equipment maintenance. Nine of these observations had persisted from the previous inspection.

On 14 Oct 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. ceased production of all products except mung bean and soy bean sprouts. FDA is working with the company to ensure that they do not produce sprouts until FDA has adequate assurances that this persistent and dangerous strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ is sufficiently controlled. Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is working to embargo all product[s] at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. and the other wholesalers that presently have product. In addition, IDPH has asked local health departments to contact facilities in their jurisdictions that have received the product to have the facilities either hold the product or destroy per the CDC recommendations.

FDA performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the isolates from mung bean sprouts and environmental samples from Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. to further characterize the _Listeria_ isolates. Compared with PFGE, WGS provides a clearer distinction of genetic differences among _Listeria_ isolates (strains that are highly related by WGS are more likely to have a common source).

Public health investigators used PFGE and WGS to identify cases of illness that were caused by highly related strains and therefore possibly related to products made at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. This included data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network of state and local public health laboratories, CDC, and federal food regulatory laboratories that perform molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

Whole-genome sequences of _Listeria_ strains isolated from 5 ill people were found to be highly related to sequences of the _Listeria_ strain isolated from mung bean sprouts produced by Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. These ill people have been reported from 2 states: Illinois (4) and Michigan (1). They became ill from June through August 2014. All 5 people were hospitalized, and 2 deaths were reported. Two of the 5 people were interviewed, and both reported consuming bean sprouts in the month before becoming ill.

The high degree of genetic similarity between isolates from ill people and from mung bean sprouts and environmental samples collected at Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. shows that the food was contaminated with a strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that can cause serious illness. Although limited information is available about the specific sprout products that the ill people consumed, the whole genome sequencing findings, together with the sprout consumption history of 2 patients and inspection findings at the firm, suggest that these illnesses could be related to products from Wholesome Soy Products, Inc.

CDC, the states involved, and FDA continue to work closely on this ongoing investigation, and new information will be provided when available.

[The news report above says that _Listeria monocytogenes_ was isolated from mung bean sprouts and sprout irrigation water on 13 Aug 2014 at Wholesome Soy Products; and the company ceased production and recalled mung bean sprouts on 28 Aug 2014. The company resumed production on 15 Sep 2014 after _L. monocytogenes_ was not identified in finished product. However, from 7-31 Oct 2014, on re-inspection of the facility by the FDA, _L. monocytogenes_ was again identified in 9 environmental swabs, but the news report above then says, "On 14 Oct 2014, Wholesome Soy Products, Inc. ceased production of all products except mung bean and soy bean sprouts." So, potentially contaminated sprouts may again be available in stores. Clarification on this matter would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _L. monocytogenes_ transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

Listeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).

The average annual incidence of invasive listeriosis in the United States was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population for 2009-2011, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) (deaths and fetal losses) of 21 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w).
