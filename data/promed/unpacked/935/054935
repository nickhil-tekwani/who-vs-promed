BSE: IFST POSITION STATEMENT, SEPTEMBER 1997
********************************************

IFST has today published a new Update of its Position Statement on BSE.
It intends to publish more new Position Statements and updates, on various
topics, in the coming months.
Up to now, the full texts of new Position Statements and Updates, in
addition to
being placed on the IFST Web site, have been posted on relevant listservs and
newsgroups. This has inevitably resulted in multiple subscribers receiving
more
than one copy -- sometimes several copies -- of each lengthy document (and
Updates tend to increase in length to take account of more recent research),
whether the topic is of direct interest to them or not.
Accordingly, it has been decided to restrict posting on listservs and
newsgroups
to brief notifications of new or updated Position Statements, with a reminder
that the full texts on all new and existing Position Statements can be
accessed
at and, if desired downloaded from, the IFST Web site at
