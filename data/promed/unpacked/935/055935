A major outbreak of typhoid fever in Pakistan may have been caused by a highly drug-resistant microbe, scientists have warned. Research by the Wellcome Sanger Institute has shown that the typhoid strain behind the outbreak, which began in Hyderabad in Pakistan in November 2016 and has since spread, has acquired an extra piece of DNA that renders it resistant to multiple antibiotics.

"It is significant because it marks the 1st time we have seen such high levels of drug resistance in typhoid," said Elizabeth Klemm of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, who co-led research carried out in collaboration with Public Health England and Aga Khan University in Karachi. "Increasing drug resistance means we have fewer drugs available to effectively treat the infection."

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by the bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ serovar [or serotype] Typhi. The bacteria, spread by contaminated food and water, is highly contagious, and spreads through communities with poor sanitation. Symptoms include fever, stomach pain, headache and constipation or diarrhea. If left untreated, the infection can be fatal.

There is no official information available on case numbers or deaths in Pakistan, but local media reports claim more than 800 cases of drug-resistant typhoid were detected in Hyderabad alone over a 10-month period between 2016 and 2017. An emergency vaccination campaign is now under way.

"There have been cases in Sindh province and other parts of Pakistan," said Klemm. "One case was found in the UK from a patient who had recently been in Pakistan."

The Cambridge-based Wellcome Sanger Institute was approached by scientists at Aga Khan University last spring with a request for genetic analysis of samples. It emerged that the H58 strain, previously linked to drug-resistant cases, was behind the outbreak. Further analysis revealed the strain had gained an extra strand of bacterial DNA - a plasmid - that increased its resistance to antimicrobials. The results were published in the scientific journal mBio.

Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust, a London-based biomedical research charity, said the findings were a clear warning that "treatment options for typhoid are running out" and focusing on prevention was now vital.

"We have seen other resistant typhoid strains spread globally in the past," said Klemm. "We have the ability to prevent typhoid by vaccination and improving water, sanitation and hygiene. A new typhoid vaccine has been recently approved by the WHO. The increased levels of drug resistance in typhoid add urgency to the call for vaccination."

The US Agency for International Development has backed a vaccination drive in Sindh by donating 250 000 syringes for a campaign to immunize children in 2 towns in Hyderabad, Latifabad and Qasimabad.

mBio 9:e00105-18. https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00105-18.

"Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa and are often associated with the dominant H58 haplotype. Reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is also widespread, and sporadic cases of resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin have also been reported. Here, we report the 1st large-scale emergence and spread of a novel _S._ Typhi clone harboring resistance to 3 1st-line drugs (chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) as well as fluoroquinolones and 3rd-generation cephalosporins in Sindh, Pakistan, which we classify as extensively drug resistant (XDR).

Over 300 XDR typhoid cases have emerged in Sindh, Pakistan, since November 2016. Additionally, a single case of travel-associated XDR typhoid has recently been identified in the United Kingdom. Whole-genome sequencing of over 80 of the XDR isolates revealed remarkable genetic clonality and sequence conservation, identified a large number of resistance determinants, and showed that these isolates were of haplotype H58. The XDR _S._ Typhi clone encodes a chromosomally located resistance region and harbors a plasmid encoding additional resistance elements, including the blaCTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and carrying the qnrS fluoroquinolone resistance gene. This antimicrobial resistance-associated IncY plasmid exhibited high sequence identity to plasmids found in other enteric bacteria isolated from widely distributed geographic locations. This study highlights 3 concerning problems: the receding antimicrobial arsenal for typhoid treatment, the ability of _S._ Typhi to transform from MDR to XDR in a single step by acquisition of a plasmid, and the ability of XDR clones to spread globally."

Unlike most serotypes of _S. enterica_ that are zoonotic in nature and cause usually non-invasive and self-limited infections which resolve even without specific antimicrobial therapy, _S._ Typhi is a pure human pathogen and often causes bacteremia with a substantial amount more morbidity and mortality. The evolution of haplotype H58 with its promiscuous ability to acquired increasing numbers of antimicrobial resistance bearing genetic elements is a major concern and underscores both the utilization of effective vaccination and the development of newer effective antimicrobials.
