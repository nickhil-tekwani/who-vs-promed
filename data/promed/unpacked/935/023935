In French Polynesia, 9 people are now reported to have died from chikungunya in an outbreak which is estimated to have affected about 40 000 people.

The World Health Organisation says the epidemic has hit several countries and is being described as explosive in its development.

Samoan health authorities say there have been 3135 cases since the end of July [2014] and New Caledonia has 30 confirmed cases with 2 hospitalisations and no deaths.

The WHO says the chikungunya outbreak is also still ongoing in American Samoa and Tokelau.

Tonga's Director of Health says an outbreak of chikungunya in April [2014] that infected about 10 000 people throughout Tonga started in Ha'apai after assistance arrived for victims of Cyclone Ian [January 2014]. He believes the virus was brought there by foreign visitors.

[Terming this outbreak as explosive is not an exaggeration. The 14 Dec 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no 20141215.3033248) indicated that there was an estimated 35 000 cases in French Polynesia, and now, a week later, the case number has increased to an estimated 40 000. Similar increases have occurred on the other affected islands mentioned above. In the absence of an available vaccine, avoidance of mosquito bites and aggressive mosquito vector control are the only measures available to reduce transmission of the virus.
