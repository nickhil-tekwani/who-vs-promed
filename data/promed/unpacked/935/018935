[The 3 reported RVF outbreaks are located in 3 separate south-western districts of Uganda (Mbarara, Isingiro, Lyantonde), facing the territories of 2 neighboring countries, Tanzania and Rwanda. According to media reports, Rwanda has been suffering RVF cases in animals since June 2018; this is in line with recent media reports from Uganda, stating that the disease was already introduced into the Isingiro district in late June 2018 (see archive no. 20180817.5966611).

The Uganda Radio Network published information on a confirmed human case on Fri 29 Jun 2018 (archive no. 20180701.5884295); additional human cases in Uganda were reported by the WHO several days later. These cases had likely been preceded by (hitherto, not recorded) diseased ruminants (sheep, goats, cattle).

Recent media report from Uganda addressed the role of cattle meat (beef) as a source of RVF infection in consumers. Illegal slaughter of animals and the sale of meat that has not undergone ante- and post-mortem veterinary inspection is obviously potentially harmful to consumers due to various meat-borne pathogens, toxins, etc. According to experts' view, endorsed by the relevant international organisations (WHO, OIE, FAO), meat consumption, in contrast to blood and milk consumption, is generally not known to be an RVF risk factor. Those engaged in the slaughtering process, as well as others in close contact with infected animals, their organs, and secretions (e.g., veterinarians, farmers) may be exposed to infected blood, either directly or as aerosol, getting "occupationally" infected.

Article 8.15.11. of OIE's Terrestrial code has been phrased accordingly to facilitate, under detailed conditions, international trade in fresh meat and meat products, even if they come from countries or zones that are not free from RVF infection. The article says the following:

"Veterinary authorities should require the presentation of an international veterinary certificate attesting that the entire consignment of meat comes from
- ruminants that showed no clinical sign of RVF within 24 hours before slaughter;
- ruminants that were slaughtered in an approved slaughterhouse/abattoir and were subjected to ante- and post-mortem inspections with favourable results;
- carcasses that were submitted to maturation at a temperature above 2 deg C [36 deg F] for a minimum period of 24 hours following slaughter."

The above OIE "immediate notification" from Uganda says that RVF vaccination in Uganda is "prohibited." This policy deserves to be explained. - Mod.AS
