Since [Fri 23 Aug 2019], the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has received reports of 5 new confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and 4 new suspect cases in counties where VSV had been previously confirmed.

The newly confirmed and suspect premises are under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses and cattle will be monitored by regulatory and authorized veterinarians until premises are eligible for quarantine release 14 days after clinical VSV signs are observed.

Since the last VSV situation update of 23 Aug 2019:
Bastrop County: 1 new confirmed positive, 0 new suspect premises
Bell County: 0 new confirmed positive, 1 new suspect premises
Dallas County: 1 new confirmed positive, 0 new suspect premises
Ellis County: 3 new confirmed positive, 1 new suspect premises
Guadalupe County: 0 new confirmed positive, 1 new suspect premises
Williamson County: 0 new confirmed positive, 1 new suspect premises

Premises that have laboratory diagnostic confirmation of VSV are categorized as confirmed-positive premises. Once a county is confirmed as VSV-positive, new premises presenting with clinical signs of VSV in that county are not required to be tested for confirmation of the disease, but the premises will be quarantined and classified as a suspect premises.

The 2019 VSV outbreak began on 21 Jun 2019, when the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the first VSV-positive premises in Kinney County, Texas. All cases of VSV had been found on equine premises until 30 Jul 2019, when the 1st case of VSV was confirmed in cattle in Gonzales County. New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming broke with VSV cases confirmed by NVSL.

To date, 168 premises in 36 Texas counties have been quarantined for VSV. Currently affected counties include Bastrop, Bell, Coleman, Collin, Dallas, Eastland, Ellis, Hood, McLennan, Palo Pinto, Parker, Taylor, Travis, and Williamson. Of the 168 premises quarantined, 140 have been released.

Texas VSV quarantine summary as of 30 Aug 2019 [see chart at source URL for numbers by county].

Several states are imposing enhanced entry requirements on Texas livestock due to the VSV cases. For information, contact the state of destination. For a list of state animal health offices, visit https://www.usaha.org/upload/Federal%20and%20State%20Health/STATE_ANIMAL_HEALTH_OFFICIALS%20-%20Copy%201.pdf.

If you suspect your client's horse has VSV, contact your TAHC region office for paperwork, procedures, and important sample submission information.

What equine and cattle owners need to know:
- VSV is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle.
- In the past decade, southwestern and western states have experienced a number of VSV outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways.
- VSV normally has an incubation period of 2-8 days before the infected animal develops blisters that swell and burst, leaving painful sores. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by blood-feeding insects.
- If VSV is confirmed, infected animals are quarantined for 14 days after clinical signs of lesions are observed. This short-term quarantine helps prevent the movement of animals and the spread of the disease to other premises, fairs, or markets.

Strategies for preventing VSV:
Even with the best defensive measures, VSV could infect a herd. However, these tips may help protect livestock:
- Control biting flies.
- Keep equine animals stalled or under a roof at night to reduce exposure to flies.
- Keep stalls clean.
- Don't visit a ranch that's under quarantine for VSV. Wait until the animals have healed.

TAHC sends out VSV updates every Friday, and all cases will be reported to the Equine Disease Communication Center.

[2] USDA update
Date: Mon 9 Sep 2019

On 5 Sep 2019, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued its latest situation report about vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-affected states and counties. Since its last situation report on 29 Aug 2019, the agency identified 42 new VSV-affected premises, with 11 confirmed positive and 31 suspect.

Newly infected counties (with number of confirmed positive or suspect premises) include
Colorado
- Dolores (1 confirmed)
Nebraska
- Morrill (1 confirmed)
Texas
- Hill (1 confirmed)
Wyoming
- Big Horn (1 confirmed)
- Park (1 confirmed positive, 6 suspect)

Also since the 29 Aug 2019 situation report, the following confirmed or suspect premises have been released from quarantine:
- Colorado: 98
- Nebraska: 3
- New Mexico: 2
- Texas: 18
- Utah: 6
- Wyoming: 6

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The southwestern and western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

[This is the Indiana strain of the virus. It will likely continue until there is a freeze, hopefully killing the insects most likely transmitting this disease.

It is a big deal, as the lesions resemble those of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), so each case must be carefully investigated. FMD does not affect horses, whereas VSV can affect horses, cattle, alpaca, goats, and sheep. - Mod.TG
