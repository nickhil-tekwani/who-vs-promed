https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/number-of-covid-19-cases-in-iran-tops-55000-883602.html


The number of COVID-19 cases in Iran has increased by 2560 over the past 24 hours to a total of 55 743 cases, including 3452 fatalities, the Health Ministry's spokesman said on Saturday [4 Apr 2020].

"Over the past 24 hours, we have confirmed 2560 new cases of the novel coronavirus infection in the country. It brings the toll to 55 743," Kianush Jahanpur told the IRINN TV channel.

According to the spokesman, 19 736 patients have recovered from the coronavirus. "Unfortunately, 158 people have died over the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 3452," Jahanpur said.

Iran's record-high daily increase in COVID-19 cases has so far been 3186.

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 Mar [2020]. To date, the global COVID-19 toll has exceeded 1.1 million cases with over 58 000 fatalities, according to statistics compiled by the Johns Hopkins University.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain has been rapidly accelerating. As of today (4 Apr 2020), totals of 124 736 cases and 11 744 deaths have been reported, up from 117 710 cases and 10 935 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. It is now 2nd globally behind the USA, in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for increasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily. - Mod.UBA

[6] Microneedle array delivered recombinant coronavirus vaccines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Background
Coronaviruses pose a serious threat to global health as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection.

Methods
We 1st generated codon-optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus-specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines.

Findings
Here we describe the development of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA-delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA-delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization.

Interpretation
MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA-delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.

[Microneedle arrays (MN) are minimally invasive devices that painlessly bypass the skin's stratum corneum, which is the principal barrier to topically applied drugs. MN (50-900 micrometre in height, up to 2000 MN per square centimetre) have been extensively investigated in recent years as a means to enhance transdermal drug and vaccine delivery. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3627464/)

As mentioned in the report above, the researchers used a new approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency. This array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the SARS-CoV-2 S protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest. The patch is applied similarly to a plaster, and then the needles, made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces, dissolve into the skin. Furthermore, according to the vaccine developers, the system is highly scalable. The protein pieces are manufactured by a "cell factory" -- multiple layers of cultured cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 S protein -- that can be stacked further to multiply yield. Purifying the protein can be conducted at industrial scale. Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mould using a centrifuge. Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it is needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage. (https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/news/116290/novel-microneedle-array-developed-to-deliver-covid-19-vaccine-to-mice/)

This sounds extremely promising. The use of MN-mediated vaccine delivery for SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens will hold immense potential for expanding access to vaccines, particularly to access populations in developing countries. - Mod.UBA]
