The infection of a trapper with bubonic plague in the Worland area this
year was an isolated incident, state health officials said. Lab tests on
animal and insect samples determined the disease is not widespread in the
wild animal populations in the Washakie County.
Fleas and blood were gathered from animals across Washakie County after a
man was infected with bubonic plague while trapping coyotes with his dog in
January.
"We didn't find any large numbers of animals positive with plague, which
was kind of what we were mainly looking for," said Dr. Karl Musgrave, state
chronic disease epidemiologist.
"We will continue to monitor the area up there, however, for any large
die-offs of animals," he said.
Untreated cases of plague are often fatal, according to state health
officers. In the Worland case, the patient was treated and released from
the hospital.
Even with the latest infection, Musgrave said the risk of contracting
plague in Wyoming remains low.
Since 1970, there have been 4 human cases of plague diagnosed in Wyoming,
he said. Two of those cases were in Washakie County. Health officials said
there are about 13 reported cases of plague each year in the United States.

[_Yersinia pestis_ is the agent responsible for causing bubonic plague.
Endemic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the western USA and several other
areas of the world. Fleas are the vectors primary responsible for
spreading _Y. pestis_ from these reservoirs, although contact with infected
rabbit carcasses has been a significant source of infection for man during
the winter. Throughout history, outbreaks of human plague involving rats in
densely populated agricultural or urban areas have occurred when rats
commingled with infected sylvatic rodents. - Mod.TG
