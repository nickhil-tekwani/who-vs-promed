Chikungunya has resurfaced in the Balochistan coastal towns of Gwadar and Pasni, and as many as 472 patients are suspected to have contracted the disease in Gwadar district alone over the past 2 months, a report jointly compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Balochistan health department confirmed on [Sun 26 Mar 2017].

The disease's occurrence was jointly investigated by the provincial health department and the WHO in Gwadar district, which compiled a report stating that the disease was first detected in the district in January [2017].

Between [January and 17 Mar 2017], at least 472 patients were suspected to be suffering from the disease, and its incidence is increasing.

According to health department officials, chikungunya is not a life threatening disease but considered to be a major threat associated with the transmission of dengue fever, transmitted by the same _Aedes_ vector mosquito.

"Since we had dengue occurrence last year [2016] in the same district, we can forecast (another) dengue incidence in the same district, which may possibly spread to other districts such as Lasbela and Kech," said the report compiled by the health department.

It stated that WHO's technical team made house-to-house visits in the presence of Dr Dawood Riaz in Gwadar and Pasni, searching for active cases, adding that most of the population was found to be affected by this disease.

WHO is working with provincial health departments to finalise an action plan for stopping the spread of this arboviral disease.

The World Health Organization is also involved in formulating short-term chikungunya and dengue incidence control plans, controlling the spread of chikungunya, and prevention of impending dengue incidence in southern districts of Balochistan.

Frequent travel to Karachi was cited as the main cause of chikungunya occurrence because of the area's proximity to the Sindh megapolis. Most people, the report stated, travelled to Karachi for trade, study, tourism, and to meet their relatives.

Dengue first occurred in Karachi in 2011, and all confirmed cases were known to have travelled to Karachi till 2015. In 2016, the 1st cases of the disease were detected with no travel history to Karachi.

Taking action on the occurrence of chikungunya in the coastal towns of Balochistan, Health Minister Mir Rehmat Saleh Baloch and Secretary of Health Asmatullah Kakar dispatched a team of doctors to tackle the situation.

The Minister of Health said that the healthcare of the people is amongst the government's top priorities, and no negligence would be tolerated in this regard. He said that a team of doctors was ordered to be dispatched under the direct supervision of the director-general of health following the occurrence of the disease.

[The news report above mentions a total of 472 suspected cases of chikungunya in coastal towns of Balochistan province. However, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases, based on data shared from the National Institute of Health Islamabad is as follows:

Location: samples received / Positive
Gwadar: 32 / 21
Lasbela: 7 / 6
Total: 39 / 27

The statement regarding 'resurfacing of chikungunya' as early as January 2017 is possibly based on suspected case numbers, since the 1st laboratory confirmed cases were reported in March 2017.

Travel to Karachi, Sindh, has been named as the underlying cause for chikungunya cases in Balochistan. However, as dengue has been reported from most districts of Baluchistan and the vector is endemic, detection of indigenous cases in these districts is hardly surprising.

Both _A. aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_ have been implicated in large outbreaks of chikungunya. Whereas _A. aegypti_ is confined within the tropics and sub-tropics, _A. albopictus_ also occurs in temperate and even cold temperate regions. In recent decades _A. albopictus_ has spread from Asia to become established in areas of Africa, Europe and the Americas (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/).

The species _A. albopictus_ thrives in a wider range of water-filled breeding sites than _A. aegypti_, including coconut husks, cocoa pods, bamboo stumps, tree holes, and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as vehicle tyres and saucers beneath plant pots. This diversity of habitats explains the abundance of _A. albopictus_ in rural as well as periurban areas and shady city parks.

_A. aegypti_ is more closely associated with human habitation and uses indoor breeding sites, including flower vases, water storage vessels, and concrete water tanks in bathrooms, as well as the same artificial outdoor habitats as _A. albopictus_. The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya as well as for other diseases that these species transmit. Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities. During outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill flying mosquitoes, applied to surfaces in and around containers where the mosquitoes land, and used to treat water in containers to kill the immature larvae.

For protection during outbreaks of chikungunya, clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) or icaridin (also known as picaridin, 1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropyl ester). For those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, or sick or older people, insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.

Basic precautions should be taken by people travelling to risk areas and these include use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering. - Mod.UBA
