Cases were found of patients having both mosquito-borne diseases chikungunya and dengue in 8 provinces that are now the focus of a special investigation by the Department of Health (DOH).

DOH Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag named the towns as Villareal and Daram, Western Samar; Kamba and Maitum, Saranggani; Ma. Aurora, Aurora; Sta. Rita, Samar; Sindangan in Zamboanga del Norte; Concepcion, Romblon; Santiago, Agusan and Patnongon, Antique.

Tayag said these were chosen because they showed cases of residents suffering from the 2 mosquito-borne diseases at the same time. "There was no chikungunya in these areas before. We are looking into this now," Tayag said.

Doctors might not [be able to] easily distinguish the rarely fatal chikungunya from the often deadly dengue in the 1st 5 days of the illness, and this worries the DOH, Tayag explained.

From [1 Jan 2013] to [30 Jun 2013], there was a total of 2594 suspected chikungunya [cases] nationwide but only 157 were confirmed as such, according to DOH data.

Dengue and chikungunya have nearly the same symptoms but the latter is hardly fatal and is characterized by long-term joint pains. Dengue could have severe complications like severe bleeding and respiratory distress, sometimes leading to death.

[There have been several reports of outbreaks of chikungunya virus in various parts of the Philippines this year (2013). The above report provides a broader national overview of the outbreaks, noting that several are mixed chikungunya-dengue outbreaks. This is not surprising, since _Aedes aegypti_ is the mosquito vector of both viruses. One can expect these outbreaks to continue as long as the mosquito population is abundant. Unless vector control measures are quickly implemented, this outbreak is likely to continue to grow. There is no commercially available vaccine to prevent chikungunya virus infections, so the only effective measure to prevent transmission of the virus is through timely control of mosquito vectors.
