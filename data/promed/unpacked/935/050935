Bubonic plague: Four Corners health alert as man sickened, prairie dogs dying

A northeast Arizona man has contracted bubonic plague and health
agencies are urging Four Corners residents to help prevent the spread
of the disease. The Apache County, Ariz., man who contracted the
disease began showing symptoms in late September, the Navajo Nation
said, including a 103-degree fever, chills, diarrhea and groin
tenderness. The man was responding to treatment and doing well Monday
afternoon,said Jenny Notah, a spokeswoman for Navajo Area Indian
Health Service.

The Navajo Nation also said plague likely killed a number of prairie
dogs east of Flagstaff, Ariz. There have been no recent reports of
plague cases on the Utah side of the Four Corners.

Humans can contract plague by touching bodily fluids of infected
animals or after being bitten by fleas that have contracted it from
infected rodents, according to the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.

In 2006, the disease was found in rodents in Mesa Verde National Park
and Natural Bridges National Monument. No humans were infected, but
Natural Bridges closed a campground until it determined there was no
threat. Both venues were fully open Monday.

[From data collected by the Arizona Department of Health
Services <http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/vector/plague/stats.htm>,
a total of 61 cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection have been
acquired in the state from 1950 to 2000. About one third of these
cases occurred in Apache County.

Four corners is the only place in the United States where four states
come together at one place. The states are Arizona, New Mexico, Utah
and Colorado. These states can be located on the map of the USA at

Apache county is in the north east corner of Arizona. See the map of

Prairie dogs are often sensitive sentinels for plague. A photo of a
