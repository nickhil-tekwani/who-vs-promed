A middle-aged man (name withheld) has tested positive to Lassa fever in Katsina [city, Katsina state] following contact with the corpse of his brother who died from the disease in Kaduna [city in Kaduna state].

The samples of the man and 7 others who participated in the burial rites were taken and his turned out positive. He is currently quarantined at the National Obstetric Fistula Centre at Babbar Ruga [in Katsina].

The state Commissioner of Health, Mariyatu Bala Usman, who disclosed this, said 'the man' had travelled to Kaduna to bring back the corpse of his brother for burial in Katsina and 5 days later Kaduna health authority sent in a report indicating the cause of death from Lassa fever.

Shedding more light on the development, the Director of Public Health, Dr Shamsudden Yahaya, said about 18 primary contacts had been quarantined just as over 100 secondary contacts were closely being monitored and on drugs.

[Lassa fever cases have occurred before in Kaduna this year (2016). A doctor, a nurse, and a pregnant patient died in the hospital in Kaduna state as reported on 29 Feb 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160302.4062565). The woman apparently had been infected outside the hospital and the staff acquired in infection in the hospital from contact with her fluids. As of mid-February 2016, 3 non-fatal cases of Lassa fever were reported in Katsina state (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160314.4090655).

The reported cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria have been increasing recently. The reason for the higher than usual number of fatal cases is undetermined. One possibility is an increase in the populations of the Lassa fever virus reservoir host, the multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp), with increase numbers of virus carriers, due to more favorable environmental conditions for them. This could result in more contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents. The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp) as was likely the case of the infected pregnant woman in Kaduna. Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures, as apparently was the case with the Kaduna physician and nurse. Because there can be person-to-person transmission via contact with viremic blood or secretions of infected patients, adequate patient isolation and use of personal protection equipment for treatment of infected patients is essential for safety. Unfortunately, nosocomial transmission is not unusual.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.
