Utah public health officials have confirmed that an elderly resident died from plague in August 2015. This is the 1st Utah resident to be diagnosed with plague since 2009.

Plague is a rare, life-threatening, flea-borne illness that is maintained in a rodent-flea transmission cycle. Species such as prairie dogs, black footed-ferrets, squirrels, and rabbits are especially susceptible and experience high mortality upon infection. Plague is naturally occurring in Utah, and typically seen in the prairie dog populations each year.

Since 1 Apr 2015, a total of 12 cases of human plague have been reported in residents of 7 states: Arizona (2), California (1), Colorado (4), Georgia (1), New Mexico (2), Oregon (1), and Utah (1). The 2 cases in Georgia and the California resident have been linked to exposures at or near Yosemite National Park in California.

The investigation continues into the circumstances surrounding the Utah [resident's] illness. The patient may have contracted the disease from a flea, or contact a dead animal. At this time, public health officials believe there was no travel history indicating that the Utah resident traveled anywhere else where plague is common.

Human plague occurs in areas where the bacteria are present in wild rodent populations. The risks are generally highest in rural and semi-rural areas, including campsites and homes that provide food and shelter for various ground squirrels, chipmunks, and wood rats, or other areas where you may encounter rodents.

Plague is a very serious illness, but it is treatable with commonly available antimicrobials. The earlier a patient seeks medical care and receives treatment that is appropriate for plague, the better the chance for a full recovery. Some common symptoms may include fever, headache, chills, and weakness. If you are experiencing symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.

[During 2001-2012, the annual number of human plague cases reported in the USA ranged from 1-17 (median = 3 cases). A map of the location of plague cases in the USA from 1970-2012 can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/. Most case reports are around the Four Corners area of the southwest where Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona come together. This seems clear in New Mexico and Arizona where most cases occur in the northern parts of the states but somewhat in Colorado and clearly in Utah, the cases are less concentrated in the southern parts.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." - Mod.LL
