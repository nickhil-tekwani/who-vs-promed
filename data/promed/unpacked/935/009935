Epidemics of a prolonged febrile illness have been sweeping parts of
Kerala state seasonally in the last few years, seriously affecting
normal life. They have been considered to be Chikungunya, mostly. The
following is a mail posted by a physician at the Kerala-Karnataka
border describing in fair detail one current, severe epidemic.

[The lengthy letter mentioned in Dr Srikantiah's message comes from a
physician, Dr Mohan Kumar, in the Kumar Clinic who was faced with
attending a large number of patients during the epidemic. Below, some
verbatim excerpts from the letter paint a picture of the severity of
the epidemic:
- "Our district is facing a natural calamity of human health. Many
villages are affected by a serious crippling fever."
- He indicated that the epidemic was very swift, saying, "I have seen
hundreds of persons falling ill suddenly. The onset is so sudden that
it resembles a war field in Ramayan serial where a single arrow of
Rama is able to destroy thousands of enemies. The spread of disease
is faster than wildfire. Nobody is spared on its forward journey."
- "With severe pain they are not able to walk or do work. There is
some swelling of joints also."
- "I have seen many infants, even 2-month-old babies who had been
affected. Schoolchildren getting affected in large numbers after
going to school is very common. Large numbers of teachers are
bedridden for many days."
- "There is high fever and general weakness from the very beginning.
The pain and swelling initially subside quickly but reappear suddenly
in a few days. I have seen hundreds of patients coming again and
again complaining of severe disability."
- "The loss to our economy is very alarming. Agriculture has suffered
a severe jolt. No one has considered it seriously so far. There is
already a severe shortage in farm labourers. As all workers are
severely affected it will take long time to restart."

Although Dr Kumar mentioned that the symptoms of the disease were
similar to chikungunya virus infections he suspected that another
etiological agent was involved, and suggested that transmission was
person-to-person and not by mosquitoes. There is no information
concerning the relative abundance of _Aedes_ mosquitoes that are
chikungunya virus vectors. He also mentions that some patients have
experienced a repeated episode of the same illness, raising the
possibility that there may be a mixed epidemic, perhaps involving
dengue and chikungunya viruses. Clearly, laboratory diagnosis is
essential to confirm or refute chikungunya virus as the etiological
agent responsible for this outbreak. In the absence of a diagnosis,
devising and implementing effective prevention and control measures
becomes guesswork with a high risk of failure.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about
this outbreak as it becomes available.
