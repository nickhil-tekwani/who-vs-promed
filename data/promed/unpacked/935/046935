A recent review of the Pennsylvania Mosquito Surveillance Program for 20-26
Oct 2000 and an overview of mosquito surveillance for the Eastern U.S.
region provides an opportunity for reflection and some observations. During
monitoring of epidemics or surveillance of arthropod-borne diseases, it is
meaningful to know the number of mosquitoes collected in an area, the
number of pools tested (which should indicate the pool size), and the
number of pools positive for a specific virus such as WNV. From these data,
one can determine the minimum infection rate per 1000 mosquitoes collected
and monitor infectivity rates over time.
Ideally, pools should be of similar size and only contain females of the
same species or of the species likely to transmit infection. Knowing the
percentage of engorged mosquitoes present in a pool can provide additional
information. Finally, titering the positive pools also might complement the
minimum infection rate and assist authorities in determining the potential
for transmission in a region and whether the epidemic is abating. It would
be helpful if this information would be provided by the appropriate
mosquito surveillance programs.

[I believe New York State uses pool sizes ranging from 1 to a max of 100,
depending on how common the species is.
The Connecticut State WN website says: "October 31, 2000... The state
reports 137 113 mosquitoes have been tested for WNV and EEE this season."
The New Jersey State WN website says as of 1 Nov 2000: "Fifty-three
mosquito pools collected in Bergen (22), Essex (2), Hunterdon (1),
Middlesex (3), Monmouth (3), Ocean (1), Passaic (11), Sussex (6), Union
(1), and Warren (3) counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV.
In total, 14 329 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been collected by
the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by the Department
of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC."
The Rhode Island WN website says they tested 10 795 mosquitoes as of 25 Oct
2000, all of which were negative for WN virus. But none of them give the
pool sizes. - Mod.JW
