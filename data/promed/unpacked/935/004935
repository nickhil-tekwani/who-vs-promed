One person has died from [legionellosis] in Evergem, [a municipality] near Ghent, after health authorities declared an outbreak of the bacteria in the region, which accelerated at the weekend. The patient died in Ghent's University Hospital on [Mon 13 May 2019] evening, The Flanders Agency for Care and Health announced in a statement.

The agency has currently identified at least 16 cases after it was reported that 11 infected people had been admitted to the hospital late last week.

The most recently reported cases have prompted authorities to warn that the source of the infection, which has not yet been identified, may still be active. A total of 7 of the 16 cases originated in Evergem or in bordering towns, leading authorities to say that there are strong indications that the source of the infection is in Evergem's vicinity.

The _Legionella_ bacteria develop primarily in warm and stagnant water and can lead to Legionnaires' disease or Pontiac fever.

The Flanders Agency for Care and Health said in a statement that they are examining water samples from 17 companies in order to identify the source of contamination. A spokesperson for the agency said that [legionellosis] symptoms can take up to 17 days to appear, but that most people manifested symptoms within 10 days.

At least 4 more people in Evergem, close to Ghent, were taken to the hospital with a _Legionella_ infection, after [Fri 10 May 2019] already saw 11 people in the hospital. Several people are in intensive care. _Legionella_ is a pathogenic group of bacteria that leads to Legionnaires' disease. It is still not clear where the infection came from, but the Agency for Care and Health has taken samples of the water in the port of Ghent. "Over the weekend, several extra people were admitted to the hospital with symptoms of a _Legionella_ infection. We will be meeting with the doctors and we hope to be able to provide more information later today," said Joris Moonens of the Agency to VRT NWS.

In the meantime, at least 15 people from the Evergem region have been infected in recent weeks. The first infections date back to April [2019] but were only announced last week. Additional infections may still be discovered in the next days, as it sometimes takes up to 19 days for the symptoms -that strongly resemble the flu- to occur.

The _Legionella_ bacteria develops primarily in warm, stagnant water, which makes the water cooling towers and installations in Ghent the ideal breeding ground for the bacteria. The Agency for Care and Health took 15 different samples in the area over the last days, primarily around the cooling installations. The test results are not known yet.

A _Legionella_ epidemic broke out in the municipality of Evergem, next to Ghent, on [Fri 10 May 2019], according to the Agency for Care and Health. As many as 11 people with the _Legionella_ bacteria have already been admitted to the Saint-Lucas hospital, 3 of them are in intense care. _Legionella_ is a pathogenic group of bacteria that leads to Legionnaires' disease.

The patients started getting the 1st symptoms in the period from [29 Apr to 6 May 2019]. "Since all the sick people have started to get sick in the same relatively short period of time, we suspect that the source of the _Legionella_ infection is now under control. However, the situation is being closely monitored," said spokesperson of the agency Joris Moonens to Het Nieuwsblad.

The agency is trying to identify the source of the infection by looking for common places all the patients have been, probably located somewhere in the Evergem region. Additionally, the agency is taking samples from the cooling towers in the Canal zone. "We currently have no indication as to what the source of the contamination may have been. It is often no longer possible to trace this when the infection only has a short duration," said Moonens.

The _Legionella_ bacteria develop primarily in warm, stagnant water. People with low resistance have the highest risk of contracting an infection, and infected people can subsequently develop pneumonia. Other symptoms are muscle aches, rapidly emerging headaches, a dry cough, diarrhoea, nausea and fever. Last year [2018], 100 Flemish people became infected with the bacteria, and 4 Flemish people die every year [of the disease].

The disease can cause permanent injuries and can even be fatal, but can - if you are quick enough - usually be treated with antibiotics.

At least 16 people in the Evergem municipality of East Flanders province in northern Belgium has been sickened with Legionnaires'' disease, according to the Flemish Agency for Health and Safety (computer translated). In addition, one patient has died while being treated at Ghent University Hospital.

The 1st complaints from patients date from the period between [29 Apr and May 6 2019]. The most recent patients presented with illness between [7 and 10 May 2019]. The patients' age ranges between 25 and 90 years, with an average of 58.6 years; 6 of them are older than 65; 9 have a chronic illness or a reduced [limited] resistance.

Water samples have been taken for testing in the cooling towers of 17 companies in the canal zone. Information about their installations has been requested from 2 other companies. However, nothing is yet known about the possible source of the infections.

A total of 7 of the 16 patients live in Evergem and 2 live on the border in Oostakker. This continues to indicate that the source of the contamination is probably in the vicinity of Evergem and must be found.

Joris Moonens, spokesperson for Care and Health said, "We have a hotline where companies can register their cooling towers, which means that we have already been able to investigate 19 companies. We call on companies in the Ghent canal zone to carefully check their cooling tower installations and to report to us, if they have not yet done so. The companies are cooperating very well with this research."

[Evergem, with a population of 32 244 in 2006, is a municipality located north of Ghent in the northern Belgian province of East Flanders (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergem). A total of 7 of the 16 legionellosis patients live in Evergem and 2 live on the border in Oostakker, a town located southeast of Evergem, separated by the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal. The Ghent-Terneuzen Canal, links Ghent in Belgium to the port of Terneuzen in the Netherlands, thereby providing Ghent with access to the sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent-Terneuzen_Canal). Cooling towers in the vicinity of the Canal are suspected to be the source of this outbreak. A map showing the location of Evergem can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/9940+Evergem,+Belgium.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the cases of legionnaires' disease will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
