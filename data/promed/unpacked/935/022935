Iraq: 2nd Avian Influenza H5N1 Death Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A 2nd Iraqi Kurd was confirmed to have died from H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection, as international teams arrived to combat the spread
of the virus in the country's north.
A 40-year-old man who died of flu-like symptoms a little over a week
after his niece passed away under similar circumstances was confirmed
as having died of H5N1 virus infection by a lab in Cairo, a senior
Kurdish health official told AFP. A few days after the man's death,
the World Health Organization (WHO) lab confirmed his niece had died
of bird flu, galvanizing a major local and international response to
the possibility of an outbreak.
Earlier on Monday [6 Feb 2006] the WHO said there were 7 more
suspected cases of bird flu in Iraqi Kurdistan. "Apart from the girl
who died, there are 7 suspected cases of bird flu, and we have taken
their blood samples and sent them to Cairo for further
investigation," Naeema al-Gasseer, the WHO representative in Iraq,
told reporters before news of the 40-year-old man's death emerged.
Further tests are underway in Britain on virus samples from the man
as well as on samples from a woman who comes from the same region and
remains in hospital.
Meanwhile, a large consignment of masks, gloves and gowns is on its
way from the United States to help the war-torn country fight a
deadly outbreak. "What Iraq needs is lots of personal protection
equipment such as masks, gloves, gowns and disinfectants to curb the
spread of the disease," said Jon C. Bowersox, health attache with the
US embassy. "A 900 kilo (1980 pound) consignment of this equipment is
on its way from the United States to Iraq and will arrive here in the
next 2 days," he told AFP. Bowersox said the consignment will be
distributed across the entire country. "The idea is to prepare Iraq
to ward off any widespread threat," he said. Bowersox, who is working
with the health ministry to help check the spread of the virus, said
the issue was not a shortage of medicines or equipment but how to
make it quickly available. The WHO said it was dispatching thousands
of doses of the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu after reports of an acute
shortage.
2 WHO veterinarians left for the Kurdish city of Arbil on Monday [6
Feb 2006] to join an 8-member team which landed in Kurdistan on
Sunday [5 Feb 2006]. "At the moment, this is an agricultural
emergency," said one of the vets, Sam Yingst. "But we believe that
there is a possibility that it may become a human public emergency,
though it will require a significant change in the nature of the
virus." A massive cull of poultry has been underway in Kurdistan, and
Yingst said the tests on the dead girl's uncle would be key to
assessing whether the virus was mutating into something even more
dangerous. "We will come to know from the tests of the 2nd person
whether or not the virus has shifted or drifted, but at the moment,
there is no indication of that, because, had it occurred, there would
have been more cases," he told reporters. "And if at all it has
happened, then this possibility has been elevated by a very
significant notch."
In the province of Diyala along the Iranian border, health ministry
officials were spreading disinfectant around poultry producing areas.
"We are checking people coming from Kurdistan and Iran to Diyala and
spreading disinfectants on their vehicles," said Hashim Ibrahim, head
of Diyala's veterinary department. "We have also closed the market in
the center of Baquba, as usually there are many clusters of people."
Ibtisam Aziz, head of a committee set up to fight the virus, said it
was still confined to the village in the Raniya district of
Sulaimaniyah province, where the dead girl lived. Turkey, which has
had 21 cases of the flu strain, was previously the only country
outside Asia to report fatalities from the virus. 4 people have died
there.

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 2
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 6 Feb 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed an additional 4 cases of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus. 2 of these cases were fatal.
The 1st fatal case was a 22-year-old man from West Java who died on
26 Jan 2006. He worked as a banana vendor at a market in East Jakarta
where poultry meat was sold. Neighbors near his home reported poultry
deaths prior to his onset of symptoms.
The 2nd fatal case was a 15-year-old boy from West Java who died on
Wed 1 Feb 2006. Deaths in chickens near his home were reported in the
week prior to symptom onset.
The 3rd case is a 9-year-old girl from West Java who was hospitalized
on 19 Jan 2006 and has since recovered. She lived in a village
neighboring that of the 2 fatal cases in siblings confirmed on 23 Jan
2006. Investigation of these cases resulted in the girl's prompt
hospitalization and treatment. She has now fully recovered. Poultry
deaths were reported in her village prior to symptom onset.
The 4th case is a 5-year-old boy from Lampung Province who developed
symptoms in October of last year [2005] and has since fully
recovered. The child is the brother of a previously confirmed case, a
20-year-old man who developed symptoms in late September 2005 and
likewise fully recovered. Both the child and his brother had direct
exposure to diseased chickens during slaughtering. As initial
diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results, retrospective
confirmation of the child's infection relied on antibody levels in
acute blood samples taken during his illness and convalescent samples
taken following recovery.
All 3 cases with recent symptom onset resided in West Java, where a
resurgence of virus activity in birds has been reported.
The newly confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 23. Of
these cases, 16 were fatal.

Indonesia: Fatality of Sailor in Port of Klaipeda Attributed to Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------------
An Indian sailor who died in the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda may have
been infected with bird flu, the Lithuanian health ministry said. "A
member of the crew of the ship M.V. Ocean Wind died in Klaipeda. The
suspected cause of death is bird flu," a statement from the ministry
said. "The sailor, who was the ship's cook, fell ill on Sat 4 Feb
2006, according to reports from the crew," the statement said. "He
died in a medical emergency vehicle on Monday [6 Feb 2006]," it said.
A preliminary autopsy will be conducted on the 62-year-old sailor's
body in Klaipeda, with a more thorough analysis to be undertaken in
the capital, Vilnius, within 48 hours, the health ministry said. The
final results of the autopsy are expected in a few days, the
statement said.
The Ocean Wind arrived in Lithuania from Germany on 17 Jan 2006, the
health ministry said.

[The basis for considering avian influenza virus infection as a
possible cause of death after a 48 hour illness of an Indian crew
member of a ship which arrived in a Lithuanian port from Germany on
17 Jan 2006 is entirely unclear. Perhaps the ship had been supplied
with avian influenza virus-contaminated chicken carcasses somewhere
en route to Germany and Klaipeda, and the sailor, who was a cook,
handled a contaminated carcass? Further information is awaited. -
