Enzootic bovine leukosis In Switzerland (serological finding)
---------------
(Date of previous outbreak of enzootic bovine leukosis in Switzerland
reported to the OIE: April 1996).
This information received on (and dated) 20 Jun 2005 from Dr Hans Wyss,
director of the Federal Veterinary Office, Bern.
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report declaring the
outbreak(s) ended.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 25 May 2005.
Date of start of the event: 17 May 2005.
Clinical disease: no.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory diagnosis as part of a national screening
programme for enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL).
Details of outbreak:
First administrative division: canton of Zurich
Lower administrative division: Dielsdorf district
Type of epidemiological unit: farm
Name of the location: ...
Species: bov
Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
42 / 1* / 0 / 1* / 0
* 5 year old dairy cow; no clinical/pathological signs
Description of affected population: dairy production and breeding.
Diagnosis:
Institute of Virology, Vetsuisse-Faculty, Veterinary Medicine, University
of Zurich using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
Date: 17 May 2005
Results: 1 suspicious
Institute of Veterinary Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Vetsuisse-Faculty, University of Bern (national reference laboratory for
EBL) using ELISA / ELISA-Ab gp51
Date: 25 May 2005 / 30 May 2005
Results: 1 positive / 1 suspicious
Institute of Virology, Vetsuisse-Faculty, Veterinary Medicine, University
of Zurich using pathological examination
Date: 30 May 2005
Results: negative
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- quarantine. The farm has been banned from moving animals. Contact of
quarantined animals with other animals is strictly forbidden. The ban
cannot be removed until all the cattle on the affected farm have tested
negative on 2 different occasions at an interval of at least 90 days.
- disinfection of premises.
Treatment of affected animals: no.
Vaccination prohibited: yes.
Conclusions:
For the following reasons it is questionable whether the cow in question
represented a real EBL case:
a. The pathological examination (macroscopic and microscopic) revealed no
findings to indicate a potential presence of EBL.
b. The 3rd serological test done with a blood sample taken immediately
before destruction of the cow in question yielded a doubtful result,
exactly as the first serological examination had done.
c. The epidemiological situation is not typical of EBL. The animal
concerned was the only animal out of 42 that tested positive for EBL.
The national reference laboratory for EBL (Institute of Veterinary
Virology, University of Bern) considers that the positive serology result
might have been a false positive.
Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, the case was treated as a real
outbreak, in accordance with the relevant Swiss legislation, and all
precautionary measures were taken, including quarantine and disease
notification to the OIE.

[This disease is also called also called leukosis, leukemia, bovine viral
leukosis, or bovine lymphosarcoma. It occurs worldwide, in up to 5 per cent
of the cattle herd, and is more commonly found in dairy herds. Transmission
is by close contact between infected and healthy animals or through the
transfer of blood containing infected lymphocytes by instruments such as
dehorning devices or hypodermic needles. Maternal transmission occurs in
approximately 20 percent of calvings from infected dams. Mechanical
transmission by biting flies is also possible.
This report is very interesting, as it presents the serological data
incriminating the particular suspect cow but also summarizes other
serological, pathological, and epidemiological evidence arguing that this
cow is a false positive. Given the vagaries of serologic testing and the
importance of post mortem pathological confirmation in making a diagnosis
of EBL, this seems a very reasonable approach. Reporting transparency is
definitely in evidence here, but the overriding message is that there was
no infection -- thus, ProMED-mail puts it in the suspect category. - Mod.PC]
