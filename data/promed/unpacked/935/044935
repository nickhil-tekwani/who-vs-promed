After finding many small groups of dead gopher tortoises (g.t.) at
Rock Springs Run State Reserve (just north of Orlando, FL) I, along
with other park staff completely surveyed a 95 acre burn zone for dead
tortoises. Our group of about 8 people took 2 hours surveying the
sandhill habitat and found 60 dead gopher tortoises. The tortoises
seem to be virtually extirpated from this area.
This zone has been well managed by the park staff and appears to have
all the components to support a healthy g.t. population. The tortoises
were clearly not killed by an animal or human. But we have not gotten
blood samples from enough tortoises in the area to make an upper
respiratory tract infection claim as of right now.
Right now we are surveying a zone that is next to the above mentioned
zone. We know there are many dead tortoises in that area as well. If I
had to make an estimate I would say there are approximately 120-140
dead tortoises in an area of about 200 acres.
Please call or email if you have witnessed any other die-offs in the
Orlando or surrounding area.
