A 2 year old girl has been confirmed to be infected with bird flu in north
China's Shanxi Province, a provincial government official said Saturday [17

grandparents took her to Luliang City in Shanxi [province] on 11 Jan 2009.

to the Shanxi Children's Hospital on Wednesday night after she got worse,

was in critical condition, the official said.

According to the test result of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, the girl tested positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.

The people who had close contact with the patient are under medical

A 2 year old girl has been confirmed to be infected with bird flu in north
China's Shanxi Province, Xinhua News Agency said on Sunday [18 Jan 2009],
citing a provincial government official, in the 2nd case in as many weeks.
The girl was found ill on 7 Jan 2009 in central Hunan Province and was
taken to hospital in Luliang City of Shanxi on 11 Jan 2009, Xinhua said,
citing an unnamed official with the Shanxi provincial health department.
The girl had tested positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza and
"was in critical condition," Xinhua cited the official as saying.

"All people who have had close contact with her are under strict medical
observation ... Up to now, no abnormal symptoms have been found," a
statement on China's Health Ministry website <http://www.moh.gov.cn> said.
The Health Ministry had notified the World Health Organization, authorities
in Hong Kong and Macau, and some other countries, the statement said.

China confirmed earlier this month [January 2009] that a woman infected
with bird flu had died in Beijing after buying 9 ducks at a market in Hebei
province, which surrounds the Chinese capital, sparking emergency checks of
local poultry markets. H5N1 influenza remains largely a disease among
birds, but experts fear it could change into a form that is easily
transmitted from person to person and spark a pandemic that could kill
millions of people worldwide.

At least 21 people have died of bird flu out of 32 people infected in China.

This is the 32nd human case of avian A/H5N1 influenza in China. No
information is available as yet with regard to possible exposure of the
child to sick poultry. The distance between the presumed site of exposure
(Hunan province) and the site of ultimate medical treatment of the sick
child (Shanxi province) may have contributed to the severity of her present
condition. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
