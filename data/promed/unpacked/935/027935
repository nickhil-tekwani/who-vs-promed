[1] WHO update

Between [1 Jan and 11 Mar 2021], the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 7 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection, including 3 associated deaths. Additional death was reported from a previously reported case (case no.2, please see Disease outbreak news published on 1 Feb 2021; https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON308). The cases were reported from Riyadh (4 cases), Jeddah (one case), Al-Ahsaa (one case), and Makkah (one case) regions.

The link MERS-CoV cases reported from [1 Jan through 11 Mar 2021] https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)-saudi-arabia provides details of the 7 reported cases.

From 2012 until 11 March 2021, a total of 2574 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and 886 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacity for MERS-CoV has been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources have been redirected towards SARS-CoV-2. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is working to increase the testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV infections.

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO re-emphasizes the importance of strong surveillance by all Member States for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures or in settings where aerosol generating procedures are conducted.

Early identification, case management and isolation of cases, supported quarantine of contacts, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures and clear and consistent risk communication can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[MERS-CoV continues to present as a sporadic disease in Saudi Arabia -- the mode of transmission for those primary cases without a history of camel contact remains undefined as yet.

[2] MERS-CoV antibodies

Study: MERS antibodies persist up to 6 years
------------------------------------------------
A study of antibodies in 48 people in Saudi Arabia who survived their MERS-CoV infections found that some neutralizing antibodies persisted 6 years, a Saudi-led team reported yesterday [14 Apr 2021] in Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

Scientists are closely watching for new information about the durability of antibody response to coronavirus infections, given that 3 diseases involving them have emerged in humans over the past couple of decades: SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), and now SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.

For the study, researchers looked at blood test findings in 48 MERS survivors from 5 hospitals in Jeddah and Riyadh. Illnesses ranged from mild to severe. Convalescent blood samples were collected at 2 to 3 years for 57.1% of the patients, 4 years postinfection for nearly 24.5%, and 5 to 6 years for 18.4%. ELISA testing was performed on 45 samples, with microneutralization assays done on 49.

Antibodies specific to MERS-CoV were detected for 6 years after infection, including 100% of those who had moderate or severe disease and 50% of those who had mild disease. Some people who had mild or moderate disease had negative ELISA results. The authors said the results suggest durable immunity against the virus, and they wrote that future studies would be useful to determine if the antibody levels would protect against infection.

A limited number of studies have evaluated the longevity of MERS antibody responses. Payne et al. described the persistence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies for more than 34 months postinfection in 6 (86%) of 7 survivors (Payne DC, Iblan I, Rha B, et al. Persistence of antibodies against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016; 22(10): 1824-6; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/10/16-0706_article).

Another study by Choe et al. documented that patients who had severe disease had robust MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody titers for 1 year, and patients who had mild disease had waning antibody response over time (Choe PG, Perera RAPM, Park WB, Song KH, Bang JH, Kim ES, et al. MERS-CoV antibody responses 1 year after symptom onset, South Korea, 2015. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(7): 1079-844; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/7/17-0310_article).

This study assessed antibody responses in 48 MERS survivors who had variable disease severity and duration longer than 6 years postinfection using both Elisa and neutralizing antibody based serological assays. The study data have implications for the introduction of potential vaccines and the expected longevity of the stimulated antibody response. - Mod.UBA]
