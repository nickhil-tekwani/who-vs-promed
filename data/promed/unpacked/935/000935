NEW HANTAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN CHILE
SANTIAGO, Chile -- A 44-year-old woman has, according to this story,
died from a hantavirus infection, the first victim of the disease in
Chile in 18 months, authorities were cited as saying on Tuesday. Two
other members of the woman's family, who were also infected, are
recovering in a hospital in the city of Chillan [about 250 miles
south of Santiago.
Officials were cited as saying that four other suspected cases are
yet to be confirmed. The disease caused by the virus, known as
pulmonary syndrome, is characterized by shortness of breath, muscle
aches, fever and chills.

The hantavirus is thought to be caught by humans when they inhale
dust contaminated by mouse saliva, droppings, urine or nesting
material, although isolated cases of human-to-human infection are
believed to have occurred.
