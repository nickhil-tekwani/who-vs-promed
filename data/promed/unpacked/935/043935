The Yucatan State Ministry of Health reported 1400 chickenpox [varicella] patients last month [March 2018], representing an increase of 46 percent in relation to the number of cases recorded in the same period of time last year [2017].

The statistics indicated that until 24 Mar 2018, there were 1497 people with this condition in the state, which were treated in different public health centers throughout the state. The reports spoke of 802 men and 695 women, affected with chickenpox.

During the same period of 2017, only 801 cases were recorded. In other words, 696 incidents are currently reported, representing an increase of 46.5 percent.

According to data from the National Epidemiological Bulletin, in 2017, Yucatan ended the year with total of 2802 cases of chickenpox. At a national level, the state with the highest number of patients is Veracruz, with 3379 cases. It is followed by Jalisco and the State of Mexico, with 2870 and 2603 incidents, respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A case series published in the journal Pediatric Dermatology [see citation above] describes the occurrence of herpes zoster at the site of varicella-zoster vaccination in 7 healthy children without a history of primary varicella.

Each of the 7 children received varicella-zoster vaccination between 12 and 14 months of age; the children were between the ages of 1.5 and 6 years old when they presented with symptoms. Viral exanthem, eczema herpeticum, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, microcystic lymphatic malformation, herpes simplex infection, and herpes zoster infection were all considered in the differential diagnosis.

In their discussion of the case, the authors acknowledged that herpes zoster can occur in patients without a history of varicella and that it can also occur in patients after varicella vaccination, as previously reported in the literature. "It is likely that the vaccine strain infects cutaneous sensory nerves around the injection site and travels to the dorsal ganglion through retrograde transport," they write.

As the children in these cases did not present with typical herpes zoster rash, but rather with small pink to erythematous papules, pseudovesicles, and plaques, the authors state that a "high index of clinical suspicion is necessary for timely diagnosis." Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing was conducted in 4 of the 7 patients.

All of the patients in this case series recovered without complications; 5 were treated with acyclovir and 2 received no treatment. "This series supports and expands upon the existing literature regarding herpes zoster in vaccinated healthy children and highlights the close correlation between the vaccination site and cutaneous eruption," the authors conclude.

[Varicella vaccination is generally considered safe but adverse reactions have been reported, as in the cases discussed above. In addition, keratitis in association with herpes zoster virus (HZV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccines has been observed. HZV vaccination is intended for at-risk adult populations and VZV vaccination is intended for all pediatric patients. ... In most cases, the onset of keratitis occurred within days of vaccination and resolved with topical steroid eye drops and oral acyclovir. Data suggest that keratitis in association with herpes zoster or varicella vaccine is rare, is usually self-limited or resolves with treatment.
