Introduction
------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and
publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available
epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by
the Global Influenza Surveillance Network), FluID, and influenza reports
from WHO regional offices and member states. Completeness can vary among
updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when
the update is developed.

Map timeline for influenza activity

Description: displayed data reflect the most recent information reported to
FluNet, WHO regional offices, or on ministry of health websites in the last
2 weeks. The percentage of specimens tested positive for influenza includes
all specimens tested positive for all influenza subtypes. The pie charts
show the distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens that were
tested positive for influenza. The available country data were joined in
larger geographical areas (influenza transmission zones) with similar
influenza transmission patterns in order to present an overview.

Influenza update 121
19 Nov 20100 - summary
----------------------
Worldwide
---------
Influenza activity remains low, except in limited areas of tropical Asia
and temperate South America. Although the winter influenza season in the
temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere formally concluded during early
October 2010 and generally transmission has been negligible since then,
there have been recent reports of localized, late season epidemic influenza
activity in Argentina, most notably in several provinces in the north
western part of the country. As the temperate zone of the Northern
Hemisphere enters the late autumn and winter months, influenza activity
remains at or below seasonal baseline in most countries of Europe, North
America, and temperate Asia. Seasonal influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses
continue to co-circulate worldwide, with the latter slightly predominant;
influenza H1N1 (2009) virus circulation continues to be detected at low to
moderate levels across Asia, and sporadically in other parts of the world.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In most countries of the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere,
influenza virus circulation remained low to sporadic and influenza-like
illness (ILI) activity levels remained near or below baseline. In
Argentina, however, there have been recent reports of localized, late
season epidemics of influenza occurring during September and October 2010
in the several north western and far southern provinces. These outbreaks
have been associated with circulation of influenza A viruses (some isolates
have been characterized as seasonal influenza A(H3N2) but most have not
been subtyped). In neighboring Chile, overall influenza activity remained
low through late October 2010 after a recently concluded influenza season
characterized by a predominance of circulating seasonal influenza A(H3N2)
viruses. In South Africa, small numbers of influenza B viruses continued to
be detected as the winter influenza season came to an end. In Australia,
low level co-circulation of influenza B and H1N1 (2009) viruses continued
to be detected through early November 2010 as levels of ILI remained low.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Several countries of South East Asia continued to report active circulation
of influenza viruses. In Thailand, as of mid to late October 2010, there
continued to be reports of active but declining co-circulation of seasonal
influenza A(H3N2), B, and influenza H1N1 (2009) viruses. In neighboring
Cambodia, since September 2010, there has been sustained active circulation
of predominantly seasonal A(H3N2) viruses, but also to a lesser extent,
seasonal influenza B and H1N1 (2009). In Hong Kong SAR (China), small
numbers of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses continue to be detected as
levels of ILI have largely returned to seasonal levels after a recently
concluded period of epidemic influenza activity. In Singapore, sustained
co-circulation of seasonal influenza and H1N1 (2009) viruses has been
observed, in varying proportions over time, since April 2010; levels of ARI
[acute respiratory illness] have remained within the expected seasonal
range over the past 2 months. Elsewhere in Asia, Sri Lanka has reported a
recent increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza A(H3N2), B, and
H1N1 (2009) viruses, while in both Bangladesh and India, influenza activity
appears to have significantly subsided after a period of persistent
influenza virus circulation since March and June 2010, respectively.

In most countries in the tropics of the Americas, influenza activity has
largely subsided. This comes after a period of variable influenza virus
transmission spanning late July through early October 2010 during which
many countries in the region observed active circulation of seasonal
A(H3N2) viruses, while a few noted either seasonal influenza B or H1N1
(2009) activity. More recently, during October 2010, low to moderate levels
of influenza A(H3N2) and H1N1 (2009) viruses have been detected in parts of
Bolivia and Colombia, respectively.

Limited data from the tropical areas of sub-Saharan Africa suggest that
overall influenza activity has remained low. Since late spring and late
summer, there has been persistent low levels of circulation of seasonal
influenza A(H3N2) viruses in Kenya and Madagascar, respectively. During
late September through mid-October 2010, Cameroon, in central Africa, has
also begun to detect significant levels of seasonal influenza A(H3N2) and B
viruses. In contrast, little influenza activity has been reported in West
Africa during recent months, except in Togo, which has recently reported
small numbers of H1N1 (2009) virus detections.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
In Canada and the United States, overall influenza activity and levels of
ILI remained near or below baseline; small numbers of seasonal influenza
A(H3N2) and B viruses have been detected during the past month.

Most countries in the European Region continued to report low overall
levels of ILI activity, with sporadic detections of influenza A(H3N2), H1N1
(2009) and influenza B viruses.

As of late October 2010, overall influenza activity remained low to
sporadic in China and Japan. In both, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses
were detected at low levels during October 2010.

Human infections with other influenza viruses
---------------------------------------------
Swine-origin H3N2 virus infection in the US
-------------------------------------------
On 12 Nov 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC),
reported 2 sporadic cases of human infection with triple reassortant swine
origin influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The 2 cases occurred in separate states,
are not believed to be epidemiologically linked to each other, and both
occurred in the vicinity of live pigs. Both patients have fully recovered
from their illness. The viruses isolated from both patients had some
genetic differences further suggesting that 2 cases were not linked.
Investigations thus far have not shown any evidence of community
transmission of these viruses. For more information visit
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pdf/External_F1044.pdf> or
<http://www.cdc.gov/media/subtopic/heard.htm>.

The 1st detection in a human of the triple reassortant swine A(H3N2) virus
was in 2005 in Ontario Canada. Since then human cases have been reported
nearly every year. All cases have fully recovered and no increased severity
has been associated with the infection with these viruses in humans.

In North America, A(H3N2) viruses in pigs emerged around 1998-99, when the
human influenza A(H3N2) viruses entered into swine population and
reassorted with other influenza viruses already circulating in pigs. The
A(H3N2) viruses currently circulating in the swine population in US and
Canada contain gene segments from avian-like, swine-like, and human-like
viruses.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel
influenza A viruses is critical to evaluate the extent of the outbreak and
possible human-to-human transmission and WHO continues to encourage member
states to investigate and report these events.

H5N1 case in Hong Kong
----------------------
On 17 Nov 2010, the Department of Health of Hong Kong SAR, China, reported
a confirmed human case of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection to WHO. The
case has a travel history to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. The
investigation is still ongoing but based on current information this is a
sporadic case of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus without
secondary spread. See also
