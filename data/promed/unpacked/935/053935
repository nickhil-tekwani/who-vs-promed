Update: influenza activity --- United States, 2 Oct to 3 Dec 2005
--------------------------------------------------
During the period 2 Oct to 3 Dec 2005, low-level influenza activity was
reported in the United States. This report summarizes US influenza
activity* since the beginning of the 2005-06 influenza surveillance season
and updates the previous summary (1).
Influenza viral surveillance and characterization
-------------------------------------------------
During the current influenza surveillance season, US World Health
Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and
Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories in the United
States tested 20 336 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 173 (0.9
per cent) were positive. The weekly percentages of specimens testing
positive for influenza virus ranged from 0.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent.
Since 2 Oct 2005, influenza viruses have been reported from 30 states. Of
the 173 influenza viruses identified, a total of 151 (87 per cent) were
influenza A viruses, and 22 (13 per cent) were influenza B viruses. Of the
151 influenza A viruses, 78 (52 per cent) have been subtyped, with 76 (97
per cent) determined to be influenza A (H3N2) viruses and 2 (3 per cent)
determined to be influenza A (H1N1) viruses.
CDC has characterized antigenically 16 influenza viruses collected by US
laboratories since 1 Oct 2005. These include 14 influenza A (H3N2) viruses
that are similar to A/California/07/2004, the influenza A (H3N2) component
included in the 2005-06 influenza vaccines, and 2 influenza B viruses, one
that belongs to the B/Victoria lineage and one that belongs to the
B/Yamagata lineage and was characterized as B/Florida/07/2004-like.
Recently circulating influenza B viruses have belonged to 2 antigenically
and genetically distinct lineages represented by B/Victoria/2/87 viruses
and B/Yamagata/16/88 viruses. The influenza B/Florida/07/2004-like virus
isolated is a minor antigenic variant of B/Shanghai/361/2002, the
recommended influenza B component for the 2005-06 influenza vaccine.
Influenza-Related Pediatric Mortality
-----------------------------
Only one influenza-related pediatric death has been reported during the
current surveillance season -- from California.
Pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality surveillance
----------------------------------------------------
During the current influenza surveillance season, 5.7-6.7 per cent of all
deaths reported to the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System were
attributable to P&I. Each week, the percentage of P&I deaths was below the
epidemic threshold.
Patient visits for influenza-Like Illness (ILI)
-----------------------------------------------
During the current influenza surveillance season, weekly percentages of
patient visits for ILI reported by approximately 1000 US sentinel providers
in 50 states, New York City, Chicago, and the District of Columbia have
ranged from 1.2 per cent to 1.7 per cent; 1.6 per cent in the week ending 3
Dec 2005 (national baseline 2.2 per cent).
Influenza activity levels reported by state and territorial epidemiologists
---------------------------------------------------
No state has reported widespread or regional influenza activity during the
current influenza surveillance season. In the week ending 3 Dec 2005, only
Nebraska reported local influenza activity; 29 states, New York City, and
Puerto Rico reported sporadic influenza activity; 20 states and the
District of Columbia reported no influenza activity.
Pediatric hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza
infection
--------------------------------------------------
The Emerging Infections Program (EIP), which began surveillance for the
2005-06 season on 1 Oct 2005, yielded a preliminary influenza-associated
hospitalization rate for children aged 0-4 years of 0.06 per 10 000. No
influenza-associated hospitalizations among children aged 5-17 years were
reported during the same period. The New Vaccine Surveillance Network
(NVSN), which began surveillance for the 2005-06 season on 30 Oct 2005,
reported no laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations
among children aged 0-4 years during the period 30 Oct to 26 Nov 2005.
Human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1)
---------------------------------------
No human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection has been
identified in the United States. From January 2004 through 9 Dec 2005, a
total of 137 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1)
infections were reported to the World Health Organization (2). Of these, 70
(51 per cent) were fatal. All cases were reported from 5 countries in Asia
(Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam).

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza (3). Although influenza
vaccinations begin in October, vaccination in December and beyond is still
beneficial; influenza activity usually does not peak in the United States
until December--March (3). The degree of antigenic match between the
current vaccine strains and strains that will circulate this season will be
determined as more strains become available for analysis.
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online
weekly during October--May and are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm>. Additional information
about influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, and the influenza vaccine
is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/flu>.
Sporadic cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) in humans continue to be
reported in Asia; in November, for the first time during the current
outbreak (26 Dec 2003 to 9 Dec 2005), China reported laboratory-confirmed
cases (4). The majority of cases appear to have been acquired from direct
contact with infected poultry. No evidence of sustained human-to-human
transmission of H5N1 has been detected, although rare cases of
human-to-human transmission likely have occurred (5).
Recently, influenza A (H5N1) was reported for the first time in avian
species in Europe (6), although the likely Asian origin of the outbreaks
has been confirmed by virus sequencing analysis and virus isolation (7).
This westward spread of disease might be attributed to transport of virus
by wild migratory birds from Asia (8); further research is needed to better
understand the role of migratory birds in the current H5N1 epizootic.
CDC continues to recommend enhanced surveillance for suspected H5N1 cases
among travelers with unexplained severe respiratory illness returning from
H5N1-affected countries (1) as a defense against further spread of the
disease from H5N1-affected countries. Additional information regarding
avian influenza is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm>.

[The latest Bulletin of the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme
similarly reports that clinical influenza activity in Europe remains at
baseline levels. Sporadic laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were
detected in England, Estonia, Poland, Scotland and Sweden in week 48/2005.
So far this season 59 per cent of total influenza virus detections (N=56)
have been influenza A and 41 percent influenza B. No human cases of
influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported in Europe.
All countries reported a low intensity of influenza activity in week
48/2005. The incidence of influenza-like illness or acute respiratory
infections remained at baseline levels in all countries. For the
geographical spread of influenza, England, France and Scotland reported
sporadic influenza activity, which means that isolated cases of
laboratory-confirmed influenza infection have been detected. Other
countries reported no influenza activity, meaning that the overall level of
clinical activity remained at baseline levels. Further details and a map
