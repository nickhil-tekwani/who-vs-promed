WA searches for answers to child death cluster
---------------------------------------------------
Authorities in Western Australia have consulted health experts as
they search for answers to a cluster of child deaths in Perth. A
2-year-old boy yesterday became the 4th toddler to die after
contracting an infection caused by the streptococcal bacteria.
Unlike the other 3 youngsters, who died earlier this month [July
2007], the latest victim did not have influenza. The only warning
sign he showed was a steadily worsening fever.
David Smith from government pathology service PathWest says it is a
concern. "As much as we can do for treating bacterial infections, we
do still have some which can cause very rapid illnesses and it's very
difficult to intervene," he said.
A national hook-up of health experts was held today [19 Jul 2007] to
discuss the situation, however the WA Health Department's Paul Van
Buynder says the reason for the cluster of deaths remains a mystery.
"It is very uncommon for us to have 4 children of this age group to
have an infectious disease and to pass away in such a short period of
time," he said.
Dr Van Buynder says samples of the bacteria have been sent to
specialist testing facilities interstate. "But at this point, it's
unclear what's causing the deaths in these children," he said.
Parents are being advised to seek medical help if their children
become listless or develop a fever.

A 4th child dies from mystery infection
-------------------------------------------
West Australian health authorities are desperately trying to find the
cause of an illness that has killed 4 young children in Perth. The WA
Health Department today announced a 4th child had died from a similar
cause of illness as 3 who died 2 weeks ago [5 Jul 2007]. The 3
children who died earlier this month all had a combination of
influenza A and a bacterial infection.
Paul Van Buynder, director of communicable diseases at the West
Australian health department, said the latest child did not have the
flu but had contracted pneumococcal bacteria. "There isn't a single
bacterial infection that links the 4 cases," Dr Van Buynder said.
"At this point we are unable to say what the cause of death has been
in these 4 children."
Dr Van Buynder said it was "very uncommon" for children to die with
an infectious disease so quickly, but he stressed Perth did not have
a epidemic on its hands. "We are desperately trying to get to the
bottom of what's causing these illnesses," he said.
Health department officials held a teleconference with health experts
from around the country today to discuss the issue and have sent
bacterial specimens from the 4 children interstate for further testing.
David Smith, director of microbiology at Pathwest, WA's pathology
laboratory, said it appeared the 4 children had a bacterial infection
in the respiratory tract.
"It appears more that in these infections the bacteria either got
very quickly into the blood without causing a real pneumonia, that
would have given the parents more warning, or that they produced a
toxin that got into the system and affected them," Mr Smith said.
"And that does mean that the course of the illness was quicker than
we normally see with these bacterial infections."
Parents whose children have common winter colds and coughs are being
told not to be alarmed but to seek medical advice if their children
develop a high fever, become listless and have a cough.

[The news reports above supply few intriguing details; four
"toddlers" (one was a 2-year-old boy) developed rapidly fatal
respiratory tract infections in the past month in Perth, capital of
Western Australia (for map see:
<http://google.com/maps?q=perth,+WA,+Australia&sa=X&ol=map&ct=title>).
Three of the four had influenza A plus a streptococcal (presumably
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_) infection. The fourth apparently had
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ bacteremia without having had an infectious
focus such as pneumonia or influenza A. Rapid death could be explained
by respiratory superinfection with toxigenic _Staphylococcus aureus_
following influenza A, but this news report clearly implicates a
streptococcal infection in the 4 cases.
The pneumococcus is a common cause of otitis media, pneumonia and
invasive bacterial infections in children, including bacteremia and
meningitis. In addition, pneumococcal bacteremia may occur with
fever, but without an apparent infectious focus, giving rise to the
name occult bacteremia. Pneumococci are spread from person to person
through droplets of respiratory secretions; this requires relatively
close contact such as occurs in daycare centers. The prevalence of
colonization in the nasopharynx, a precondition for the development
of disease, can reach 40-60 percent in toddlers and young children in
daycare. Children 2 years of age and under had the highest rates of
invasive pneumococcal disease prior to implementation of pneumococcal
vaccination programs.
There are over 90 different types of pneumococcal bacteria, but only
a few serotypes cause most of the serious infections in children.
Vaccination has markedly diminished pneumococcal disease for the 7
serotypes covered by the vaccine. Risk factors for acquisition of
pneumococci and development of severe disease include crowding (for
example, daycare centers), ethnicity (for example, native Alaskans,
African-Americans, and Australian Aboriginals), preceding viral
respiratory tract infection such as that due to influenza or
respiratory syncytial virus, and co-morbidities such as sickle cell
anemia, no or poorly functioning spleen, HIV infection or other
immune deficiency.
Death from pneumococcal infection is relatively uncommon in children,
except among those who have meningitis, are immunocompromised, or have
no or non-functioning spleens.
Pneumococci are becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics
making treatment more difficult. There are currently 2 pneumococcal
vaccines available for children: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was
licensed in February 2000 and protects against the 7 most common
pneumococcal serotypes that account for 80 percent of invasive
pneumococcal disease in young children. Candidates for vaccination
include all children 23 months of age and younger, in whom 4 doses
are given at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age, previously unvaccinated
healthy children 24 to 59 months of age, who are given one dose, and
previously unvaccinated children 24 to 59 months at high risk for
invasive pneumococcal infection, who are given 2 doses 2 months apart.
A recent ProMED post documented influenza A (H3) in the Perth area,
and the 3 deaths in children in that post of 7 Jul 2007 (see: 1st ref.
below) refer to 3 of the 4 deaths in this post. More information is
needed. What were the 4 different pneumococcal serotypes involved in
the cases? Were the cases linked epidemiologically? Was there any risk
factor for severe pneumococcal disease, such as ethnicity or
co-morbidities?. Antibiotic susceptibility of the strains and the
antibiotics used for therapy are not mentioned, although the patients
may have died too rapidly for therapy to be effective, We await
further details. - Mod.ML/JW]
