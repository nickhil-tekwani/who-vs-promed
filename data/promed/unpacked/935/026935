Public health notice: outbreak of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ linked to raw shellfish
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Health Canada to investigate 67 Canadian cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection in British Columbia and Alberta linked to raw shellfish. The majority of the illnesses have been linked to the eating of raw oysters.

The risk to Canadians is low, and illnesses can be avoided if shellfish are cooked before being eaten. People with weakened immune systems, young children, pregnant women and older adults are at increased risk for developing complications if they get sick. Vibrio are naturally occurring bacteria that can be present at high levels in coastal waters during periods of increased water temperatures. Most people come in contact with vibrio by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters.

Investigation summary
---------------------
In Canada, a total of 67 cases have been reported in British Columbia (48) and Alberta (19). 1 case has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals became sick between 1 Jun 2015 and 7 Aug 2015 and all reported consumption of raw shellfish, primarily oysters. The investigation is ongoing to determine the source and distribution of these products.

People most at risk for complications are pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, liver disease and low stomach acidity, young children and the elderly. Most people recover fully within a week. Foods contaminated with vibrio may look, smell and taste normal.

The following safe food practices will reduce your risk of getting sick from vibrio and other foodborne illnesses:
- do not eat raw shellfish;
- cook shellfish thoroughly before eating, especially oysters. Shellfish should be cooked to a safe internal temperature of 74 degrees C (165 degrees F);
- discard any shellfish that do not open when cooked;
- eat shellfish right away after cooking and refrigerate leftovers;
- always keep raw and cooked shellfish separate;
- avoid eating oysters, or other seafood, when taking antacids as reduced stomach acid may favor the survival and growth of _Vibrio_ species;
- always wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap after using the bathroom;
- avoid exposing open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, or to raw shellfish. Wear protective clothing (like gloves) when handling raw shellfish;
- wash your hands well with soap before handling any food. Be sure to wash your hands, cutting boards, counters, knives and other utensils after preparing raw foods.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is commonest in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_. - Mod.LL
