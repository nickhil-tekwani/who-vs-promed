Many countries in eastern and southern Africa are currently affected by
severe outbreaks of cholera. Despite control measures which are being
undertaken, past experience suggests that the cholera epidemic will spread
to other countries, accompanied by a very negative impact on public health
and serious social and economic consequences.
National authorities in collaboration with WHO and other agencies are
continuing to implement and strengthen cholera prevention and control
measures in the affected countries and countries at risk. The cholera
situation in the region has triggered questions and interest regarding
appropriate measures to prevent the international spread of cholera. In
this context WHO would like to refer interested readers to the WHO
Guidelines for Cholera Control.
<http://cdrwww.who.ch/pub/cholera/cholguid.htm>
WHO advises that travel and trade restrictions have never proved to be
effective in controlling the international spread of cholera but that sound
public health practices are the most effective approach. WHO therefore
recommends that: countries should not use travel and trade restrictions,
quarantine or frontier controls in the efforts to prevent the spread of
cholera; if there is a theoretical risk of cholera transmission through
trade, agreement should be reached between exporting and importing
countries on the most appropriate public health measures to prevent
transmission. These could include measures to validate good practices at
food processing plants Tourism to cholera affected areas should not be
restricted no country should require travellers to have been vaccinated
against cholera (International Health Regulations) mass chemo-prophylaxis
should not be used in efforts to control cholera.
CDPC Note: These recommendations have been made for decades. However, many
countries still resort to these ineffective measures in an attempt to
appear that they are doing something to protect the public's health!
