New findings from two independent laboratories and preliminary findings
from a case-control study have implicated Battle Ground Lake as the source
of the August 1999 outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in Clark County,
Washington.
Laboratory Findings: At the Washington State Public Health Laboratory,
scientists have cultured _E. coli_ O157:H7 from a sample of sediment
obtained from the swimming area. Further, the genetic fingerprint of the
sediment isolate determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis exactly
matched the fingerprint pattern in all 24 swimmers and their contacts (the
outbreak strain) who have been tested thus far. To our knowledge this is
the first time that _E. coli_ O157:H7 has been isolated from a natural body
of water associated with an outbreak. In addition, at the University of
Washington, scientists have reported culturing _E. coli_ O157:H7 from
freshly formed feces obtained from a duck at the lake. The DNA fingerprint
from this duck isolate also precisely matched the outbreak strain.
Case-control study: Using a standardized questionnaire, information was
obtained from all confirmed cases and the following two sets of control
subjects: 1) children 1 to 14 years old whose families were registered to
camp at Battle Ground Lake State Park and 2) area residents under 15 years
old identified by sequential forward digit dialing. Preliminary analysis
has shown that swimming in Battleground Lake is associated with _E. coli_
O157 infection.
There have been 32 culture-confirmed cases in the outbreak; all cases have
been swimmers (27) or contacts of swimmers (5). Seventy-five percent of
cases have occurred in children under age 10. Seven children have been
hospitalized, including 3 children with hemolytic uremic syndrome. There
have been no deaths.
The most likely explanation for the outbreak remains contamination of the
lake by human feces. Battle Ground Lake has been closed to swimming,
boating, and fishing since August 28, 1999.
