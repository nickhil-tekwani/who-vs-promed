Further outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) have been identified
in the Northern districts of Bangladesh. It is suspected the virus may have
spread from the South-Eastern region of the country, where outbreaks had
been identified a month before.
An investigational team is working in the affected areas to identify the
virus and to find the degree of damage due to PPR.
The first outbreak of PPR was recorded during 1993; it caused huge economic
damage. The virus was identified as PPR by World Reference Laboratory
(WRL), UK. In the genetic study made by WRL, it was found the Bangladeshi
isolate is under the linkage of 3, which includes most of the isolates from
India and Middle East, including Israel.
