There is a toxic red tide along the west coast
of Cape Town (Atlantic Ocean) right at the moment. According to
the Sea Fisheries Research Institute in Cape Town, the current
reddish brown bloom is caused by the dinoflagellate _Alexandrium
catenella_. This organism produces saxitoxins that cause shellfish,
particularly mussels, to become toxic to humans. The Institute
also operates a telephonic red-tide information service that can be
reached at +27-21-439-4380.
