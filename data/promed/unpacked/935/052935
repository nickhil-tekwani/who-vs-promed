A 6-year-old child suspected of being infected with avian flu virus, died
at Adam Malik Hospital in Medan, North Sumatra, a hospital director said on
Thu 16 Nov 2006.
M. Nur Rasyid Lubis, deputy director of the hospital, said the child had
been treated at the hospital for 2 days. The child died at 1 a.m. Wednesday
morning with a temperature of 39 degrees [Celsius, or 102.2 degrees
Fahrenheit], after experiencing breathing difficulties, coughing and loss
of appetite, he added. The victim was previously admitted to a private
hospital near his home. However, because his condition did not improve, he
was transferred to Adam Malik Hospital, Rasyid said. A member of his family
said the child experienced a high fever for 2 weeks, following the death of
a number of chickens around his house.
Rasyid said more tests were needed to officially determine whether the
boy's death was caused by avian flu. The head of the North Sumatra Health
Office, Fatni Sulani, said his office had sent a blood sample from the
victim to a laboratory in Jakarta to help determine the cause of death. "We
need to wait 3 days before we can see the test results," Fatni said, adding
the death could have been caused by other illnesses.
Meanwhile, Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said during a visit to Medan
on Thursday, she had not received any information on the death of the
suspected bird flu patient. The minister said the number of deaths in the
country due to avian flu had reached 55 out of a total of 74 bird flu
cases. Siti Fadilah said the spread of bird flu in Indonesia was unique, as
the causes of the spread differed from one place to the other.
"After appearing in Karo (a regency in North Sumatra), where the virus was
spread by wild birds, it reappeared in Tangerang, Java, where it was spread
by contact between wild birds and domestic poultry," she said. "This means
as long as we cannot control the migration of birds, it will be
very difficult to stop the spread of the virus," Siti Fadilah said. The
minister reiterated that if in a certain region local poultry was found to
have the virus, the local administration had to make a quick decision to
cull the infected chickens. A fast decision was needed because the infected
chickens could transfer the virus to humans, she said.
According to the World Health organization, bird flu remains essentially an
animal disease but it has infected more than 250 people worldwide since
late 2003, killing more than 150, Reuters reported. The country has become
one of the front-lines in the battle against the disease. No country has
suffered from more deaths than this 17 000 island country where millions of
chickens roam backyards freely. Despite the rise in the human death toll,
the government has resisted mass culling of birds, citing the expense and
impracticality in a sprawling, populous country where many people are still
unperturbed by the bird flu threat.

[If confirmed the death of this patient would raise the number of
H5N1-associated human cases in Indonesia to 75 and the number of deaths to 57.
