South Dakota News Release, 10 JUL 2002
-----------------------
Jerauld County veterinarian diagnosed with anthrax as result of livestock
exposure

PIERRE - A Jerauld County veterinarian has developed cutaneous anthrax
after being exposed to blood and tissue during an autopsy of a cow. The
autopsy involved an unvaccinated cow that was recently added to a herd of
vaccinated cattle in a pasture adjacent to the premises where buffalo were
lost due to anthrax in August of 2001. Anthrax bacteria survive in soil
indefinitely and the disease is identified in cattle in various parts of
South Dakota nearly every summer.

So far 2 individuals who assisted the veterinarian have been placed on
antibiotic treatment as a preventive measure. The Department of Health is
asking health care providers in the area to be on active surveillance for
human cases and ranchers to be alert for animal cases. The South Dakota
Animal Industry Board has advised area ranchers to vaccinate their cattle
and bison. "It is important to know that anthrax does not spread from
animal to animal nor from person to person and that the skin form of
anthrax is entirely different from respiratory anthrax related to
bioterrorism" said Dr. Sam Holland, State Veterinarian.

The Animal Industry Board is planning an informal meeting for area
livestock producers at 7:00 PM Thursday, July 11 at the Springs Inn, 201 E.
Main, Wessington Springs, SD. A Department of Health representative will
also attend to answer questions about human exposure. The general public
is welcome.

"If individuals who have exposure to livestock develop skin lesions, they
should see their health care provider," said Dr. Kightlinger, State
Epidemiologist. "They can also contact the Health Department at
1-800-592-1861."

Individuals with questions about anthrax can pick up a department fact
sheet about the disease at locations in Wessington Springs including the
Sioux Nation Ag Center, the Jerauld County Clinic, and the department's
community health services office. Information is also available on the
department web site:
or by contacting the South Dakota
State Veterinarian's Office at 605-773-3321, or their web site:
