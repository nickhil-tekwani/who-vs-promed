Testing confirms H1N1 in NC pigs
--------------------------------
A federal laboratory has confirmed the presence of the novel H1N1
2009 influenza virus in samples taken from pigs at 2 North Carolina
farms. The animals have been under the care of a private veterinarian
and have recovered from the illness.

"The herd veterinarian noticed signs of mild illness in the pigs and
conducted tests to determine the type," state veterinarian David
Marshall said. "Confirmatory tests by the US Department of
Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory [NVSL] in Ames,
Iowa, indicated the virus was H1N1.

"Pigs are subject to flu viruses just like humans, so it's not
unexpected to find it in a herd," Marshall said. "These cases show
that our surveillance system is working."

People cannot contract H1N1 from handling or consuming pork or pork
products, according to the World Health Organization and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. The US meat inspection system
provides an additional safeguard by inspecting all animals presented
for slaughter.

"We want to reassure the public that it is safe to eat pork from
swine that have been infected previously and recovered from influenza
viruses, including novel viruses," state health director Jeff Engel
said. "As always, we will continue to work closely with the
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to protect the health
and safety of the public."

Tom Ray, DVM, director of livestock health at the NC Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, said it appears the pigs at both
farms caught the virus from humans. The herd owners indicated that
workers who had contact with the animals had exhibited flu-like
illness in the days preceding the animals' illness, Ray said.

North Carolina joins Minnesota, Indiana, and Illinois with confirmed
cases of novel H1N1 flu in pigs. The virus also has been identified
in cats in Iowa, Oregon, and Pennsylvania; ferrets in Oregon, turkeys
in Virginia, a dog in New York, and a cheetah in California. In all
these cases, it appears the animals caught the virus from humans.

[It is tragic that this strain of flu has so profoundly and
negatively affected the swine industry. The naming of this virus was
unfortunate. However, did the pigs recover before the NVSL confirmed
the strain of virus? Or was news of the findings not released until
the animals recovered? - Mod.TG]
