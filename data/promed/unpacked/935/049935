FMD confirmed at slaughter on suspicion site
--------------------------------------------
Positive test results for foot and mouth disease (FMD) have now been
confirmed at the site where it was decided that cattle should be
slaughtered on suspicion earlier this evening [21 Sep 2007]. The affected
animals are within the existing Protection Zone and this now becomes the
6th Infected Premises since 3 Aug 2007.
Minor changes have now been made to the Protection Zone (PZ) and
Surveillance Zone (SZ) in the area [see the updated PZ and SZ at

A 4th case of FMD has been confirmed on a farm in the Egham area of Surrey,
officials say. The Department for the Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
said that around 40 cattle had been culled on the premises, within the
current 3 km (1.8 miles) protection zone. Tests were carried out after the
animals showed signs of the disease. The disease has been confirmed at 3
other farms in the Egham area during the last 2 weeks; the latest case is
the 6th in Surrey since early August [2007].
A DEFRA spokeswoman said: "Positive test results for FMD have now been
confirmed at the site where it was decided that cattle should be
slaughtered on suspicion." She added that "minor changes" had been made to
the protection and surveillance zones. A number of sites outside Surrey
have also been investigated and several control zones set up, but these
have all proved to be false alarms.
On Thursday [20 Sep 2007] a temporary control zone imposed around a farm
near Solihull, West Midlands, was lifted after tests on animals for the
disease proved negative.
Laboratory results showed the latest incidence of FMD in Surrey revealed
the strain of the disease was the same as all the other cases in the outbreak.

[DEFRA's decision to cull the animals in this holding "on suspicion", prior
to laboratory testing, was based upon the clinical examination, probably
taking into consideration that the animals might have been exposed to
infection from neighbouring farms. Reportedly, animals in IP 5 (The
Krondyke farm), had been infected -- and potentially spreading the virus --
for weeks before eventually diagnosed and culled.
A useful map, showing the locations of IP3, IP4, and IP5 is available at
