While trying to avoid alarmism, global health agencies are steadily ratcheting up concern about bird flu in Asia. Bird viruses that can infect humans -- particularly those of the H7N9 strain -- continue to spread to new cities there.

Since October 2016, China has seen a "5th wave" of H7N9 infections. Nearly 1600 people have tested positive, almost 40 percent of whom have died.

Most had been exposed to live poultry, but a small number of clusters suggest that the virus could be passing from person to person.

In September [2017], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention summarized some disturbing developments. The H7N9 virus had become lethal to birds, which made it potentially more dangerous to people but also easier to spot. And the virus had split into 2 lineages -- called Yangtze and Pearl, after the river deltas in which each was spreading -- complicating efforts to make vaccines.

In October [2017], the World Health Organization put out an update citing new cases of H7N9 infection as cold weather set in and noting that poultry farmers were vaccinating flocks against both this virus and other strains.

At about the same time, a well-known virologist at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison showed that a Chinese H7N9 strain could both kill ferrets and be transmitted between them.

Because ferrets suffer roughly the same effects from flu that humans do, the development was "not good for public health," said the virologist, Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka.

Many microbiologists consider influenza to be the virus most likely to start a pandemic that kills millions, as the 1918 Spanish flu did. But the flu is notoriously unpredictable. Public health experts have become wary about raising alarms over new strains because the grave predictions made in 2005 and 2009 turned out to be overblown.

In 2005, it was feared that the H5N1 avian flu, which killed or forced the culling of millions of chickens and ducks, would mutate and spread widely among humans.

It still circulates, primarily in Egypt and Indonesia, but so far has not become a human epidemic. As of last month [October 2017], only 860 people in 16 countries had tested positive for the infection. Still, more than half of them died.

And in 2009, a new H1N1 flu virus containing genes from both American and Eurasian pigs emerged in Mexico, prompting scary "swine flu" headlines and the declaration of a health emergency. That virus has now become one of the seasonal flu strains circling the world. It has infected millions but has killed relatively few people.

The 2017-2018 flu season in the United States does not yet seem unusually threatening. But Australia, where winter recently ended, just suffered one of its deadliest outbreaks in a decade, and the H3N2 and B Yamagata strains that dominated there are now the most common ones in the United States.

Flu hospitalizations in this country rarely shoot up before mid-December, and Americans are far more likely than Australians to get flu shots.

[Since 2013, a total of 1564 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 612 deaths, have been reported to WHO. If the incidence of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of reported human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are therefore expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected in poultry from live bird markets, commercial and backyard farms. The agricultural authorities in China have announced that vaccination of domestic poultry against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses has commenced, in addition to the ongoing poultry vaccination program against avian influenza A(H5) viruses.

Information from a recent publication describes influenza A(H7N9) virus transmission of highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, which emerged in late 2016-early 2017. The study confirms that like the low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, this HP influenza A(H7N9) virus can transmit via respiratory droplets between ferrets. Vaccine viruses are being developed by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to cover this and other potentially similar HP A(H7N9) viruses.

Overall, the risk assessment has not changed. The influenza A(H7N9) viruses have not exhibited sustained human-to-human transmission since their emergence in 2013 and no significant changes in the virus properties or the epidemiology of human infections have been observed. Rapid sharing of information and viruses is essential to detect emerging changes and conduct rapid risk assessment with increased confidence. WHO, through GISRS, and in collaboration with the OIE-FAO Network of Experts on Animal Influenza (OFFLU), research and academic institutions and national authorities, will continue monitoring the A(H7N9) virus situation very closely (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_10_30_2017.pdf). - Mod.UBA]

[The 1st human cases of disease due to infection with a type A influenza virus of the strain H7N9 was announced in China in March 2013. Following reinforced surveillance by the veterinary authorities, it became soon apparent that the source of infection was located in live poultry markets. On 4 April 2013, China's Veterinary authorities notified the OIE about the occurrence of infection of pigeons and chickens with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N9, which was very similar to the virus infecting humans. In the absence of clinical signs, the farmers could not detect infections in poultry with LPAI H7N9, and most of these infections remained unreported.

The Chinese authors of a paper announcing the initial appearance of a zoonotic LPAI H7N9 strain warned: "H7 viruses may pose threats beyond the current outbreak. Their continuing prevalence in poultry could lead to the generation of highly pathogenic variants and further sporadic human infections, with a continued risk of the virus acquiring human-to-human transmissibility."(Ref 1).

Between April 2013 and August 2015, 43 "outbreaks" of LPAI H7N9 ("sub-clinical infections"), discovered by serological surveillance in live birds markets and in samples from some poultry farms which could be traced back as the origin of infected marketed birds, were reported. The event was declared 'resolved' in a final follow-up report submitted to the OIE on 31 Aug 2015, which meant that no more reports on LPAI H7N9 were to be submitted. All OIE reports on LPAI H7N9 and China's map showing the sampling locations, until Aug 2015, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13225. The spread of infections in humans continued.

In early 2017, a new HPAI mutant was found in human patients; the same HPAI mutation of the H7N9 strain was eventually shown in several poultry farms and this was immediately reported to the OIE. Clinical disease and mortalities in commercial poultry were 1st reported from China to the OIE on [Fri 24 Mar 2017] (see 20170324.4924555). In the presence of clinical disease in poultry, its reporting and subsequent possibility of control have been boosted. Hopefully, the other part of the warning/prediction published in Ref 1, namely the frightening appearance of effective human-to-human HPAI H7N9 infectivity, will not be similarly realized.

As of [Wed 25 Oct 2017], 38 locations, in at least 11 of China's provinces, tested positive for HPAI H7N9 in birds and/or the environment. A table presenting them, by province and sampling site (Live bird markets, commercial farms, backyards) , is available in FAO's H7N9 situation update of 25 October 2017, at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/h7n9/situation_update.html. Additional accumulating information on the issue, in animals and man, including a map, tables, figures, and links to 4 recent relevant publications, is to be found there as well. The next FAO update will be issued on [Wed 29 Nov 2017].
