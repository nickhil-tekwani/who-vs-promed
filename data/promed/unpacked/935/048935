Vaccination and biosecurity remain crucial in controlling equine flu outbreaks across the UK, the Animal Health Trust (AHT) has reminded owners.

There have now been 61 confirmed cases since the start of the year [2019], with the outbreak following the expected pattern.

"We are certainly hopeful that events raising their game and requiring vaccination will have had a positive effect on reducing transmission," an AHT spokesman told H&H.

"But the continued testing and positives does suggest that there is still a problem with a sufficiently large proportion of susceptible non-vaccinated horses and movement of them to allow equine flu to continue to circulate."

Many venues and national governing bodies are continuing to insist on horses' having received a flu vaccination booster within 6 months of arrival at an event.

In January 2019 there were 5 confirmed cases of equine flu, with 4 involving vaccinated horses -- more than double the total number of cases in both vaccinated and unvaccinated horses in the whole of 2018.

"February [2019] was busier with 35 outbreaks confirmed and with 9 [of those] involving vaccinated horses, there was heightened awareness from the headlines around racing," added the AHT spokesman.

"This was reflected in the amount of testing undertaken; this was more than all of the most recent year where we saw increased equine flu activity, 2014.

"March [2019] has quietened down, although we have still confirmed 21 positive outbreaks so far in March making it 61 altogether and we may see several outbreaks confirmed in a day, for example 3 were confirmed on [Wed 27 Mar 2019].

"However, this is a pattern that we might expect. The outbreak will almost certainly continue to grumble on and we expect to continue to make positive diagnoses, especially in clinically sicker non-vaccinated animals."

The Old Tiger Stables in Soham [Cambridgeshire, England] will remain closed for 2 weeks following an outbreak of equine influenza.

The stables called in a vet who said the virus has "hopefully" been contained.

A spokesman for the stables said: "We have hopefully contained the virus. We have had all horses swabbed and we are taking temperatures twice daily to help us monitor any further potential cases.

"The vet is happy the pony is doing well and getting better and we have all biosecurity measures in place.

"On advice from the vet we will remain closed for the next 2 weeks and will continue to give you regular updates.

"A big thanks to everyone for your kind messages and well wishes, it means a lot to us all."

Equine influenza (horse flu) is the disease caused by strains of influenza that are enzootic in horse species. It occurs globally, previously caused by 2 main strains of virus: equine-1 (H7N7) and equine-2 (H3N8).

[Equine influenza [EI], an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenzavirus A_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae. According to OIE's Manual, chapter 3.5.7 (last adopted May 2016), EI viruses [EIV] of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.07_EQ_INF.pdf).

While normally confined to equids, EIV H3N8 has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Infections of dogs have been reported in North America, generally producing mild fever and coughing, but fatal pneumonias have been recorded. Although EI has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described, primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

EI is endemic in the UK. The current event, starting earlier this year (2019), has been caused by a newly introduced strain, Florida Clade 1 H3N8 which has recently been recorded in several other western European countries. It has been suspected to cause clinical disease in some vaccinated animals.

EI is not reportable in the UK; the cited number and locations of the published cases is based upon information from non-governmental sources. - Mod.AS
