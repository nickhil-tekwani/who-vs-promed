West Nile Virus Infects 3 More People in New Jersey
---------------------------------------------------
Three more people in New Jersey have tested positive for West Nile
virus, bringing the state's total of infected persons this year to 4,
health officials said on Wed 19 Sep 2001. The new cases are the first
since a 72-year-old Bergenfield woman was diagnosed with the
mosquito-borne encephalitis on 29 Aug 2001. The woman, is recovering
at a rehabilitation center in New Jersey, said Dennis McGowan,
spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
The 3 new patients were hospitalized with symptoms of West Nile virus
infection, including fever and confusion. But their condition
improved, and they have been discharged, McGowan said. A 72-year-old
Camden city man was admitted to Cooper Hospital in Camden with West
Nile symptoms on 23 Aug 2001. An Edison man, 66, was admitted to JFK
Medical Center in Edison on 31 Aug 2001, and a Westfield woman, 78,
was admitted to Overlook Hospital in Summit on 5 Sep 2001. The 3
people were diagnosed following tests on blood and spinal fluid
samples by the state health department.
There have been no human deaths from West Nile in New Jersey this
year.
A horse in Burlington County was the state's first equine case of West
Nile this year, and was destroyed, McGowan said. West Nile is spread
to humans by the bite of mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. So
far this year, 825 dead crows and 254 mosquito pools collected from
across New Jersey have tested positive for the virus.
