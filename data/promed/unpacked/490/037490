An outbreak of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) was confirmed in the state
of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) on 27 Jun 2001 at a breeding farm in
Baja Sajonia in the district of Soltau-Fallingborstel (Lueneburg) 60
km North of Hannover, with 170 sows and 600 young pigs.
Pigs from this farm have been sold in the last 4 weeks to neighboring
farms and 2 farms in the region of Rotenburg (40 km to the northwest,
20 km east of Bremen), and to a farm in the Celle Region (10 km
northwest of Hanover). A 3 km zone, and 10 km control zones are being
established. So far 1200 animals have been killed on 2 farms. Wild
boar are the suspected source.
Last case of CSF (Wild-pig-Swine-Fever type "Uelzen 1") in
Niedersachsen was in June 1999 in Reckum, Oldenburg Region.
