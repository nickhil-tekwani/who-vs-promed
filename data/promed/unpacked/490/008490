First report of soybean rust caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ in Ghana
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nigeria is the only country in West Africa where soybean rust, caused
by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, has been officially reported (1). During
a disease survey in Ghana during October 2006, soybean (_Glycine
max_) leaves with rust symptoms (tan, angular lesions with erumpent
sori [clusters of spore-producing structures] exuding urediniospores)
were observed in 11 fields in the following districts: Kassena
Nankana in the Upper East Region; East Gonja, Central Gonja, and
Tolon-Kumbungu in the Northern Region; and Ejisu-Juabeng in the
Ashanti Region. Disease incidence in these fields ranged from 50 to
100 percent and disease severity ranged between 3 and 40 percent of
the leaf area on infected plants.
Urediniospores were hyaline [transparent], minutely echinulate [set
with small spines], and 23 to 31 by 14 to 18 micrometers. Within a
week of collection, leaf samples were sent to the USDA-ARS (US
Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service) Foreign
Disease-Weed Science Research Unit for verification of pathogen
identity. DNA was extracted from leaf pieces containing sori, and all
11 field samples amplified in a real-time fluorescent polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) with _P. pachyrhizi_-specific primers (2).
Sequence alignment further confirmed the identification as _P. pachyrhizi_ (2).
Infected leaves from 3 fields were separately washed in sterile water
to collect urediniospores that were used to separately inoculate 3
detached leaves (for each isolate) of a susceptible soybean cultivar
(TGx line; 3). Lesions on inoculated leaves developed 5 to 6 days
after inoculation (DAI), and pustules (105 to 120 micrometers) formed
7 to 8 DAI and erupted 3 days later exuding columns of urediniospores
similar in size to the initially collected isolates. Inoculating
another set of detached leaves with a spore suspension from the 1st
set of detached leaves resulted in typical rust symptoms.
The PCR assay, sequence alignment, morphological characters of the
isolates, and pathogenicity tests demonstrate that _P. pachyrhizi_
occurs in Ghana. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P.
pachyrhizi_ in Ghana.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902
as the cause of soybean rust. It was 1st confirmed on the African
continent on soybean in central Uganda in 1996, although several
unsubstantiated reports suggest an earlier presence on other legumes.
The fungus can cause premature defoliation, with yield losses of up
to 80 percent reported in Asia. It is now widespread in Australasia
and parts of Africa and has recently been reported from a number of
countries in the Americas, but data are lacking concerning its
establishment in Europe. It has a wide host range unusual for rust
fungi, and besides soybean a number of other species in the family of
_Fabaceae_ can also be affected. Weed species can serve as pathogen
reservoirs, and spores are spread by wind over long distances.
Fungicides may be used in disease management and partially resistant
soybean lines are available.
A less-virulent related species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in South
America and the Caribbean and also causes rust symptoms on a similar
range of hosts. Previously, these 2 species were considered strains
of the same species, with _P. pachyrhizi_ called the very aggressive
Asian strain, and _P. meibomiae_ called the mild American strain. New
strains of _P. pachyrhizi_ with increased virulence and fungicide
resistances are emerging.
TGx lines are newly developed African soybean cultivars known as
Tropical Glycine cross (TGx). They are able to nodulate with
_Brachyrhizobium_ spp., which are indigenous to African soils.
