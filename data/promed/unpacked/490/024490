Rabid Kitten Found On Staten Island
-----------------------------------------
A stray kitten found in the Huguenot area of Staten Island has tested
positive for rabies.
A New York City Health Department spokeswoman says the kitten was
found near Ida Court and North Railroad Street in Staten Island. One
person was bitten by the kitten, and several others either fed or had
direct contact with this kitten. They're currently being treated to
prevent rabies.
There hasn't been a case of human rabies in New York City for more
than 50 years.
The health department is trying to identify anyone else who may have
had contact with this black and white, tiger striped, 5-month-old
stray kitten. Anyone who has is urged to seek medical care and call
311 to notify health officials.
The health department says rabid animal activity is on the rise on
Staten Island. Since April 2006, 7 rabid raccoons and 2 rabid cats
have been identified.
New Yorkers should avoid contact with stray cats and dogs or other
potentially rabid animals, such as raccoons, skunks, or possums. They
should also make sure that their pets' rabies vaccinations are up to
date.
Rabies is most often transmitted through the bite or scratch of an
infected animal or when saliva of the infected animal comes into
contact with an open wound or a person's nose or mouth.

[Until approximately 1995 or 1996, when the spread of rabies reached
Staten Island, Post-Exposure Prophylaxis was not the standard
recommendation. It is currently the standard recommendation and is
the reason the health department is seeking others who may have been
exposed. - Mod.TG]
