During the last two weeks, 2 cases of measles were confirmed by Fiocruz`s
Laboratory( Osvaldo Cruz Foudation-Health Ministry)from serum by capture
EIA for the presence of IgM antibody.
One of them was a 2 year-old child who had received just one dose of
vaccine against measles, and the other, age 6 months, was unvaccinated.
Both with no history of other cases among householders or in daycare,
and no history of travel to known locales with transmission (Sao Paulo
and Bahia).
In Rio de Janeiro City there have been periodic vaccination
campaigns:
-1992; TARGET POPULATION: CHILDREN FROM 9 MONTHS TO 14 YEARS OLD, COVERAGE
RATE-98%, VACCINE-MEASLES.
-1996; TARGET POPULATION: CHILDREN FROM 1 TO 12 YEARS OLD, COVERAGE RATE
83%, VACCINE-MMR that was brought into routine practice for children at
age 15 months, as well as measles vaccine for children at age 9 months.
-ANNUAL CAMPAIGN; TARGET POPULATION: CHILDREN UP TO 5 YEARS OLD, twice a
year with multivaccine.
Since 1990, when 2888 cases with 12 deaths were reported, the incidence
has been decreasing showing, a remarkable decrease after 1992. The last
fatal case occured in 1991.
YEAR ATTACK RATE/100 000 inhab.
1990 53.22
1991 28.26
1992 5.97
1993 2.47
1994 1.33
1995 1.27
1996 1.88
Last year 102 suspect cases were reported, however none confirmed
by laboratory test (only 28 samples were sent for examination).
This year after the alert about outbreaks of measles in Sao Paulo and
Bahia, efforts are being made to optimize the early detection and control
of disease as well as a "catch-up" vaccination trying to keep up the
coverage rate.

[Measles appears to be re-emerging in Brazil, in spite of effective
vaccination campaigns. The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo on 9 July 1997
reported that 1157 cases had occurred in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area,
the worst outbreak for the last 5 years with, according to the Minstry of
Health, cases being "exported" to the states of Bahia & Ceara - Mod.JW]
