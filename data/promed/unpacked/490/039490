A baby from Redmond, Oregon, is recovering at a Portland hospital from an extremely rare case of infant botulism. Dr. James Lindsay said the 6-month-old is only the 2nd baby he has treated for that disease in his 16 years at Randall Children's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel. He also said he has never seen a baby develop the disease as quickly as this case.

The boy's family said he caught a cold from other family members one weekend in June 2013 and then quickly contracted pinkeye and an influenza-like illness according to hospital spokeswoman Maegan Vidal. By the following Monday he was lethargic and had stopped nursing.

"By Tuesday morning he stopped holding up his head and had a double ear infection and on Tuesday night his breathing was rumbly and cry was so weak his mother could barely hear him," Vidal said. "He also didn't want to open his eyes and wasn't moving his arms, legs or head much. His mother rushed him to St. Charles Hospital in Redmond and he had stopped breathing and turned blue by the time they arrived. He was placed on a ventilator and flown to Randall Children's Hospital.

Dr. Lindsay confirmed that the boy had infant botulism, a rare disease that was reported only twice in Oregon in 2010 and once in 2011. He did not say exactly how the boy came in contact with the toxin, but it's usually ingested from spores in dirt.

The boy was put on a ventilator and cared for in the pediatric intensive care unit; he is now off the ventilator but will still have to go through a long rehabilitation process, including feeding, occupational and physical therapies, but he's expected to make a full recovery.

[It is not stated whether the patient received the botulinum toxin antiserum generally used in this circumstance. Guillain-Barre syndrome, another potentially paralyzing condition, may present in a similar way and often occurs after a viral syndrome.

Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism rather than preformed toxin. It is the commonest form of botulism in the USA. In many cases, the source of the spores is not found, although honey has been a common vehicle. Babies being breastfed as the only source of food may also develop the illness.

A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult colonization botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the umbrella term intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ production of the neurotoxin. The following is the CDC editorial note (with references removed) from the 2003 report of a cluster of cases of infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the piece, apparent clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure generally is not identified; apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified."
