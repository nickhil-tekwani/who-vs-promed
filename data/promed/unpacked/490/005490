Monkey fever, a viral disease characterised by headache and haemorrhage, is sweeping through parts of Shimoga, Chikmagalur and Dakshina Kannada districts.

Also called the Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), it spreads through the bite of a forest tick, which carries the disease-causing virus from monkeys and other hosts to humans. The Health Department has already recorded 74 cases of monkey fever and has stepped up efforts to identify the affected and take preventive measures in Thirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks of Shimoga and other affected districts.

The department has deputed a mobile unit with a doctor and 2 nurses to create awareness among people about the disease. According to officials, they have covered 98 per cent of the houses in the targeted area in Shimoga and given 4500 bottles of medicated oil to families who visit forests.

Deputy Commissioner Vipul Bansal said the 1st case was reported from Kannangi in Thirthahalli. "As per protocol, people living in targeted areas close to the forest are vaccinated for 5 years in a particular season. After the incident, all have been vaccinated," said Bansal. He said that after a case of monkey fever was reported 4 months back, blood samples were taken from patients and sent for testing. After confirmation, a house-to-house survey was taken up. People have also been urged to notify authorities if they spot a dead monkey. "Dead monkeys have to be buried 5 km away from the village, and all people in the area have to be vaccinated," he said.

District Health Officer Rajesh Suragihalli said the disease does not have any specific treatment. As in other types of fever, treatment aims at bringing down body temperature, said Suragihalli. If the immune system is strong, the disease does not cause any damage, but if it resurfaces within a few weeks, it is dangerous, he said.

The DHO said healthcare workers have been directed to conduct house-to-house surveys and educate families on the disease.

[There have been previous reports of Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) cases in this area this year (2014). KFD virus is endemic in this area. As noted in the ProMED post of 1 Mar 2014 (archive no. 20140304.2313813), the disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state), where it is endemic. The increased rate of illegal felling of trees and deforestation has been blamed as one of the reasons for the outbreaks of KFD. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. The only way to prevent occurrence of additional cases is to avoid tick bites. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
