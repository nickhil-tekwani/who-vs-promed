Transmissible gastroenteritis in Israel
---------------------------------------
(Disease never reported before in Israel).
Information received on 6 Sep 2004 from Dr Moshe Chaimovitz, Director
of Veterinary and Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development, Beit-Dagan:
Date of the report: 6 Sep 2004.
3 outbreaks of transmissible gastroenteritis were reported in Acco
district (in Ibillin, Kafar Yasif and Mielya). Severe diarrhoea was
observed in sibling piglets (1-6 days old), ending with the death of
28 percent of infected piglets in 25 swine breeding farms.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 23 May 2004.
Estimated date of primary infection: 7 May 2004.
Total number of susceptible animals in the outbreaks: 48 120.
Total number of cases: 43 300.
Total number of deaths: 12 120.
Total number of animals destroyed/slaughtered: 0.
Source of agent / origin of infection: under investigation.
Control measures:
- strict movement restrictions on susceptible animals;
- vaccination of sows with infected material from piglets has reduced
mortality;
- other control measures in the outbreak settlements.
The favourable evolution of the epidemiological situation and the
results of the epidemiological surveillance activities (screening,
inspection, serological testing and additional studies), indicate
that the infection has stopped spreading.

[TGE is caused by a virus in the same coronavirus family that
includes Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus and others. Morbidity and
mortality in growers and finishing pigs is tolerable but can be
explosive and fatal in piglets less than 3 weeks of age. Symptoms
include watery, foul-smelling diarrhea and vomiting. TGE is
well-known in most swine-producing areas of the world.
The almost 4-month gap between the estimated date of primary
infection and reports to OIE is surprising, particularly in light of
the fact that the disease was widely reported in Israel -- see ref.

TGE has never been reported in Israel, and so when the disease was suspected
samples were sent to a reference laboratory in Europe. Subsequently, antibody
titers were found and the virus was isolated. The outbreaks occurred in a
very small area of less than 5 km proximity in northern Israel, and steps
were taken to control the disease at the first suspicion, before confirmation
of the disease was received.
