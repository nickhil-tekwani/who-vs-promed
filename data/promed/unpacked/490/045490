[Bluetongue (BT) is a disease of ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), the type species of the genus _Orbivirus_ in the family Reoviridae, a large group of double-stranded RNA viruses with 10-12 genome segments.

In the last couple of decades, there has been a dramatic northwards extension of the virus into Europe. The 3 principal routes by which BTV was introduced into Europe were Morocco-Spain, Tunisia-Sicily, and Turkey-Greece/Bulgaria. Climate change has been implicated in the emergence of BT in Europe. The continuing entry of new BTV strains into Europe is likely to be exacerbated in the future by further climatically induced increases in vector competence and extensions in vector distribution and seasonal activity.

_Culicoides imicola_ -- the major Old Word BTV vector -- has expanded its distribution northwards in the new century. - Mod.PMB
