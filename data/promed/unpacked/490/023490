San Salvador: 26 children die in viral gastroenteritis outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPAS)
announced on Thu 2 Mar 2006 that during January and February a total of 26
Salvadoran children had died as a consequence of viral gastroenteritis
caused by faecal contamination of water supplies and the environment. The
minister of health, Guillermo Mace, reported that so far among the children
succumbing to viral gastroenteritis, one has been confirmed as a case of
rotavirus infection. The minister stated that the rotavirus victim was an 8
month old child who died as a consequence of severe dehydration associated
with rotavirus gastroenteritis. The death of this boy is the first to be
attributed to rotavirus infection, the cause of the remaining 25 deaths
remains to be established. According to data from MSPAS, during January and
February a total of 55 634 cases of gastroenteritis were recorded.
Children under the age of 5 made up slightly more than 70 per cent of the
total. As the number of cases and fatalities increased from the middle of
January onwards a yellow alert was declared in 4 of the 14 departments of
El Salvador: Sonsonate and Santa Ana (in the west) and Libertad and San
Salvador (in the centre).

[Although only a single identification of an etiologic agent has been
obtained, the age range, characteristics of the outbreak and previous
experience in El Salvador are consistent with a diagnosis of rotavirus
infection. - Mod.CP]
