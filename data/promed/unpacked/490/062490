Scientists say they've solved the mystery of what killed the hundreds
of seabirds that washed onto Monterey Bay, California's shores in
late 2007. Their answer identifies a previously unrecognized cause of
death.

First several false leads were eliminated. The episode occurred
around the same time as a nearby oil spill and the aerial spraying of
a pesticide. But the birds' water-logged feathers, coated with an
unknown substance, provided a clue that more unusual forces were at
work.

Their investigation produced the real culprit: a sudsy foam that
stripped the natural waterproofing from the birds' feathers. A red
tide -- a major algae bloom that can harm wildlife and humans -- had
produced the previously unknown substance, they found. Such tides
have occurred before, but 2007's was particularly large and formed
just as big waves churned the choppy waters and many migrating birds
had arrived. Though the bad timing may be why 2007 was the 1st time
birds were affected, the authors said such events could become more
frequent.

Red tides, which are sometimes linked to nutrient pollution and
warming waters, are increasing both in Monterey Bay and around the
world.

[Fascinating! The algae capable of producing red tide can also
produce a surfactant. Although this article does not give us enough
information to understand if the algae are producing the surfactant
or if it is combination with something else, the original source
does. The source listed in the posting (Mass Stranding of Marine
Birds Caused by a Surfactant-Producing Red Tide) is available at
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004550>
and it states, "_Akashiwo sanguinea_ is capable of producing large
quantities of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which are
water-soluble and serve as powerful surfactants." - Mod.TG/CopyEd.MJ]
