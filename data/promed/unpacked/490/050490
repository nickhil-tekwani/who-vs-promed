>> QUESTION/THESIS:
>
> However, and that is where we (with a veterinary science background) come
in, should a recipient, who is 'carrying' a foreign organ be afraid of
microorganisms, which are pathogenic to the donating animal? In other
words, if swine fever is breaking out is that a threatening situation for a
recipient, with a kidney, which was grown and formerly owned by a pig?
> We hope that you can philosophise on this subject and we are very
interested in your discussion.<<
I think one of the major fears is that humans may become mixing bowls for
pathogens, producing human pathogenic organisms that previously were only
pathogenic for pigs, much like the recent theory that pigs have become
mixing bowls for avian / porcine / human influenza viruses.

To answer to the question asked by Aldert A Bergwerff about theoretical
risks associated with xenotransplantation, I'd want to make clear something
which was not mentioned in this message (as far as I understood it).
To my knowledge, it was never thought that pigs from usual farms could be
donors. There are special breedings in sterile conditions for that special
application (one already exists in western France and there may be many
others)
Only gnotobiotic (or axenic) pigs, which would have grown in perfectly
sterile conditions, could be candidate for xenotransplantation. So, the
risk of pathogens inhabiting pig's tissue would be therefore very limited,
as long as it concerns microorganisms.
On another point, as there would be special pig-breedings, in the special
aim to generate potential organ donors, all control tests (veterinary,
genetics...) could be carried out before or just after the animal is
killed. So
Of course, these risks have not to be neglected but I am led into thinking
that pigs would be "saner" donors than humans!

In the moderators comments he stated that the question could be asked,
"Will pig be affected by human pathogens" in relation to the rising
discussion of pig pathogens infecting humans with transplanted organs. I do
not think that this really has any application, since the pig is not
receiving any organ from the human. If the pig was receiving transplants,
then maybe there is some type of discussion, but otherwise, this question
is not really applicable to the topic.

[My suggestion was not totally tongue in cheek as the 'pig' is receiving an
organ ... the recipient human body and all it contains, including the blood
system keeping the pig organ going in its new home. Maybe transformations
can go on in both directions? Let us imagine, for the sake of theoretical
argument only, a pig farmer who receives a replacement kidney from a
gnotobiotic pig, recovers well, and one day while inspecting his healthy
pigs, he is taken short and pees in the pigshed ... Is he putting his pigs
at risk, the possible nature of that risk, and probabilistic size of it? I
suspect that the risk is trivial but my father taught me that one should
always ask the obvious questions as those are the ones folk don't ask. -

I read Dr. Bergwerff's post on ProMED-mail about xenotransplantation. There
are several excellent reports and articles on the subject of viral risks
from pigs and primates that members of this list may wish to receive. If
anyone would like copies, please e-mail or send me your address and I will
forward them to you.
I am the spokesperson for the Campaign for Responsible Transplantation
(CRT), an international coalition of physicians, scientists, health care
professionals and laypersons representing over 2 million people around the
world, who oppose xenotransplantation because of the risks of transferring
animal viruses to humans. About 50 physicians, scientists, veterinarians
and lawyers have signed onto a legal petition that we are filing with the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ban xenotransplants.
Last-minute signers are welcome, by December 1st.
There are numerous medical, scientific, medico-legal, economic,
environmental, and ethical problems associated with xenotransplantation.
For example, with 43 million Americans lacking basic healthcare, and 29
million underinsured in 1997, how can we justify resource allocation to
such an expensive technology. Screening one pig for (known) viruses will
cost $18,000. Nextran, breeder of transgenic pigs, acknowledges that animal
organs will cost as much as human organs. With the intensive monitoring,
follow-up care, immunosuppressive drug regimes, quarantine programs, and
lawsuits that may result from members of the public being involuntarily
exposed to animal viruses, these costs will likely soar. The U.S. Institute
of Medicine reported that xenotransplantation would increase annual
transplant costs from $3 billion to $20.3 billion. These are not small
considerations. Xenotransplantation's clinical track record is appalling,
with 100% of patients dying after receiving whole animal organs. Animal
experiments have also been disappointing, with most animals surviving 3
months with a xenograft. Moreover, animal experiments will not tell us how
an animal organ will function in a human.
In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency is clamping down on hog
breeding operations, as they have become an environmental hazard, dumping
billions of gallons of untreated manure into our nation's waterways,
killing fish and making people sick. Do we really need more pig facilities?
The answer, though it is not a profitable one, is to invest in disease
prevention. Last year the U.S. spent $425 billion treating the six leading
preventable chronic diseases, including heart disease, hypertension,
stroke, and liver disease. Studies have shown that low-fat vegetarian
diets, combined with exercise programs can prevent and reverse disease.
It is time we invest aggressively in these programs and stop meddling with
dangerous and unethical technologies that will place global human health at
risk, causing untold human and animal suffering.

[Some ground rules if this thread is to continue. Firstly, we limit
ourselves to the science, preferably hard science, of the subject and
ignore the other dimensions, however attractive, including the economic and
social opportunity costs of this research and development. Secondly, we
assume that the pigs to be used in these transplants are all very specially
bred and maintained gnotobiotic/axenic animals, and in due course that the
economics and availability will become attractive as in any profitable
industry. Thirdly, the original questions was and still is: "Should a
recipient, who is 'carrying' a foreign organ be afraid of microorganisms,
which are pathogenic to the donating animal?" - Mod.MHJ
