_Cochliomyia hominivorax_ is the scientific name of a screwworm that is
found in the Western Hemisphere, but that was introduced into Libya in the
late eighties ... reportedly the fly is under control there now. Are you
sure that this is the screwworm that is causing the Iraqi problems? Are you
actually referring to _Chrysomyia bezziana_?

This message is to clarify that the scientific name of the Old World
screwworm is _Chrysomya bezziana_ and not _Cochliomyia hominivorax_, which
is the Latin name for New World screwworm.

[Let this be a lesson to me for not checking what the parasitologist in the
next office told me. My mistake, my responsibility. Thanks to Mssrs.
