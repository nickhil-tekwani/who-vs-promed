A spell of anthrax is observed in a village in Saratsky district, Odessa region, southern Ukraine. The local police reported this on [Tue 2 Oct 2018]. According to preliminary data, the source of the disease is a domestic cow, who was slaughtered for meat. 5 people who skinned her suffered the symptoms and were taken to hospitals; they are under the supervision of doctors. Their lives are beyond danger.

The local government ruled to conduct anti-epidemic measures due to the emergency situation across the entire village. The village is surrounded with 6 quarantine posts, with the police, National Guard and State Emergency Service workers staying there. They prevent the local villagers from any attempts to bring the cattle and cattle products in or out of the village.

The Odessa Regional State Administration has reported an outbreak of anthrax in a single location within Odessa region, with 5 local residents being hospitalized. All cases were recorded in the village of Minyalivka in Odessa region's Saratsky district, the Administration told UNIAN on 2 Oct 2018. According to preliminary data, over the recent few days, 5 residents of the village have been hospitalized with cutaneous anthrax infection.

Measures are now being taken to contain and prevent the spread of the infection, a local official said. According to the regional administration, all said persons were involved in butchering the infected animal and/or consuming its meat.

Anthrax is a particularly dangerous infectious disease of livestock and wild animals, as well as humans. It is characterized by intoxication, the development of serosanguineous inflammation of skin, lymph nodes, and internal organs. It proceeds as cutaneous or septic infection (animals also have intestinal and pulmonary forms of infection).

[Anthrax is truly sporadic in the Ukraine, which will foster butchering sick animals, as has occurred here. Hopefully the vaccination and quarantine of the livestock in this village will be effective. The off-and-on reappearance of this disease under these circumstances is always a puzzle. My 1st hypothesis would be to check whether some spores might have surfaced at the site of am anthrax cattle grave. Rainwater will float them up if they are just a dozen or so centimetres down. Grave soils are easily sampled and the "grave" will be about 2 m x 1 m in extent and sunken. Such a basin collects rainwater and if you walk around the pasture easy to recognise. Otherwise, check the health of the neighbours' cattle. A tabanid feeding on a sick and dying unreported death can initiate cases in the neighbourhood. - Mod.MHJ
