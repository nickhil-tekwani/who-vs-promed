Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System officials have confirmed a horse from Outaouais Region, Quebec, as positive for neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) [also known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis or EHM]. The horse presented with clinical signs including fever, ataxia (loss of muscle control), mild cough, problems urinating and defecating, and recumbency (down and unable to rise). The horse, whose vaccination status was unknown, was euthanized. 6 horses were exposed and remain under official quarantine.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[The report in ProMED post of 20 Feb 2021, Equine herpesvirus - North America (03): Canada (QB) horse 20210220.8203803 states that 39 horses were exposed and "half" infected. While the report in this post is from the same general area (Outaouais Region) it it is not clear if this is actually from the same outbreak (same affected farm) or a separate outbreak in a different farm suggesting spread in the region. Clarification of this would be greatly appreciated.

Consequently, we are, sadly, likely to see more notices of EHV in the area. We wish them the best and hope the animals recover quickly. - Mods.TG/MPP
