The Department of Health (DOH) expressed concern over the rising
number of dengue cases this year [2008], saying authorities have
recorded nearly 10 000 dengue cases from January to April [2008]
alone. In a surveillance report, the DOH National Epidemiology Center
(NEC) indicated that the cases covering 1 Jan-10 Apr [2008] already
hit 9555. This is higher by almost 30 percent compared to the number
of cases during same period last year [2007].

"This (figure) is 29.4 percent higher compared to the same period
last year [2007], when it stood at 7384 cases," the report stated.
The report also noted that deaths due to dengue stood at 111, which
is higher by as much as 29 fatalities as compared to last year
[2007], the report said.

According to the report, National Capital Region (NCR) posted the
bulk of the dengue cases with 2443 victims. Of the 2443 Metro
victims, the city of Manila had the most number of cases with 687
followed by Quezon City and Caloocan City with 362 and 328, respectively.

The same report also showed that Central Visayas (1384), Central
Luzon (1221), Calabarzon (881), Zamboanga (805), and Soccsksargen
(655) likewise recorded high number of dengue cases.

Dr Lyndon Lee Suy, DOH Emerging and Reemerging Disease Prevention
National Program manager, advised the public to continuously search
for areas where dengue [virus]-carrying mosquitoes thrive and
subsequently clean such breeding grounds.

"We must always practice the search and destroy strategy. It remains
to be the best way to combat dengue fever," Lee Suy told reporters,
adding that the public to continue self-protection measures and
immediately seek medical consultation at the 1st signs of dengue.

The number of dengue fever patients has grown to 387 people. Although
the rainfall has decreased, in April and in May as the peak of the
endemic spread [of] dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), [people] still
must be on extra alert.

Although several territories have done fogging or fumigation, the
situation for numbers of [dengue] patients continues to be quite
high. During the past April [2008], at least 387 dengue patients were
treated. This figure does not yet include the daily data of the
[dengue] patients for May, although to date in mid-May [2008], an
additional 96 [dengue] patients have been treated.

The state of Ceara now has 17 384 cases of dengue confirmed this year
[2008]. Most [of the cases] -- 10 381 cases (73.7 percent) -- have
been recorded in Fortaleza. The capital of Ceara also has 4 of the 9
deaths caused by this disease in the state. The other deaths occurred
in Caucaia, Redemption, Oros, Itapipoca, and Quixada, one in each of
these cities.

Another 20 deaths suspected to have been caused by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito dengue vector are still under investigation,
according to the weekly newsletter released this Fri 16 [May 2008],
by the secretary of Health of Ceara.

The secretary of health of Fortaleza, Odorico Monteiro, now admits
that there is an epidemic in the city. Until last month [April 2008],
he spoke of a pre-epidemic of the disease, but the trend [in numbers
of dengue cases] has been increasing, with a shift in the epidemic curve.

In 2006, the highest concentration [of dengue cases] was in the month
of July with 4000 [dengue] patients. Last year [2007] there were 2000
cases in May and 3000 in April. After almost a month [this year,
2008], the secretary of health of the state of Ceara, Joao Ananias,
acknowledged that the state is facing an epidemic of dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

[Several collective mobilizations] to control and prevent dengue will
hit the streets of Fortaleza on Sat 17 [May 2008]. The work is being
done by the Prefecture of Fortaleza. The effort to eliminate the
breeding [sites] of the mosquito vector of the disease [virus] will
mobilize the participation of the population and various sectors of
the government.

Araraquara, 270 kilometers [168 miles] from the [state] capital,
registered 41 more dengue cases in a week. The total for the city for
the period 1 Jan [2008] until the present, reported this Friday [16
May 2008], was 1043 dengue cases, with 5 of these being imported
[from other localities]. Another 141 await [laboratory] test results.

The municipality is the 1st in Sao Paulo state to register an
epidemic of the disease, but according to Epidemiological
Surveillance the numbers [of dengue cases] is beginning to fall.
Colder weather is an ally in the control of the disease, because the
mosquito [dengue virus vector] _Aedes aegypti_ takes longer to reproduce.

At the peak of the epidemic, the municipality registered 123 cases in one week.
