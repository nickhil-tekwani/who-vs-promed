Third Brecon Beacons sheep cull completed
-------------------------------------------
The cull of a further 1300 sheep on the Brecon Beacons in mid Wales, has
been completed. The Welsh Assembly announced the mass slaughter on Friday
after blood test results found low levels of the virus. The slaughter on
Saturday brings the number of animals killed on the Beacons in recent weeks
to 6500. But farmers are still awaiting the results of blood tests on a
further 4000 sheep which were carried out this week. A Welsh Assembly
spokesman said the results were expected after the weekend.
A picture is emerging of how foot-and-mouth has moved around mid Wales and
Rural Affairs Minister Carwyn Jones has been upbeat about efforts to trace
and combat the disease. "The results we had confirm an emerging picture,
whereby the disease is getting less the further away you get from Libanus,"
he said. "All the evidence so far suggests that the disease has been
spreading on the mountain from one original point and that the level of
infection drops sharply as we move out from that point. It provides us with
some comfort - the disease isn't as widespread as people had feared at one
time."
Mr Jones said the fact that the latest results supported the theory that
the disease was spreading from one source, was positive. "This reinforces
our confidence that a robust approach to culling will eradicate the disease
in the Pen-y-Fan area. We will continue to conduct tests in that area and
more widely on the Beacons," he said. "As part of this approach, the State
Veterinary Service and the graziers involved have agreed that the best way
forward is that a further 1300 sheep will be culled, on the basis that they
had been in contact with infected animals."
With more test results still awaited, there have been fears the disease
threatens the entire flock of 100 000 sheep in the Beacons.
The decision to continue the culling in Brecon came as the Department of
Environment and Rural Affairs announced the resumption of the disinfection
scheme to rid farms in England and Wales of the disease. It had been halted
by the government for a two-week review amid concerns over escalating costs.

[The British press is presently releasing tantalizing details of highly
inflated contractor costs & demands and of farmer compensation payments in
the millions of pounds. Whether these are exceptions and how much is spin
will be clear when the review report is issued. Of more import would be
what happened at Libanus to make it a major & effective disseminating
source of virus. Enlightenment would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
