Five people were infected with listeriosis within a one-week span earlier in April 2015, the Danish State Serum Institute (SSI) said on Tue 28 Apr 2015. Two of them died within 30 days of the bacterium's discovery.

The institute said that 2 of the new cases resemble the same type that was present in batches of the popular deli meat rullepolse produced by the company Jorn A. Rullepolser in 2014. That outbreak began in August 2014 and infected a total of 41 individuals, 17 of whom died. Two of the other new cases resemble previous minor outbreaks, while the 5th is infected with a type of _Listeria_ that has not yet been seen.

"It's unusual to have 5 cases in one week. Normally we see one case of listeriosis per week. But it is also unusual that we were able to so quickly determine the type of _Listeria_. That is a sign that our monitoring for the organism has gotten better," SSI spokesman Kare Molbak said.

The Jorn A. Rullepolser listeriosis outbreak led to a total of 30 products -- including variations of rullepolse, salami and hot dogs -- being recalled from stores nationwide. The company was shut down as a result.

The source of the new cases was not immediately known, Molbak said. "It's the same bacteria as in the rullepolse outbreak. So it's possible that the old outbreak has been rekindled," he told public broadcaster DR.

SSI said that the majority of those who have been infected with _Listeria_ had weakened immune systems. Fatality rates among infected individuals is 25 percent, the institute said.

Denmark normally sees around 50 listeriosis cases per year, but in the years 2009-2014, that number was closer to 100.

[The locations of the 5 cases in Denmark are not stated in the posting, but it seems to be the case that the strains are not all genotypically related.

The following is part of a moderation written by my colleague ML regarding listeriosis:
"Listeriosis is an illness caused by eating foods contaminated by the bacterium, _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive bacillus. _Listeria_ can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. The process of making asparagus soup, if cooked at temperatures higher than 150 F (65 C), should have killed _Listeria monocytogenes_, the gram-positive bacillus that is the cause of listeriosis, in any of the soup's ingredients. However, _Listeria_ can contaminate foods after the food is cooked, and unlike many other foodborne bacteria, _Listeria_ multiply at refrigerator temperatures (between 35-38 F (2-3 C). If previously refrigerated soup had been reheated sufficiently before serving, _Listeria_ again should have been killed. The FDA recommends that soups, sauces, and gravy should be brought to a boil when reheating, and leftovers should be reheated to 165 F (74 C) (http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm079667.htm). Presumably, the asparagus soup was served cold or insufficiently reheated to hospitalized patients, many of whom were likely at high risk of developing listeriosis."
