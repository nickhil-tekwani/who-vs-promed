Canada moves to thwart bird flu
-------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) yesterday ordered the culling of
19 million domesticated fowl in British Columbia after a bird flu outbreak
spread beyond a "hot zone" surrounding a handful of affected farms. The
order will have an impact on 80 per cent of British Columbia's chicken and
turkey producers. 2 Canadian poultry farm workers have caught mild forms of
the H7 avian influenza, but the strain is not life-threatening to humans,
and the 2 recovered.

WHO starts process of developing human vaccine to BC avian flu strain
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) is starting the process of producing a
human vaccine for the H7 avian flu virus ravaging poultry stocks in British
Columbia, and Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory will be one of the
centers working on the project.
Dr Frank Plummer, the lab's scientific director, confirmed on Tuesday that
the Winnipeg facility will be one of at least 2 labs in the world that will
try to develop what's called a viral seed -- a genetically modified version
of the H7 virus that could be used by commercial vaccine makers should the
H7 strain emerge as a pandemic strain. That [possibility] appears unlikely
at this point, but nevertheless national and international health
authorities have to prepare for the possibility. It's also good practice
for when the next pandemic -- believed by influenza experts to be
inevitable -- comes, Plummer said.
"In some ways we're treating it like that," he said in an interview from
Winnipeg. "It's part of (pandemic) preparedness." Producing a seed vaccine
for an H7 virus requires the capacity to use reverse genetics, a procedure
in which the part of the virus which is deadly to chickens is plucked out.
Vaccines are grown in fertilized eggs; unless an H7 virus is modified, it
would kill the embryos and arrest the process. If all goes well the process
should take between 4 and 6 weeks, Plummer said.
Plummer confirmed that the national lab would provide WHO with samples of
the viruses taken from the 2 people who were infected with the H7 virus in
British Columbia. Those samples were sent off to the national lab Tuesday
by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver.
WHO pandemic planning guidelines require the organization to commence
production on a human vaccine for an avian influenza strain once there is
evidence 2 people have been infected in an outbreak, a spokesperson for the
Geneva-based organization explained. "We had to do it. You have 2 human
cases. Zip! It's automatic," said Dick Thompson, communications director
for the communicable diseases branch. Thompson admitted that the project
will probably not proceed with the same level of urgency that surrounded
efforts to develop a seed vaccine for the H5N1 strain that has killed 22 of
33 people infected during an extensive outbreak in Asia earlier in 2004.
"You guys have the resources to deal with this. There's rapid and
transparent reporting . . . so you know where the disease is. There's not a
lot of argument about how to get rid of the infected birds. You're moving
ahead with mass culling, which is exactly what should be happening. You
have trained workers that are being given the right personal protection
equipment. And so you've got a virus that seems to cause relatively minor
disease so far in a situation where there's widespread knowledge and an
abundance of resources to deal with the problem."
The H7 strain hasn't proved to be as serious a threat to human health as
the H5N1 strain, though one person died in a large H7 outbreak in the
Netherlands in the spring of 2003 during which at least 89 people were
infected. The Dutch outbreak was caused by an H7N7 strain. The 2 Canadian
cases are believed to be a different strain of influenza, H7N3.
Confirmation of the neuraminidase or N factor in the human cases will be
done at the Winnipeg lab, said virologist Martin Petric of the BC disease
control center.
The influenza lab at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis,
Tennessee, USA may also be involved in the project. "Certainly if we're
asked as part of a WHO effort, we're certainly willing to do whatever is
needed from us," said Dr Richard Webby, who is leading an effort there to
produce a viral seed for the H5N1 influenza strain.
Late last week Thompson revealed that one of 3 laboratories working to
develop a prototype vaccine for the H5 virus had succeeded. A British
government lab, the National Institute for Biological Standards and
Control, will announce this week that it has completed that task.
