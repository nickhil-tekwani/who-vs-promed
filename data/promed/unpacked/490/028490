Mauritius health officials stating reporting sporadic measles cases in late-March 2018 and by mid-May [2018], the measles epidemic threshold was met.

From March through late August [2018], 808 confirmed measles cases, including 3 deaths (case fatality ratio 0.4 percent), have been reported in Mauritius. 2 districts, Port Louis and Black River, have been the most affected.

The 3 reported deaths occurred among immunocompromised adults, aged between 29 and 31 years.

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa isolated the D8 genotype of the measles virus in a number of samples.

During this outbreak, about 50 percent of the confirmed cases never received any measles containing vaccine and an additional 29 percent didn't know their vaccination status. 20 percent of the confirmed cases received 1 dose of measles containing vaccine.

This outbreak comes after about a decade since the last case of measles was detected in the country in 2009.

[A measles outbreak has been ongoing in Mauritius since March 2018. The case count has risen from 450 to over 800 since that time. 3 immunocompromised people are reported to have died from the infection. The increase in the cases of infection over the last 6 months indicates that there is active transmission of the disease in the country. There is a vaccine for measles, however, outbreaks continue to hit several African countries, causing the deaths of children. The vaccine is part of the vaccination schedules for children in Africa that is given at 9 months of age, with a booster at 14 months of age. Unfortunately, in Mauritius the infection affects adults as well.

Some parents/guardians refuse to take their children for vaccination because there is a misconception that the vaccine causes other diseases, including autism. Other people also refuse to take their children for this particular vaccination for religious reasons. More needs to be done to make parents/guardians have confidence in vaccination.

Most times, unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death. Unvaccinated pregnant women are also at risk, as are any non-immune persons (who have not been vaccinated or were vaccinated but did not develop immunity). There could be several adults who may be immunodeficient who could be infected with the measles virus.

Measles is caused by a virus of the paramyxovirus family that is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals.

In countries where there have been outbreaks of measles, health authorities have embarked on a vaccination campaign to reach out to those who might have missed it when they were young and even those who might have taken it. This might be the way to go for the health authorities in Mauritius. - Mod.YA

Mauritius, officially the Republic of Mauritius (French: République de Maurice), is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km (about 1250 mi) off the southeast coast of Africa. The increase in measles burden is very similar to other countries where vaccination hesitancy has become strong. - Mod.LK

Until 31 Aug 2018, pediatricians at the JM de los Ríos hospital in Caracas had received 1074 cases with symptoms of the [measles] virus. There was a drop in admissions of the new affected people because the outpatient clinic has been limited by the indefinite strike that the health sector has maintained for the past 2 months.

Six children have died from measles at the hospital, since they began receiving the 1st cases with the disease in December 2017, after the epidemic spread from the south and the east towards the capital region of the country.

The majority of lethal cases were children under 2 years of age who had not been adequately immunized against the viral infection. The cause of the deaths was respiratory complications associated with this highly contagious disease.

The cases swell even more the measles mortality data reported, so far, by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which indicates that Venezuela has notified, since the disease reappeared in July 2017, 115 deaths due to the virus. These include 53 indigenous people of the Yanomami ethnic group, who live in the state of Amazonas. The Ministry of Health has notified PAHO that only 2 measles deaths have occurred in Caracas.

Regarding the incidence of cases, epidemiologists and infectologists of the children's hospital agree that there was an increase in admissions between January and June; but in the following 2 months they have observed a decrease attributed to 2 reasons: that consultations in the pediatric clinic have been limited by the medical strike that began in June 2018 or that the cases decreased because the Government began to vaccinate massively in the city. "Last week [week of 27 Aug 2018] only 12 children with measles entered the triage of the emergency, and that was not the rule in the previous weeks," said a pediatrician.

The Department of Epidemiology of the JM de los Ríos hospital reported that 1074 cases entered the pediatric department with symptoms of measles between December 2017 and August 2018. It is not known with certainty how many of the children who were admitted with eruptive febrile syndrome and conjunctivitis received confirmation of the illness by the Rafael Rangel National Institute of Hygiene, although it was learned that until last April 2018, 159 children had been confirmed with measles in the pediatric hospital.

From the JM de los Ríos case count, 136 patients were hospitalized in the infectious disease area, while the rest of the children were treated on an outpatient basis. The common cause of hospitalization was respiratory infections.

The 1st cases of measles in Caracas began to be reported between 23 and 25 Dec 2017, 4 months after the disease reappeared in Bolívar state. As in the JM de los Ríos, children infected with the virus arrived at the Pediatric Elías Toro hospital, located in Catia [Caracas], at the beginning of last January [2018], mostly from the Sucre parish of the Libertador municipality [Caracas]. In that health center, until the middle of June 2018, 465 cases of measles were reported.

Currently, the Capital District is one of the entities with the highest incidence of measles, according to the epidemiological information of PAHO. Data from the Rafael Rangel National Institute of Hygiene, published by the Venezuelan Society of Public Health last May, pointed out that between December 2017 and March 2018, 235 cases of the disease were confirmed in all the parishes of the city. At the end of April 2018, 710 suspected cases of measles had been evaluated in the JM de los Ríos and in the Elías Toro hospitals.

Since the epidemic reappeared in 2017, the Ministry of Health has not divulged weekly epidemiological figures that allow knowing the incidence of the virus and the magnitude of the spread in the national territory. But the data sent by the ministry to PAHO detail that the country, 1 year after the resurgence of the disease, accumulated 4272 confirmed cases of the disease, of which 3545 were diagnosed between January and July 2018 in 23 states of the country.

The high rate of new cases that the country has sustained for more than 12 months led to the reestablishment of the endemic transmission of the viral infection in the territory, which meant the loss of recognition of the country as measles-free that PAHO granted to Venezuela in December 2016.

In view of the increase in cases, the government is executing, with the support of PAHO, a 2nd phase of the National Vaccination Plan, focused on protecting the population against measles and diphtheria, which began last April 2018. The Minister of Health, Carlos Alvarado, pointed out that in the 1st stage a national immunization coverage of 60 percent was fulfilled and aspires, in this 2nd approach of the program, to reach 95 percent of the population, as established by PAHO. So far, in the Healthy Child Control Service of the JM de los Ríos are applying triple and double viral vaccines, although, say pediatricians, the supply is not regular.

[Venezuela accounts for 95 percent of measles deaths recorded in the Americas, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on 20 Aug 2018. Venezuela not only has the largest number of confirmed cases of measles in the Americas, but also leads in mortality figures for the disease, recording 115 of 121 deaths reported to the agency.

It is not clear what is meant by "triple and double viral vaccines", but the standard dose and booster are sufficient for protection, and it most likely refers to the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and MR (measles, rubella) combined vaccines. - Mod.LK

No cases of measles have been reported in North Dakota and only 2 cases were found this year [2018] in Minnesota.

Both cases were reported in young children who contracted the virus during travels to Africa. Measles is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal virus. [...]

The disease was considered eliminated in 2000 because high vaccination rates led to low numbers of infections.

Last year [2017] more than 70 Minnesotans contracted measles, the largest statewide outbreak in over 20 years. The rapid spread of the virus was largely attributed to a lack of vaccinations among children.

There has not been a measles case in North Dakota since 2011.

Across the country, 124 cases of measles have been confirmed in 22 states and the District of Columbia. There have been 9 outbreaks, which occur when 3 or more cases are linked. With 4 more months to go before the end of the year [2018], there have already been more cases this year than last. In 2017, 118 people contracted the measles.

Local health authorities are again asking people to watch for symptoms of measles with 4 cases now confirmed in the Coffs Harbour to Woolgoolga area [New South Wales].

A further suspected case in an infant is being investigated. The cases occurred after 2 unvaccinated school-aged children returned from an overseas holiday with the disease and infected 2 classmates.

Of the 4 primary school-aged children, 3 are unvaccinated.

Director of North Coast Public Health Unit, Paul Corben said other cases may emerge as measles -- which is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing -- is highly infectious among people not fully immunised.

"I urge parents to ensure that their children are fully immunised to protect them and others in the community against infectious diseases. Infants under 12 months of age are particularly vulnerable to measles as they are too young to be vaccinated," Mr Corben said.

"Despite the Coffs Harbour area having a high vaccination rate of 93 percent of 5 year olds fully vaccinated, we have taken the precaution, under recent state legislation, of excluding 13 children from attending school who are not vaccinated or have not received the full course of 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine."

Mr Corben said the Local Health District's public health unit is contacting people known to have been in contact with these cases.

Anyone in the Coffs Harbour to Woolgoolga area who is not vaccinated against measles should be alert to symptoms, particularly those who were in Woolgoolga on 28 Aug 2018 or in the Coffs Harbour central business district on 29 or 30 Aug 2018.

As the investigation is ongoing, other places and times of potential exposure may be identified.

"The time from exposure to the disease and the onset of symptoms is typically about 10 days but can be as long as 18 days so people should be alert to symptoms until 17 Sep 2018," Mr Corben said.

[...]

Protecting children from potentially deadly diseases is a key priority for the NSW Government, which has invested approximately USD 130 million in the 2018-19 Immunisation Program budget, including Commonwealth and state vaccines.

The latest Annual Immunisation Coverage Report shows vaccination rates in NSW are at their highest level ever, with more than 94 percent of 5 year olds vaccinated against measles.

NSW children at 1 and 5 years of age have some of the highest measles vaccine uptake in Australia, boosted by programs including the:
- Save the Date app campaign (USD 5.5 million invested since 2013)
- Aboriginal Immunisation Health Worker program (USD 1.3 million annually)
- New NSW Government laws that came in on 1 Jan 2018 preventing parents who object to vaccination from enrolling their children in preschools and early childhood centres.

Mr Corben said it was important for people to see their GP if they have symptoms, and limit exposure to others until the GP has made a diagnosis.
