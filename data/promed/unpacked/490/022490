During the week of 5 Dec 2005, public health officials in Clark County,
Washington, were notified of 4 county residents with laboratory-confirmed
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection. All 4 residents reported having
consumed raw (that is, unpasteurized) milk obtained from a farm in
neighboring Cowlitz County, Washington. The farm participated in a
cow-share program, in which persons purchase interests in, or shares of,
dairy cows in return for a portion of the milk produced. The farm had 5
dairy cows and regularly provided raw milk to shareholders. In a cow-share
agreement, a person who does not own, house, or care for the milking cow,
signs a contract or an agreement with the owner of the cow, pays an initial
contract fee, and pays a monthly fee for the boarding and care of the cow.
Depending on state law, the person might subsequently have partial
ownership in the cow. In exchange for the fees, the person has the right to
receive on a weekly basis a certain amount of unpasteurized milk, milk
products, or both, produced from the cow. The person can either pick up the
unpasteurized milk at the farm, pay someone else to pick it up and deliver
it, or pay a fee to the owner of the cow to have the products delivered.
Although the sale of raw milk and cow-share agreements are illegal in
certain states, they are legal in Washington; however, Washington farms
that provide raw milk to consumers must be licensed, meet state
milk-production and processing standards, and pass health and sanitation
inspections by the state department of agriculture (1). The Cowlitz County
farm was not licensed. This report summarizes the investigation of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 cases associated with the farm and reinforces previous
warnings about the health hazards of consuming raw milk.
The farm's shareholder list, obtained through a court order, was used to
conduct a retrospective cohort study to identify risks for infection.
During 16-19 Dec 2005, shareholders were interviewed by telephone using a
standard questionnaire to collect information regarding their milk
consumption since 20 Nov 2005. Of the 45 families who held shares in the
dairy cows from the farm 43 were interviewed; information regarding 157
persons was collected. A case was defined as either 1) laboratory-confirmed
_E. coli_ O157:H7 infection, or 2) diarrhea with abdominal cramping or
blood in a person with illness onset during 20 Nov-13 Dec 2005, who was a
customer of the [farm's products]. Additional cases in the community were
identified using faxed health alerts and media releases to notify health
care providers, infection control practitioners, neighboring public health
agencies, and the public of the cluster of illnesses.
Among the 43 families who were interviewed, 18 cases were identified and 8
(44 per cent) of these were laboratory confirmed. Dates of illness onset
ranged from 29 Nov to 13 Dec 2005 (Figure -- see original URL - Mod.LL]).
Patients were residents of 2 south west Washington counties and one
northwest Oregon county. The median age was 9 years (range: 1-47 years); 90
(50 per cent) were female. Among the 18 patients, 17 (94 per cent) reported
diarrhea, 13 (72 per cent) bloody diarrhea, and 13 (72 per cent) abdominal
cramps. 5 patients (28 percent), aged 1-13 years, were hospitalized; 4 of
these had hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Seventeen patients were farm
shareholders or children of shareholders; one patient, a child aged 10
years, was a friend of a shareholder.
Of 140 persons who reported consuming raw milk from the farm, 18 (13 per
cent) became ill; among the 157 persons for whom information was obtained,
no illness was reported among those who did not consume raw milk. Among 102
of 140 exposed persons who provided information about their raw milk
consumption during 20 Nov-13 Dec 2005, the relative risk for illness
increased with the average number of cups of milk consumed daily. The
dose-response trend for average daily consumption was statistically
significant (p=0.008 by expanded Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test), with
attack rates of 3.6 per cent for 0-0.9 cups of milk, 6.7 per cent for 1-1.9
cups, 14.3 per cent for 2-2.9 cups, and 37.5 per cent for 3 or more cups.
Visiting the farm and consumption of raw milk products from other sources
were not associated with illness.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to analyze _E. coli_
O157:H7 isolates from stool samples from 8 patients; 7 (88.0 per cent)
isolates had PFGE patterns that were indistinguishable (pattern A), and one
isolate from an Oregon patient had a PFGE pattern that differed from
pattern A by one band.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 also was isolated from raw milk samples obtained from the
farm and a shareholder. In addition, _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from 7
environmental samples collected from the floor of the farm's milking
parlor. All _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates from milk and environmental samples
had PFGE pattern A. No _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from stool samples of
any of the farm's 5 cows.
During inspections of the farm, officials from the Washington State
Department of Agriculture (WSDA) noted mud and manure accumulation in the
entrance to the milking parlor and on the rubber mats covering the dirt
floors of the parlor. The bucket used for milk collection had direct
contact with these surfaces. Inspectors also noted inadequate hand-washing
facilities and improper procedures for cleaning milking equipment and
handling fresh milk.
On 9 Dec 2005, the farm contacted shareholders and advised them to discard
any remaining raw milk. After a court order was obtained by the Cowlitz
County Health Department and an embargo was placed by WSDA, the farm
discontinued sales of raw milk on 13 Dec 2005. No additional reports of
illness associated with the farm have been received.
Editorial note
--------------
_E. coli_ O157:H7 causes an estimated 73 000 illnesses and 61 deaths
annually in the USA (2). About 8 per cent of reported infections lead to
HUS, particularly in children aged less than 5 years and older adults (3);
4 per cent of patients with HUS die (4). Raw milk is an important vehicle
of transmission of _E. coli_ O157:H7 and other pathogens, including
_Mycobacterium bovis_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Campylobacter_,
_Brucella_, and _Salmonella_ species (5, 6). During 1988-2005, a total of
33 outbreaks of _Campylobacter_ species, _E. coli_ O157:H7, and
_Salmonella_ species infections associated with raw milk consumption were
reported to CDC (7).
Several findings from this investigation indicate that consumption of raw
milk was the cause of the outbreak: 1) all ill persons drank raw milk; 2)
the illness risk increased with the amount of milk consumed; 3) _E. coli_
O157:H7 was isolated from raw milk samples and environmental samples
collected from the milking parlor floor; and 4) PFGE patterns of isolates
from patient, milk, and environmental samples were indistinguishable.
Investigators found several factors that might have contributed to
contamination of milk at the farm, although previous outbreaks have
demonstrated that even raw milk collected using stringent hygiene methods
might be contaminated with pathogens (9).
Although many consumers are aware that raw milk can contain pathogens, some
believe that it has potential benefits (such as, vitamins that are present
naturally rather than added, enhanced fertility, and protection against
tooth decay). However, the validity of any health or nutritional benefits
from consuming raw milk has not been proven scientifically (6).
Raw milk is a well-documented cause of enteric infections and was 1st
recognized as such about 100 years ago (6). Pathogens that infect humans,
including _E. coli_ O157:H7, are shed in the feces of cows and can
contaminate milk during the milking process. Using standard hygiene
practices during milking (such as, washing hands, keeping equipment clean,
and keeping the milking area separated from other areas) can reduce but not
eliminate the risk for milk contamination. Pasteurization decreases the
number of pathogenic organisms, prevents transmission of pathogens, and has
been determined to improve the safety of raw milk more than other measures,
including certification of raw milk (8). Because raw milk certification has
failed to prevent many raw milk-associated infections in the past,
consumers should not assume that certified raw milk is free of pathogens
(9). To prevent _E. coli_ O157:H7 and other infections, consumers should
not drink raw milk.
In Washington, cow-share programs and the regulated sale of raw milk are
legal; however, the Cowlitz County farm was not licensed, and it did not
follow applicable sanitation and public health safety regulations. As a
result of this outbreak, WSDA revised regulations to help ensure that milk
producers who sell pasteurized milk and those who sell raw milk through
cow-share programs obtain the appropriate state licenses and comply with
milk-processing sanitation and public health guidelines. As of February
2007, raw milk could be sold legally in 27 states, including Washington.
During 1973-1992, a total of 40 (87 per cent) of the 46 reported raw
milk-associated illness outbreaks occurred in states in which the
intrastate sale of raw milk was legal (5). State milk regulations and
methods for their enforcement should be reviewed and strengthened to
minimize the hazards of raw milk.
Early in the 20th century, widespread adoption of the pasteurization
process led to substantial reductions in milk-associated disease, a
milestone in the history of food safety (10). In the 21st century, more
effective consumer education regarding the hazards of drinking raw milk is
needed to further reduce milk-associated diseases.

[This is the CDC report regarding this previously posted _E. coli_ O157:H7
outbreak. The discussion is quite pertinent. Other diseases that can be
related to unpasteurized milk are highlighted in these paragraphs extracted
from Leedom JM. Milk and infectious diseases in humans. Clin Infect Dis
2006; 43: 610-615 with the citations renumbered to be consecutive starting
from 1:
"In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that occurred
in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies virus, and
transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically possible. Temperatures
reached during pasteurization kill the virus. A total of 80 persons
consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2 cows, and 9 more
had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons received
post-exposure rabies prophylaxis, and there were no human cases of rabies.
A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure associated with
the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in
2006 (2).
Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually transmitted
to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcutus_ or _Ixodes ricinis_ tick,
is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia (3). However, the
virus can be found in the milk of cows and goats with tickborne
encephalitis and was reported to be transmissible to humans by the
consumption of unpasteurized milk (4). A case-control study failed to
confirm oral transmission (5).
A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among 122
residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period December 1983-July 1984
(6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked urgency, lack of systemic
symptoms, failure to respond to conventional antimicrobial agents, and a
long median duration of illness (median duration, 16.5 months). The
syndrome was linked to consumption of raw milk from a single dairy (6). No
etiologic agent was ever isolated. The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea
stopped when all of the dairy's output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT
Osterholm, personal communication).
Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly associated
with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an Illinois well
that had its water implicated as a vehicle of transmission (7). Another
outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although not associated with raw milk,
affected 58 (15 per cent) of 394 passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting
the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (8).
