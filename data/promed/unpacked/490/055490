Two days after the death of a 10-year-old AK at the civil hospital in Samana [Punjab state], the state drug controller authority has shot a letter to the drug controller general of India (DCGI), urging it to immediately stop the use of anti-rabies vaccine in the country. A copy of the letter has been sent to all civil surgeons into the state, with an instruction to discontinue the use of the vaccine in the wake of this recent tragedy.

The vaccine, AbhyaRab, has been manufactured by the Human Biological Institute, Tamil Nadu [state], which has supplied it to the entire state [Punjab]. The vaccine is available at all government hospitals in the state. However, with its quality coming under cloud now, the use of the vaccine has been suspended with immediate effect.

Apart from civil surgeons, the copy of this letter has also been sent to the manufacturing company, director of drug controller of Tamil Nadu, deputy drug controller of India, Ghaziabad on Friday [7 Mar 2014] by the state drug control.

Victim KA, who was a student of Class-5, died while 4 others fell ill after they were administered the anti-rabies vaccines at the civil hospital in Samana on [5 Mar 2014]. All the victims were given anti-rabies injections after which they complained of drowsiness and nausea. Following the death of Ankit, Patiala drug controller visited the Samana civil hospital and took samples of the vaccine. The samples were later sent to the Central Research Laboratory at Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh [state] for testing its quality.

The health officials who visited the Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, where 4 other victims were admitted, had stated that prima facie it seems to be a case of drug reaction that occurred after anti-rabies injections were administered to the victims.

Soon after receiving the letter from the state drug controller authorities, the pharmacists and doctors in the local civil hospital have been instructed not to administer the vaccine to anyone. Hospital officials said that [normally] around 30 anti-rabies injections were administered to dog-bite victims daily in the hospital free of cost. The patients, who were bitten by jackals, monkeys, foxes, cats, rats and bats, are given rabies vaccine. If the course is not started in time, a patient can suffer a painful death within 48-72 hours of the bite. [Normally the incubation period for rabies is around 21 days. - Mod.MHJ]

State drug controller Ajay Singla said, "We have informed DGGI and urged it to ensure steps to stop use of the vaccine. Also, civil surgeons have been instructed not to administer vaccines to anyone into the state till the final report of the samples comes."

[If this is a first bad reaction to this vaccine at this hospital, it is more likely to be a bad batch of vaccine contaminated with some product capable of killing within hours. If one vial is contaminated, others will be. We await clarification.

However this is not the first fatality with this company's rabies vaccine: see 20120829.1271575. To quote my expert colleague Craig about that incident: "The AbhyaRab vaccine is produced by Human Biological Institute. It is a purified Vero cell rabies vaccine. It is a freeze dried preparation that should be reconstituted with 0.5 mL of a diluent supplied with the vaccine. The reconstituted vaccine should be administered immediately and should not be stored for administration later. Abhayrab vaccine should be administered intra-muscularly in the deltoid region in both adults and children. Under no circumstances should it be administered intravenously.

[In the 2012 incident] the tolerance of the child to the 1st 3 inoculations followed by abrupt deterioration of his condition following the 4th administration of the vaccine suggests that there may been some error in preparation or administration of the vaccine rather than a defect in the vaccine itself. The outcome of the investigation of this incident is awaited."

To repeat Craig, "Under no circumstances should it be administered intravenously." Maybe this is what happened here. However we should also keep the following comments in mind. - Mod MHJ]

[Occasionally when there is a lyophilized vaccine that requires reconstitution with a diluent, an incorrect or contaminated diluent is used and leads to adverse events following receipt of the vaccine. This has unfortunately been seen with the childhood vaccines used by the EPI (Expanded Programme on Immunizations). Adverse reactions have ranged from local sterile or non-sterile abscesses to severe with fatal outcomes when toxic substances have been used. - Mod MPP]

[It would seem prudent there should be an investigation as to why there was a reaction to this particular lot of vaccine. Was the entire lot of vaccine contaminated or was this a contaminated diluent affecting only one vial? How exceptionally sad to remove all vaccines in the face of a rabies out break. An investigation may reveal the reason for the reaction. The investigation may extend into drug testing the vaccine. Was a drug used as a diluent for the vaccine? What about bacterial testing of the vaccine? Was this a reconstituted vaccine that was not held under refrigeration or held long after it should have been discarded? Bacterial swabbing of even the container may yield answers. Clearly, an investigation into this particular lot of vaccine and this particular vaccine vial is in order. - Mod.TG]
