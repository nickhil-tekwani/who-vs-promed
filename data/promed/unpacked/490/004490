A case of scrapie has been confirmed at a farm in Skagafjordur.

Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease, which affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats. This is the 4th confirmed case of scrapie in Northwest Iceland since February of 2015. [Prior to] that year, no case had been reported since 2010.

MAST, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, is currently collecting data and preparing a course of action.

Last week, the farmer of Brautarholt in Skagafjordur suspected a case of scrapie and contacted the district's veterinarian. The sheep was slaughtered and a specimen sent to the University of Iceland's Institute for Experimental Pathology at Keldur, which confirmed that the animal had been affected with scrapie. Cases of the disease have come up on 11 farms in Skagafjordur in the past 2 decades. Sheep had to be slaughtered at the farm Brautarholt in 1987 due to scrapie. The farm currently has 290 sheep.

Until 2010, cases of scrapie were confirmed on a few farms in the country every year, but no cases were reported 2011-2014. MAST stresses that even though such cases are rare, we must constantly be on guard against the disease. Every year, samples are collected from about 3000 sheep at slaughterhouses. Farmers have also been encouraged to send the heads of sheep killed by accident or disease to Keldur for examination.

[Iceland's sheep population is highly susceptible to exotic disease agents due to its location in a territory physically isolated from animal populations elsewhere. It has been suggested that the susceptibility may have been historically supported by genetic uniformity due to inbreeding. During the years, several transboundary diseases penetrated the country by imported animals, in spite of the severe veterinary control, with devastating results, such as paratuberculosis (which affected cattle as well) and the lenti-viruses of jaagsziekte/ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma and of ovine progressive pneumonia (the latter obtained the Icelandic term/name Maedi-Visna, which has become its common name globally). The Icelandic animal-health establishment handled the said events efficiently, gathered vast experience, developed scientific expertise, and gained a remarkable reputation worldwide.

Scrapie was probably introduced into Iceland in 1878 by an imported ram of the Oxford-Down breed that was brought to a farm in the mid-north of Iceland. Its descendants were used widely for breeding in the adjoining area, and, a few years later, scrapie was detected in this region. At the beginning of the 20th century, scrapie had spread to a considerable part of the mid-north and has remained endemic in this area ever since. During a campaign begun in the 1940s to eradicate lentiviral diseases of sheep and paratuberculosis of sheep and cattle, the country was divided into 30 quarantine areas by fences and natural boundaries such as rivers and glaciers. The number of these quarantine areas was later increased to 38, when plans to control, and subsequently eradicate scrapie were implemented. During this campaign, all sheep in the original endemic scrapie areas were culled and restocked with lambs from scrapie-free areas. However, scrapie recurred on several farms, which were not restocked until 3 years after culling, indicating that the scrapie agent could persist in nature for at least 3 years. Independent experimental studies have amply documented the extraordinary resistance of scrapie and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) pathogens to extremes of heat and pressure and to environmental weathering for at least 2-3 years. Icelandic researchers, who later carried out an epidemiological investigation of scrapie in Iceland, reported that the scrapie agent may persist under environmental conditions for as long as 16 years (see reference below).

According to the said paper, the main features of the Icelandic program to control scrapie (in Icelandic, Rida), as revised in 1986, are the following:
(i) slaughter of all sheep in scrapie-affected flocks and sometimes also of healthy flocks considered to be at risk;
(ii) destruction of hay, disinfection of sheep-houses, barns and equipment and, in some instances, burning of old decrepit sheep-houses and replacement by new buildings;
(iii) ban on the movement of sheep, hay and equipment from scrapie-affected farms between and within quarantine areas;
(iv) restocking after a minimum of 2 years with lambs from scrapie-free areas remote from affected quarantine zones; and
(v) continuous health control of new flocks to detect possible recurrence.

According to OIE's data (2015), Iceland's sheep population counts 487 000 animals in 2497 establishments.
