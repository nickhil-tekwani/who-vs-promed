[The above follow-up PPR report, No 11, has been submitted by China to the OIE one day after follow-up report No 10 (1 Apr 2014), in which 9 new PPR outbreaks, in 5 provinces, were reported. The provinces named in follow-up report No 10 were Heilongjiang (Bordering Russia), Jilin, Jiangsu, Hunan and Guangxi (bordering Viet Nam). All outbreaks reportedly involved animals which were "purchased from other places." This was the 1st report indicating, among the applied control measures, "Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)," (similarly to the current report). Follow-up report 10, including an interactive map, is available at http://tinyurl.com/o6m6cqs. For China's provinces map, see http://www.maps-of-china.net/province_map.html.

The current PPR epizootic reportedly started on 5 Dec 2013 in northwestern China, spreading, within less than 4 months, throughout the mega state, currently present in most parts thereof, as can be seen in OIE's summary interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/oqx8okm. The 1st official report on PPR in China dates back to 2007. Between 2007 and 2010, the disease was reported from the southwest (where no outbreaks have been reported during the current major epizootic). Their respective maps can be seen as follows:
2007-2008: http://tinyurl.com/p24m3jh

2010: http://tinyurl.com/nzxh76l

Since follow-up report No 9 (submitted 30 Mar 2014), all new (29 so far) PPR outbreaks are, reportedly, related to infected animals "purchased from other places." It seems that China has recently undertaken a major surveillance program. Have the Chinese authorities discovered a widely (and long?) applied, uncontrolled movement of infected animals, which is behind the current "spread?"

It is reassuring to note that China has moved to PPR vaccination "in response to the outbreak." Details on the vaccine applied and on the vaccination scope (regions, numbers) will be helpful. China's PPR-susceptible animal population (2012 OIE data) is 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000 goats. General, mass preventive vaccination, if necessary, would be a huge undertaking.

At present, PPR is present on China's borders with Russia, Mongolia, North Korea, Viet Nam, Uzbekistam and Kazakhstan. The disease was recorded in previous epizootics (as mentioned above) in provinces bordering India (2007/8, 2010), and Nepal (2007/8).
