Event description
-----------------
The Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya continues to evolve. Since our last report on 22 Jun 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 25; http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272939/OEW25_1622062018.pdf), an additional 36 RVF cases (with no new deaths) have been reported. A retrospective epidemiologic investigation has established that the date of onset of illness in the index case was 11 May 2018, marking the beginning of the outbreak. Since then, a cumulative total of 90 cases and 10 deaths (case fatality rate 11 percent) have been reported as of 27 Jun 2018. Of the 90 cases, 18 have been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The most affected age group is 21-30 years, with men making up 70 percent of the cases. So far, 3 counties have been affected: Wajir (78 cases, 6 deaths), Marsabit (11 cases, 3 deaths), and Siaya (1 case, 1 death).

The RVF outbreak in Kenya was detected on 2 Jun 2018, confirmed by the Kenya Medical Research Institute on 7 Jun 2018 and officially declared by the Ministry of Health on 8 Jun 2018. A RVF epizootic had been reported in 4 counties (Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, and Wajir) by the Ministry of Livestock, with a number of animal blood samples testing positive for RVF. Risk assessment for RVF in humans and livestock identified 8 counties (Tana River, Tharaka Nithi, Garissa, Lamu, Kajiado, Baringo, Mombasa, and Nairobi) as having high risk for RVF outbreak.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
- A national RVF technical committee has been activated and chaired by the Director of Veterinary Services, who meet weekly and execute the guidelines in the RVF contingency plan and coordinate and work with the counties who have formed their own joint technical working groups.
- The Ministry of Health has activated the Emergency Operations Centre and identified the Event Manager and supporting technical team.
- A joint human and animal health multisectoral team from government and nongovernmental agencies has been meeting weekly to update the situation report and provide technical guidance to counties.
- Four treatment centres have been set up in Wajir County and are managing cases.
- A team from the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program has been dispatched to Wajir to support the county health teams, and active surveillance is ongoing in all the affected and high risk counties.
- Information, education and communication (IEC) materials in English and Kiswahili have been dispatched to Wajir County, and information is being broadcast on local FM radio stations and at mosques, as well as house-to-house by the Kenya Red Cross using Community Health Volunteers.
- The ban on movement and slaughter of animals from affected and at-risk counties remains in place.
- Indoor residual spraying was carried out at the epicenter in Eldas sub-county, and animal spraying with pyrethroids is ongoing in affected counties.
- A total of 500 000 doses of RVF vaccine has been provided to high-risk counties, based on risk analysis.
- Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) and sample protection protocols have been shared with Wajir, and PPE for veterinary officers in Wajir has been provided through collaboration with the Ministry of Health.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The RVF outbreak in Kenya has rapidly increased in the last week, with more cases reported. This outbreak is occurring among seminomadic and remote communities, who are largely dependent on their livestock for livelihood and as their main food source. While response interventions are ongoing, several gaps have been identified, including lack of information on emergency stocks at county level; inadequate vector control tools, equipment, pesticides and personal protective equipment; limited knowledge of RVF by healthcare workers; and inadequate information, education and communication materials. Vector surveillance and control for humans and animals in high risk counties is yet to start, while communication flow between the national, counties and the responding partners is inadequate.

In addition, a number of the areas affected by RVF are experiencing outbreaks of other epidemic-prone diseases, along with major insecurity in some regions. These factors are of great concern as they could contribute to further spread of the disease in the subregion. There are already reports of an epizootic in Rwanda and suspected human cases in Rwanda and Uganda. The national authorities and partners in Kenya need to continue scaling up response activities, based on the One Health approach, to prevent a much wider disease outbreak. The national authorities in the neighbouring countries also need to enhance preparedness for RVF, including active surveillance in both animals and humans.

[The RVF outbreak continues in humans, with 36 new cases. Fortunately, there have been no new deaths.

The above report indicates that surveillance is needed to detect human and animal RVF virus cases and of vector virus mosquitoes as well. The prolonged rains mentioned in earlier reports have doubtless provided breeding sites for RVF virus vector mosquitoes. The advice to the public to only consume inspected animal products is prudent. The loss of hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats is a significant economic and cultural loss for their owners, many of whom depend on these animals for their livelihoods. - Mod.TY]

[2] Isiolo county: livestock preventive vaccination

The County government of Isiolo has launched a vaccination exercise targeting over 150 000 heads of livestock within the next 12 days. This follows positive confirmation of Rift Valley fever found in livestock blood samples examined at the government laboratory. Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti urged pastoralists to present their stock to veterinary officers for vaccination in order to curb the spread of the zoonotic disease to other unaffected areas.

[As detailed in the WHO report above, human RVF cases have been diagnosed since 11 May 2018, in 3 of Kenya's counties, namely Wajir, Marsabit (both in the former province North Eastern), and Siaya (in the former province of Nyanza, bordering Uganda and Tanzania). RVF was identified, by positive blood tests, in animals (camels, sheep, goats) in the counties Wajir, Marsabit, Kadjiado (in the former 'Rift Valley' province) and in Kitui (in the former Eastern province).

According to recent information, RVF has also been identified in animals in Mandera county, in the former North Eastern province (see 20180702.5885427), and in Isiolo county, located within the former Eastern province. That means that, so far, the virus has been shown as active in 7 out of Kenya's 47 counties. In addition to the 6 above, the following counties have been recognized as currently at high risk for RVF: Tana River, Tharaka Nithi, Garissa, Lamu, Baringo, Mombasa, and Nairobi. Obviously, preventive measures, including mass vaccination of susceptible animal species, are urgently required in the counties above and others at-risk, not yet infected.
