The O'Higgins Health SEREMI [Secretaría Regional Ministerial de Salud; local health ministerial unit] Epidemiological Unit confirmed the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus [infection], that is a 22-year-old youth who currently is in the intensive care unit of the San Fernando Hospital.

As for the patient's health status, Hector Muñoz, advisor to the Epidemiological Unit, stated that "he is in good condition and progressing well." As for the locality where he was infected, he added that, "possibly he went on an excursion in a rural locality in Las Peñas in Colchagua province."

"We now have started the protocols that include an envionmental investigation that will be conducted by our Health Action Department. As well, we are getting into contact with the family to find out more about the case and thus avoid possible new cases of infection," emphasized the epidemiologist.

Muñoz added that, " we must insist on preventive measures that are relevant to avoid infections with hantaviruses, such as, for example, only walking on improved paths and not going through bushes; avoid collecting wild fruit; throw away trash adequately in order to reduce eventual contact with the long-tailed rat, among others."

[This patient's infection apparently has not evolved into hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The specific situation under which the individual acquired his hantavirus infection is not confirmed. He likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the O'Higgins region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the young man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
