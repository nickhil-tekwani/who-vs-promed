The following information is provided in response to the request for
information in the ProMED-mail post entitled: Rabies, bat, human
exposure - USA (03): (AZ), archive number 20080921.2971.

The bat concerned was identified as a Mexican free-tailed bat,
_Tadarida brasiliensis_.

As for "virus genotype," rabid bats in Arizona are not routinely
submitted for variant typing so it is presumed to be a bat variant of
some kind.

[ProMED-mail thanks Kenneth Komatsu for this information.

The Mexican free-tailed bat has been implicated previously in
transmission of rabies to humans; in Alabama in 1994 (Bat & coydog
rabies, 1994, archive number 19950418.0216), in Texas in 1997
(Rabies, human, bat - USA (Texas), archive number 19971101.2230), and
in California in 2002 (Rabies, human, bat - USA (California), archive
number 20020810.5016).

An image of a Mexican free-tailed bat and a map of the range of this
species can be viewed at
<http://www.thewildones.org/Animals/mexFree.html>. Mexican
free-tailed bats are medium sized bats. Their bodies are about 9
centimeters (3.5 in) in length, and they weigh about 15 grams (0.5
oz). The Mexican free-tailed bat is a migratory species living in
caves in the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the
West Indies, central Chile, and Argentina. Their colonies are
believed to be the largest congregations of mammals in the world. The
largest colony is found at Bracken Cave, north of San Antonio, Texas.

Other species of bats known to transmit rabies to humans include the
silver-haired bat (_Lasionycteris noctivagans_) and the eastern
pipistrelle (_Pipistrellus subflavus_), see
