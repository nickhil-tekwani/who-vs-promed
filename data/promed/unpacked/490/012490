A comment on LCMV from C.J. Peters and C.H. Calisher
-----------------------------------------------------
We have read your posting of CDC's "Interim Guidance for Minimizing Risk
for Human Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) Infection Associated
with Rodents" [see: Human lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus: risk factors
20050804.2273] and were pleased to see that so much good information about
LCMV is being disseminated to the medical and public health community;
however, we were dismayed to see certain implicit assumptions in some of
the comments and recommendations. LCMV is related to the viruses causing
Lassa fever, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever,
Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and other arenaviruses known to be vertically
transmitted by their chronically infected rodent hosts.
The major problem is the assumption that personal protective measures will
protect owners of LCMV-infected pets from infection. There can be
disastrous consequences of infection of the fetus of an exposed woman, and
potentially of all immunosuppressed persons, so that definitive protection
against infection is mandated. Although the incidence of central nervous
system disease after LCMV infection of the average person is unknown, the
disease is not trivial when it occurs, and an antibody prevalence of
approximately 5 percent in the general population suggests there are quite
a number of infections. The recommendations listed certainly would reduce
the risk of infection if one were working with infected animals, but would
not be considered at all adequate for laboratory or animal care of known
infected animals. In particular, the recommendation to "Closely supervise
young children when cleaning cages or handling rodents" is ridiculous. The
LCMV-infected rodent should not b!
e sold to pet stores or passed along to consumers.
LCMV is a chronic, vertically transmitted infection of house mice (_Mus
musculus_), and no other host supports it as a chronic infection. In
commercial breeding colonies, horizontal infection with chronic virus
excretion among hamsters can be sustained, but this form of infection is
not known among wild rodents. Guinea pigs suffer fatal infection, but the
outcome of LCMV infection in gerbils and other potential pet rodents is not
well-documented. Thus, the key element for keeping mouse and hamster
colonies free of LCMV is to establish known "clean" colonies and exclude
contact with wild _Mus_, so that the colonies cannot be infected in this
way. Because of the difficulty of definitively excluding wild _Mus_,
periodic testing of colonies should be carried out to assure virus is not
introduced. This is the norm for breeders of mice and hamsters for
scientific use, but there are no statutory requirements for pet animals.
The norm for LCMV infection among animals in colonies should be ZERO
percent infection and anything less than this is both irresponsible and
unacceptable.
It is important to recognize that the goal of maintaining LCMV-free mouse
and hamster colonies is readily achievable and has been accomplished by the
scientific suppliers. One also has to appreciate the biology of LCMV; it
is uniquely linked to wild house mice, the control point. The potential
for aerosol transmission is high and thus measures to reduce human contact
with fomites cannot by themselves provide safety. Contrast this with the
relation between _Toxoplasma gondii_ and domestic cats. It is virtually
impossible to rid felines of this highly infectious human pathogen, and the
strategy for protection of humans (and the highly sensitive fetus) does
involve the kind of protective measures suggested.
We strongly urge the adoption of measures to assure that breeding centers
for pet animals be properly tested for LCMV infection, that animals sent
from infected colonies be traced and destroyed, and that we be able to
assure a source of pet rodents safe from infection with virus. The tragedy
of fetal infection with LCMV and the morbidity from this virus can be
reduced to virtually zero.
As Richard Montali recently stated on ProMED-mail [see: Human lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (02): risk factors 20050806.2290], callitrichid
(marmosets and tamarins) hepatitis occurred in zoos in the US in the 1980s
and early 1990s and was associated mostly with the feeding of newborn mice
as a dietary supplement. In these cases, newborn mice were not obtained
from sources known to be properly controlled against LCMV infection. Wild
mice were also implicated in some of the documented cases; see also
reference (6) below.
In specific criticism of the CDC report, we point out the phrase "the
prevalence of LCMV in pet rodents is not known." Perhaps not specifically,
for each pet shop, but it is known that LCMV is vertically transmitted, and
this mechanism leads to the high excretion state, whereas horizontal
transmission between adult mice leads to limited infection without chronic
viremia, which Traub recognized more than 60 years ago. Infection beyond
the major colonies would be horizontal and thus not be a problem with mice.
It could be more of a problem with hamsters, but would be more likely to
lead to overt disease (3, 4, 7) The colonies could be monitored easily.
Studies during outbreaks in the past show that infection can occur when
infected animals are kept in homes even without direct contact, and
laboratory workers have been infected (presumably by aerosols) after only a
single entrance into a laboratory (1, 2, 5).
The bottom line is that there appears to be a lack of political will to
take the necessary steps. Telling people (who likely will never see the
recommendations) to "be careful" and not mentioning that close supervision
of young children when cleaning cages or handling rodents is essentially
irrelevant or that it would be better to have strict surveillance of the
hamster (or any pet), rather than the child, seems irresponsible. The best
solution is to legislate requirements for pet shops and other sources of
rodents or to eliminate these sources of disease altogether and suggest
acquiring a real pet or go to a baseball game. Half a century of
experience with LCMV plus the repeated experiences with infectious agents
found among prairie dogs (tularemia, monkeypox, plague, hantaviruses)
should have changed the landscape in all this but obviously has not.
