More than 150 people have fallen ill and over 30 hospitalized in a
countrywide outbreak of salmonellosis in the Netherlands, the Dutch
National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said on
Wednesday [6 Nov 2008].

From the beginning of August until 20 Oct 2008, 152 new cases were
reported of an antibiotic-resistant strain of the salmonella bacteria; and
between 5 and 10 new cases are being reported every week, compared to the
normal figure of 2, said the institute.

Cases are distributed throughout the country, and no travel-related cases
have been reported. The source of the infection has yet to be determined,
but it could be pork products, the institute said. According to the RIVM,
the strain, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium phage type DT104,
is resistant to a range of antibiotics.

The following discussion is adapted from the USA Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) website
(<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPHS/stdt104.htm>).

"Salmonellosis due to serotype Typhimurium DT104 is an emerging foodborne
pathogen detected in several countries worldwide including: the USA, the
UK, Canada, Germany, France, Austria, and Denmark. Of particular concern
with DT104 is the presence of a multiple antimicrobial resistance pattern
(R-Type) to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and
tetracycline (ACSSuT). Molecular studies have demonstrated that in this
strain, resistance genes are chromosomally encoded. This is important
because removal of the selective pressure from antibiotics is not expected
to reverse resistance, as it might with extrachromosomal-mediated resistance.

"Also of concern is the increasing trend of additional resistance of DT104
to trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone), which has occurred
in the UK. In the USA, DT104 R-type ACSSuT has been isolated from poultry,
swine, cattle, and other domestic and wild animals.

"DT104 is an animal pathogen and a foodborne pathogen of humans. The
mortality rate for clinically affected cattle with this strain is reported
to be 40-60 per cent in some outbreaks in the UK. The case fatality rate in
humans may be higher than with other _Salmonella_ infections. In a study of
83 DT104 cases in the United Kingdom, 41 per cent of patients were
hospitalized and 3 per cent died. In contrast, the case-fatality rate for
other non typhoid _Salmonella_ infections was approximately 0.1 per cent.
In the USA, serotype Typhimurium R-type ACSSuT infections have been more
likely to cause bacteremia and have been associated with longer
hospitalizations. No increase in mortality has been observed.

"Recent antibiotic use in humans and animals is a predisposing factor for
serotype Typhimurium DT104 infection. This has been observed in other
enteric bacterial pathogens as well. Killing the competitive gut flora may
allow unrestricted growth of a pathogen. In addition, the use of
antibiotics to treat infection prolongs the carrier state of DT104 in
humans and animals. Both of these features indicate a need to educate
physicians, veterinarians, and the public about the potential adverse
consequences of indiscriminate antibiotic use.

"The best prospect for minimizing human illness is a strategy of barriers
to introduction and multiplication of DT104 throughout the farm-to-table
continuum. Control measures that are effective against other types of
_Salmonella_ spp will reduce the likelihood of transmission of serotype
Typhimurium DT104." - Mod.LL
