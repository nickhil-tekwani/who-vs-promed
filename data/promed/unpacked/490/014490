The Mohmand Agency political administration has launched the 3rd phase of the campaign against leishmaniasis with help of Frontier Corps North Headquarters [HQ/FC]. After receiving 400 injections from the HQ/FC, the 3rd phase of leishmaniasis treatment campaign was launched in selected health facilities in the Mohmand Agency.

A total of 282 patients, predominantly children, were treated on [Mon 28 May 2018] on the 1st day of the campaign. Moreover, as a preventive measure, LLIN (long lasting insecticide nets) were handed over to the health facilities. Up to 120 bed nets were given to Baizai tehsildar for onward distribution in Ghanam Shah, Yari Khel and Spenki Tangi areas.

The campaign will last until the registered and under-treatment patients receive the 3rd dose.

The political administration is confident that thanks to the timely and generous help extended by the HQ/FC in arranging the rare Glucantime [meglumine antimoniate] injections, not only the existing patients will get adequate treatment but also new patients, if any, will be cured in the agency.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Pakistan, especially in the North West tribal areas. The latest data available from the WHO (http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/Pakistan_CP_2014.pdf) indicate a rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) of around 0.2 per 10 000 population. However, looking at the maps of the regional incidence, data is lacking from many of the North West Frontier areas and thus CL is probably much underreported.

As pointed out in the ProMED posting 20170408.4958084 of 8 Apr 2017, there is no government leishmania control program in Pakistan and no program to identify the animal reservoirs and reduce transmission. Thus these areas, like Afghanistan, remain highly endemic. - Mod.EP
