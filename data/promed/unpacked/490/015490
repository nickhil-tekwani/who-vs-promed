Some avian influenza viruses, and particularly the dangerous H5N1 subtype,
appear to prompt the human immune system to over-produce important
pathogen-fighting chemicals called chemokines, triggering an exaggerated
response that creates more damage than it fixes, a new study suggests. The
study shows that at least with older versions of the H5N1 virus, this
response -- referred to as a cytokine storm -- was significantly more acute
in adults than children. The findings could help to explain why the 1997
outbreak of H5N1 was far more deadly for adults than children and why the
infamous 1918 Spanish flu -- caused by the H1N1 subtype -- wreaked its
greatest havoc on young adults.
They could also offer clues to help in the design of therapies to treat
infections caused by these viruses, by pinpointing the response that needs
to be moderated to avoid this immune response tidal wave and the damage it
inflicts.
"I think this is starting to provide us with a framework to better
understand why H5N1 does what it does," said Dr. Michael Osterholm,
director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the
University of Minnesota. "And I think also it's a reason to be more
concerned about similarities between 1918 H1N1 and 2006 H5N1."
The work, by scientists at the University of Hong Kong, is reported in the
July issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases and was financed by Hong
Kong's Research Grants Council. The research is part of a series of studies
done by this group of scientists that is looking at the way human cells
respond to H5N1 and related avian influenza viruses. Group leader Dr. Malik
Peiris, a leading influenza expert, said the study was inspired by the
mortality pattern observed during the first recorded outbreak of human
disease with the H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997. Of the 18 recorded cases,
5 of 9 who were over 12 years of age died. Only one patient under that age
succumbed to the virus. "It made us wonder if there was some host factor
associated with age," Peiris said in an interview from Hong Kong.
But the current wave of human infections with H5N1, which began in late
2003, includes many cases under 12, many of whom have died. Peiris
acknowledged that host response -- in other words, the immune system
reaction -- obviously isn't the only factor involved in determining the
severity of disease caused by H5N1 viruses. He suggested the route of
infection, or the dose of virus to which an individual is exposed, may also
play a role. Peiris's team tested their age hypothesis using blood from
healthy adult blood donors and donated umbilical cord blood from healthy,
full-term babies.
The scientists tested the response to 3 influenza viruses: a human H1N1
virus from 1998, an H5N1 virus from 1997, and a 1997 H9N2 virus. The last
is considered an ancestor of the H5N1 virus, because while the 2 wear
different hemagglutinins (the H in a flu virus's name) and neuraminidases
(the N) on their outer shell, their 6 internal genes are very closely
related. The blood samples were used to isolate macrophages -- immune
system warriors which are drawn to the site of infection by signalling
chemicals such as chemokines. Once at the site of infection, macrophages
engulf and destroy invading pathogens. In this experiment, the flu viruses
were added to cultures of macrophages to see what responses were provoked.
Interestingly, the flu viruses all replicated at about the same rate, in
both the adult and infant cells. "So these differences weren't due to
differences in the extent of virus growth that they could discern, but
rather something intrinsic to the viruses themselves which were causing the
different (chemokine) expression levels that they reported," said Dr.
Frederick Hayden, a scientist with the World Health Organization's global
influenza program.
But while the viruses generated the same amount of infection, the immune
response to the infection varied greatly, both between the human and avian
viruses and between the adult and infant cells. In particular the avian
viruses triggered the production of significantly higher levels of a
chemokine called CCL3 in the adult cells. The authors noted elevated levels
of CCL3 have also been found in the blood of patients who have died from
H5N1 infection as compared to those who were infected but survived. "The
higher CCL3 response in adult (macrophages) may be one of the important
factors responsible for the age-related severity of avian influenza virus
infection in 1997," they wrote.
Peiris also noted that in fatal human cases of H5N1 infection it has been
observed that macrophages have virtually swarmed the lungs. Chemokines like
CCL3 draw macrophages, he noted, saying the pattern of actual disease and
the experiments done by his team "do fit." Chemicals like these play a
crucial role in the body's response to invading pathogens. But
overproduction can create a cascading hyper-response that actually
exacerbates the damage already done by the virus.
The authors noted that mice infected with the newly reconstituted 1918 H1N1
Spanish flu virus produced high levels of the same immune system signalling
chemicals as were seen to be over-produced by the H5N1 and H9N2 viruses.
Since these more contemporary avian flu viruses carry a number of the same
mutations on their internal genes as the 1918 virus did, they argued,
further analysis of the role of these mutations is needed to determine what
role they play in the disease process.
For Osterholm, the work provides further supporting evidence that the
cytokine-storm phenomenon was at work during the deadly 2nd wave of the
Spanish flu. It also supports the concern he and others share about the
similarities between the type of human disease H5N1 causes and reports of
what patients suffered during the 1918 pandemic, which claimed an estimated
50 million lives worldwide. "We'll never be able to go back to 1918 and
demonstrate that the cytokine storm was the key feature of those early and
dramatic deaths in patients," Osterholm said. "But clinically those
patients were so similar and [from a] patho-physiologic standpoint it makes
so much sense that that's what was happening that I've got to believe that
there are important parallels here."

Expression of Chemokines and Their Receptors in Adult and Neonatal

The abstract reads as follows: "In 1997, avian influenza virus H5N1 was
transmitted directly from chicken to human and resulted in a severe disease
that had a higher mortality rate in adults than in children. The
characteristic mononuclear leukocyte infiltration in the lung and the high
inflammatory response in H5N1 infection prompted us to compare the
chemokine responses between influenza virus-infected adult and neonatal
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The effects of avian influenza virus
A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1) (H5N1/97), its precursor A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97
(H9N2) (H9N2/G1), and human influenza virus A/Hong Kong/54/98 (H1N1)
(H1N1/98) were compared. Significantly higher expression of CCL2, CCL3,
CCL5, and CXCL10 was induced by avian influenza viruses than by human
influenza virus. Moreover, the increase in CCL3 expression in
H5N1/97-infected adult MDMs was significantly higher than that in neonatal
MDMs. Enhanced expression of CCR1 and CCR5 was found in avian
virus-infected adult MDMs. The strong induction of chemokines and their
receptors by avian influenza viruses, particularly in adult MDMs, may
account for the severity of H5N1 disease." - Mod.CP]
