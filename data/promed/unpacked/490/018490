More than 2500 dead seabirds have been found in Russia's Far
East and scientists are not sure what caused the birds to die.
About 2500 birds have been found on Kunashir Island in the
southern Kurils, and another 100 on Sakhalin Island, the Interfax
news agency said.
People started reporting unusually large numbers of dead birds this
month, and some experts say it could be caused by unusually hot
weather.
Zoya Revyakina, the chief of the state environmental protection
authority on Sakhalin, said the same phenomenon had been
reported in Japan.

The birds' bodies have been lying in hot sand for many days,
making it hard for researchers to discover a trace of disease or
poisoning, the report said.
