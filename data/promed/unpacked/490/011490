"We have to be highly aware of the spread of leaf-burning disease
caused by _Pyricularia oryzae_ during this [2009/2010] winter-spring
crop," said Nguyen Huu Huan, deputy director of the Plant Protection Agency.

The disease has affected 80 000 ha [approx. 198 000 acres] of rice in
the delta. Huan warned farmers to reduce the cultivation density to
avoid the spread of disease. He said farmers, in an aim to control
disease, should avoid using too much nitrogenous fertilizer.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia oryzae_, _P. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive
diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of more than
50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem
rot, and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts
above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection
occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often
completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be
affected by different strains of the fungus, but most strains
isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris,
mechanical means (including insect activity), water, and wind.
Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices, but
relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly
variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased
virulence.
