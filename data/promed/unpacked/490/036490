The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 3 Jan 2020:
- Since the start of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases has been 3386, of which 3268 have been confirmed and 118 are probable. In total, there were 2233 deaths (2115 confirmed and 118 probable) and 1114 people recovered;
- 523 suspected cases under investigation;
- 1 new confirmed case in North Kivu at Butembo;
- 1 new death from confirmed cases, including 1 death from confirmed cases in North Kivu in Katwa; no community deaths have been recorded;
- no cured persons have been released from Ebola treatment centers [ETCs];
- no health worker is among the new confirmed cases. The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 164 (5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 41 deaths;
The general coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic, Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke, intervened this Sat 4 Jan 2020 at the 28th ethics day of Kinshasa organized by the urban council of the Order of physicians (CUOM) under the theme "Medical ethics and ethics, the foundation of practice of the art of healing" in the Agora Amphitheater at Bel Campus University in Kinshasa;
- For Prof. Ahuka, there is a link between managing the epidemic and ethics in medical practice. The Ebola crisis, he said, concerns all health personnel, particularly doctors, recalling that doctors must intervene in this crisis while respecting the ethics as intended by this day;
- "There are many aspects of deontology and ethics in medical practice and in the management of Ebola. Lack of hospital hygiene is one of the major factors in the spread of the disease. To this is added the lack of prevention and control of infection in Congolese hospitals. This is an important element of which doctors must be aware, "said the general coordinator of the response during the 28th ethics day in Kinshasa;
- The intervention of the general coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic at these meetings focused on the communication on the current situation of the Ebola virus disease epidemic;
- This day ended with the presentation of a diploma of merit to a few doctors and pharmacists for their distinction and commitment to their profession. The diploma of Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Ntamfum was symbolically awarded to Prof. Ahuka.

[WHO Disease Outbreak News [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/02-january-2020-ebola-drc/en/

WHO Disease Outbreak News, Ebola virus disease DR Congo as at 2 Jan 2020:

Since the last disease outbreak news published on 19 Dec 2019, 29 new confirmed cases were reported from 18 to 31 Dec 2019 in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu province. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from 8 health areas in 4 health zones: Mabalako (62%, n=18), Butembo (14%, n=4), Kalunguta (17%, n=5), and Katwa (7%, n=2). Three of the 4 cases reported in Butembo in the past 14 days are linked to a transmission chain of more than 50 people that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone. One individual classified as a relapse case of EVD infected several other individuals within the family and through nosocomial transmission (for more information, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 19 Dec 2019). In Kalunguta Health Zone, the 5 cases reported between 24 and 28 Dec 2019 are a distinct, epidemiologically linked chain of transmission, although the source of exposure is currently under investigation.

In the past 21 days (11 Dec-31 Dec 2019), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health areas within 5 neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu province (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (68%, n=27), Butembo (13%, n=5), Kalunguta (13%, n=5), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Biena (3%, n=1). The majority of the cases (75%, n=30) are linked to known chains of transmission.

As of 31 Dec 2019, a total of 3380 EVD cases were reported, including 3262 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2232 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1900) were female, 28% (n=953) were children aged less than 18 years, and 168 (5% of all reported cases) were healthcare workers. *3380 confirmed and probable cases, reported as of 31 Dec 2019. Excludes n=173 cases for whom onset dates not reported.

[3] Anthropologist's report
Date: Fri 3 Jan 2020

https://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/amphtml/World/Africa/2020/0103/Congo-Ebola-crisis-To-fight-disease-an-anthropologist-heals-distrust?__twitter_impression=true


Congo Ebola crisis: To fight disease, an anthropologist heals distrust. Congo's Ebola outbreak is not just a health crisis. It's also a social crisis - and it's this anthropologist's job to heal it.

The crisis in Butiaba began with a grave.

When a man named M. got sick in September 2019 in this isolated village in Congo's lush green eastern borderlands, his family did just what the radio PSAs and awareness posters had instructed. They called an emergency number and told them they had a possible Ebola case.

And when he died at a clinic, 50 miles away in a town they had never seen, the family swallowed their fear and consented again. OK, they demurred, he could be buried there, in a cemetery shared by strangers.

But back at home in Butiaba, a cluster of mud-brick houses huddled at the edge of the rainforest, the message hadn't gotten through. The chief had already dispatched a group of young men to dig a grave in the town cemetery, a hacked-out clearing a few hundred meters into the forest. And now it sat gaping and empty like a crater.

This was a bad omen, said Moshi Katwakima, an elder. A man with an air of quiet authority, he told the chief that he had seen what happened when graves were left open in the past. Failed harvests. Scores of young people suddenly unable to find work. The conversation quickly turned barbed. Why do we have to follow their rules, they wondered about the Ebola responders, when they clearly don't respect ours?

When the young men in the village caught wind of the conversation, they decided on a plan. No more Ebola responders would be allowed in Butiaba, or on the dirt road that passed through the village. They couldn't be trusted. Not after this.

Fifteen miles away, at the World Health Organization logistics base in the city of Mambasa, Dr. Julienne Anoko's phone began to ring. Since the world's 2nd-most deadly Ebola outbreak began in eastern Congo nearly 1.5 years ago, Dr. Anoko is often called when relationships with local communities get complicated. A Sorbonne-trained anthropologist from Cameroon, she has the job of heading off conflict between Ebola responders and the communities they're meant to protect.

Slight and compact, with an easy laugh, Dr. Anoko seems at times the embodiment of what she hopes the Ebola response can do better: take up less space. Talk less and listen more. Disease outbreaks, she is fond of telling her colleagues, are often social crises as much as they are health emergencies.
That work has become especially urgent as responders reel from the murder of 4 of their own in 2 attacks by local militias on the night of 27 Nov 2019. In 2019, nearly a dozen health care workers were killed and more than 80 injured in nearly 400 attacks on health facilities.
Dr. Anoko also knows from 2 decades of experience in responding to disease outbreaks that there are often good reasons for people to fear the experts who, from the outside, seem to have all the answers.

"What people want in times of suffering is empathy and compassion," she says. What they often get, instead, is the brusque urgency of a giant international health bureaucracy trying to stop a disease from spreading.
And so she leads by example. Crawling into body bags and being carried through a town in the rainforest to understand complaints that the dead aren't being carried gently. Crying with grieving mothers. Arm-wrestling teenage boys or learning a local dance, to break the ice.
Today, as her colleagues explain the crisis in Butiaba, she imagines herself as part of one of the farming communities here who live and die by the loamy red dirt that squishes underfoot. Here, stability depends on the health of tidy rows of peanuts, beans, rice, and corn that flank the village. It is a fragile way to live, and the unseen forces that govern it can feel mercurial, even vengeful.

The problem, she explains, was us. We buried an elder far from home. We neglected to tell the leaders of his village. We made them afraid. "So now we need to fix it."

Locals have a lifetime of experience watching outsiders -- from the capital, Kinshasa, from the U.N., from international aid groups -- arrive with cash and promises they can't keep. And in their eyes, whatever the crisis, someone always stands to get rich.

Although the WHO and the Congolese government say the response to Ebola is woefully underfunded, from a local perspective it is practically printing money. International organizations working for La Riposte -- the response -- jostle along the region's stomach-churning dirt roads in new SUVs, booking out hotels and building state-of-the-art disease treatment centers in the shadow of crumbling public hospitals.

Many here see the disease, at worst, as a complete fabrication, and at best a smokescreen, yet another excuse for outsiders to get rich off the region's suffering.
That puts Dr. Anoko in a paradoxical position. No matter how many times or how gently she tells people that she too is a mother, she too is an African, she is also an outsider here. And workers like her have been hired to make the response work better, "not to criticize the institutions doing the responding," says Adia Benton, an anthropologist at Northwestern University who has researched international public health responses in Africa.

And there she is gathering community leaders after an Ebola treatment center was burned to the ground in Butembo, their anger still a live wire. Not because the treatment center had burned. But because no one had thought to ask them if they wanted it built in the 1st place.

So she asked. Yes, they assured her, they did want another clinic, but it must be built with their own hands. A place made by the sweat of their women would sacred, they told her. (Not to mention, she knew, if leaders bought into the clinic, they might be able to keep the local militants who had likely burned its predecessor at bay.)

In the end, locals rebuilt and blessed the clinic. It hasn't been attacked since. But often her work is far less dramatic. When she arrives [in a village], after she settles into the town's dark airless concrete schoolhouse or under a drooping mango tree, her job is often to sit and be yelled at.

People have always gotten sick here from diseases we couldn't cure, someone might ask. Why didn't anyone come to help us then? How can you expect a mother to let strangers take her sick baby away from her? Why did we never see this disease before all of these foreigners arrived? Why are you trying to kill us?

"Why hasn't anyone from our village been hired to help with safe Ebola burials?" a man asked her recently at a community meeting, referring to the teams in spacesuit-like protective gear who urgently descend on the dead with jugs of chlorine. "We don't know these people who are taking our families away."

No matter how many times she has heard a particular complaint before, Dr. Anoko always writes it down. And she always says thank you.

"This will help us make the response work better," she says, after listening to someone tell her for the hundredth time that they have heard no one comes out of an Ebola treatment center alive. "Thank you for coming to speak with us today."

[Scientists and clinicians have made great headway in developing the expertise to treat and protect against infection with Ebola. There are currently 2 vaccines in use in the DRC, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate (V920) administered in a single dose (Merck), now pre-qualified for certification, and the Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo vaccine candidate administered in a prime-boost regimen (produced by the firm Janssen Pharmaceuticals for the company Johnson & Johnson. Antiviral therapies include ZMapp, a monoclonal antibody medication composed of 3 chimeric monoclonal antibodies that target the EBOV glycoprotein (Mapp Biopharmaceutical), REGN-EB3, a cocktail of 3 monoclonal Ebola antibodies made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and mAb114, a single monoclonal antibody developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as 2 antiviral drugs, favipiravir and remdesivir (Gilead; GS-5734). In an ongoing clinical trial, Remdesivir and ZMapp have been dropped. Similarly, advances have been made in rapid diagnosis; OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test is the 1st rapid diagnostic test the FDA has allowed to be marketed in the U.S.

But such impressive scientific advances sadly are not proving sufficient in the case of Ebola, as an effective vaccine also is not in the case of measles as well as some other infectious diseases. In the DRC, social problems -- unrest, distrust -- are jeopardizing ending this current outbreak. The report above and the recommended reading referred to below explore how crucial the expertise of anthropologists is and how it can be applied to emergency public health responses. Certainly, as the authors in the paper state, successful responses to public health emergencies often, if not always, require collaboration between specialists such as clinicians, epidemiologists and social scientists.

See: D Stellmach, I Beshar, J Bedford et al. Anthropology in public health emergencies: what is anthropology good for? BMJ Glob Health. 2018; 3(2): e000534. Published online 2018 Mar 25. doi: 10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000534

Abstract. Recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (2013-2016) and Zika virus (2015-2016) bring renewed recognition of the need to understand social pathways of disease transmission and barriers to care. Social scientists, anthropologists in particular, have been recognised as important players in disease outbreak response because of their ability to assess social, economic and political factors in local contexts. However, in emergency public health response, as with any interdisciplinary setting, different professions may disagree over methods, ethics and the nature of evidence itself. A disease outbreak is no place to begin to negotiate disciplinary differences. Given increasing demand for anthropologists to work alongside epidemiologists, clinicians and public health professionals in health crises, this paper gives a basic introduction to anthropological methods and seeks to bridge the gap in disciplinary expectations within emergencies. It asks: "What can anthropologists do in a public health crisis and how do they do it?" It argues for an interdisciplinary conception of emergency and the recognition that social, psychological and institutional factors influence all aspects of care. - Mod.LK
