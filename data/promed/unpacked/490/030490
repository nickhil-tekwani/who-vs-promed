Three people died, while 3 others were attacked by an unknown disease
at Bharapara and Mazikandi villages in Kendua upazila (an
administrative subdivision of the Nekatrona Division) in 5 days,
hospital sources said.

An inhabitant, aged 55, of Bharapara village died on 5 Jul 2008,
while an inhabitant of Maizkandi village died on 7 Jul 2008, and
another resident of Maizkandi village died on 8 Jul 2008. All of them
were undergoing treatment at Kendua Upazila Health Complex.

Three others who were attacked by the disease are a 12-year-old boy
of Kabichandpur village and a 45-year-old inhabitant and 12-year-old
boy, both of Bharapara village. As the 12-year-old boy's condition
worsened, he was sent to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital.

When contacted, Netrakona civil surgeon (CS) Sudhir Chandra Banik
said the government had formed a 7-member investigation team headed
by Deputy CS Abdur Rafique to investigate the incident. "After the
investigation, we can be confirmed about the disease," the CS said.

[Bangladesh has been affected in recent months by several outbreaks
(see references below) of undiagnosed and diagnosed diseases
(including avian H5N1 influenza, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis
and Nipah disease). The above report is too vague to allow an
inference as to the nature of the disease currently affecting the
Netrakona District. It is not even clear that it is a contagious
condition. ProMED-mail would welcome additional information regarding
the incident and the outcome of the local investigation now in progress.
