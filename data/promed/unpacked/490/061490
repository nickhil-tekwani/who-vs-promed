- Bahia and Roraima states. 10 Dec 2018. (published) A distinct lineage, the CHIKV-East-Central-South-America (ECSA)-genotype, was detected nearly simultaneously in Feira de Santana, Bahia state, northeast Brazil. The authors generated 20 novel CHIKV-ECSA genomes from the Brazilian Amazon. The large CHIKV outbreak in 2017 in Boa Vista, Roraima state, was caused by an ECSA-lineage most likely introduced from northeastern Brazil. Epidemiological analyses suggest a basic reproductive number of R0 of 1.66, which translates in an estimated 39% of Roraima's population infected with CHIKV-ECSA.

[Chikungunya virus infections were fewer this year (2018) in Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America than in the previous 3 years. However, transmission of the virus was active in Brazil and Bolivia. One wonders if the virus has spilled over into wild non-human primates in Brazil and other tropical countries of the Americas. If it can be maintained in wildlife in tropical ecosystems, eradication would not be possible with contemporary technology. - Mod.TY
