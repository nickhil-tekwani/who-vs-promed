The General Administration for Agricultural Affairs in the Eastern Province
[Saudi Arabia] has asked the Plant and Animal Quarantine Department in
Riyadh to take necessary penal steps against a cattle trader who sold more
than 300 sheep allegedly infected with foot and mouth disease (FMD) in
various markets in the Kingdom. The punishment could range between a
suspension of his import license for 2 years and its permanent cancellation.
Agricultural officials allegedly allowed the trader to keep the diseased
animals in his farm with [the understanding] that he would not trade in
them and keep them in isolation, according to Al-Yaum daily. In the
meantime, the agricultural officials and police have been interrogating the
trader to find out who bought the infected animals and where they went.
The agricultural administration in the region has assured the people that
there are no confirmed FMD cases in the region. It said officials have
inspected all cattle markets and abattoirs in Alkhobar, where some
suspicious looking sheep were found recently, and every other town and
village in the province and they could not detect a single case of animals
suffering from the disease.
An FMD scare reportedly spread in the region last week when the authorities
realized that 336 sheep sold by a cattle trader in the Souk Tagba in the
Eastern Province were afflicted with the dreaded disease. The authorities
also found that he had in his farm another 15 cattle heads affected by FMD.
Agricultural officials learned that the animals carrying the contagion
entered the Kingdom across the King Fahd Causeway on 28 Jun 2007. Though it
was clear then that the animals showed symptoms of FMD, the samples were
sent to Riyadh for confirmation, as there was no quarantine laboratory in
the region.
However, the agricultural officials permitted the livestock to enter the
country but to be kept in isolation and not be traded until the test
results came from Riyadh. Shortly after, an agricultural inspector who
visited the trader's farm discovered that the trader sold most of the sheep
in various markets including Riyadh and Ahsa. The mayor's office in the
Eastern Province blamed the agricultural officials for not informing the
concerned authorities about the matter when they learned about the
afflicted animals in June [2007].
Hussein Al-Baloushi, public relations director at the mayor's office, said
that immediately on receiving a memo about the afflicted animals, his
office took emergency measures to stop the spread of the disease. It
alerted all municipalities, governorates, and abattoirs to keep watch on
all animals and inform the concerned officials if they found any symptoms
of the disease. The officials also urged the public to make sure that the
meat they buy carried proper municipal seals.

[The King Fahd Causeway is a multiple dike-bridge combination connecting
Khobar, Saudi Arabia, and the island nation of Bahrain. See map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/saudi_arabia_pol_2003.pdf>.
The article above reflects the deplorable animal health situation,
including that of FMD, in the Middle East. According to the report, the
agricultural officials permitted the animals (which "clearly showed
symptoms of FMD"!!) to enter the country but "to be kept in isolation and
not be traded until the test results came from Riyadh". Needless to say,
keeping such animals in the premises of the importer does not preclude the
spread of disease and certainly does not conform to basic quarantine
measures. Though FMD is endemic in both countries involved, exotic strains
are a constant, serious threat.
According to the WRL (World Reference Laboratory) data, the last reported
FMD serotypes in Bahrain were SAT 1 (1962), A (1965), O (2001), Asia 1
(1985). In Saudi Arabia, they were SAT 1 (1970), O (2007), A (2005), Asia 1
(1994?), C (1984), and SAT 2 (2000). See
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/middle_east.html>.
Bahrain is one of the world's leading importers of sheep; its off-peak
consumption is 40 000 to 45 000 sheep per month, doubled during the Ramadan
season. It also serves as a main transit country for imported sheep, which
continue their way to other countries in the Middle East. Draught in
Australia, a main supplier of sheep to the Gulf States, has recently
reduced the number of animals available for export and Bahraini traders may
have resorted to other sources, where the animal health situation might be
less favorable than in Australia. Such animals could, potentially, be
infected with exotic strains of the virus.
The following information was provided by Bahrain to the OIE (Office
International des Epizooties; World Organization for Animal Health) in its
last available (2004) report in OIE's Handistatus database: "FMD
vaccination carried out twice a year using an inactivated antigen against
serotypes O, A, C, and Asia 1. After each vaccination, samples are taken to
measure the level of immunity in vaccinated animals (sheep, goats, and
cattle)." In 2004, the number of reportedly vaccinated animals was 2592
cattle and 1 656 328 sheep and goats.
The Gulf States have been, in the past, the site of introduction of exotic
FMD virus strains into the region, in some cases spreading westwards and --
during several epizootics -- even reaching the Thrace barrier [vaccination
against FMD in Thrace is used to prevent the disease spreading into the
European Union
