This past Tuesday [1 Mar 2011], a new possible case of [a] hantavirus
infection was detected. This is a student of about 20 years of age,
who was admitted to the Cochrane Hospital with a clinical picture
consistent with a hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. He was later
sent to the Coyhaique Regional Hospital.

According to statements by the Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial
Secretariat], the young man from Osorno was in serious condition in
the intensive care unit where he remains on a a respirator, [but]
giving signs of favorable developments.

Epidemiological personnel are going to Guadal to carry out an
investigation in the terrain in the area where the young man had
become infected, carrying out cleaning efforts of a cabin.

The Health SERAMI stated that this could be the 2nd case of [a] hanta
[virus infection] so far this summer season, indicating that the risk
of infection exists throughout the year, although increases during
summer due to recreational activities and to cleaning of closed
buildings that are not inhabited throughout the year.

It must be remembered that there are some measures [taken] to not
contract [a hantavirus infection and avoid contact with rodent hosts
and their secretions. - Mod.TY]: keep vegetation cut short near
houses, before occupying a cabin, air it out and disinfect it with
bleach, protect one's respiratory system with a mask, eye goggles and
gloves, avoiding any type of contact with this fatal virus, as well as
keeping trash and garbage [containers] well covered.

[There is no indication that this case has been laboratory confirmed,
so it remains a suspected case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, most
likely caused by an Andes virus infection, with the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat as the rodent host. This is the reason for the recommendation
to clean up areas in and around buildings to avoid attracting these
rodents. Interestingly, this suspected case occurred in the same
locale as a previous one in December 2010 (see promed archive number
20101223.4517).

longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
