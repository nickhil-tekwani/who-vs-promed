Scrapie in Hungary: (disease never reported before)
---------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 27 Jun 2006 from Dr Miklos Suth, chief
veterinary officer, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Budapest:
Date of start of the event: 29 May 2006.
Details of outbreak: An outbreak occurred on a farm in Sakeresztur (46 deg
98 min 27 sec N by 18 deg 55 min 46 sec E) in Fejer county. Among the 564
sheep (414 ewes, 8 rams, and 142 young sheep under 12 months) there were 2
cases and 2 deaths. Among the 19 goats (8 breeding females, 1 breeding male,
and 10 young goats under 12 months) there were no cases.
Description of affected population: 2 sheep in a large-scale farm, aged 85
months and 125 months, respectively.
The Central Veterinary Institute, Budapest performed Biorad TeSeE rapid test
on 2 June 2006 and immunohistochemical (IHC) test on 23 Jun 2006, both of
which were both positive. Primary discriminatory immuno-blotting indicated
that both cases can be ascribed to the classic form of scrapie. The
genotyping of the animals is in progress. The CVI will send samples to the
European Community Reference Laboratory for further investigations.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures:
Undertaken: quarantine.
To be undertaken: the entire animal population in the outbreak will be
killed soon. The whole carcasses of these animals will be destroyed as
category 1 material in line with regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002; screening;
disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).

identified the disease since the onset of a new European Union testing
