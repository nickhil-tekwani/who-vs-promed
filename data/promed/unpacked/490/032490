The deaths of 8 more children because of a mysterious disease in Bihar's Muzaffarpur and Gaya districts has taken the death toll to 31 in 10 days, officials said on Wednesday [6 Jun 2012].

The government has yet to identify the cause of the deaths. Health minister Ashwani Kumar Choubey and principal secretary (Health) Amarjit Sinha denied reports that the children were dying due to suspected encephalitis. "The causes are yet to be ascertained," Choubey said. Sinha said most deaths were due to excessive heat, dehydration, and malnutrition.

Up to date, 23 children have died in Muzaffarpur and 8 in Gaya. Over 4 dozen children suffering from the mysterious disease have been admitted to hospitals in both districts. Nearly a dozen are battling for life, said a health official.

Some doctors and health officials have reportedly claimed that the children were suffering from symptoms similar to encephalitis. Last year [2011], encephalitis, a mosquitoborne disease, claimed nearly 150 lives in the 2 districts.

[The etiology of these cases is uncertain, although encephalitis is mentioned, perhaps due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections as indicated in a 2 Jun 2012 report from this area in Bihar state (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120604.1155306). As the report states, there were many cases of encephalitis in this area last year (2011) and are now occurring again. ProMED-mail awaits further news on the diagnosis of these cases with interest. The JEV transmission season in Bihar state is just beginning.
