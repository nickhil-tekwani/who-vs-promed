Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare illness that anyone can get. It affects a person's nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. AFM can result from a variety of causes, including viral infections.

In a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) update, from 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2016, a total of 108 people in 36 states across the country were confirmed to have AFM. This is up from 89 confirmed cases at the end of September [2016].

CDC notes [that] even with an increase in cases in 2016, AFM remains a very rare disease (less than 1 in a million).

CDC reports the following "knowns" about AFM since August 2014: most patients are children; the patients' symptoms have been most similar to those caused by certain viruses, including poliovirus, non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and West Nile virus and; despite testing a variety of specimens, they have not consistently detected a pathogen in the patients' spinal fluid.

CDC does not yet know the cause of the AFM cases.

[From 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2016, 108 people were confirmed to have AFM, in 36 states across the U.S. In 2015, 21 people were confirmed to have AFM, in 16 states across the U.S.

From August to December 2014, 120 people were confirmed to have AFM, in 34 states across the U.S. The increase in AFM cases in 2014 coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory illness among people caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Among the people with AFM, CDC did not consistently detect EV-D68 in the specimens collected from them.

In 2015 there were no cases of EV-D68 detected and so far in 2016, only limited sporadic cases of EV-D68 have been detected in the United States.
It is currently difficult to interpret trends of the AFM data since reporting only started in 2014 and is voluntary in most states. Also, since AFM reporting is relatively new, there may initially be more variability in the data from year to year making it difficult to interpret or compare case counts between years. One possible reason for the differences in annual reporting is more awareness among and reporting by healthcare providers and health departments.
