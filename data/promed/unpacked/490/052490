[ProMED-mail posted a Request for Information following an earlier Reuters report (see 20130217.1546695). That report stated that the case was discovered on a duck farm, which was carrying out its own tests to be confirmed by a state laboratory, while final tests were pending. The suspicion has not been confirmed. - Mod.AS
