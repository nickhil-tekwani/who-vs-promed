China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced on Thu 2 May 2013 that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] has been confirmed in cattle in south west China's Tibet Autonomous Region.

A village in Dagze County in Lhasa City reported on 25 Apr 2013 that 145 head of cattle were showing suspected signs of the disease, according to the MOA. The National FMD Reference Laboratory on Thursday [2 May 2013] confirmed the cases as type A FMD.

Local authorities sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where 527 head of cattle have been culled and safely disposed of so as to prevent spreading the disease, the ministry said.

FMD is a contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild species within the family Bovidae.

[The above outbreak was reported by China's veterinary services to the OIE as follow-up report No. 1 on Fri 3 May 2013, available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13386. It includes an interactive map.

The initial outbreak in this Tibet FMD-A epizootic had started on 12 Apr 2013. It would be interesting to obtain the genotyping results of the Tibet strain and compare it with the FMDV serotype A strains from other provinces of China, in particular the strains recently genotyped by the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright (one collected from pigs in Shange town, Maoming, Guangdong on 18 Feb 2013 and the other one from cattle in Chengbei district, Xining, QingHai around 15 Mar 2013) and found identical to the Russian serotype A strain collected from cattle in Molodezhny, Priargunsky district, Zabaikalsky kray, on 1 Mar 2013 (see 20130429.1679986).

Since, according to OIE reports, China's policy in regard to this "new" FMD virus (serotype A, topotype: ASIA, genotype/strain SEA 97) is stamping out without vaccination, it remains to be asked whether farmers are eager to report suspected cases while knowing that, if found infected, their livestock will be destroyed. Such policy may be successful only if full compensation, including coverage of lost income, is guaranteed and paid without delay.

China's control policy against another circulating FMDV strain, namely serotype O, includes vaccination (see OIE follow-up report No. 11/Final report, submitted 2 May 2013, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13363. - Mod.AS
