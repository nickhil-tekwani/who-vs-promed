Three more children outside mainland China have developed kidney
stones after drinking Chinese-made milk products in a scandal over
tainted milk blamed for 4 infant deaths.

At least 8 Asian countries have banned or restricted Chinese dairy
products. The European Union has urged customs authorities throughout
the bloc to keep a closer eye on food imports from China.

The 2 new cases in Hong Kong and one in Macau bring the total number
of cases outside mainland China to 5. In the mainland, some 54 000
have fallen ill, as well as the 4 who died.

A 16-month-old infant in China's southern enclave of Macau was
diagnosed after being fed Nestle milk powder made in China's
northeastern Heilongjiang province, the Macau government said.

However, no government tests have found melamine, the industrial
chemical at the heart of the scandal, in Nestle milk products.

Switzerland-based Nestle said in a statement that its milk products
sold in China and Hong Kong are "absolutely safe" and that none are
made from tainted milk.

Two boys aged 2 and 9 in Hong Kong were in a stable condition, the
Hong Kong government said.

A senior Chinese official has pledged to crack down on a nationwide
milk-gathering system that he conceded was "out of control".

Chinese Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai told a meeting with the
health and public security ministries that the industrial chemical
melamine was likely added at stations that collect milk from small
individual dairy farmers.

"We must crack down on them with the greatest determination and the
toughest measures," Sun said in a meeting held late Monday [22 Sep
2008], but reported on the ministry's website.

The government has been scrambling for days to show it is tackling
the problem. Recent days have seen a number of arrests and forced
resignations of officials over the widening scandal.

The company at the centre of the scandal, Sanlu Group Co, had no
comment about allegations it had 1st received complaints more than 8
months ago about its infant formula.

A deeply shaken dairy industry pledged to reform itself. A group of
316 Chinese milk producers and retailers issued a joint statement
promising to keep the dairy industry clean, take responsibility for
product quality, and take concrete action to satisfy consumers, state
broadcaster CCTV said.

Melamine, used to make plastics and fertilizer, has been found in
infant formula and other milk products from 22 Chinese dairy
companies. Suppliers trying to cut costs are believed to have added
it to watered-down milk because its high nitrogen content masks the
resulting protein deficiency.

Taiwan's Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the island would send a team of
experts to mainland China to probe the extent of the crisis. Taiwan
has imported 25 tons of tainted baby products made by Sanlu Group.

The World Health Organisation has warned of possible smuggling of the
infant formula across borders.

The scandal has claimed the head of Li Changjiang, who stepped down
on Monday [22 Sep 2008] as boss of the General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. Li had run the safety
watchdog since 2001, and his resignation comes a year after he and
the government promised to overhaul the system in response to a
series of product safety scares.

New regulations and procedures were introduced in an attempt to
restore consumer confidence and preserve export markets after a
string of recalls involving tainted toothpaste, faulty tires,
contaminated seafood and pet food.

Baby formula and other milk products have been pulled from stores
around the country, and Chinese dairy products have been recalled or
banned in Japan, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Hong Kong.

One of China's biggest milk producers, China Mengniu Dairy Co, saw
its stock price plummet slightly more than 60 per cent in Hong Kong
trading after some of its products were found tainted with melamine.

[2] Hong Kong - Melamine found in cakes, new cases

The number of Hong Kong children found with kidney stones rose to 4
as the industrial chemical melamine believed to be responsible was
found in cakes for the 1st time.

In addition, 365 children have been referred to special assessment
centers after displaying symptoms related to kidney problems.

The Centre for Food Safety said tests on Four Seas Cake (strawberry
flavor) showed more than twice the permitted amount that became
effective yesterday [23 Sep 2008]. The chemical was also found in
White Rabbit Creamy Candies.

The center urged the public to stop consuming these items and said
importers had agreed to recall the products. A spokesman said no one
will be prosecuted since the samples were collected before the
amendment setting the melamine limit at 2.6 parts per million for
non-dairy products came into effect.

The 2 new kidney patients, aged 9 years and 29 months, were living in
the mainland.

The 9-year-old, who has been drinking 2 to 4 packets of Mengniu milk
(250g) purchased in Shenzhen everyday for the past 4 years, was
admitted to a private hospital in Hong Kong last Saturday [20 Sep
2008]. He has since been discharged and is now in stable condition.

The 29-month-old boy had been drinking Sanlu and Yili milk since he
was 8 months old. He was examined at Kwong Wah Hospital outpatient
clinic on Monday [22 Sep 2008] and remains under treatment.

About one-quarter of the 1328 children seeking evaluations at the 18
general outpatient clinics yesterday [23 Sep 2008] were referred to
the 7 special assessment centers for further checkups after
displaying symptoms related to kidney problems.

None of the children, however, required hospital admission.

The symptoms involved blood in the urine, a small amount of
urination, discomfort when urinating or bad temper.

Secretary for Food and Health York Chow Yat-ngok said a task force
will study the number of Hong Kong-born children living in the mainland.

The center hotline, 2125 1133, has received 2148 inquiries, with 651
callers claiming they or their children had consumed tainted milk
products. Of these, 157 claimed to have symptoms of renal problems.

A 16-month-old child in Macau, who was fed Nestle milk powder, has
been diagnosed with a kidney stone.

[3] Taiwan - possible cases

<http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=747325>


A 2-year-old girl who lived in China with her parents was diagnosed
with signs of a hardening kidney yesterday [23 Sep 2008] in what
might be the 1st case in Taiwan of a melamine-related disease.

The girl drank milk made from Chinese milk powder on a regular basis
as she lived with her Taiwanese father and Chinese mother in
Guangzhou, the Chinese-language United Evening News said yesterday
[23 Sep 2008].

The family recently arrived in Taiwan and had the girl undergo a
regular check at a hospital in Taichung County.

Doctors found a hardening kidney, though no kidney stone, symptoms of
ingesting melamine, the toxic chemical added to some Chinese dairy
products to fool protein tests.

The hospital said continued observation of the child was necessary,
though kidney stones would not necessarily develop. Another medical
test would be needed 2 months from now, the hospital said.

People needed to drink the tainted product for at least 2 months
before kidney problems would show, Taipei City Hospital president
Huang Pi-tao told reporters.

In Taipei, doctors found kidney stones in 2 adults out of 25 adults
and 2 children who underwent checks yesterday [23 Sep 2008] morning.
The doctors were also unable to tell whether the kidney problems were
related to long-term drinking of milk products.

A 74-year-old man who said he had the habit of drinking milk tea was
diagnosed with a 2-centimeter-long kidney stone. Doctors said he
should undergo an operation to remove the stone.

The other patient, a 40-year-old woman, was in a far less serious
state. Her problem could be solved by drinking more water, doctors said.

The diagnoses came as hospitals across Taiwan geared up to provide
free kidney-stone screening for children or for patients who thought
they might have suffered from drinking the contaminated dairy
products. The hospitals taking part in the 6-month program will
provide urine tests and ultrasound examinations.

[The above newswire mentions the identification of possible renal
disease in a 2-year old with a history of ingestion of milk prepared
from powdered milk while living in Guangdong. It also mentions that
kidney stones were identified in 2 out of 25 adults screened and 2
children screened. It seems to suggest that there were now 3 cases of
kidney abnormalities in children identified in Taiwan. Concluding
that the kidney stones in adults were related to ingestion of
melamine adulterated milk products will be a challenge, unless these
individuals are screened for the presence of melamine and its
by-products. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Viet Nam - melamine found in milk products
Date: Wed 24 Sep 2008

<http://www.thanhniennews.com/healthy/?catid=8&newsid=42265>


Tests conducted in Ho Chi Minh City show the presence of melamine in
samples taken from milk imported from YiLi Industrial Group, one of 3
Chinese companies found to have melamine in their milk products.

Local importer Kim An Company in HCMCs Phu Nhuan District said
results from examinations done by an affiliate of the city's
Department of Science and Technology revealed a melamine
concentration of 25.34 micrograms per liter.

However, no regulations have been established in Viet Nam that
pronounce at what concentration level melamine would be poisonous for
consumption.

Kim An Company also said it has recalled all the YiLi milk it had
distributed. However, 321 tins of one-liter milk had already been
sold. The company reportedly imported 1494 cartons of milk (one
carton contains 12 tins) from YiLi Industrial Group.

The HCMC Health Department said Tuesday [23 Sep 2008] it had
confiscated 1081 cartons from the company and also seized 3375
kilograms of milk powder lacking required documents being transported
on a truck belonging to Duc Long Hang Co., Ltd. in District 10.

An inspection in Hanoi Tuesday [23 Sep 2008] of Hoang Lam Trading and
Technology JSC found 25 tons of cream imported from China lacking
quality certification.

The inspectors requested the company present documents today [24 Sep
2008] on 42 tons of milk powder imported from China last year [2007]
without quality guarantees.

Deputy Minister of Health Cao Minh Quang Tuesday [23 Sep 2008] set up
2 inspection forces to probe production and trading of dairy products
in northern and southern provinces.

In related news, Sanlu Group, the Chinese dairy firm 1st found to be
selling melamine-contaminated goods, allegedly began receiving
complaints of sick children as early as last December [2007], AFP
quoted Chinese media CCTV as saying.

The media source also said local officials in the northern city of
Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based, delayed referring the matter to
higher authorities for more than a month after Sanlu informed them of
the problem on [2 Aug 2008].

[5] Viet Nam - melamine found in milk products
Date: Tue 23 Sep 2008

<http://www.nhandan.com.vn/english/life/230908/life_m.htm>


The Health Ministry has sent an urgent message to centrally-governed
provinces and cities to suspend the circulation of milk products and
materials of unidentified origins.

The ministry also directed local health departments to work with
related agencies to inspect the sources of supply of all milk
products and materials in the market, especially those imported from China.

Qualitative samples taken from Vietnamese and imported milk products
and materials must be tested for melamine, with test results being
reported to the Health Ministry immediately.

Provinces and cities were asked to submit preliminary reports to the
Health Ministry prior to [25 Sep 2008].

On [22 Sep 2008], Ho Chi Minh City's Health Department Inspector
sealed up 18 000 liters of Yili Pure Milk produced by the Chinese
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group at the warehouse of an importing company.

Noticeably, this is one of 22 Chinese companies whose product samples
were found to be melamine-contaminated.

Samples of 18 000 liters of Yili Pure Milk were taken for testing for
melamine, a chemical substance which causes kidney-related diseases
in many Chinese children.

[Milk products imported from China have been confiscated in Viet Nam,
as they were found to be contaminated with melamine, which has
adverse effects on the function of kidneys, and can lead to renal
failure. However, some of those products have already been sold. At
present, there have been no case reports of children with kidney
stones or kidney failure in Viet Nam associated with the
melamine-adulterated milk.

China has been reporting an increasing number of children who have
sought medical treatment associated with the consumption of
melamine-contaminated powdered infant formula. According to the
report from the Ministry of Health of China dated 22 Sep 2008, nearly
40 000 children have received medical treatment; almost 12 900 are
currently hospitalized, and 3 deaths have been confirmed (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Infant kidney stones - China (06): WHO, timeline
20080922.2990 below).

and Response of the World Health Organization is available at:

[As of today, 24 Sep 2008, there have been 5 cases of children
identified with renal stones associated with ingestion of implicated
Chinese milk products outside of mainland China: 4 residents of Hong
Kong and one resident of Macau. There is the suggestion of between
one and 3 possible cases identified in Taiwan as well (see part [3]
above) and rumors of cases in the Maldives (see part [6][a] above).
From the myriad newswires available, the list of countries with
identifiable products containing the implicated Chinese milk
continues to grow. It is clear that with time, more and more
countries will be announcing either bans on importations of food
products known to contain Chinese milk or will be implementing
regulations that mandate testing imported products for melamine
before permitting them to be sold in their countries. A real
challenge will be to establish whether there are other children
affected by these products in other countries where the products were imported.

ProMED-mail will continue to monitor the situation and provide
updates when more information is known on the extent of the impact of
the melamine adulteration. At this point, further information on
additional countries banning importation seems unnecessary, as the
pattern is clearly established this is occurring in many countries. - Mod.MPP]
