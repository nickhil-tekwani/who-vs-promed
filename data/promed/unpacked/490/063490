The most recent effort to crush the largest measles outbreak in nearly 3 decades took place at a Brooklyn soccer field.

As Latino players and fans showed up for a weekend tournament, Spanish-speaking health teams offered free vaccines to players and spectators, explaining the outbreak in predominantly Orthodox Jewish communities had spread in recent weeks and sickened some Latino adults.

New York City's efforts to halt the largest and longest-lasting measles outbreak in decades have been "nothing short of epic," said City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot. That's also true of the costs -- at least USD 2.3 million through mid-May [2019], including overtime and purchases for vaccines, supplies, and outreach materials. The pace of new cases appears to be slowing at last, but officials still fear the outbreak could reignite at summer camps, through holiday travel to regions experiencing measles outbreaks, and with the start of school.

Around the country, health officials have been trying new strategies to fight misinformation about vaccines and protect people who aren't fully vaccinated and are therefore vulnerable to one of the most contagious diseases on Earth.

At least 30 states have reported measles cases, with the total number -- 1164 -- constituting the country's worst outbreak in a quarter century. New York City's outbreak began in October [2019]. By this spring [2019], about 400 of the health department's 6500 employees were working on the measles emergency. More than 31 000 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine have been given to individuals in the heart of the outbreak. In the past 9 months, at least 642 cases have been reported.

Just outside the city, there have been at least 289 cases in Rockland County, New York, including 6 reported in late July [2019]; county officials estimate their costs at more than USD 2 million.

[The case number and case fatality rate of measles in the DRC are a sad reminder that there are other highly infectious diseases devastating this country, and in the case of Ebola and measles, particularly children. This is an unacceptable public health disaster. The public health infrastructure badly needs strengthening and more support from the global community to be able to confront these outbreaks. But even with strengthening of the infrastructure, the unrest and lack of trust disrupt delivery of vaccines and healthcare to the people who need it. - Mod.LK

For the 1st time [since 2014], UNICEF and partners were able to reach nearly 13 million children with vaccination in close cooperation with local health authorities and the World Health Organization, including in areas where access was restricted for many years due to insecurity and conflict.

"We welcome the new window of access that allowed to vaccinate children in South Kordofan and the Blue Nile. This will significantly reduce the risk of diseases spreading among children," said UNICEF Representative in Sudan Abdullah Fadil.

Kicking off in April 2019, and despite ongoing socio-political uncertainty in the country, the campaign provided children under the age of 10 with vaccines against measles and polio combined with vitamin A supplement covering 18 states.

Measles is the 3rd cause of mortality among infants in Sudan. While the country has not seen a case of polio for almost 9 years, certain factors put it at considerable risk of poliovirus importation and outbreaks.

The risk of vaccine-preventable diseases among children in South Kordofan and Blue Nile States is high due to the decline in immunity due to insecurity and conflict in these areas.
