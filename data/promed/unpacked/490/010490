As of [Fri 15 Aug 2014], 2 cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) have been confirmed in South Carolina. A horse in Darlington County and a miniature donkey in Horry County, both died, recently tested positive for the disease, according to a news release issued by Clemson University [CU]. According to the CU Media Relations news release, horses should be vaccinated to prevent infection with eastern equine encephalitis. Eastern equine encephalitis is a serious, mosquito-borne illness in horses that can also affect humans. Vaccination can prevent the disease in horses.

"Horse owners should check with their veterinarian to be sure their horses' vaccinations are up to date against both EEE and West Nile Virus," said Boyd Parr, state veterinarian and director of Clemson University Livestock-Poultry Health (LPH). "Vaccination is especially important in our coastal counties."

The EEE virus is maintained in nature through a cycle involving the freshwater swamp mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, commonly known as the black-tailed mosquito. "2 to 3 days after becoming infected with EEE virus, a mosquito becomes capable of transmitting the virus," said Adam Eichelberger, veterinarian overseeing LPH animal health programs. "Infected mosquitoes feeding on both birds and mammals can transmit the disease to horses and humans."

Signs usually develop in horses from 2 to 5 days after exposure. The signs include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, the inability to stand, muscle twitching or death. 9 out of every 10 horses infected with EEE virus die from the disease. In South Carolina last year [2013], 48 of the 49 of the confirmed cases died from the EEE infection. South Carolina led the nation in EEE cases.

Any livestock, including horses, that display neurologic signs -- stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression, or apprehension -- must be reported to the state veterinarian within 48 hours, according to state law.

[The immunity to EEE wanes more quickly than the other encephalitis titers. It is recommended in areas where EEE is prevalent, especially the Gulf coast and eastern seaboard of the US, that horses be vaccinated every 4-6 months to prevent this disease.
