We wish to thank the moderator for his comments. We also wish to provide the following clarification:

It deserves emphasis that infant botulism is not a form of food poisoning and, for the vast majority of cases, the source of spores is never determined. Nonetheless, consumption of honey remains an important preventable risk factor despite it being associated with relatively few cases of infant botulism in North America (1). While improperly canned foods or traditional indigenous foods may be causes of foodborne botulism, they are not risk factors for infant botulism. In addition, infant botulism is not caused by entry of spores through open wounds. It has been suggested that most patients who contract infant botulism probably do so by inhaling and swallowing airborne _Clostridium botulinum_ spores which are common in dust and soils (2,3).
