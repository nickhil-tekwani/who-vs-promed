A 49-year-old man from south China's Shenzhen city has been diagnosed
with _Streptococcus suis_, a pig-borne bacterial disease that can be
fatal, the local government said on Wed 25 Jul 2007.
The patient is receiving treatment and is in stable condition, the
information office of the municipal government said.
The man, who lives in Bao'an District, felt sick at around 9:00 a.m.
last Thursday [19 Jul 2007] and went to a local clinic for treatment.
His condition improved after treatment, but he fell into a coma in
his dormitory on Saturday [21 Jul 2007] morning and was sent to
Longhua Hospital for treatment.
He has since been transferred to Shenzhen People's Hospital, and the
Shenzhen Disease Control and Prevention Center diagnosed him with the disease.
The local government did not reveal how the man contracted the
disease but did make a point of saying that local health and
agricultural authorities had strengthened inspections of meat products.
The man's family members, colleagues and roommates have shown no
symptoms of the disease, and no epidemic has been found among pigs in
the Shenzhen, the government said.
Initial symptoms of _Streptococcus suis_ are fever, headaches and
dizziness and it can cause meningitis and arthritis.
In 2005, an outbreak of the disease killed 37 people and infected
more than 250 in southwest China's Sichuan province [The numbers of
cases and deaths differ from prior reports. See "Streptococcus suis,
porcine, human, 2005 - China (Sichuan) 20060411.1082." - Mod.ML].

[Shenzhen is a port city of 9 million people located on the border
with Hong Kong in the southern part China's Guangdong province
<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/shenzhen#demographics>.
It has grown from a small fishing town to a prosperous center of
foreign investment, industry and commerce over the past 20 years; for a map see
<http://www..maps of China.com/shenzhen-ow.shtml>.
During 2005, sporadic cases of _S. suis_ infection in humans have
been reported from Guangdong (4 cases) and Hong Kong (13 cases), and
an outbreak was reported from Sichuan that involved 204 cases with 38
deaths in that year (see ProMED posting "Streptococcus suis, porcine,
human, 2005 - China (Sichuan) 20060411.1082"). Hong Kong reported 8
more cases in 2006 and 3 so far in 2007. The Shenzhen case in the
current report is likely the same as the case (49-year-old male
living in Bao'an District of Shenzhen City) mentioned by the ProMED
moderator in the recent ProMED posting, "Streptococcus suis, human,
porcine & PRRS - Viet Nam 20070726.2403."
For a discussion of the disease in humans and pigs, see prior ProMED
postings "Streptococcus suis, human, porcine & PRRS - Viet Nam
