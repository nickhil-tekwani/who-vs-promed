[These increases are not unexpected and follow from having one's medical and veterinary staff out in the field, the locals keener to report, and sick people seeking help or relatives taking the medics to see sick folk. If the numbers start jumping we will know that we are getting significant spread. This can happen when biting flies start having an impact. - Mod.MHJ
