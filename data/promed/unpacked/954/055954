Toxic Metal Cadmium Found in Chinese Made Kid's Jewelry
-------------------------------------------------------
Deprived of the ability to use lead in children's jewelry manufactured
and bound for the U.S., it appears China has found a deep, and even
more toxic, substitute. An Associated Press (AP) investigation has
found the more dangerous heavy metal cadmium is being used by some
Chinese manufacturers in those fake jewelry being sold throughout the
United States. [This is actually cheap costume jewelry. I am unaware
the jewelry is being passed as "fake" for anything. - Mod.TG]

Anyone who has watched a todddler or young child at play knows that it
is not necessary to assume a child will have to swallow a
cadmium-laced item to be harmed. Children love to suck on such items,
and cadmium is toxic enough for poisoning to occur from repeated
sucking.

[The concern here stems from the original AP report
<http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wirestory?id=9525526&page=2\>
stating that some of the jewelry flaked off cadmium particles. A piece
of jewelry or toy or any other item that is flaking off pieces of
cadmium could be toxic if they were consumed. - Mod.TG]

Lab testing was done on 103 items purchased in New York, Ohio, Texas
and California. All but one were bought in November or December
[2009], making the sampling very recent. The results are worrisome: 12
percent of the pieces of jewelry contained at least 10 percent
cadmium. [Although these 103 items were recently purchased there were
other items purchased in 2008, according to the original AP article. -
Mod.TG]

One of the tested items was 91 percent cadmium by weight. Others
showed 89 percent, 86 percent and 84 percent cadmium by weight. In
some items, cadmium was easily shed from the jewelry.

For parents who see their children demand trinkets associated with
popular movies, the study noted that high amounts of cadmium also were
detected in "The Princess and The Frog" movie-themed pendants.

Bruce A. Fowler, a cadmium specialist and toxicologist with the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said "There's nothing
positive that you can say about this metal. It's a poison." Not only
is it toxic, on the CDC's priority list of 275 most hazardous
substances in the environment, cadmium ranks number 7.

Examples of some of the issues associated with cadmium poisoning can
be recalled from Japan, where environmental exposure to cadmium was
the result of people consuming rice that was grown in cadmium
contaminated irrigation water. The phenomenon was known as itai-itai
disease. "Itai" means "ouch" in Japanese. Cadmium is also a carcinogen.

Cadmium poisoning can affect bones, causing osteoporosis, renal
failure, and more. Continued long enough, death will result.

[Cadmium is a lustrous, silver-white, ductile, very malleable metal.
Its surface has a bluish tinge and the metal is soft enough to be cut
with a knife, but it tarnishes in air. It is soluble in acids but not
in alkalis. It is similar in many respects to zinc but it forms more
complex compounds. In the earth's crust, cadmium is always found in
association with zinc. Cadmium can be produced as a byproduct of
smelting zinc.

The disease referred to 'itai-itai' literally translates to
'ouch-ouch' disease. The disease is characterized by osteomalacia
accompanied with osteoporosis, and multiple proximal renal tubular
dysfunctions. Cadmium causes a syndrome described as softening of the
bones, and it affects all bones and joints, including those of the
spine. The bone pain and the kidney pain of those suffering from the
disease gave rise to the name of the disease.

In addition, victims of cadmium intoxication generally suffer with dry
throat, cough, headache, vomiting, chest pain, congestive lung
conditions, pulmonary edema, bronchospasm, wheezing, pneumonitis,
muscle weakness, and severe leg pain. Additionally damage to the
immune system, psychological damage and even cancers have been
associated with cadmium toxicity. Supportive care is about the best
treatment. EDTA (ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid) chelation therapy
has been added to hemodialysis and has had some positive effect.

While the Consumer Protection Safety Commission is aware of high
cadmium levels, they seem to be hampered in regulating this product as
most of the regulations test for lead, not cadmium.
