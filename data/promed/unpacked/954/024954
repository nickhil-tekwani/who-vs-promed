Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to pet bearded dragons
-----------------------------------------------------------------
CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Muenster infections linked to bearded dragons.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 25 Sep 2020, a total of 13 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Muenster have been reported from 8 states.

Idaho / 2
Illinois / 1

Total / 13

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 23 Feb 2020 to 22 Aug 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 72 years, with a median age of 15. 5 ill people are children under 5 years of age. 58 percent of ill people are female. Of 11 ill people with information available, 7 were reported to have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis of 10 bacterial isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) of 3 isolates also showed no resistance.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence shows that contact with pet bearded dragons is the likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of the 13 people interviewed, 10 (77%) reported contact with bearded dragons before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying bearded dragons from various pet stores in multiple states. A common supplier has not been identified. The outbreak strain making people sick was identified in samples collected from a bearded dragon and its environment from the home of an ill person in Virginia.

Bearded dragons can carry _Salmonella_ that can make people sick even if they look healthy and clean. Bearded dragon owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their pets.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.

[Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles, and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk and directly kissing the animal would not be considered appropriate behavior.

Pogona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon, (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi desert regions, and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
