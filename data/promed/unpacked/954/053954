On 20 Oct 2010, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS)
announced that it had determined chopped celery was the source of a
_Listeria_ food poisoning outbreak among Texas residents. Texas DSHS
had been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the
illness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_
bacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when
investigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped
celery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10
cases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped
celery.

According to a health department press release, all cases of
_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo
counties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious
underlying health problems.

Several segments of the population are at increased risk for
contracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:
Pregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy
adults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen
during pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women
themselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;
Persons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,
diabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more
likely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);
Persons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);
and the elderly.

Texas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce
in San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products
shipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of
chopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.
According to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the
food processing plant posed "an immediate and serious threat to human
life or health."

Sangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut
fresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to
restaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and
schools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to
have been sold in grocery stores.

Texas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at
the plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe
the _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have
contaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency
stated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found
above the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also
found soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing
issues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of
_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was
chopped and packaged.

Texas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation
into the possible points within the facility where the celery became
contaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,
restaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled
products to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh
Cut Produce does not reach consumers.

The order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening
without DSHS approval.

The incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of
symptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21
days.

A person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and
sometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If
infection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,
stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In
immune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central
nervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain
infection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a
mild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead
to miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

Newborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)
or late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the
early-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with
sepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most
often acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.
Late-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset
form. Clinical symptoms may be subtle and include irritability, fever
and poor feeding. The mode of acquisition of late-onset listeriosis
is poorly understood.

State health officials discounted claims by the president of Sangar
Produce & Processing Co. that the company's celery -- linked to the
deaths of 5 people from foodborne illness -- is "absolutely safe."

"When we test produce, we do a rapid screen initially," said Texas
Department of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams. "But
then we follow up with a very extensive, week long test where we grow
the organism to be sure of what we have. The celery was tested
independently of other ingredients, and our scientists concluded that
the illnesses were linked to the celery processed at the Sangar
plant."

State health officials ordered the closing of the produce plant and
the recall of all products shipped from there since January 2010
following the deaths of 5 people in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo
counties from listeriosis. Five other people have become ill after
eating chopped celery processed by the plant at 1500 S. Zarzamora.
Officials say there's no indication celery was shipped outside Texas.

In a statement, company president Kenneth Sanquist Jr. said
independent testing done on the produce found it to be safe, adding,
"we are aggressively fighting the state's erroneous findings." A call
to the company headquarters Thursday [21 Oct 2010] morning was
referred to the Uresti Law Firm, where an employee said a statement
would be released later in the day.

Health services spokeswoman Williams said Sangar products are sold
primarily to restaurants, hospitals and elementary schools, although
she would not release the names of any facilities were the celery
might have been consumed. Also unknown is the volume of produce
Sangar sold in the 10 months covered by the recall. "Celery is often
frozen and, while you wouldn't want to eat it raw after it was
defrosted, it's still often used as an ingredient in other dishes,"
explained Williams.

Williams would not estimate when the Sangar plant would resume
operations. "Right now, we're working with the company to collect
distribution information and to get the produce back to protect the
health of consumers," she said. "After that, we'll work with them to
make sure the facility is clean and safe and ready to re-open."

Tracking the outbreak was difficult for several reasons. Only a small
number of cases have been reported, and many of the victims were
elderly, with poor memories, or had already died. Also, _Listeria
monocytogenes_, the bacteria that causes listeriosis, has an
incubation period of up to 70 days.

[Since _Listeria monocytogenes_ in raw food would be killed during
cooking, the risk of listeriosis is usually greatest from
ready-to-eat products; that is, food that will not be further cooked
before eating. DNA fingerprinting of the isolates would help in
establishing epidemiologic linkage. It is not stated in the news
release above whether DNA fingerprinting was done, and if so, whether
there was a common DNA fingerprint among the strains of _L.
monocytogenes_ isolated from patients in the Texas outbreak, which
would indicate a common source, and whether the DNA fingerprint of
clinical isolates matched that of the strains isolated from the
celery processed at the Sangar plant. A detailed discussion of
listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20071230.4186.

All cases of the Texas listeriosis outbreak occurred in Bexar, Travis
and Hidalgo counties. Travis County is part of the city of Austin
metropolitan area. Austin is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas
and is located in Central Texas. San Antonio, the county seat of
Bexar County, is located 80 miles to the southwest of Austin. Hidalgo
County is located on the Rio Grande River at the border with Mexico.
