A 3rd outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was identified by government
vets yesterday [Sun 16 Sep 2007]. News of the case, which has not yet been
confirmed by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA),
coincides with today's [17 Sep 2007] official EU inspection of the
government's handling of the outbreak.
The Times has learnt that the results of tests on cattle culled last Friday
[14 Sep 2007] showed that they were infected. It was cattle [from a plot of
land near Chertsey and kept by the owner] at Milton Park Farm, near Egham,
Surrey, that triggered the resurgence of the disease last week. Results are
awaited on 24 pigs kept at a smallholding next to Stroude Farm, Virginia
Water, where the disease was confirmed in cattle on Friday [14 Sep 2007].
The pigs were slaughtered amid fears that they could be infected.
Vaccination teams are on standby at an aerodrome near Guildford, but are
unlikely to be called on today [17 Sep 2007]. The government contingency
plan makes clear that vaccination must be considered on day 5 of an
outbreak, which falls today [* see footnote]. But without a dramatic rise
in cases and no evidence of any leap in the virus from outside the
surveillance zone, vaccination is unlikely to be recommended by Debby
Reynolds, the Government's chief vet, though the possibility will remain
under review.
The European delegation, from the Food and Veterinary Office, is due to
arrive in London today [17 Sep 2007] to monitor the Government's efforts to
control the disease. It is also to inspect biosecurity at the Pirbright
Scientific Research Centre, where the virus escaped from a broken drainpipe.
State vets and animal health officials have stepped up inspections at the
other holdings in the Surrey surveillance zone. There is concern that some
farmers, especially those who keep small numbers of animals, may have
failed to spot signs of disease.
There was also criticism yesterday [16 Sep 2007] about the containment of
the present outbreak after 4 cattle escaped from a field at Ripley early on
Saturday [15 Sept 2007] as Government vets and slaughtermen arrived to
carry out a cull. The cattle were apparently "spooked" shortly after 7 am
and fled across fields, went through a canal and ended up at the 16th hole
of Pyrford Golf Club where golfers discovered them at 10.30 am. Police and
DEFRA officials ordered the greens to be cleared. For 5 hours 60 golfers
were instructed to remain in the clubhouse. One of the golfers caught up in
the drama was appalled by what he described as the mismanagement at the
scene. [The man,] who runs a farmers' cooperative, said: "I am probably
more aware than most about the impact of this disease on farmers. But I was
horrified by the poor biosecurity. They made us all disinfect our shoes but
they were not at all interested in our golf trolleys, clubs, or bags that
were also in contact with the grass where the cattle had been. There were
also pools of water around the club but they also ignored car tyres. There
should have been a disinfectant mat at the clubhouse."
Government vets are finalising an epidemiology report into the latest
spread of FMD, 4 days after the UK was declared disease-free. Hundreds of
movements are being traced in a 50 km (31 mile) radius from Pirbright,
where the Institute of Animal Health and Merial, the pharmaceutical
company, handle the virus. Traces are being made on all lorry movements
from the site. It is thought that the leaked virus was picked up on tyres
of contractors' vehicles, which then shed the virus on a lane near the
Surrey farm where cattle contracted the disease in August [2007].

[* The following relevant passages are derived from DEFRA's "Emergency
vaccination protocol", available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/pdf/vacprotocol.pdf>:
"The UK has its own stocks of FMD antigens held, on its behalf by a
commercial supplier and the EU Vaccine Bank also holds a range of antigens
for emergency use.
"DEFRA has arrangements in place with GENUS, an external contractor to
implement an emergency vaccination programme. The contractor has trained a
1st response team made up of sufficient lay vaccinators and support staff
for 50 teams and recruited 25 vets to support them. The contractor can
ramp-up this level of response to meet any reasonable disease scenario
within 4 to 5 days of notification. This is GB wide contract and the
contractor will, at all times, be working under the control and direction
of the State Veterinary Service.
"Vaccination teams can be operationally ready to vaccinate by day 5 of any
outbreak. Strain identification of the virus and vaccine formulation might
take a little longer. Vaccine could be formulated for dispatch to the
regional vaccination centres within 3 to 4 days once the strain is known.
In practice, it is unlikely that vaccination would commence on this
timescale as it will take time to collect the epidemiological data to
support vaccination decisions." - Mod.AS]

[The unofficial, yet to be confirmed, information above on a 3rd outbreak
within the 2nd wave of FMD in Surrey, has not been mentioned by other news
media. This outbreak is currently regarded as "suspected".
The BBC indicated on 17 Sep 2007 morning that "pigs on a farm near the 2
infected premises have been culled as a precaution following inconclusive
tests for the disease." Laboratory results and the official DEFRA update
would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
