A virus appears to be the cause behind a rash of polio-like illnesses that struck Minnesota last fall [2018], causing paralyzing symptoms in several children, including one girl who lost all motor function and remains hospitalized. Researchers from Minnesota and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Thursday [18 Apr 2019] that they found enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) in the spinal fluid of one of 6 children with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).

The virus caused the condition in that child and is presumed to be the cause in the other 5, according to the researchers, who described their finding as a key development in addressing a puzzling national outbreak.

"[AFM] is incredibly scary for patients and families," said Dr. Heidi Moline, the lead author of the report and the University of Minnesota's chief pediatrics resident. "The fact that we were able to definitively identify the EV-D68 virus as the cause of paralysis in one of our Minnesota patients does suggest this virus as a probable cause in our other recent AFM cases."

Moline said the researchers are working with public health officials to better understand the virus and how it affects children. EV-D68 has been suspected for some time as a cause, in part because of surveillance data since 2012 showing that spikes in AFM cases emerged in lockstep with the virus every other fall in 2014, 2016 and 2018.

The virus was previously found in the spinal fluid of a California child, but contamination of the fluid had tainted those results, Moline said. "This is the 1st true confirmation that we've had," she added.

AFM is a neurological disorder that affects the spongy gray matter surrounding the spinal cord and damages nerves and their communication with muscles. The 1st public reports of AFM in 2018 showed up in Minnesota, which ended the year with 10 of the nation's 228 confirmed cases.

The new research report was based on 6 children, ages 1 to 9 years, who were hospitalized between 19 Sep and 1 Oct [2019] after suffering headaches or flu symptoms that devolved into limb weakness or paralysis. The CDC released the findings in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

Limb weakness was reported in the left arms of 2 children, the right arms of 2 others and the left legs of 2 others. Five of the children improved after receiving infusions of immunoglobulin to boost their immune systems and physical therapy exercises.

One 7-year-old girl suffered rapid paralysis that has not improved. The report indicates that she has lost all voluntary limb movements but remains cognitively intact.

[JH] of Lakeville said he still can't believe how quickly his active 7-year-old son, [QH], went from flulike symptoms to loss of motion in his upper left arm. "It's hard looking at pictures, looking back, because he was the healthiest kid you ever met," [JH] said.

Research like the study released this week, together with public awareness about AFM, should help clinicians if the pattern holds and cases surge again in the fall of 2022, but doctors still don't know for certain the best ways to treat it, even with the role of the virus being confirmed, said Dr. Anupama Kalaskar, a co-author of the report and an infectious disease specialist for Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.

"Some patients received multiple treatments," she said, "so it's hard to tease out which may have worked and which didn't work."

[JH]'s son regained some movement in his left elbow over the winter through physical therapy at clinics and exercises at home designed to kick-start the nerves damaged by AFM. [QH] still can't lift his arm from his shoulder, though.

[QH] underwent surgery in Los Angeles, California, a week ago to transplant healthy nerves into his dormant upper left arm. The procedure was something of a disappointment, his father said, because the ideal nerves for transfer were found during the operation to be unusable. The family is hoping the procedure still will restore mobility after [QH]'s cast is removed.

While [QH] has been resilient and upbeat, and even showed some signs of strength-building in his biceps this winter, he still can't push himself up with his left arm or raise it above his head. "From our standpoint," [JH] said, "we felt strongly that we needed to be able to give him every single chance to be able to move."

Despite suspicions about EV-D68, doctors and clinicians had struggled to find it in the spinal fluid of afflicted children. The virus was found in their noses, but that doesn't prove that it played a role in a neurological disorder, Moline said. One possibility is that the virus has already exited the spinal fluid before the paralyzing symptoms emerge, so tests simply occur too late.

The confirmation of EV-D68 does not rule out other viruses as potential causes. Nor does it rule out the possibility of environmental factors, which could explain why just one in 1 million children contract AFM due to the exposure, while most children simply suffer common colds.

Moline said it does underscore the importance of basic public health measures to reduce the spread of germs. "Our guidance at this time is really to cover coughs, wash hands, and try to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, especially in the fall," she said.

Cases of AFM were confirmed last year [2018] in 41 states but mostly occurred in regional clusters, presumably in states where EV-D68 and other viruses are prevalent. California and Colorado have both reported high numbers of cases since 2014.

A frustration for disease investigators is that the afflicted children seem to have little in common. In Minnesota, 4 of the children had no underlying health conditions, while one had cerebral palsy and suffered from seizures. Five of the 6 were girls. One had no prior cold symptoms, while the others had reported headaches, vomiting or diarrhea before their loss of movement.

"These children didn't go to the same day care; they didn't live in the same street," Moline said. "Aside from living here in Minnesota, there wasn't anything that was a common factor."

During 14 Sep to 1 Oct 2018, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified of 6 children hospitalized in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region with symptoms consistent with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). A confirmed case of AFM is defined as acute onset of flaccid limb weakness with magnetic resonance image indicating spinal cord lesions largely restricted to gray matter and spanning one or more vertebral segments (1). All 6 cases were confirmed by the CDC. After a cluster of 3 cases occurred in 2014, an average of fewer than one AFM case per year had been reported to MDH.

Among the 6 patients, the median patient age was 6.0 years (range, 1.3-9.2 years). All children resided in different Minnesota counties, and all experienced fever and upper respiratory signs and symptoms (e.g., rhinorrhea and cough) beginning a median of 8 days (range, 5-11 days) before weakness onset; none had a history of being immunocompromised. In addition, 4 patients experienced neck pain or headache, and 2 experienced diarrhea before weakness onset. Four patients had marked weakness of proximal muscle groups in one arm, although distal motor function was largely preserved. The other 2 patients initially had weakness in one leg, which became bilateral and rapidly ascended during hospitalization; both of these patients required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. In all 6 patients, limb weakness was 1st noted after waking in the morning. No epidemiologic links among patients were identified.

All 6 patients were hospitalized. Three patients were discharged home, and 2 were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. One patient remains hospitalized with complete paralysis of all voluntary muscles, including the diaphragm, at the time of this report. All discharged patients had residual weakness at time of discharge; among these patients, the median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (range, 1-14 days).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated spinal cord gray matter involvement in all 6 patients, largely in the anterior horns. The extent of gray matter involvement did not always correlate with deficits seen on physical exam; in 3 patients with only single limb weakness, multisegment gray matter involvement was apparent. Among all patients, 3 had anterior nerve root and facial nerve enhancement, and 2 had basilar and brainstem involvement. Three patients had normal MRI findings early in the illness course but demonstrated extensive gray matter involvement on a subsequent MRI.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected in 5 patients, with pleocytosis (white blood cell count more than 5 cells/mm3) present in 2 patients (see Table at source URL). One CSF specimen (patient B) was positive for enterovirus (not typed) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a commercial reference laboratory. Serum, CSF, stool, and nasopharyngeal specimens from 5 patients were tested at CDC. One nasopharyngeal swab (patient D) was positive for enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) by real-time RT-PCR. One nasal wash specimen from patient B was positive for EV-D68 and a 2nd specimen for EV-D68 and parechovirus A6 by real-time RT-PCR; CSF from this patient also was positive for EV-D68. The remaining specimens were negative, including those from 3 patients who had no positive specimens. All stool specimens were negative for poliovirus.

Five of 6 patients received some form of immunomodulatory treatment (see Table at source URL). One patient was treated with steroids and plasmapheresis followed by intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), one with steroids followed by IVIG, 3 with only IVIG, and one with supportive care only.

This AFM cluster, the largest identified in Minnesota, occurred during a period of increased reporting of AFM nationally and is consistent with the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of previously described AFM clusters (2-6). Despite report of upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms in all patients, testing for viruses that commonly cause upper respiratory tract infections was positive from nonsterile specimens in only 2 cases. EV-D68 in the CSF of patient B is considered the cause of AFM in this patient. Detection of a pathogen in the CSF might be related to the severity and prolonged nature of illness in this patient; however, host or other factors contributing to illness severity are unknown.

AFM is a rare but serious cause of sudden-onset limb weakness, especially in children, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis and care of patients with AFM includes early collection of specimens, including CSF, for laboratory testing, MRI scans, and consultation with neurology and infectious disease experts. Potential cases should be reported to public health departments in a timely manner. Public health classification of AFM cases involves expert review of clinical and imaging findings; however, it is important that clinical care not be delayed pending case classification.
