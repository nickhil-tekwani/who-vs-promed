The province of Buenos Aires has registered the largest number of confirmed cases of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (FHA) in the last 10 years, as detailed by the Ministry of Health in its latest epidemiological bulletin.

The increase of FHA cases has been causing concern in the north of the province of Buenos Aires with the confirmation of infections in the districts of San Nicolás, Pergamino, and Ramallo.

In this framework, the Buenos Aires government reported in its latest epidemiological bulletin (the one corresponding to the week of 5-11 Jun [2022]) that "the number of confirmed cases registered by the province is the highest in the last 10 years."

Nicolás Kreplak, in charge of the agency, indicated that, so far this year [2022], "75 suspected cases have been reported." Of that total, "12 cases were confirmed (15%), 27 discarded, and 40 remain as suspected cases with inconclusive results awaiting 2nd samples to complete serological studies." For the same period in 2021, 15 suspected cases and one confirmed case had been registered.

The Ministry of Health explained that "the districts of San Nicolás, Pergamino, and Ramallo, where the cases of FHA have been confirmed, correspond to the endemic area of the disease and where the appearance of sporadic cases is expected."

In addition, he indicated that "as for the treatment, only 4 confirmed cases did not receive a transfusion with convalescent immune plasma." Meanwhile, none of the 12 infected people had a history of vaccination with Candid #1, the immunization to prevent the disease that is "free and mandatory for all residents of the endemic area" of Buenos Aires.

It is worth recalling that in mid-April [2022], a 42-year-old woman died as a result of the disease. Health noted in the bulletin that she "had as an epidemiological history having participated in a social event in a rural area of the Ramallo district."

FHM, popularly known as "mal de los ratrojos"[stubble disease], is a serious disease endemic to Argentina and caused by Junín virus. Its transmitter is the corn mouse [more correctly the drylands vesper mouse - Mod.TY], (_Calomys musculinus_), and its fatality rate can reach 30% without treatment, although the administration of immune plasma in the 1st week of onset of symptoms reduces it to 1%.

Prevention

The Ministry of Health urges the local health teams in the FHA endemic areas (with the presence of the _C. musculinus_ reservoir) "to strengthen the surveillance, follow-up, and final classification of suspected FHA cases" in order to "have access to quality information about the epidemiological situation of the disease" in order to make decisions.

"The Candid #1 vaccine is part of the National Vaccination Calendar, being free and mandatory for all residents of the endemic area of the province of Buenos Aires," the agency noted in its bulletin.

And he added: "The scheme consists of a dose at 15 years of age or older, in the event that they reside or work in said area. This indication is independent of the work activities that are carried out and is not considered exclusively for rural workers."

[Argentine hemorrhagic fever is caused by infection with Junin virus, an arenavirus. Cases of Argentine hemorrhagic fever occur sporadically in Buenos Aires and other provinces. As the above report notes, there is a vaccine to prevent this virus disease. Although more common in rural agricultural areas, there is a risk of infection in any area where the rodent hosts of Junin virus are found.

The hosts of Junin virus are rodents, particularly _Mus musculus_, _Calomys spp_., and _Akodon azarae_. The animals have a chronic, asymptomatic infection and shed virus through saliva, urine, and blood. Human infections occur through contact with skin, mucosa, and inhalation of aerosolized particles carrying the virus.

According to the GIDEON database, most cases of this vaccine-preventable disease occur in Cordoba, Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe provinces, and the peak year was 1964 with over 3000 cases, with 120 cases in each of 1993 and 1994. Prevention of human cases is the same as for hantaviruses: avoidance of activities that result in contact with aerosols in areas where the rodent hosts are present.
