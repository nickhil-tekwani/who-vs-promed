National lab finds an extra 120 people may have had SARS
--------------------------------------------------------
TORONTO (CP) - As many as 120 people not on the list of Canada's probable
or suspect SARS cases may actually have had the disease, testing done by
Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory has shown.
Experts say it's crucial to find those individuals and figure out whether
they actually had SARS and whether they have spread it to others. "It's a
worry. It's an important thing to try to figure out why, (and) what this
means," said scientific director Dr Frank Plummer.
The Winnipeg lab, in conjunction with Ontario officials and public health
authorities in the locations where the individuals live, is beginning a
study to track down the people, their doctors, and their contacts to ensure
that other SARS cases aren't simmering, undetected, in Toronto and other
southern Ontario communities.
"Look what happened at North York," said leading SARS expert Dr Donald Low,
referring to North York General Hospital, the epicentre of Toronto's second
SARS outbreak. "There was a cluster in a family that wasn't recognized.
Maybe there's a cluster in Belleville that we just haven't recognized."
Even if further study shows that no new clusters are simmering, the
findings suggest Ontario must have dodged a few SARS bullets, the experts
admit.
Canada has officially recorded 245 probable and 193 suspect cases of SARS
since the disease hit these shores in late February, the vast majority in
the Toronto area. One of the puzzling positive test results that Plummer's
lab has turned up was for a woman from Belleville, which is why Low
referred to that city, about 2 hours drive east of Toronto. Another was for
a man from the Grey Bruce area, north of Toronto, who had been listed as a
suspect SARS case in March. The man, who had been believed to have
contracted SARS in Singapore, was eventually struck from the list when it
was found he had influenza B, which could have caused his symptoms. But
Plummer's lab recently informed his local medical officer of health that
the man probably had SARS as well.
That case and another like it at North York General suggest it may be time
to again rewrite the definitions of probable and suspect SARS, Low said. A
psychiatric patient at North York who appeared to have SARS in April but
who was not known to have been in contact with a SARS case was eventually
ruled out when lab tests showed he had mycoplasma, a pathogen that causes
pneumonia. Weeks later blood tests revealed the man also had SARS.
The current definitions allow authorities to rule out a case if another
reasonable diagnosis is discovered. The North York and Grey Bruce cases
suggest that that's no longer an option, Low said, noting that 10 to 15 per
cent of community acquired pneumonias are caused by more than one agent.
"It's naive to think to think that people only have infection with one
organism. It's naive to think that because somebody has influenza B that
they couldn't have SARS," he said. Since the SARS outbreak began, the
Winnipeg lab has been working overtime, processing samples submitted from
about 2100 people so far.
Plummer doesn't have enough information on each individual case to
determine whether these 120 people are false positives, people who were
infected but whose symptoms were so mild they didn't meet case definitions
or actual SARS cases who somehow slipped through public health's nets. He
doesn't even know if they all would have been quarantined, though some,
like the Grey Bruce man, definitely were. Dr Andrew Simor, chief
microbiologist at Toronto's Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences
Centre, said testing done by their lab corroborates the Winnipeg lab's
findings. "Of course of most importance is are these people who are
potentially infectious? And to this point in time, I'm not aware that any
of these people ... have actually been responsible for transmission of
disease. And ultimately that's what's most important."
But public health officials cannot afford to assume that just because they
haven't identified that kind of below-the-radar transmission doesn't mean
it hasn't happened.

[Many details are unavailable from this newswire report: the methodology of
testing (presumably serology, IgM, IgG?, threshold for positivity), the
denominator (that is, the total number of tests done of which 120 were
positive), the population from which they were drawn (community-acquired
atypical pneumonia cases?), any contact or clinical data, and so forth.
While the law of parsimony is often cited in clinical medicine, it is true
that it is very possible to have multiple simultaneous infections -- indeed
some respiratory infections predispose to others. It is also likely that a
proportion of these are false positive tests and that some represent true
infection. ProMED-mail awaits further details. - Mod.LM]
