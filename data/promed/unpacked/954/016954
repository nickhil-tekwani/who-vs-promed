US mask, COVID-19 vaccine mandates in question
----------------------------------------------
Some states, cities, and national public health officials are posing the possibility of reinstating mask mandates as COVID-19 cases continue to surge across the United States. And businesses and organizations are struggling with the question of vaccine mandates as the delta (B1617.2) variant shows no sign of slowing down.

Yesterday [Sun 25 Jul 2021]on CNN, Anthony Fauci, MD, White House chief medical adviser, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discussed the use of masks for even vaccinated individuals when indoors.

"We're seeing that in LA. We're seeing that in Chicago. We're seeing that in New Orleans," Fauci said on CNN. "The officials there, many of them are saying even if you are vaccinated, it's prudent to wear a mask indoors."

Fauci, echoing CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, last week said the current surge is a "pandemic of the unvaccinated." Almost all COVID-19 deaths are in unvaccinated people, and the United States has yet to make significant strides toward the [4 Jul 2021] goal of vaccinating 70% of adults with at least one dose. The daily number of new vaccine recipients is now what it was in late January [2021].
According to the CDC, only 20 states have vaccinated at least 50% of their population. The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 394 948 975 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 341 818 968 have been administered, with 49.1% of Americans fully vaccinated (56.8% have received at least one dose).

The United States reported 14 637 new COVID-19 cases yesterday, according to the New York Times COVID-19 tracker. The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 51 939, with 269 daily deaths. There are 30 475 hospitalized COVID patients.

New hot spots across the nation
-------------------------------
Across the country, local leaders are grappling with new COVID-19 activity. On Cape Cod, Provincetown officials issued an indoor mask mandate after a cluster triggered by 4th of July visitors now tops 551 infections in people from multiple states.

Health officials in St. Louis announced [Fri 23 Jul 2021] that they will reinstate a mask mandate for vaccinated and unvaccinated residents alike, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Beginning today [Mon 26 Jul 2021], masks will be required on public transport and indoor public places for all people 5 and older. [https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/coronavirus/st-louis-st-louis-county-to-reinstate-mask-mandate-some-of-first-in-us/article_b7730c4d-3ee9-5970-8e81-cd704bb67dfa.html]

Hospitalizations for COVID-19 have tripled within St. Louis in the last 6 weeks.

Arizona is also experiencing a new surge in activity, as yesterday [Sun 25 Jul 2021] marked the 7th consecutive day of 1000 or more new cases. Yesterday, Arizona reported 1508 new COVID-19 cases, the Associated Press reports. [https://apnews.com/article/health-arizona-coronavirus-pandemic-6317dbd8e9d10d78aa852ea11308ea0a]

Florida is reporting more new COVID-19 cases than any other state, and the number of people hospitalized in some parts of the state is rising at a faster rate than in previous waves, according to the Wall Street Journal. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/florida-leads-u-s-in-covid-19-cases-as-hospitalizations-surge-11627131600]

Model predicts Delta surge to peak in October [2021]
----------------------------------------------------
A new model suggests that the current surge of activity will continue to gain momentum and peak in October, with around 60 000 cases and 850 deaths each day.

The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, which uses 10 possible models to make predictions, assumes the variant is 60% more transmissible and that only 70% of the US population will be vaccinated. [https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/viz.html]

Amid the dire predictions, the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and 55 other medical groups have written a joint statement calling for mandatory vaccination of all US healthcare personnel against the coronavirus, the Washington Post reports. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/26/mandatory-vaccinations-urged-health-workers/]

"Unfortunately, many healthcare and long-term care personnel remain unvaccinated. As we move towards full [Food and Drug Administration] approval of the currently available vaccines, all health care workers should get vaccinated for their own health, and to protect their colleagues, families, residents of long-term care facilities and patients," the statement reads. "This is why many health care and long-term care organizations already require vaccinations for influenza, hepatitis B, and pertussis."

And the New York Times broke the story today that the Department of Veterans Affairs will require 115 000 frontline healthcare workers to be vaccinated against the virus. This is the first federal agency to require COVID-19 vaccination.

Though vaccine mandates could be enacted by the federal government for the military, the Biden administration has yet to do so. Full authorization from the FDA will make it easier for businesses and organizations to require vaccinations.

[2] Veteran's Affairs: vaccine mandate
Date: Mon 26 Jul 2021
Source: Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/n28zfks7


The Department of Veterans Affairs on [Mon 27 Jul 2021] became the first federal agency to mandate that front-line workers, including physicians, dentists, podiatrists, and registered nurses, must be vaccinated against the coronavirus.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough said in a statement that the safety of veterans had driven the decision as new infections, driven by the infectious delta variant, surge around the country.

"Since the pandemic began, we have tragically lost tens of thousands of Veterans to this deadly disease," said VA spokesperson Randal Noller. "This action is aimed at ensuring that we are doing everything we can to protect our veterans and the system that serves them.

The directive, which gives employees 8 weeks to comply, is in line with vaccination requirements that other health care systems and hospitals have implemented, Noller added, citing the joint statement released [Mon 27 Jul 2021] from nearly 60 medical groups, calling for all health workers to be vaccinated against coronavirus.

The statement -- issued by many groups urging a mandate for the first time -- represents an increasingly tough stance by the medical and public health establishment amid the sluggish pace of national vaccinations. It comes as new cases rip through the nation, driven by the hyper-transmissible delta variant. Confirmed coronavirus infections have nearly quadrupled in July [2021], from about 13 000 cases per day at the start of the month to more than 50 000 now, according to The Post's tracking. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus_sn_coronavirus-us-cases-deaths_1&itid=lk_inline_manual_10]. Hospital leaders in states such as Alabama, Florida and Missouri have implored holdouts to get vaccinated, citing data that the shots prevent hospitalizations and even death.

"We call for all health care and long-term care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19," the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and 55 other groups wrote in a joint statement shared with The Washington Post. "The health and safety of U.S. workers, families, communities and the nation depends on it." [https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/medical-groups-issue-joint-statement-on-need-for-mandatory-vaccines-for-health-workers/c91401fb-9d64-44fa-b863-624771ff7551/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12]

But many workers in the health field remain unvaccinated, despite having priority access to coronavirus vaccines, which first became available in December [2020]. More than 38% of nursing home staff were not fully vaccinated as of [11 Jul 2021], despite caring for patients at elevated risk of the coronavirus, according to data collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and analyzed by LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit nursing homes and other providers of elder care.

An analysis by WebMD and Medscape Medical News estimated that 25% of hospital workers who had contact with patients had not been vaccinated by the end of May [2021]. [https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210628/huge-number-of-hospital-workers]

Health leaders said that the slowed pace of vaccinations, coupled with the threat of the delta variant, compelled them to act.

"We feel that it's important to sign our name onto this," said Rachel Villanueva, an OB/GYN and the president of the National Medical Association, which represents more than 50 000 Black physicians and is calling for a vaccination mandate for the first time.

Villanueva added that new coronavirus cases could disproportionately affect front-line workers -- many of whom are African American -- and communities of color that continue to lag behind Whites on vaccination rates. "We want to continue to dispel myths, educate, increase confidence and increase vaccination rates in our communities," she said.

Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who organized [Mon 26 Jul 2021]'s statement, said he thinks that requiring vaccinations could boost uptake of the shots, beginning with health workers.

"Despite everything -- cajoling, making access readily available at any pharmacy, making it free, having the president plead -- all of this hasn't really moved the needle very much in the nation," said Emanuel, who spent 2 weeks organizing the joint statement and praised the buy-in from so many groups.

"One of the things that resonated with people is, 'Look, we're the medical community. This is a health problem. We need to lead -- and we need to have the courage of our convictions,'" Emanuel added.

About 60% of all U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, with the rate of new immunizations slowing since mid-April, according to The Post's tracking.

Health-care facilities generally have hesitated to mandate coronavirus vaccines for employees, noting that the vaccines have not yet received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration and citing the threat of lawsuits. Fewer than 9% of hospitals have required their workers to get vaccinated, according to tracking by the American Hospital Association, which announced separately last week that it supported such mandates.

Emanuel cited the example of Houston Methodist, which has said it was the nation's first health system to impose a coronavirus vaccination mandate. Some staff members opposed the rule -- including more than 150 who refused to get vaccinated and left the organization. But 97% of Houston Methodist workers complied, with about 2% obtaining exemptions or deferrals. A federal judge also dismissed a lawsuit filed by former staff members who refused to get vaccinated, ruling that Houston Methodist was "trying to do their business of saving lives without giving [patients] the COVID-19 virus."

Emanuel said that the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which imposed its own COVID-19 vaccination mandate 2 months ago, also has seen a similar uptake in shots.

"The sky didn't fall," Emanuel said. "When we do it, and we have a good justification, people respond."

Hundreds of colleges and universities also have imposed vaccination mandates, which are expected to move forward after a federal judge last week upheld Indiana University's mandate. The White House has said it will not impose mandates but supports private employers doing so.

"We certainly support these actions by these hospital associations," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mon, adding that she may have "more to say" about whether federal health care providers will adopt similar requirements.

[4] mRNA vaccine 2nd dose
Date: Mon 26 Jul 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/no-anaphylaxis-after-second-dose-mrna-covid-vaccine-study-finds


No anaphylaxis after 2nd dose of mRNA COVID vaccine, study finds
-------------------------------------------------------------------
People who had a severe allergic reaction to their first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine had no issues after their 2nd dose, according to a retrospective multicenter US study today [Mon 26 Jul 2021] in JAMA Internal Medicine.

Allergic reactions are estimated to occur in up to 2% of people after their first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, with anaphylaxis reported in as many as 2.5 per 10 000 vaccinees. Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially deadly systemic allergic reaction.

From [1 Jan to 31 Mar 2021], a team led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) analyzed data from 189 people who had sought care for allergic reactions within 4 hours after their first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID-19.

20% have mild reactions to 2nd dose
-----------------------------------
The most common first-dose allergic reactions were flushing or redness (28%), dizziness (26%), tingling (24%), throat tightness (22%), hives (21%), and shortness of breath or wheezing (21%). A total of 32 patients (17%) experienced anaphylaxis. Of the patients with first-dose reactions, 130 (69%) were to the Moderna vaccine, and 59 (31%) were to Pfizer.

Of the 189 total patients, 159 (84%) received a 2nd dose of mRNA vaccine, 30% of whom were given antihistamines before their shot. All 159 patients, including 19 who had experienced anaphylaxis after the first dose, tolerated the 2nd dose without severe complications. Immediate, potentially allergic reactions that occurred in 32 (20%) of patients resolved on their own or with antihistamine treatment. Median patient age was 43 years, and 86% were women.

The authors said that the results demonstrate that a 2nd dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is safe for those who had an allergic reaction to the first dose. "Although mild symptoms were reported in 20% of patients with 2nd dose administration, all patients who received a 2nd dose safely completed their vaccination series and could use mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the future when indicated," they wrote.

May not be classic allergic reactions
-------------------------------------
Earlier this year [2021], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that people who had an allergic reaction to a first dose of an mRNA vaccine should not get a 2nd, recommending that they instead could follow up with the Johnson & Johnson single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. However, the study authors said their results suggest this "largely unstudied" strategy might not be needed.

In fact, the researchers pointed out that the immediate 2nd-dose mRNA vaccine reactions might not be classic allergic reactions at all because re-exposure to the same substance in classic allergy situations causes the same or worse symptoms.

"Second dose tolerance following reactions to the 1st dose argues that either many of these initial reactions are not all truly allergic reactions, or supports an allergic, but non-immunoglobulin E-mediated mechanism in which symptoms can typically be abated with premedications," the researchers wrote.

Co-senior author Aleena Banerji, MD, of MGH said in a hospital news release that it is important for people with a 1st-dose allergic reaction to complete the vaccine series, if possible. "After first dose reactions, allergy specialists may be useful to help guide risk/benefit assessments and assist with completion of safe vaccination," she said.
