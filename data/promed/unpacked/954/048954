The Connecticut Department of Agriculture has initiated a shellfish closure and voluntary recall of oysters and clams harvested from the waters of Norwalk and Westport and is advising consumers to discard shellfish harvested from the affected areas. "We are advising the public not to consume shellfish obtained from the closed recreational and commercial areas, and to discard recalled shellfish to reduce the risk of contaminating other food and food contact surfaces," Agriculture Commissioner Steven K. Reviczky said. "I want to emphasize the importance of heeding this advice. If there is any doubt, throw it out, regardless of how much you love shellfish. It's just not worth risking the health of you or your loved ones."

These areas are now closed to harvest until further notice. Raw or undercooked shellfish have been implicated as the source of a number of illnesses related to the naturally occurring bacterium _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. Oysters, mussels, hard clams, littleneck clams, chowder clams, quahogs and soft-shell/steamer clams from the affected areas are harvested commercially and recreationally. A commercial recall is underway.

Consumers who have purchased hard clams or oysters and are concerned should speak with the retail establishment regarding the harvest location of the shellfish. Restaurants and retail establishments that believe they have this product should contact the local health department for further instruction.

This recall does not include all shellfish commercially harvested from the waters of Norwalk and Westport, but rather affects only specific harvest locations. Shellfish affected by this recall include hard clams and oysters harvested between 3 Jul 2013 and 2 Aug 2013. The following harvest locations are included in the recall:

CT 79 Westport, CT 123 Westport, CT 207 Westport, CT 173 Westport, CT 109 Norwalk, CT 20 Westport, CT 21 Norwalk, CT 109 Norwalk, CT 253 Norwalk, CT 268 Westport, CT 254 Westport, CT 599 Westport, CT 255 Norwalk, CT 270 Norwalk, CT 595C Westport, CT 595D Westport, CT 105 Westport, CT 207 Westport, CT 67 Westport, CT 171 Westport, CT 71 Westport, CT 73 Norwalk.

All of the above location information may not be present on each shellfish tag, and the information may be in a different order. For example, CT 79 Westport may read "Westport Lot 79, CT," "L-79 Westport," or simply "L-79" with no town designation.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _E. coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as Connecticut can also be associated with oyster-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

In 2005, a New England Journal of Medicine report highlighted this infection linked to even Alaskan oysters:
