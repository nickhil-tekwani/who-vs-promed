A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) said today [4 Mar 2011] that a goose carcass found
in Lantau was confirmed to be H5N1 positive after laboratory testing.

The goose carcass was found and collected at a beach near Sham Shek
Tsuen, Lantau on 1 Mar 2011. It was highly decomposed when found and
required a series of tests before H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed
today [4 Mar 2011].

The spokesman said there were no poultry farms within 3 km of where
the dead goose was found. AFCD staff have conducted inspections and
found no evidence of any backyard poultry being kept there. The AFCD
will continue to monitor the situation and conduct inspections of the
area.

A ban on backyard poultry has been in force since 2006. Unauthorised
keeping of 5 kinds of poultry -- chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons or
quail -- is an offence with a maximum fine of HKD 50 000 [USD 6400].
Repeat offenders are subject to a maximum fine of HKD 100 000 [USD 12
840].

All relevant government departments will continue to remain highly
vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian
influenza.

The AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen
precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza.
Letters have also been issued to farmers, pet bird shop owners,
licence holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that
proper precautions must be taken.

The spokesman said the department would conduct frequent inspections
of poultry farms and the wholesale market to ensure that proper
precautions against avian influenza have been implemented. The
department will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.

"People should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live
poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly
after coming into contact with them. The public can call the Call
Centre on 1823 for follow up if they come across suspicious sick or
dead birds, including the carcasses of wild birds and poultry," the
spokesman said.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to
be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls.
It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.

The Department of Health will keep up with its health education to
remind the public to maintain strict personal and environmental
hygiene to prevent avian influenza.

AFCD, FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department and the Police will
strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong
to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks caused by imported
poultry and birds that have not gone through inspection and
quarantine.

Health advice is available from the "H5N1 Health Advice" on the AFCD
website at <http://www.afcd.gov.hk>.

[The above event is reminiscent of the previous H5N1 case in Hong
Kong, namely the detection of a duck carcass at a beach in Tai O on 3
Feb 2011; the carcass was similarly highly decomposed when found and
required a series of tests before H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed.

Hong Kong was the site of the very 1st case of human infection with
HPAI H5N1, in August 1997. Since then, the HK government has been
applying the following exemplary measures to reduce the risk of
infection spreading from poultry to humans:

(a) vaccination of chickens in local farms and imported chickens;
(b) regulation of local farms including tightened biosecurity
measures (for example, all farms should be (wild) bird-proof);
(c) import control (for instance, imported chickens must come from
registered farms with health certificates);
(d) segregation policy (no waterfowl, which are natural carriers of
avian influenza viruses, can be sold in retail outlets);
(e) market rest days to break the virus cycle and reduce the viral
load;
(f) hygiene requirements on wholesale market and retail outlets; and
(g) surveillance targeted at humans, poultry and wild birds to ensure
timely detection of the presence of any avian influenza viruses in our
environment.

The said measures and additional background information are described
in the document "Hong Kong's preparedness for influenza pandemic --
Prevention and Protection," which is included, with additional updated
information, in Hong-Kong's website "Prevention of Avian Influenza,"
available at <http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm>. This
useful web-site covers continuously also the H5N1 situation worldwide,
including 2 tables under the title "Global statistics of avian
influenza," (which has been last updated on 3 Mar 2011). - Mod.AS]
