Malaysian state fights deadly cow disease
-----------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian workers are racing to vaccinate 17 000 cows and
buffalo against an infectious disease that has killed 47 animals in the
northeast of the country.

Officials have declared an epidemic of hemorrhagic septicemia in one
district of Kelantan state bordering Thailand. The state's director of
veterinary services, Idris Kadir, hopes vaccinations will prevent the
disease from spreading.

The bacterial disease, which can be spread by direct contact and
contaminated food or water, is one of the most serious to hit cows and
buffalo in southeast Asia and can kill infected beasts within 6 hours.

Symptoms include high fever, bleeding eyes, running nose, swollen joints
and diarrhea.

Humans are not affected. [Actually, wound infections of humans are not
uncommon, and may progress to cellulitis and/or osteomyelitis. The bites
of small animals are a common means of human exposure. - Mod.ES

Kelantan has banned movement of the animals in and out of the district,
Rantau Panjang.

Farmers say their losses total 150 000 ringgit (39 480 US dollars).

In 2000, the northeast state vaccinated 16 800 cattle after the disease
surfaced there and in neighboring Terengganu.

In March, Terengganu said it was vaccinating 90 000 cattle after the
disease killed 240 animals there.

[Hemorrhagic septicemia is an acute pasteurellosis, caused by particular
serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_ and manifest by an acute and highly
fatal septicemia, generally in cattle and water buffalo. Water buffalo are
thought to be more susceptible than cattle, and the disease occurs
infrequently in swine and is even more rarely in sheep and goats. However,
it has been reported in bison, camels, elephants, horses and donkeys, and
there is evidence it occurs in the yak.
Infection usually occurs by direct or indirect contact. The source of
infective bacteria is thought to be the nasopharynx of bovine or buffalo
carriers. As many as 5 percent of these animals may be carriers in
endemic areas.

In susceptible animals, a septicemia develops rapidly, and death due to
endotoxemia ensues within 8-24 hours after the first signs.
The mortality rate is high when the agent is introduced to non endemic
regions. Losses vary widely in endemic areas. The heaviest losses occur
during the monsoon rains in southeast Asia, and it is thought the
organism survives for hours, probably days in moist soil and water.
Because the course of the disease is so short, clinical signs may be
overlooked. The first evidence is dullness, a reluctance to move, fever,
salivation and serous nasal discharge. Edematous swelling is frequently
seen, beginning in the throat region and spreading to the parotid region,
neck and brisket. Mucous membranes are congested and there is respiratory
distress. The animal usually goes down. Recovery is rare and there is no
chronic form.
Characteristic epidemiologic and clinical features aid in the recognition
of this disease. Sporadic cases may be difficult to diagnose clinically,
particularly in endemic areas. Differentials include anthrax, acute
salmonellosis, pneumonic pasteurellosis and rinderpest.
Presumptive diagnosis is based on the isolation of _P. multocida_ from
the blood and vital organs. The causative agent may be overgrown and
obscured by extraneous bacteria if there is postmortem decomposition.
The principle means of prevention is by vaccination. Three kinds include
the plain bacterin, alum-type precipitated bacterin, and oil-adjuvant
bacterin. The most effective is the oil-adjuvant, providing 9-12 months
of protection for one injection.
Because the course of the disease is so rapid treatment is difficult.
However various sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and penicillin are effective
when administered early. - Mod.TG
