Influenza in long term care facilities
------------------------------------------------
The recent posting on alleged influenza vaccine "failures" underscores
several public health points.
First, as current inactivated vaccines are of poor to moderate efficacy, we
have no standardized process for determining whether a vaccine has "failed"
in a population sense. All influenza vaccines fail frequently to protect
many individuals, but in the case of influenza A this does not necessarily
imply viral antigenic drift. The problem may not be only inadequate
vaccines, but inadequate prevention knowledge (see below).
Secondly, vaccine efficacy as determined in healthy middle-aged adults may
bear little relationship to that in the very elderly, e.g., those over age
80, and especially those in long term care facilities. Although there are
too few data on the subject, it seems that the long endorsed (by ACIP and
other agencies) cut-off point of 65 years old for a definition of "elderly"
includes "young elderly" at lower risk of both vaccine failure and
influenza severity, and "older elderly" at much higher risk for both vaccine
failure and severe disease. With regards to influenza risks, there may be a
big difference between the two groups, but this has not been adequately
looked at by researchers or policy makers.
Recently a colleague and I reviewed all publications reporting influenza A
or B outbreaks in nursing homes (unpublished). Recognizing the potential
for publication biases, and the obvious limitation of "numerator data", it
was nonetheless notable how poorly efficacious influenza vaccines were in
the institutionalized elderly, especially in the "very old". Vaccine
efficacy rates, calculated independently by us from the data provided by
over 50 studies spanning more than 30 years, approached zero, and within the
same H and N type of influenza A efficacy rates were poorly correlated with
the match/mismatch between the vaccine and epidemic viruses. On the plus
side, there appeared to be some vaccine-associated reduction in mortality
even when influenza infection was not prevented, but this benefit was far
from complete. Our review led us to agree with Langmuir, who stated 30-40
years ago that influenza vaccines are just not good enough to form the basis
of modern public health prevention policy. This is especially true when one
considers that the most important risk group for prevention -- the ill
elderly -- is the group least protected. Modern vaccines need to be brought
on line, e.g. cold-adapted live virus vaccines.
Third, although Dr. Griffin comments that only 35% of the Mt. View staff had
been vaccinated, very high attack rates may typically be seen in nursing
homes even when staff are well vaccinated. In our investigation of a
nursing home outbreak (Morens & Rash, Infect Control Hosp
Epidemiol1995;16:275-280) we suspected that nurses transmitted virus between
bedridden patients via hands or fomites. There was no evidence of aerosol
transmission. Inoculation route and dose may play a role in influenza
acquisition in this setting.
As we argued at the time, there is urgent need for basic epidemiologic data
on influenza in institutionalized persons. We should remember that
influenza is the number one cause of infectious disease mortality in the US,
as measured by "P & I" YPLL [years of productive life lost due to pneumonia
& influenza and that this important target population provides a litmus
test for our prevention capacity.
Finally, I suspect that the recent reports to ProMED-mail are in no way
atypical of what has been occurring each influenza season for many years.
This is an important public health problem that has been repeatedly ignored.
