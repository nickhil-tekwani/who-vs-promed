[1] Canada: rabies bait drop

The province is continuing its bait drop program to prevent outbreaks of raccoon and fox strain rabies.

The program began in 2015 and will [continue] this year until mid-September [2022].

Staff will hand out rabies baits in urban areas of several regions, including Niagara, Hamilton, Norfolk, Haldimand, and Brant.

Officials say there will be a focus on raccoon and skunk habitat, such as bushes, green spaces, and ravines where animals may forage.

In more rural areas, aircraft will be used to drop baits.

Since 2015, over 7.5 million vaccine baits have been dropped, and over 25 000 wildlife samples have been tested.

[2] Nevada (Douglas and Clark counties): bat, human exposure

A Douglas County resident picked up a bat and was bitten, prompting a rabies warning from the Nevada Department of Agriculture Animal Disease Laboratory.

The state confirmed 2 cases of rabies, one in Douglas and another in Clark County. [It is unclear if both cases were associated with human beings being bitten, as was the case in Douglas County. - Mod.TG]

"Bats are common throughout Nevada, with their activity increasing between May and October," state agriculture officials said.

The Animal Disease Laboratory confirms 10-20 cases of bat rabies each year. While other species of wildlife can carry rabies, bats are the most common source of human and domestic animal transmission, making it important to keep pets vaccinated and ensure no contact is made with wildlife.

"Animals carrying rabies can only be confirmed through laboratory testing," said State Veterinarian Dr. Amy Mitchell. "It is important for all animal owners to be proactive and work with their veterinarians to keep animals up to date on vaccinations, to protect both the animals and their owners. Even if animals are indoor-only pets, they should still be vaccinated as it's possible for bats to enter and exit residences unnoticed."

In the state of Nevada, a current rabies vaccination is legally required for dogs, cats, and ferrets, and are also available for certain species of livestock. Animal owners are urged to work with their veterinary healthcare provider to maintain a regular vaccination schedule for their animals.

"If you or your animals have had contact with any bats, contact your local healthcare professional or veterinary provider immediately," said Animal Disease Lab supervisor Laura Morrow.

Any bats, dead or alive, that may have been in contact with people or domestic animals should be reported immediately. It is important individuals contact the NDA Animal Disease Lab or their local animal control agency before attempting to pick up a bat. If an individual is asked to collect the bat for testing, they should carefully follow all instructions provided by the NDA or animal control agency including wearing heavy gloves to avoid potential bites.

Individuals can learn more about rabies and the proper steps to take in the case of a possible exposure on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website at <cdc.gov/rabies>, or through the Southern Nevada Health District or Washoe County Health Department.

[3] South Carolina: bats, cats, dog, human exposure

Two people, one pet, and a feral cat colony were confirmed to have been exposed to rabies this week.

The Department of Health and Environmental Control said Friday [24 Jun 2022] that 2 different exposures to rabies in the Charleston area were confirmed on 23 Jun [2022].

A gray feral cat, which is part of a larger colony near Apple and Hickman streets in North Charleston, tested positive for rabies. One person was exposed, and an unknown number of cats in the colony have potentially been exposed. An investigation is ongoing, DHEC said.

Around the same time, a bat found near Rifle Range Road and Scotts Creek Circle in Mount Pleasant also tested positive for rabies. Another person and a dog were exposed. The people were referred to healthcare providers, and the dog is being quarantined.

DHEC has recorded 34 cases of rabid animals statewide so far this year [2022]. The bat and cat were the 1st 2 animals in Charleston County to test positive for rabies this year [2022].

South Carolina averages almost 150 cases of rabies each year.

Stray and feral cats are a "significant source" of rabies exposures, DHEC said. In addition, they said to never release a bat that has potentially exposed a person or pet to rabies.

If you believe there has been a possible rabies exposure, you are asked to call DHEC.

A rabid raccoon attacked 2 women early Thursday [23 Jun 2022] in Ocean City.

The raccoon, which tested positive for rabies, attacked the women in the area of 141st Street. Officials said the raccoon attacks happened within hours of each other.

Health department officials say that any person, pet, or other animal that may have had contact with this raccoon could be at risk for rabies exposure.

To report any contact with or exposure to the raccoon, call the Worcester County Health Department immediately. If you call after hours or on the weekend, call Worcester County Emergency Services to reach the health department on-call staff.

[5] New York (Oneida County): raccoon, dog, human exposure

The Oneida County Health Department says a raccoon in Stittville has tested positive for rabies.

The raccoon was sent to the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth Center for testing on 23 Jun [2022], and positive results were reported on 24 Jun [2022].

According to health department officials, one person was exposed to the raccoon and received post-exposure treatment.

A dog was also exposed to the raccoon and received a rabies booster shot, according to the department.

Department officials are urging residents to look out for signs of rabies in animals, including strange behavior, shyness, or willingness to get unusually close, and drooling or foaming at the mouth.

If an animal is displaying this behavior, department officials say your local animal control should be contacted for help.

Under NYS Public Health laws, all dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated by 4 months old with updated booster doses in the years following.

[Bait drops are a wonderful way to start building a wall of prevention between wildlife and humans and domestic animals. It is also a lifesaving situation for some of the wildlife.

Vaccination of your pets is another way to help build a barrier between you and the rabies virus. It is also a measure to protect yourself and your beloved pets.

Pets are part of our lives, just as encountering difficulties can be. But how much nicer to know the pet companion can be protected from the deadly virus of rabies.

If humans are bitten, please seek medical attention for the wound, and if a wild or domestic animal is involved, report it to animal control. Medical attention involves cleaning the wound and starting the affected human being on post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the rabies virus.

Keeping your pet up to date on the rabies prevention vaccination is very important. If your pet is bitten by a suspect rabid animal, the wound should be cleaned and sutured if needed, and the pet will be re-vaccinated against rabies. If your pet is not vaccinated, it may be euthanized if the animal having bitten it is confirmed with rabies.

Watch your surroundings, being alert for wild animals or animals acting unusual. Wild animals may be more friendly or act droopy. Often animals with rabies may be observed to be salivating and seemingly vicious. Animals with rabies may be found in cities and towns as well as in city parks or roaming the neighborhood. - Mod.TG]
