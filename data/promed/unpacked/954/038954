IDF Recruits Battle Mysterious Illness
-------------------------------------------
The condition of 4 army recruits suffering from pneumonia has
improved Saturday [31 Dec 2005], after they were hospitalized at
Beersheba's Soroka Medical Center. "They have been transferred from
an intensive care unit to the internal medicine wing," said an Israel
Defense Force (IDF) spokesman. However, an additional female soldier
is still listed in critical but stable condition.
On Thursday [29 Dec 2005] evening, some 500 IDF Engineering Corps
recruits at Tzukei Uvda, in the Negev, were sent home, after 14 of
them came down with a bacterial [?] infection. According to the army,
the soldiers complained of fever and breathing problems. Most of the
sick were treated by doctors and sent home, but 5 of the most serious
cases were airlifted from Eilat's Yoseftal Hospital to Soroka Friday
[30 Dec 2005] afternoon. Army medics who accompanied the sick from
Eilat wore face-masks in order to prevent infection. The reason for
the pneumonia outbreak is still unclear.
"The IDF Medical Corps has opened an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the development of the disease," said the
army spokesman. MK (National Union) Arieh Eldad, a former IDF chief
medical officer, said that outbreaks like this "happen from time to
time," especially on large bases in the winter. However, Eldad said
that efforts should be made to rule out _Legionella_ bacteria, which
led to 29 deaths at an American Legion conference in 1976.

Another Soldier in Serious Condition at Hadassah
-----------------------------------------------
A soldier was rushed, in very serious condition with pneumonia, to
Hadassah University Medical Center in Ein Kerem on Sunday [1 Jan
2006]. The hospital said he was attached to a ventilator and sedated
in the respiratory intensive care unit. A woman soldier -- who also
was part of a group of soldiers who contracted pneumonia at the
Tzukei Uvda base in the south -- is in serious condition at Soroka
University Medical Center in Beersheba. She was previously in
critical condition, but she has been stabilized.
On Sunday [1 Jan 2006], about 500 new draftees were released from
their base in the south, after 13 of their comrades were diagnosed
with pneumonia. 3 others are hospitalized in Eilat, but they are out
of danger.
The Israel Defense Forces' Medical Corps is investigating the
incident. The Health Ministry said it is not involved, as the
infection was an internal military matter. The draftees had been
vaccinated against influenza. The IDF (Israel Defense Force) has said
it has not found the source of infection and has not disclosed
whether it is viral or bacterial. The military base's water, food and
ventilation systems were tested, and nothing unusual was found, the
IDF said.

2 Recruits Still in Intensive Care
-------------------------------------
Israel Defense Force (IDF) Radio stated this morning [2 Jan 2006]
that 2 recruits are currently being treated in intensive care units
due to their serious condition: a female, hospitalized in the Soroka
hospital, Beer Sheva since last week [final week December 2005]; and
a male, who was sent home with 500 other recruits over the weekend
and who was hospitalized yesterday [1 Jan 2006] in Hadassah hospital,
Jerusalem complaining of respiratory distress, which soon
deteriorated. Respiratory support and antibiotic treatment are being
given under anesthesia.
Unlike the female patient's condition, the male soldier's condition
has slightly improved, though still serious. The army's medical corps
suspect that additional soldiers have been infected and are still
within their incubation period. They expect some additional cases to
appear.
Though not publicly mentioned [besides MK Harel's remark, see in
preceding news-item], it seems that _Legionella_ is included in the
list of suspect disease agents; reportedly, the authorities have been
investigating water systems and showers in the affected camp.
