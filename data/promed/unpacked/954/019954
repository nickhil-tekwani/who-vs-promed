Indonesia: Ministry of Health reports H5N1 fatality
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (via the Directorate General of Disease Control and Environmental Health) announced a new case of bird flu [avian influenza H5N1 virus infection] has been confirmed by the Center for Biomedical and Healthcare Technology Association, Balitbangkes. The case is a 31-year-old female resident of East Bekasi, West Java Province with symptoms of fever and nausea commencing on 1 Nov 2013. On 3 Nov 2013 the patient attended a private outpatient clinic and was advised to check into a laboratory within 3 days if there was no change in her condition. When there was no improvement by 5 Nov 2013, the patient then went to a private hospital outpatient clinic with laboratory facilities and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. On 6 Nov 2013 the patient went to a different private hospital emergency department complaining of fever, nausea, and vomiting and was treated at that hospital. On 8 Nov 2013 the patient's condition worsened with development of coughing and shortness of breath. On 11 Nov 2013 at around 2:00 in the morning, [the patient died following transfer] to avian influenza referral hospital.

Epidemiological investigations have been conducted in the homes of neighbours of the victim and their environment by the Ministry of Health Integrated Team, West Java Provincial Health Office, Department of Health and Department of Animal Husbandry of Bekasi to identify possible risk factors [which in this case may have been proximity to ornamental bird aviaries]. There were about 50-60 birds in 4 adjacent locations. About 500 metres from the patient's house there is also a general market that the deceased visited.

The cumulative number of [human] cases [of H5N1 influenza] since the 1st appearance of the disease in Indonesia in 2005 is now 195 cases with 163 deaths. The Director General of Disease Control and Environmental Health Yoga Aditama Prof. Dr. Tjandra as the focal point of the International Health Regulations (IHR) has communicated this information to the World Health Organisation.
