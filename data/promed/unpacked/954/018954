Another case of polio was reported in Balochistan on [Sat 3 Aug 2019], taking the total number of cases detected across the country this year [2019] so far to 48.

The victim has been identified as a 5-month-old boy from Qilla Abdullah, according to the health department. His parents hadn't allowed polio teams to administer the vaccine to him.

Four cases have so far been reported in Balochistan, 2 from Qilla Abdullah and one each Quetta and Jaffarabad.

Babar bin Atta, the prime minister's focal person on polio eradication, in a video message on [27 Jun 2019], had urged people to let polio teams administer drops to their children. "The purpose of this video message is that I want to request parents to please not play with their children's future. I urge parents not to give in to false propaganda against the polio vaccine," he said.

He urged parents to realise that the propaganda campaigns were only directed at interrupting Pakistan's polio eradication efforts.

Sometimes a single mistake changes everything, and you regret making it for the rest of your life. The parents whose children have contracted the crippling disease polio in Balochistan this year [2019] also find themselves in this situation. They hid their children -- below the age of 5 or less -- when polio workers knocked on their doors for vaccination.

Under the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme, vaccinators come to the doorsteps of citizens every month just to protect their children from permanent paralysis caused by polio virus. But still there are parents who take this facility for granted and shut the door on the workers by saying their child is not home, sleeping, or already vaccinated.

"When polio teams visited our house, we used to hide our children," said [the] uncle of [a] polio-stricken child. The 8-month-old, who lives in Gandakha tehsil of Jaffarabad district, developed high-grade fever, followed by fits and left lower leg weakness. He was notified by a volunteer and tested positive for polio. "It's our fault that despite the government providing us with the health facility at our doorsteps, we hid our children and not had them vaccinated," said [the uncle]. The previous case in Jaffarabad was reported back in 2014, an example of how the threat of the polio virus is always looming.

Qilla Abdullah -- the district that was at the highest risk for polio -- also notified a case after remaining polio-free for the last 18 months.

A 9-month-old resident of Union Council Girdi Pinki, also belongs to a family that refused to have him vaccinated. "What should I do now to cure my child? How he can be fine again?" asked [the child's] father. However, it is too late now. [This father] skipped the opportunity to have his child vaccinated against the disease. There is no cure after a child is affected by polio, only damage control measures. [This child] is a zero-dose child who was hidden and unregistered. However, in the recent anti-polio drive, [the father], realising his mistake, had his 2 other children vaccinated.

A recent polio victim in Quetta is a child whose family arrived from Qilli Khizan in Shadinzai tehsil of Chiltan Town. The 18-month-old developed fever, and all his limbs have been affected by the disease. "I am repenting now. If I see polio teams anywhere, I'll bring them to my house to have my children vaccinated 1st," said [this child's] father.

All the families whose children are suffering from the disease are regretting their mistake now.

The negative propaganda and false rumours have taken away their happiness. They will never be able see their children like others. They are convinced now that vaccination is necessary, but after paying a heavy cost, a lifetime of disability for their children.

Polio virus is attacking low-immunity children everywhere in Pakistan. In 2018, 12 children in the country were affected by polio. In 2019, 47 [48] cases have been reported so far. Most of these cases are because of the parents' reluctance to allow vaccinators to administer polio drops to their children.

[These media reports are confirmed by information available on the End Polio now, Pakistan website (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces). As mentioned above, the addition of this newly confirmed case brings the total number of cases of WPV1 associated paralysis in Pakistan this year (2019) to 48. If one adds the total number of WPV1 cases reported by Afghanistan this year (12 cases confirmed during 2019), the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) attributable to WPV1 infection since 1 Jan 2019 is now 60, almost twice the total number of cases reported during 2018, 32 cases.
