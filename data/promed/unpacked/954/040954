to capture cases of atypical pneumonia in China that are now recognized as
being cases of SARS.
2. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of Affected Areas.
3. The reporting period from Guangdong Province is from 16 Nov 2002 to 28
Feb 2003.
ยง Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national
level, probable cases are reported by all countries except the United
States of America, which is reporting suspect cases under investigation.

[C] Update 16 - Update on cases and countries 1 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_01/en/>
As of today, a cumulative total of 1804 cases of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and 62 deaths have been reported from 15 countries. This
represents an increase of 182 cases and 4 deaths compared with the previous
day.
The largest increase occurred in Hong Kong, where 155 new cases were
reported. This brings the cumulative total of cases in Hong Kong to 685
cases with 16 deaths.
Of the 4 new SARS deaths, 3 occurred in Hong Kong. The fourth death was
reported in Singapore.
China remains the country with the largest number of cases. According to
official reports, 806 cases with 34 deaths have occurred. The majority of
these cases and deaths were associated with an outbreak in Guangdong
Province. During that outbreak, authorities recorded 792 cases and 31
deaths from 16 Nov 2002 through 28 Feb 2003.
Other countries reporting additional cases include Canada (9), Taiwan,
China (3), Italy (1) Singapore (1), Thailand (1), and the United States of
America (10). Australia and Belgium reported their first probable cases
today.
In Viet Nam, where hospitals in Hanoi were among the earliest to experience
a rapid burst of cases within a health care setting, the number of cases
(58) and deaths (4) remained stable for the eighth day in a row. The
incubation period for SARS is currently believed to range from 2 to 10
days. WHO epidemiologists regard [this] 8-day period with no newly detected
cases as an encouraging sign that the outbreak in Hanoi has been controlled
and that no further spread is occurring beyond the initial hospital foci.
Singapore, another country that was hard hit at the beginning of the
epidemic, is likewise showing a stable pattern, with cases confined to
well-documented risk groups and few new cases being detected.
An evolving epidemic, SARS is a newly identified disease with transmission
patterns that are only beginning to emerge and thus difficult to interpret.
Much about the disease remains poorly understood, despite great progress in
characterization of the causative virus and development of a robust
diagnostic test.
Particularly puzzling are the great differences between areas where
outbreaks appear to have been fairly rapidly contained and confined to
health care settings and persons in close face-to-face contact with
patients, and other areas, such as Hong Kong and Toronto, where
transmission is continuing despite the prompt isolation of patients and
introduction of strict barrier nursing practices.
WHO has established a set of priority issues requiring urgent scientific
investigation. More studies are needed about how the disease is spread, the
stages of the disease when virus is shed, which bodily secretions carry the
virus, and whether certain secretions are more infectious than others.
Researchers also need to understand whether persons infected with SARS
become more infectious at a certain stage in the course of the disease, and
whether factors such as age or underlying disease influence severity and
prognosis.
Some of the world's foremost scientists and clinicians are now
collaborating around the clock, through 3 WHO networks of "virtual" labs
and clinics, to find answers to these questions. Evidence can then form the
basis for more precise public health advice on how to prevent further
spread both internationally and within those countries where cases have
occurred. Based on more than 5 decades of experience, WHO maintains the
position that good surveillance and response will contain any infectious
diseases.

[A] Daily update 1 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As at 1 PM 1 Apr 2003, 5 more patients are recovered. This brought to 84
the total number of patients who have recovered from atypical
pneumonia and have been discharged from public hospitals.
Most of the 601 patients currently in hospital are showing positive
responses to the new treatment protocol. 67 of them are receiving treatment
in an intensive care unit.
Meanwhile, an additional 75 patients with symptoms of atypical pneumonia
were admitted to public hospitals. They include 4 healthcare workers and 52
patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 19 were new patients and contacts
of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A 83-year-old man died in United Christian Hospital, bringing to 16 the
total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia. Most of the deaths
occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic diseases, or were
patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage of infection.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 168 (168)
49 of the patients were discharged
Patients, family members & visitors 517 (517)
35 of the patients were discharged
Total admission 685 (685)
84 were discharged
[B] Residents of Block E moved to holiday villages 1 Apr 2003
Deputy Director of Health, Dr P Y Leung, said residents of Block E at Amoy
Gardens were being moved tonight (1 Apr 2003) into 2 holiday villages in
Sai Kung and Lei Yue Mun.
He said the residents of the block, which has seen a high incidence of
atypical pneumonia, would be kept at Lady MacLehose Holiday Village and Lei
Yue Mun Park Holiday Village until the end of the isolation order.
Dr Leung said health officials were now investigating whether environmental
factors could have contributed to the spread of the disease at Amoy Gardens.
The operation was being jointly carried out by the Department of Health,
the Police and Civil Aid Service. Dr Leung said the residents would be
provided with daily necessities and food during their stay at the holiday
villages. They would also be given regular medical checks. He said Block E
was still under isolation orders and would be under Police protection to
ensure residents' flats were not broken into.

[A] Update 17 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 1 Apr 2003 7:00 PM
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update17.htm
>
More Health Canada Support for Ontario
Health Canada has deployed 6 staff to assist Toronto's public health unit
and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of the SARS
cases. The department has also provided guidelines for infection control
and recommendations on actions for public health settings. Health Canada is
deploying an additional 6 personnel to Ontario this week.
Health Canada's SARS Screening Initiative at Pearson Airport is Being
Rolled-Out Today
--------------
Effective 1 Apr 2003, Health Canada is informing all departing travellers
from Pearson International Airport about SARS through the Health Alert
Notice (cherry cards). The local airport authority has placed the Health
Alert Notices and posters at strategic locations at the Pearson
International Airport informing travellers who meet certain criteria to
defer their flights. These criteria include: having SARS symptoms (fever,
cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing); having been in
contact with a SARS-affected person in the last 10 days; and, having
visited a health facility that has been identified by public health
officials as being affected by SARS.
If passengers have visited a SARS-affected facility or have had contact
with a SARS-affected person, they are instructed to call their local health
department.
A Health Canada SARS Team of physicians and nurses have been deployed to
Pearson to provide information to airline and airport staff.
Latest Canadian Numbers on SARS
----------------------------
As of 1 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 151
probable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
Canada. There have been 6 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The information
contained in this update is based on the best available information Health
Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 56 probable and 68 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 12 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.
Saskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 7 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
[B] Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases: 31 Mar 2003
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sars20030331_e.html>
Latest Case Counts: Since yesterday, 9 additional probable cases have been
reported in Canada. A total of 53 individuals who meet the probable case
definition of SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia,
including 4 deaths. In addition, a total of 76 individuals who meet the
definition of a suspect case of SARS have been reported in British
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick. Since SARS is a
diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.
Thus, previously reported cases may be discarded after further
investigation and follow-up. The current number of probable cases by
reported symptom onset date and type of exposure is also provided
(Figure 1) [see webpage.
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sars20030331_e.html>
Recent Ontario Epidemiologic Findings: The Ontario Ministry of Health and
Long-Term Care has reported a total of 51 probable cases of SARS. Of these,
most remain hospitalised for isolation purposes and only 2 are currently in
intensive care. All 4 deaths were associated with individuals with
underlying illness, and all but one occurred in elderly patients. Using the
information currently available, the average age of probable cases is 46.5
years (n=37, range 17 to 82 years), with 26 known females and 17 known
males.
While it is difficult to conclusively determine the incubation period of
the etiologic agent, given the fact that many of the probable cases in
Ontario may have multiple exposures, the current estimated mean incubation
period is 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10 days).
It is believed that 4 generations of transmission have occurred. The index
case in Ontario was an individual who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at
the Metropole Hotel, where a cluster of SARS cases has since been reported.
Upon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4 members of the
immediate and extended family. A physician who had close contact with
members of this family was also diagnosed with SARS. Following this, cases
were reported in individuals in a hospital setting where some of the first
cases were treated. Most recently, SARS has been reported in a few of the
household contacts of these hospital-associated cases. An isolated case in
Ontario was reported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did
not stay in at the Metropole Hotel.
Based on the most recent epidemiologic investigations, nearly all of the
probable cases of SARS that occurred in individuals outside of the initial
family cluster have been linked either directly or indirectly back to
exposure to the first hospitalised case of SARS, on 7 Mar 2003. It is
believed that disease transmission occurred mainly as a result of
person-to-person contact. The initial hospital-associated cases are thought
to have contracted the illness as a result of unprotected contact with the
initial cases prior to the recognition of SARS. Subsequent transmission may
have then occurred between households of these hospital-associated cases,
and between other healthcare workers. To date, there has been no evidence
of transmission in the general community. Furthermore, there is presently
no evidence to suggest that disease transmission occurs prior to the onset
of fever in a suspected or probable case of SARS.
Other Reports: A Canadian with SARS [not counted in the official Canadian
case count], who is currently hospitalised in Hong Kong, stayed at the
Metropole Hotel, as did the first identified probable case of SARS in
British Columbia. However, while a second probable case reported by BC did
not stay at this hotel, this individual was exposed to a SARS case while in
Hong Kong. Both BC cases are currently in isolation and there is no
evidence of further spread in the province. The 11 suspected cases
currently under investigation are all associated with travel-related
exposures.
Ontario has declared a provincial emergency and SARS is now a reportable
diseases under Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act. The province
has introduced a number of public measures in an effort to contain the
spread of SARS. Key public health measures include: extensive contact
tracing of persons who may have come in contact with SARS cases, isolation
of suspect and probable cases, and voluntary home quarantine for
asymptomatic contacts. Isolation wards have been established at hospitals
and health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact
precautions. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS
and have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and
their patients in an effort to prevent any further infection.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank John Herbert <j_a_herbert@yahoo.com>,
Marianne Hopp <mjh12@yahoo.com>, Dr.P.Badrinath <badrishanthi@hotmail.com>
and Pablo Nart <p.nart@virgin.net> for their continuing contributions
following this unfolding epidemic and investigation.
Data from Singapore and the USA were not available for 1 Apr 2003 on their
respective health department/ministry websites.
The text of the WHO update [1C] raises many of the questions that still
require answers. Until there is a reliable laboratory test that will allow
for a definitive diagnosis of a definitive etiologic agent, data that are
being presented refer to cases that are defined by clinical and
epidemiologic criteria. Once a definitive agent is identified, and
laboratory testing will allow for confirmation of cases, a wider spectrum
of clinical presentation is likely to be described as well as more answers
on transmission routes, virus shedding etc.
As mentioned above there were 182 new cases and 4 new deaths reported to
WHO in the past 24 hours attributable to SARS. The situation in Hong Kong
awaits further clarification as to the presumed mechanism of transmission
in the apartment complex where the most recent cluster of cases has
occurred. Elsewhere, transmission is still following the pattern of
requiring close contact with an active case of SARS. It appears as though
transmission may have been interrupted in Viet Nam, where the majority of
transmission was in the healthcare setting and infection control procedures
have been implemented. Traditionally interruption of transmission is
considered to have occurred when 2 maximum incubation periods of a disease
have passed without new cases being identified. In the case of SARS, the
maximum incubation period is currently described as 10 days, so that at 20
days one might consider transmission to have been interrupted. Clearly
this may change once the etiologic agent has been definitively identified
and studies on duration of viral shedding are completed.
For additional information on the early outbreak investigations in Canada
and Hong Kong and an editorial addressed to the medical community, the New
England Journal of Medicine has posted 3 articles on SARS. They have been
released early due to its clinical/public health implications.These
articles cam be accessed on line at
