Status of rural carbuncle [anthrax] in Argentina in 2019
--------------------------------------------------------
Again, after 42 years of permanent assessment of this zoonosis, we insist on the fact that "Only persevering in the vaccination of bovines on an annual basis and in efficiently eliminating the carcasses of dead animals, will facilitate the reduction of the load of _Bacillus anthracis_ spores on the soils, and will control this zoonosis." The various indicators assessed show significant progress but not enough for control.

Summary
------
1. Assessment area of rural carbuncle in the province of Buenos Aires: This area consists of 30 districts of the province. Two districts, Olavarria and Pehuajo, presented sporadic outbreaks of "bovine carbuncle." The outbreaks presented a common denominator: "the partial vaccination in facilities," in spite of the obligation to vaccinate all susceptible animals in the facility (law no. 6703/1961 - resolution no. 115/2014, Province of Buenos Aires). The annual percentage distribution of carbuncle was 3% -- 2 percentage points above the record of the previous period, even though the 1977-2019 percentage distribution still stands at 10%.

2. Alert zone and response, district of Azul: There is a historic record of 67 bovine carbuncle outbreaks, which resulted in 21 human alerts and 22 veterinary alerts since 2004. The last bovine carbuncle outbreak occurred in 2013, and as from such year, no human cases have been recorded either. From the beginning up to 2019, 3 181 724 bovines have been simultaneously vaccinated for foot-and-mouth disease and carbuncle.

3. Isolations in other veterinary diagnostic labs: A new decrease of 7 percentage points against 2018 was evidenced in external monitoring labs collaborating with this report. The annual percentage distribution of bovine carbuncle for this period was 4.5%. The 4 isolations correspond to the province of La Pampa. This province consists of 22 departments, and 11 departments (50%) recorded at least one bovine carbuncle outbreak in their history (2016-2019).

4. Districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in carbuncle outbreaks: During 2019, 4 sporadic bovine carbuncle outbreaks were recorded for this report, in the districts of Olavarria (1), Rauch (1), and Carlos Casares (2).

5. Production of anti-carbuncle vaccine for veterinary use: In 2019, the National Health Authority (SENASA) approved 25 664 800 doses for use and commercialization, around 4 160 710 more doses than in 2018.

6. Mandatory simultaneous bovine vaccination: Two areas of bovine anti-carbuncle vaccination were assessed in order to follow up the actions under vaccination programs:
- (a) Alert zone and response (district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires): In 2019, 90% of the susceptible population were vaccinated, whereas in 2018, 98% were vaccinated, which means 8 percentage points fewer vaccinated bovines.
- (b) Province of Buenos Aires: In 2019, 93% of the susceptible population were vaccinated. In 2018, such figure reached 77%, showing an increase of 16 percentage points as regards vaccinated animals.
- (c) Province of Santa Fe: During 2019, it was not possible to obtain self-proving information on this sanitary event.

7. Cases of human carbuncle countrywide: Due to the changes made to the National Surveillance Comprehensive Bulletin issued by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE), in which human carbuncle cases are no longer reported, it is not possible to provide such information.

Conclusions:
- (a) There are still isolations of _B. anthracis_ in items 1, 3, and 5 of the systematized assessment, thus showing the endemic nature of bovine carbuncle.
- (b) Despite the increase in compliance with mandatory vaccination programs as provided by law, they are not efficient in the control of stocks of susceptible animals of each cattle breeding facility, in order to make immunization more effective. This is because not all susceptible animals in the roundups involved were vaccinated.
- (c) The [control of the] negligence shared by cattle breeders and authorities in relation to animal health is part of the future solution.

[They are working very hard in Argentina to get this disease fully controlled and eradicated. The disease has become truly sporadic, and a common history is a failure to wholly or completely vaccinate the herds. When the owners fail to vaccinate or leave out a bunch, it becomes public knowledge when the latter come down with anthrax. This brings back memories of the problems in the US Dakotas, which are now effectively clear of this disease despite the procrastinators. Our thanks to Ramon for his annual report and our full support for his hard work. - Mod.MHJ
