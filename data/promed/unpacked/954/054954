[1] Luxembourg
Date: Sat 18 Aug 2007
From: Sabine Zentis <CVLonghorns@aol.com>
The Luxembourg authorities yesterday (17 Aug 2007) confirmed the 1st
case of Bluetongue in a suckler cow. The cow is kept on a holding in
Altrier; see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=49.751986,6.361478|13|4&loc=LU:49.751986:6.361478:13>.
More cases in the eastern part of Luxembourg are being investigated
by vets. As required, a 20-km zone has been established around the
affected holding.
The Luxembourg authorities are expecting that the whole of Luxembourg
will be declared infected as more cases occur.

[The BTV-8 cases in Luxembourg were expected, falling in line with
the extensive reemergence of the disease in northern Europe after a
brief winter pause. In addition to the massive spread in Germany and
the Netherlands reported in postings 20070811.2621 and 20070808.2580
respectively, the following more recent data relate to other affected
countries.
Belgium notified the OIE on 13 Aug 2007 about 100 outbreaks in bovine
and ovine holdings, with 47 cases (6 mortalities) out of 2166
susceptible bovines, and 170 cases (60 mortalities) out of 2638
susceptible ovines (see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5903>).
France notified the OIE on 16 Aug 2007 about 7 outbreaks in bovine
holdings, with 11 cases diagnosed among 1118 susceptible bovines (see
at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5915>).
The virus seems to be widely spread, but its clinical effect is
rather mild, particularly in cattle. Clearly, the case fatality rate
in sheep is significantly higher. To assess the pathogenicity of the
current BTV-8 strain, it would be useful to obtain data on the age of
the affected sheep, on their breeds and on the disease history of
their respective flocks in 2006. - Mod.AS]

[2] BTV-8 vaccination

The posting "Bluetongue - Europe (15): BTV-8, Germany (NRW, RP)"
included the following moderator's comment: "... It will also be
useful to hear about the availability of a BTV-8 vaccine ..."
My investigation into the issue has gained the following results:
Inactivated vaccine against bluetongue virus serotype 8 will most
likely be available mid 2008 for sheep and cattle (according to
Merial SAS, Lyon). Merial said that in sheep, one single injection
will lead to an efficacious protection of animals. For cattle, 2
injections at an interval of 3 weeks will be needed. Annual
re-vaccination will lead to a long-lasting and efficient protection
in sheep and cattle.
Another pharmaceutical company, Intervet (Boxmeer, NL) is also
developing a vaccine against BTV serotype 8. The 1st test results in
sheep are promising, and this would mean that by next year [2008],
the 1st sheep could be vaccinated against BTV.
In Spain, Portugal, Italy and France (Corsica), millions of sheep and
cattle are vaccinated each year since 2004.
History from Spain, Portugal (BTV-4) and France (Corsica, BTV 2-4)
shows that the use of inactivated vaccines against bluetongue was
successful. Non-infected, vaccinated animals remained PCR-negative
(also after challenge/field infection), which will allow animals to
be moved.
Commission Decisions 2006/603/EC and 2006/273/EC deal with the
reduction of restricted areas after cessation of virus circulation in
affected countries. According to OIE/EU, c-ELISA-positive but
PCR-negative animals are considered safe for trade.
The above mentioned examples have shown that if a strict vaccine
regime with at least 80 percent coverage of susceptible populations
is achieved, vaccination can lead to the eradication of the virus.
The use of inactivated vaccines will provide additional safeguards,
preventing the spread of vaccine virus within the susceptible
population.
In addition, as the vectors respect neither borders nor movement
restrictions, vaccination is a key tool to prevent the virus from
spreading into hitherto uninfected areas.
It seems that the European commission is willing to fund 50 percent
of the costs of a vaccination campaign.
I hope this information is useful.

[Commission Decision 2005/603/EC includes the following statement:
"On 7 Jun 2005, Italy presented a report to the Standing Committee
for the Food Chain and Animal Health, which concludes that the
surveillance system in place in Italy has proved that no virus has
circulated in the province of Massa Carrara, in Toscana, for more
than 2 years. Consequently, that province should be considered free
of bluetongue and, on the basis of the substantiated request
submitted by Italy, deleted from the Italian provinces listed under
Zone B in Annex I to Decision 2005/393/EC."
Similarly, Commission Decision 2006/273/EC says: "Spain has informed
the Commission that no virus has circulated in the Balearic Islands
for more than 2 years. Consequently, that geographic area should be
considered free of bluetongue and, on the basis of the substantiated
request submitted by Spain, deleted from the areas listed for
restricted zones."
While this moderator is an advocate of BT vaccination, mainly for the
protection of clinically-susceptible animal species/breeds (mostly
sheep) against the clinical disease and its subsequent economical
losses, it is highly debatable whether vaccination is in a position
to "eradicate" the disease. There might be various factors leading to
the absence of virus circulation within a region during extended
periods (e.g. 2 years); vaccination does not seem to be a prominent
one among them, if it is at all, unless covering continuously all
domestic and wild susceptible animals, an impractical undertaking. On
the other hand, the permit to move vaccinated/immune animals from an
affected area deserves consideration, in view of the fact that such
animals will not be viremic.
It will be interesting to obtain also views of entomologists as to
the prospects of eradicating the disease from an infected area. -
