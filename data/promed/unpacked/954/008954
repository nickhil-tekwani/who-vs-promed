Dr Myers Lugemwa, the head of the malaria control programme at the health ministry, has confirmed cases of chikungunya [virus] infection in Uganda, especially around the River Semliki and in the West Nile region. He said there were few incidences, however, so there was no need for panic.

Chikungunya [virus], transmitted by mosquitoes and whose signs and symptoms are similar to those of malaria, has no known vaccine or cure at the moment. Patients bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus present with severe muscle pains, high temperature, lymph node pains and swellings and may develop a rash that eventually bleeds if unattended to. They develop red eyes and also have severe headaches and backaches and may start vomiting.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has already sounded a concern regarding the growing incidences of the viral infection, especially around the Caribbean islands in the Atlantic Ocean [Caribbean]. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have sent out a health advisory to doctors in the United States to consider chikungunya infection in patients with acute onset of fever and joint pain.

Chikungunya [virus], which was 1st isolated in Tanzania in 1953, is commonly spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that also transmit dengue fever [virus], a similar but more serious illness with a deadly haemorrhagic form.

Unlike the female _Anopheles_ mosquito that transmits malaria plasmodium and is common in Uganda, Lugemwa says the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are rare, except around the prone areas surrounding River Semliki and the West Nile region.

Lugemwa says once bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, the incubation takes between 3-12 days before symptoms manifest. The illness is not life-threatening, but there is no vaccine.

The diagnosis is carried out using specialised equipment, lest the disease is mistaken for malaria or another form of haemorrhagic fever. Several methods can be used for diagnosis. Lugemwa says the infection can also infect other animals, especially monkeys, and can also be transmitted from mother-to-child when the baby is still in the womb.

"There are many types of mosquitoes, and some transmit viruses. However, the fact that mosquitoes can also transmit viruses should not cause alarm, because mosquitoes cannot transmit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes transmit a virus scientifically called alphavirus, whereas HIV is a retrovirus (a family of enveloped viruses that replicate in a host cell)," he added. Lugemwa explains that HIV cannot survive inside the body of the mosquito, while the chikungunya [virus] can. He says cases of the chikungunya virus [infection] have, in the past, also been reported in Asia, Latin America, the Congo, and in Europe.

Lugemwa says in Tanzania, chikungunya means "break your back," because the person with the disease has a severe backache ["that which bends up" because of severe joint pain. - Mod.TY].

He says the ministry's antimalarial interventions like indoor spraying and distributing free mosquito nets also help in the prevention of these and other diseases such as malaria.

[ProMED-mail very rarely receives reports of chikungunya virus outbreaks in Africa. The most recent reports were in 2011 and 2012, from the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. No previous reports of chikungunya virus infections in Uganda have been received by ProMED-mail. It would be of interest to learn how many cases have occurred in Uganda and the dates of their occurrence. - Mod.TY
