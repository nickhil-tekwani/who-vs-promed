A hawk in western Minnesota is the 1st wild bird in the state to test positive for the bird flu virus since the beginning of an outbreak that's killed more than 15 million birds in the Midwest this spring [2015], state wildlife officials announced [Thu 30 Apr 2015].

Officials have long said that wild birds could be spreading the flu, but warned that the positive test in the hawk doesn't prove wild birds are the direct cause of the recent infections.

"This bird tells us our surveillance is working, but it unfortunately doesn't provide many other clues about transmission of the virus," Lou Cornicelli, wildlife research manager for the Department of Natural Resources, said in a statement.

Scientists and industry officials have said the virus also may be reaching captive birds via the feet of humans and rodents, or is being carried in by trucks, equipment, crates, and egg flats.

Minnesota, the nation's largest turkey-producing state, has been hit hardest by the flu, with nearly 4 million birds killed by either the virus or euthanization. 19 counties have infected flocks.

The H5N2 virus was detected earlier this year [2015] in at least 3 snow geese in Missouri and a goose in Kansas, but Minnesota officials had tested nearly 3000 fecal samples from wild birds without finding the virus. They are also testing dead birds for the virus as well as hunter-harvested wild turkeys.

The Cooper's hawk died in mid-April [2015] after flying into the deck of a home in Yellow Medicine County [southwestern Minnesota], and was tested after the homeowner reported it. That county isn't among those that have had bird flu turn up in big poultry operations, but nearby Lyon County [southwestern Minnesota] is.

A Cooper's hawk in Washington State tested positive for the virus in January [2015]. Cornicelli said the hawks likely get it from something they eat.

The virus spreads quickly in confined flocks, but wild bird populations such as raptors and wild turkeys aren't as vulnerable because they are dispersed.

Separately [Thu 30 Apr 2015], the Minnesota Board of Animal Health released mortality numbers for 11 flocks found earlier this week to have the virus or presumed to have the virus. The flocks had a total of 515 000 birds, including 202 500 turkeys on a Stearns County [central Minnesota] farm.

The article above referring to a hawk, a wild bird I understand, although not perhaps a migrating bird, may contradict the previous ProMED-mail post (Avian influenza (102): USA, HPAI H5N2, poultry, turkey archive no 20150501.3332390), stating that no wild birds had been found to have the virus in Minnesota.

So while no wild migratory birds may have been found to have the virus, this virus is spreading in some fashion. Efforts to identify how it is spreading need identifying so it can be stopped. - Mod.TG]

Daily update on avian influenza -- 29 Apr 2015
----------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Homeland Security and Emergency Management Division (HSEM) activated the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) to coordinate the state's ongoing response to avian influenza. HSEM will coordinate resource needs with several state agencies including the Minnesota Board of Animal Health and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

Additional HPAI cases in Minnesota
----------------------------------
The USDA today [29 Apr 2015] confirmed the presence of H5N2 HPAI in 8 additional flocks. The following counties are affected:
- Steele: 1st detection (turkeys, flock size pending)
- Kandiyohi: 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd detections (turkeys, flock size pending)
- Stearns: 11th (turkeys, flock size pending) and 12th detections (layer chickens, flock size pending)
- Swift: 3rd detection (turkeys, flock size pending)

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health today [29 Apr 2015] announced 3 presumptive positive flocks.
The following Minnesota counties are affected.:
- Kandiyohi: 24th and 25th detections (turkeys)
- Meeker: 7th detection (72 400 turkeys)

Current situation
-----------------
Total number of farms: 67
Total number of counties: 19

Total number of birds affected in Minnesota: 3 460 532 (not including pending flocks)

All affected farms remain under quarantine.

Visit the USDA's website [http://tinyurl.com/owsgy54] for information on all HPAI findings in the United States.

To date, animal health officials have completed the following response zone activities:
- Appraisals have been completed for 64 of the affected premises.
- Birds on 52 of the affected farms have been euthanized.
- The composting process is underway on 42 of the affected farms. Animal health officials are currently working with producers to begin composting on others.
- The affected farm in Pope County (1st detection in Minnesota) is done with composting and is working on cleaning and disinfection of the barns.

Identification and announcement of HPAI cases in Minnesota
----------------------------------------------------------
There are several steps involved in confirming that a poultry flock is positive for a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza. Here is an outline of that process which includes timing of public notification:
1. A poultry producer or backyard flock owner notices unusual death loss or other signs of illness in his/her birds.
2. The individual notifies their veterinarian or an animal health official.
3. Samples are collected from the birds on the premises.
4. Samples are submitted to an approved state laboratory for preliminary testing.
5. State laboratories are able to determine if the samples are positive for an H5 or H7 influenza virus. If samples are positive for an H5 or H7 virus, they are considered as presumptive positives and are forwarded to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.
6. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health will include information on presumptive positive flocks on its website. These cases will also be shared through the State Emergency Operations Center Daily Updates on Avian Influenza.
7. NVSL is the only laboratory in the United States that is authorized to officially confirm the presence of a HPAI and identify the specific strain of virus. When NVSL confirms HPAI, the US Department of Agriculture [http://tinyurl.com/owsgy54] shares that information with the public by posting online.

National Guard completes mission
--------------------------------
The Minnesota National Guard completed its water delivery mission. Private contractors are now in place to provide water support for foaming operations on affected farms. The National Guard remains involved at the State emergency Operations Center and is available if their support is needed in the future.

Producers affected by H5N2 get more time to file and pay their taxes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Poultry producers in Minnesota whose farms or flocks are affected by the H5N2 avian influenza will get help if the outbreak prevented them from filing their returns or paying their taxes on time, the Minnesota Department of Revenue announced today [29 Apr 2015].

The department will forgive penalties and interest for poultry producers in the affected counties who have Minnesota tax returns or payments due between 23 Apr and 27 May 2015, in line with the original emergency executive order and 30 day extension.

This only applies to Minnesota taxes. This does not apply to any local government or federal taxes.
If you are a poultry producer in the affected counties and the outbreak has prevented you from filing or paying your taxes, please contact us at 651-556-3003 or 1-800-657-3909

Behavioral Health Medical Reserve Corps
---------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health has activated its Behavioral Health Medical Reserve Corps (BH-MRC) to help provide mental health resources for those Minnesotans impacted by avian influenza. MDH is working with regional public health preparedness contacts to assess specific community needs. The immediate focus is on the three most heavily impacted counties: Kandiyohi, Meeker and Stearns.

The BH-MRC is a statewide group of volunteer behavioral health specialists that supports individuals, communities, and the Incident Command System during disasters by providing expert behavioral health skills. The BH-MRC may be deployed during disasters that include but are not limited to natural disasters and public health emergencies. The group was last activated during the 2012 floods. More information is available on the MDH website at http://www.health.state.mn.us/oep/responsesystems/bhmrc.html.

Governor Dayton hosts turkey lunch for interns, promoting Minnesota-grown turkey
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Governor Mark Dayton hosted a Minnesota-grown turkey lunch at the Governor's Residence for interns who are working this spring [2014] in the Office of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The lunch featured a 25-pound [11.3 kg] turkey, which was raised in Glenwood, Minnesota. Minnesota is the nation's largest producer of turkeys, with 450 farmers raising approximately 46 million turkeys annually, and generating nearly USD 800 million in economic activity every year.

"As turkey farmers across our state deal with the devastating effects of avian influenza, it is more important than ever for all Minnesotans to support the Minnesota turkey industry," said Governor Dayton. "Our turkey growers need more than our help in stopping the spread of this disease; they need our full support as consumers to buy and eat good Minnesota turkey."

Minnesota [MN] Dept of Agriculture [MDA] outreach
-------------------------------------------------
MDA Liaisons have been actively contacting key agricultural stakeholder groups including MN Farm Bureau, MN Farmers Union, University of Minnesota Extension, County Executive Directors of USDA-Farm Service Agency, and leaders of 4-H, updating them on HPAI response and educating their contacts about effective biosecurity on and off the farm.

No public health risk
---------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) reports that no human infections with this strain of the virus (H5N2) have been detected in Minnesota or elsewhere in the US. However, in some cases certain HPAI H5 viruses can infect people and it is important to prevent infections.

In general, avian influenza viruses are spread to people through direct contact with infected birds or their environments, including contaminated bedding, feed, or water. Person-to-person spread of avian influenza viruses is rare and limited.

This is not a public health risk or a food safety risk. The potential risk is for those who have direct contact with infected birds.

Poultry workers
---------------
MDH is monitoring the health of workers, who have had contact with infected poultry, and providing guidance on infection control, the use of personal protective equipment, and providing support for any other health-related aspects of response.
- People who had close, unprotected contact with infected flocks are recommended to receive an antiviral drug called Tamiflu. MDH does not issue the drug directly. Rather, MDH facilitates getting the prescription for the workers by working with the company occupational health departments or the health care providers for those individuals.
- Workers are then contacted daily for 10 days and monitored for development of respiratory symptoms.
- As of today [29 Apr 2015], MDH has completed follow-up contacts for 51 flocks.
- MDH is currently monitoring 86 poultry personnel for potential symptoms of infection, such as development of an eye infection or respiratory symptoms.
- The MDH 10-day monitoring period has been completed for 83 people associated with 22 flocks; no infections with this virus were detected.

State agriculture officials say the deadly bird flu virus is suspected on 2 more Iowa chicken farms and 2 more turkey operations.

Officials say initial tests indicate the virus on 2 turkey farms in Buena Vista County [northern Iowa]. One has 50 000 birds and the count on the other farm is still pending. A chicken farm in that county with 63 000 laying hens also tested positive.

Tests also returned positive on a chicken breeder farm with 19 000 birds in Kossuth County [northern Iowa].

A US Department of Agriculture laboratory in Ames will run additional tests to confirm.

That lab [Wed 29 Apr 2015] confirmed the virus on farms in Sioux, O'Brien, and Osceola counties [northwestern Iowa] with nearly 6 million chickens.

The new cases bring to 10 million the Iowa birds that have either been or will be euthanized.

The deadly bird flu virus has been confirmed on northwest Iowa farms that had been identified earlier as possible cases by state officials.

A laboratory in Ames operated by the US Department of Agriculture has confirmed the H5N2 virus on a Sioux County farm with nearly 3.7 million egg-laying hens, 2 O'Brien County farms with a combined 338 000 hens, and an Osceola County farm with 258 000 chickens. An egg farm with 1.7 million chickens was confirmed late [Mon 27 Apr 2015].

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey had said [Mon 27 Apr 2015], the 5 farms were probable cases pending further tests.

The confirmed cases bring to about 9.8 million Iowa chickens that have either been or will be euthanized.

The virus has also been found on 2 Iowa turkey farms involving 80 000 birds.
