The Dallas Morning News [August 29] reported that [a 26-year old woman] was
indicted by a Dallas County Grand Jury on several first degree felony charges
for tampering with a consumer product. [She] was formerly employed as a lab
worker in the laboratories at St. Paul Medical Center in Dallas. An outbreak
of _Shigella dysenteriae_ infections, epidemiologically related to eating
muffins and doughnuts in the employee break room, occurred in late October
1996 (Kolavic et al. JAMA 1997, 278:396-398). Bail has not been set; [she]
remains free on $15,000 bond on an earlier charge of tampering with government
records and aggravated assault. These charges were in connection with an
earlier case in which she allegedly altered a former boyfriend's lab
specimens after planting bacteria in his food.
No trial date has been set for either attack. A federal criminal
investigation into this outbreak is still active.
