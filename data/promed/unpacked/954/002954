Occurrence of Potyviruses on Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) in Colombia and First
Molecular Characterization of Yam mild mosaic virus.
S. Dallot and M. Bousalem, IRD, 911 av. Agropolis, 34032 Montpellier,
France; and M. Guzman, Instituto de Biotecnologia, Universidad Nacional de
Colombia, Colombia. Plant Dis. 85:803, 2001; published on-line as
D-2001-0521-03N, 2001. Accepted for publication 2 May 2001.
A survey to determine the prevalence of potyviruses on yams, _Dioscorea
alata_ and _D. cayenensis-rotundata_, was undertaken in Colombia. [250]
leaf samples showing mottling symptoms were collected on the Atlantic coast
and analyzed by antigen-coated plate ... [ELISA] with universal potyvirus
monoclonal antibodies (Agdia, Elkhart, IN). Potyviruses were detected in
70% (165/235) of the _D. alata_ and in 66% (10/15) of the _D.
cayenensis-rotundata_ samples. The presence of Yam mild mosaic virus (YMMV)
was indicated in some of these samples by immunocapture
reverse-transcriptase ... [PCR] performed as previously reported (1).
A 600-bp fragment that included the core and C-terminal region of the coat
protein gene (CP) and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) was amplified from
a _D. alata_ isolate using universal potyvirus primers (1), cloned, and
sequenced (EMBL Acc. AJ311725). Comparison with the 2 previously published
YMMV sequences revealed 96.1 and 97.4% identity for the deduced amino acid
sequence in the CP region, 74.1 and 83.2% nucleotide identity in the 3'UTR
for Papua New Guinea (AB022424 [2]) and Martinique (AJ250336) isolates,
respectively.
YMMV is known to be widespread on _D. alata_ in Africa and the South
Pacific and has been recently identified in the Caribbean (1). To our
knowledge, this is the first report of its occurrence in Colombia. A study
of its incidence and genetic diversity in South America has been undertaken.

[This potyvirus was first reported in _D. cayenensis_ from the Ivory Coast
in 1977. The virus infects several other species of _Dioscorea_. It is
transmitted by several aphid species. Symptoms (mosaic and vein-banding)
are mild and tend to disappear soon after infection. It also spreads in
west Africa, Guadeloupe and Guyana. Comparisons between YMV and YMMV
isolates from Japan, Martinique and other potyviruses are needed to
determine if YMMV is considered to be a strain of YMV or a new potyvirus.
The sequence of the coat protein of YMMV suggests that it might qualify as
a new potyvirus, but the 7th Report of the ICTV does not list YMMV as a
member of any of the genera in the family Potyviridae. Presumably the
matter will be resolved at the next meeting of the ICTV.
