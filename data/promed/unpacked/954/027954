Gabon Fears Possible Spread of Ebola
------------------------------------
Health officials feared an Ebola outbreak could be spreading in this
Central African nation Thursday, as the mother of one of the 10 people
killed so far developed symptoms of the deadly disease.
A blood sample was taken from the woman -- the first person to show
signs of the disease in Mekambo, a town of about 11 000 people near 4
afflicted villages, said provincial health director Dr. Prosper
Abessolo-Mengue. Results were expected Friday.
Authorities were also waiting for the results of tests conducted on
other people who came into contact with the victims in the
northeastern province of Ogooue Ivindo, near the border with Republic
of Congo, he said.
The highly contagious disease has killed 10 people and infected 2
others -- including a woman who left her village late Tuesday or early
Wednesday. Health officials feared she had fled to relatives in
Republic of Congo and could spread the disease. Authorities on the
other side of the border were still looking for the woman Thursday.
Gabon's government first reported on Dec. 4 that it suspected an
outbreak. WHO confirmed Sunday the disease was Ebola, which has
similar symptoms to other, less deadly hemorrhagic fevers.
While a quarantine has not been imposed on the affected region, local
authorities are monitoring movement to and from the area. Journalists
have not been allowed to travel to the region.
