Two children have been hospitalized and a number of others affected by a suspected _ E. coli_ outbreak at a nursery in Northwich.

Environmental Health officers are investigating a cluster of probable _E. coli_ O157 cases after 2 children from Chrysalis Day Nursery had to receive treatment at Leighton Hospital due to "complications."

14 probable cases have since been reported following screening of all staff and youngsters, with both children and family members showing symptoms of the infection, prompting the nursery to ask parents to keep their children at home as a precaution. Five of the cases are a result of secondary transmission to other family members.

Dr Richard Jarvis from Cheshire and Merseyside's PHE team said: "Investigations are still ongoing and all public health measures have been put in place to help prevent further cases. Staff and nursery children in the 3 affected classes are being screened, and parents have been asked to keep their children at home until they have produced 2 clear specimens. This is a precautionary approach and in line with national guidelines."

The condition of the children in hospital is not yet known.
