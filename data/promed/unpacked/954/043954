17 cases of animal bites are recorded daily in Setif
----------------------------------------------------
Algeria continues to record cases of rabies in proportions which are
causing increasing concern. The fight against this phenomenon is
dependent on a strategy of action against environmental degradation
and preservation of public health. Rabies, and other diseases caused
by bites, are a permanent danger in our country which threaten
Algerian society, particularly since their occurrence is facilitated
by environmental degradation, particularly in urban areas. According
to the prevention service of the Directorate of Health in Setif, 17
cases of animal bites are recorded daily in this wilaya
[administrative region] despite efforts being made locally.

In 2008 in Algeria 84 717 people were vaccinated as a consequence of
animal bites. In Setif during that period 6198 people were vaccinated
as a consequence of animal bites, a figure which is the highest for
the whole country.

According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Health, 66
percent of the cases were accounted for by dog bites, 18 percent by
cat bites, 11 percent by rat bites, and the remaining 5 percent
undefined. The wort aspect of these figures is that animal bites
account for 20 to 44 percent of all registered medical conditions
registered for treatment at the national level.

[Setif is a town in northeastern Algeria. It is the capital of Setif
province (wilaya) and it has a population of 239 195 inhabitants as
of the 1998 census. Setif is located to the east of Algiers and is
the 2nd most important wilaya after the country's capital.

This press report does not specify the numbers of human and animal
cases of rabies virus infection recorded throughout Algeria, or even
in the city of Setif, but they must be presumed to be considerable.
It is clear that post-exposure vaccination is well organised, but it
is less clear whether any measures are in place to tackle the
incidence of rabies in domestic and other animals.

People intending to visit Algeria should be made aware of the current
situation. (For those interested the original text is accompanied by
a photograph illustrating what is meant by a 'degraded urban environment.'
