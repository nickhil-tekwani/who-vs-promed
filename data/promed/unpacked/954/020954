4 new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been found in the
State of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, following surveillance activities
surrounding the original outbreaks.
3 cases have been found in Mundo Novo municipality and one in Japora
municipality, Dr. Jorge Caetano Junior, Director, Department of Animal
Protection (DDA), Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply of
Brazil, told the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).
In Mundo Novo municipality, 2 of the affected holdings are situated very
close together, he said. They have a total of 36 head of cattle, used for
subsistence purposes. The 3rd holding has 333 animals for rearing and breeding.
In Japora municipality, the affected holding contains 1072 head of cattle
for rearing and breeding. 10 female animals aged between 12 and 24 months
showed clinical signs compatible with FMD, he added.
The source of new outbreaks is currently unknown or inconclusive, but
Brazilian authorities said that investigations are in progress. The control
measures that have been taken include stamping out, quarantine, movement
control inside the country, screening and zoning. The authorities are to
carry out a program of disinfection of infected premises.
To date, in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, 28 outbreaks have been
detected and 14 785 FMD-susceptible animals have been slaughtered and
destroyed.
The change in the weather in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul has enabled
stamping-out activities to be intensified.
The sanitation process is in progress in the holdings where all susceptible
animals have been destroyed.
