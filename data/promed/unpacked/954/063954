Authorities in Djibouti have reported a serious outbreak of a
potentially fatal diarrhea infection in the capital [Djibouti], with
2 deaths since October 2011 and 127 new cases this month [November
2011], the WHO said on Tuesday [22 Nov 2011]. WHO said 5000 cases of
acute watery
diarrhea (AWD) have already been reported this year [2011] compared
to 2000 in the Red Sea port in 2010.

Poor hygiene and sanitation along with recent rainfall in some areas
had led to the contamination of already limited and unsafe water
supplies, according to the UN health agency, which said the drought
in the Horn of Africa had exacerbated the situation.

"The effects of the recurring drought on several parts of Djibouti
and neighbouring countries have resulted in a malnourished, poorer
and more vulnerable population," a WHO statement said. [WHO] is
working with the Djibouti ministry of health to train health workers
and set up treatment centres.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (North Eastern province), Somali refugees

Cholera has broken out in the world's largest refugee camp in Kenya,
home to nearly 500,000 Somali refugees, the United Nations said on
Tuesday, 15 Nov 2011. Insecurity also continues to hamper aid efforts
following the kidnapping of Western aid workers from the sprawling
Dadaab complex of five camps, where 100 additional Kenyan police have
been deployed in the past month, it said.

"There are now 60 cholera cases in the camps, including 10
laboratory-confirmed cases and 1 refugee death," Andrej Mahecic,
spokesman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a
news briefing. The outbreak is believed to have started among newly
arrived refugees from Somalia, where the disease is endemic, who may
also have contracted it en route by drinking unsafe water from areas
flooded by heavy rains, he said.

The UNHCR and other aid agencies have set up cholera treatment centers
in the camp for severe cases and are promoting safe hygiene practices,
Mahecic said. Most cases can be managed by giving oral rehydration
solutions.

In all, some 220 Kenyan police are now deployed in Dadaab, which
consists of 5 camps spread across 50 square kilometers (19 square
miles), according to the UNHCR spokesman.

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Rift Valley province)

The government has confirmed an outbreak of dysentery and cholera in
parts of Turkana where 40 people have died in the last one month.
Turkana Central medical officer Joseph Epem said they had dispatched a
team of more than 50 medical officers and delivered drugs to help
combat the outbreak in Kerio division. However, Epem said the outbreak
had been compounded by famine in the area. More than 250 other victims
have been placed under treatment. "We treating the affected people to
ensure the diseases do not spread," Epem said.

Last week, medical teams had been sent to parts of Turkana to
investigate the cause of the deaths. Turkana Central district
commissioner Humphrey Nakitare said the teams have been working in
Kerio area where most of the victims are reported to have succumbed to
famine, malaria and diarrhea, among other ailments.

He said than 100 000 people still rely on relief food for survival in
the area where the famine situation worsened early in 2011, leading to
the Kenyans for Kenya Initiative through which more than Shs600
million [USD6550] was raised to aid the famine victims. Kerio division
Public Health officer Diana Rotich, said famine had contributed to the
deaths in the area.

[4] Cholera - Cameroon (Littoral province)
Date: Non 28 Nov 2011

A cholera epidemic has spread across all districts of Cameroon’s
economic capital, Douala, home to 2.1 million people. The epidemic,
which was officially declared 14 months ago, in September 2010, has
peaked and troughed a number of times. In March and April 2011, during
the short rainy season, cholera peaked with an average of 120 cases
per week. But since September the number of cases has been increasing
further, with more than 400 cases per week reported in mid-October
2011.

“The existing health structures were no longer able to care for
patients adequately. We found 2 to 3 patients per bed, some lying on
the ground or on benches, in an appalling condition,” says Dr
Narcisse Wega, MSF’s emergency coordinator in Cameroon. “Health
facilities had reached their limit and were no longer able to cope
with the influx of patients.”

There has been a gradual decrease in registered cases of cholera in
the past few days, raising hopes that the current peak is over. During
the 3rd week of November 2011, 15 new admissions were registered per
day at the Laquintinie hospital treatment centre, compared with 40
daily admissions during the previous week. “This corresponds to the
rain having stopped in the past 10 days,” says Dr Wega.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR
Date: Wed 16 Nov 2011

http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/more-funds-needed-for-congo-cholera-response-un


Aid agencies in Democratic Republic of Congo are running short of
funds
to respond to a cholera outbreak that has hit 8 out of 11 provinces,
the
UN has said. Cholera has infected around 17 500 people and
killed 508 in the vast central African nation since the start of the
year [2011], according to the Congolese ministry of health and the
WHO.

With the epidemic yet to subside, humanitarian agencies estimate at
least USD 4 million is needed to maintain cholera response activities
in
the western provinces of Equateur, Bandundu and Kinshasa, and the
central-eastern Province Orientale, until next year [2012]. "We are in

the rainy season, a period which increases the risk of propagation. It

is, therefore, important that aid groups continue the response," said

Yvon Edoumou, spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Congo.

There are have been more than 7500 cases in western provinces,
including
the capital Kinshasa, which had not experienced a cholera epidemic in
10
years. But the majority of cases, about 10 000, have been reported
in the restive eastern region, where waterborne diseases are endemic.

"Even though the epidemic seems to have reduced in Mbandaka, cholera
still affects some parts of the country especially in South Ubangi
area in Equateur province where 15 out of 119 cases that were reported
since 5 Nov 2011 have died; 8 other people died during the same period
in Basankusu health zone," the president of the local civil society
groups, Modeste Bonkengu, said on Tue, 15 Nov 2011.

At least 81 Somali women and children have died and nearly 670 others
[have been] hospitalized due to cholera in the famine-stricken African
country, Press TV reports. The 81 lost their lives in Jilib Town and
Hoomboy village in south Somalia in the last 24 hours Sat 12 Nov].

Somali doctors say that within the last 24 hours more than 670 Somali
children affected by cholera were rushed to medical centers in
Mareerey Village 15 km north east of Jilib.

Somalia has been the hardest-hit country in what is being described as
the worst drought in the Horn of Africa in 60 years. According to the
UN, a quarter of Somalia's 9.9 million population are either
internally displaced or living outside the country as refugees. The
UN has declared famine in 5 regions of Somalia and says that the
international humanitarian response to the crisis has been
insufficient.

Authorities in Kasese District have ordered the closure of all eating
places that do not meet minimum health standards following a cholera
outbreak that has left 4 people dead and 50 others admitted to
hospital.

The district health officer Yusuf Baseka said, "The disease is
spreading very fast. It is now in Bukonzo West and East and Busongora
North and South constituencies; 4 people have died so far and by this
evening we have about 50 cases admitted at various health units in the
district." He said the disease was first reported in September 2011
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) fishing villages of
Kyavinyonge and Kasindi Pole along Lake Edward which are adjacent to
Kasese.

The two eastern DRC fishing villages correspond in cross-border
business with Uganda's fishing village of Kayanzi where the first
cases in Kasese were reported during the last week of October 2011.
