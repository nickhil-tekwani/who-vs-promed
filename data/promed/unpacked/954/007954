[New Hampshire] State veterinarian Steve Crawford has alerted swine owners of the 1st confirmed case of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PED, in the state. Positive PED tests have also recently been reported in several neighboring states.

Carol Soule, livestock farmer from Loudon, said the loss of a young girl's 4-H project [4-H is a global network of youth development organizations] piglet to PED really brought home Crawford's message about the disease and the importance of biosecurity practices to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Soule said anyone involved with livestock should take biosecurity precautions.

"Livestock diseases can be transmitted from animal to animal," Soule said. "Having a veterinarian check new arrivals is smart. Buying animals, pigs especially, from a farmer with a healthy, closed herd makes sense, too. Disease is also spread by human contact, so if you touch livestock you might not get sick but you could carry a disease to another animal.

"Biosecurity means washing boots, clothing, and hands before and after handling livestock," Soule added. "Practicing biosecurity also means that you could save a piglet's life."

The 8-year-old 4-H member and her family had grown very attached to the piglet.

"This was a hard lesson to learn about biosecurity but one none of us will forget," Soule said. "So pay attention and help save a life. Know that biosecurity works and pay attention to where you buy your animals."

In his May [2016] article, Crawford wrote: "PED has been responsible for significant losses in the national herd with some farms experiencing nearly 100 percent mortality in newborn piglets. PED is caused by a coronavirus that primarily attacks the gastrointestinal system. Young piglets have severe vomiting and diarrhea leading to dehydration and death. As piglets get older the signs are less severe and death is less likely in animals that are over 8 weeks of age. There is no specific treatment other than supportive care by providing access to water and electrolytes. There is no human health risk. There is an available USDA conditionally licensed vaccine for use in breeding sows. Approval for use within New Hampshire may be granted on a case-by-case basis at the request of the herd veterinarian."

Crawford reminded all swine owners and prospective owners to review biosecurity practices with their veterinarian.

"Visiting or doing business with other farms, sharing equipment, and getting animals from unknown sources are inherently risky behaviors that can ... spread disease. If you have breeding animals or visit someone who does, the risk is even greater. Pigs do not have to look sick to be shedding this virus. Trucks, trailers, crates, and other means of conveyance have been implicated in the spread of PED. Therefore, thorough cleaning and disinfection should be carried out before and after any conveyance goes onto a farm or other animal facility, such as an auction, sale barn, or slaughterhouse."

[The state of New Hampshire can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4326764,54083. Loudon is in SW New Hampshire and a short distance from Concord; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/NH/Loudon.html

Coronaviruses are by definition highly contagious, so for adequate prevention and control one must have high biosecurity standards both for vehicles and livestock. This report does not indicate the source of infection for this 4-H piglet but I would suspect that it was probably via some 4-H get-together, possibly with animals. But there must already be PED infected pigs in that part of New Hampshire/Rhode Island/Massachusetts. We can expect further reports.

However I have had a comment from a friend and colleague in Loudon: "We know that farmer. She's right in our town and views her operation as a petting farm and source of entertainment rather than the farm she tries to portray it as, while offering cattle rides and bringing pigs to such places as the State House for everyone to pet and hug. She lets parents have photo ops of their little kids in the pen with her breeding sow, hosts numerous events at her farm letting random people tromp around, spreading no telling what." So there was no security and the PED outbreak was just a matter of time. Take note, this farm acquired the infection somehow, somewhere, but now there may well be more. - Mod.MHJ]
