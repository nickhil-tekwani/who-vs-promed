In the Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, 4 people were hospitalized with botulism after eating homemade canned mushrooms at a dinner in the city of Lebedin.

According to the medical director of the Clinical Center for Infectious Diseases and Dermatology, Krasovitsky Irina Trotskaya, 2 victims were hospitalized at the Center for Infectious Diseases in Sumy and 2 remained to be treated in the city hospital. She notes she only had 1 dose of antibotulism serum, which was administered to a 44-year-old woman who was the sickest. The 2nd patient of the center went to the doctor too late, and the serum would not have helped him. The other 2 had to purchase the antitoxin on the private market outside the region as there was none to be found in the hospitals, nor in pharmacies. The Ministry of Health must import the consignment from abroad, register it in Ukraine and distribute it.

So far in 2021, Ukraine has reported 80 foodborne botulism outbreaks involving 89 patients, including 3 children. In most cases, botulism in Ukraine is due to the consumption of dried and salted freshwater and sea fish (40%), but other products, often canned food made at home or bought in unauthorized places can also be vehicles for this toxin-induced neurological illness.

[The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin from inadequate preparation, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile injections in illicit drug users. - Mod.LL
