The health authorities of the Catalan municipality of L'Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona) notified on Friday [10 Aug 2018] that 5 people are suffering from [legionellosis] in the wake of an outbreak whose origin they are already investigating.

There are 4 men and one woman between 59 and 80 years old. Four of them have required hospitalization, of whom 3 have already been discharged and one remains hospitalized, although [the patient] shows good progress, reports El Periódico.

[Legionnaires' disease is a pneumonia caused by several species of _Legionella_, a Gram negative bacterium. Legionella can also be acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols or aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as very debilitated people; possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gonçalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016;374(5):497-498 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). Most healthy people exposed to legionella do not get sick. People 50 years or older are at increased risk of getting legionnaires' disease.

For 2011-15, 4 European countries (Spain, France, Germany, and Italy) accounted for 70.3 per cent of all reported cases of legionnaires' disease within all 28 EU member states plus Iceland and Norway, although their combined populations represented only 49.9 per cent of the study population (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.27.30566).The age-standardized incidence in 2015 for Spain was 2.12 and for Europe as a whole, 1.3 per 100 000 individuals (https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/AER_for_2015-legionnaires-disease_0.pdf).

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 5 patients will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.

Molecular typing of environmental isolates of legionella can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain and comprises 4 provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. L'Hospitalet de Llobregat is a Catalan town with a population of 252 171 in 2015 immediately south west of Barcelona (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Hospitalet_de_Llobregat).
