[In the Philippines, regions are administrative divisions that serve primarily to organize the provinces of the country for administrative convenience. Currently, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions (16 administrative and one autonomous) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_the_Philippines). Bicol is a region (Region V) in the Philippines encompassing the southern part of Luzon Island and nearby island provinces (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicol_Region). Davao (Region XI) is situated at the southeastern portion of Mindanao (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_Region). Soccsksargen is a region (Region XII) located in south-central Mindanao (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccsksargen). The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao is an autonomous region located in the Mindanao island group (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Region_in_Muslim_Mindanao).
