Deadly 1918 virus resembled common swine flu
A frozen corpse and preserved samples from victims of the 1918 flu epidemic
that killed up to 40 million people worldwide show the virus resembled the
common swine flu, scientists reported Monday.
Tissue samples from three people who died in the epidemic have provided
enough genetic material to allow researchers to sequence, or map, one key
gene of the virus, a team from the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "The
existing strain to which the 1918 sequences are most closely related is
A/Sw/Iowa/30, the oldest classical swine flu strain,'' the scientific team,
led by Ann Reid and Jeffrey Taubenberger, wrote.
Researchers have been eager to discover what made the 1918 strain of flu so
different -- and so deadly. "The influenza pandemic of 1918 was
exceptionally severe, killing 20 to 40 million people worldwide, with
unusually high death rates among young, healthy adults,'' the team wrote.
Scientists also wanted to know where the virus originated because that can
help doctors understand how best to fight the disease. But scientists
investigating the 1918 flu were stymied in part by the difficulty of
finding viable samples from people who have been dead for more than eight
decades.
Last year a team tried to get samples from people buried on the Norwegian
island of Spitzbergen, but they found the bodies were buried above the
permafrost and the tissues were not well enough preserved to provide good
genetic samples.
The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology team used samples from the body of
an Alaskan Inuit who was buried in permafrost on the Seward Peninsula and
tissue preserved in formaldehyde from a 21-year-old soldier who died at
Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and a 30-year-old who died at Camp Upton, New
York.
They managed to sequence the entire gene from the samples for
hemagglutinin, a protein the influenza virus uses to infect the cells
scientists look at first to determine a flu strain.
Often, the virus passes from birds to pigs, where it takes on
characteristics that make it easier to pass to humans. The
Reid-Taubenberger team said it is not yet clear whether the 1918 virus came
to people straight from birds or passed through pigs first -- or whether it
passed from people to pigs.
They noted that there had been an outbreak in the spring of a mild flu,
followed by an outbreak in the autumn among pigs and then the killer
epidemic in people. "This sequence of events supports the theory that the
1918 influenza spread from humans to swine,'' they concluded.
