An 18-year-old young man died due to a hantavirus [infection], regional chief of Epidemiological Surveillance Ruben Castillo stated on Thursday [4 Apr 2019].

"We have registered on week 13 the death of a patient, an 18-year-old young man. Regrettably, this would be the 1st fatal hantavirus [infection] case notified for this year [2019]," he told the reporters, without giving the name of the victim.

According to Castillo, the patient went to a government health center in the Villa Tunari municipality with symptoms of a febrile situation, apparently in a terminal state. He said that the preliminary information about the case determined that the youth had experienced a health problem for nearly a month. Also, he mentioned that the central Cochabamba department registered 7 laboratory-confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections]. "Of these, the 7 have emerged without any problems. Many had acquired the disease in their 'chaco' [the area around their village], as they call it, while working in an endemic area," he said.

The authority stated that the register of hantavirus [infection] cases in the Cochabamba tropics is related to an outbreak "that has us worried," so preventive tasks are being done for control.

[Unfortunately, the specific circumstances under which this youth or the previous 2019 cases acquired their infections is not mentioned. Presumably they were in contact with excreta from infected rodent hosts. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur in the Bolivian tropics, including Cochabamba department. The specific hantavirus involved in these or previous cases in 2013 or those in 2012, in Bolivia, is not given. In the lowland Amazon basin of Bolivia, the hantaviruses that are likely to be in tropical Cochabamba department that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases are Laguna Negra viruses with its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_, the small vesper mouse (https://www.flickr.com/photos/cdtimm/4367939127/in/photolist-otqNuS-EwTizo-7DYQ8i-278Fjfq-owyXyD-osEZQs), and _C. callosus_, the large vesper mouse (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html), and Rio Mamore virus with _C. laucha_ and _Oligoryzomys microtis_, the small-eared pygmy rice rat (https://www.reservacostanera.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/colilargo-menor-oligoryzomys-flavescens2-JGV-e1298896507790.jpg). - Mod.TY
