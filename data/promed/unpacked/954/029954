I do not have any information regarding fireblight in Australia, but if my
memory serves me correctly this refers to a bacterial disease of fruit trees.
It was sometimes called "anthrax of fruit trees"; the etiologic agent was
determined to be _Erwinia amylovora_.

The Ministry of Agriculture has dismissed Australian suggestions that the
finding of fire blight in Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens by a New Zealand
scientist might be sabotage.
MAF's Chief Plants Officer Richard Ivess said there was no doubt that the
discovery by HortResearch scientist Dr Chris Hale was genuine and legitimate.
"Dr Hale is a highly reputable and respected scientist and world expert in
fire blight, whose interest is purely scientific."
Mr Ivess said it appeared some sectors in Australia were attempting to turn
what was a scientific and technical issue into a political one.
In answer to calls from some quarters across the Tasman for Dr Hale to face
legal action, Mr Ivess queried on what grounds this could be taken. "The only
thing he did which might be remotely unlawful was to prune a few centimetres
of dead wood from a common cotoneaster in a botanic garden. I wonder how many
other people have taken healthy clippings from much rarer trees to plant in
their gardens.
"To try to charge him for that would be like charging someone for double
parking when they've stopped to assist at an accident," Mr Ivess said. "The
Australians should be grateful that someone who is an expert in this disease
spotted it so that they can now take steps to control or eradicate it."
He added that Dr Hale broke no New Zealand laws, because he declared the
plant material to MAF's Quarantine Service officers as soon as he stepped off
the plane.
Dr Hale, who was on holiday at the time took samples from trees which he
believed showed symptoms of classic fire blight and brought them back to New
Zealand for tests, which proved positive. The find took Australia by
surprise, because it has declared that it is free of the disease and does not
accept apple exports from New Zealand, a country which does have the
disease.
Despite strong positive results in New Zealand, the Australian tests had
shown less conclusive results. Mr Ivess said this was probably because the
bacteria which cause fire blight become dormant during the winter, making it
much more difficult to isolate them.
Mr Ivess said following the Melbourne results, he was in Adelaide on other
business and on 11 May had taken a clipping himself from a cotoneaster in the
botanic gardens with fire blight-like symptoms. He had informed the
Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and with their consent
had brought this clipping back to New Zealand for tests, which showed signs
of the disease but were in conclusive. Australian officials also took
samples from the Adelaide botanic gardens for their own tests, the results of
which are not yet known in New Zealand.

OUTCOMES OF CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE MEETING - 19 June 1997
TESTS CONFIRM FIRE BLIGHT IN ADELAIDE AND MELBOURNE BOTANIC GARDENS.
At today's meeting in Melbourne, the Commonwealth/State/Industry Consultative
Committee on Fire Blight reported that test results from Australian and
German laboratories have confirmed the presence of the fire blight bacterium
_Erwinia amylovora_ in three samples from the Botanic Gardens in Melbourne
and one from the Adelaide Botanic Gardens.
Laboratory inoculation tests today show that one of the cultures from the
Melbourne gardens and one from Adelaide gardens cause fire blight symptoms in
pear seedlings.
However, surveys throughout Australia have failed to detect fire blight in
commercial orchards, nurseries and other urban areas.
A low number of suspect samples from all States were submitted for
laboratory testing and so far have proven negative.
The committee agreed on further on-going stringent surveillance and testing
for fire blight and is currently planning a national survey program for
spring 1997
Given the survey results from this year and previous years the Consultative
Committee considers that the risks of movement of disease on fruit harvested
this season is very low and will recommend to State authorities that
interstate bans on the movement of apples and pears be lifted.
Whilst fire blight has not been detected in nursery stock, the committee
considered the potential risk of spreading fire blight through the movement
of nursery stock is higher than for fruit and the States are therefore urged
to give consideration to the criteria for interstate movement.
The committee agreed to continue the containment and eradication strategy.
The committee stressed that fire blight poses absolutely no health risks.
