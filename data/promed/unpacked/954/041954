The New South Wales Health Department, Australia, is investigating an
apparent outbreak of psittacosis in the Blue Mountains, a bush land
area adjacent to national parks 100 km to the west of Sydney. A
review of the medical records of patients presenting to local
hospitals has shown that compared with previous years, there has been
a substantial increase in cases of pneumonia among local residents
since mid-March 2002.
A team is investigating the outbreak to determine its etiology,
cause, and the best prevention strategies. From 1 Mar 2002 to date,
approximately 80 cases of pneumonia in people aged 15 to 75 years who
live in the Blue Mountains without underlying chronic lung disease or
heart failure have been identified through active surveillance of
physician and hospital records. These cases have been asked to
provide convalescent serology for testing for a range of infections,
including psittacosis.
Preliminary serological testing on 21 cases using Chlamydia genus IgG
and IgA EIA followed by microimmunofluorescence shows presumptive
evidence of psittacosis in 16 cases. [Neither the height of the
antibody titers nor whether acute and convalescent antibody changes
occurred are given - Mod.LL] Testing for other pathogens is ongoing,
but to date none have been detected. Further laboratory tests have
been arranged on the other cases identified.
Many cases report spending time gardening, but few report contact
with pet birds. Further epidemiological and environmental studies are
underway. A case control study is planned to better identify risk
factors and inform prevention strategies.
In the meantime, the local public health unit has issued
precautionary warnings that people in the area avoid contact with
birds, and that they use face masks and gloves when gardening with
materials that may be contaminated with bird droppings, including
pruning, clipping, lawn mowing, or handling mulch.

[Infection due to _Chlamydia psittaci_, also known as parrot fever,
is a zoonosis. It is sometimes referred to as ornithosis, since many
birds other than psittacine birds (such as parrots and parakeets) may
spread the infection to man. It seems that all species of birds are
susceptible to infection, and poultry can be an important reservoir,
particularly turkeys. Non-avian strains of _C. psittaci_ can be
spread from cattle or sheep to man, albeit uncommonly.
Infection in man is usually spread via the respiratory route through
contact with infected birds, their discharges, or dust. Individuals
at highest risk, therefore, include bird owners, pet shop workers,
veterinarians, and abattoir employees. However, exposure can be more
trivial, such as visits to public parks containing birds, and in as
many as 25 percent of cases no direct avian link can be found. In
this presumptive outbreak, the vehicle for transmission seems to be
aerosolization of contaminated soil.
The presentation of this infection in man can be nonspecific, with a
spectrum ranging from a mild viral-like syndrome to a more severe,
typhoidal illness. Symptoms of an atypical pneumonia with fever,
cough, and headache and a chest radiograph showing a pneumonic
infiltrate more prominent than expected on physical examination.
Enlargement of the liver and/or spleen can be useful diagnostic
findings. Serologic diagnosis has drawbacks, but a MIF IgG antibody
of at least 1:32, a 4-fold antibody rise, or a MIF IgM of at least
1:16 with a compatible clinical illness fit the USA CDC surveillance
definition. Complement fixation antibody titers are only
genus-specific and therefore do not distinguish _C. psittaci_ from
_C. trachomatis_ or _pneumoniae_ - Mod.LL]
