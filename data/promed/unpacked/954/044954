A heifer herd of 250 animals, 15 months old, in General Lavalle,
Cordoba Province, were grazing a low salinity pasture of natural
forage supplemented with maize meal. Over a period of about 20 days,
animals were dying acutely with enlarged livers and blood
extravasations from natural openings (mouth, vagina, anus). Some
animals were noted to have haematuria, raising the suspicion that it
was either leptospirosis or bacilliary haemaglobinurea.

Liver samples were sent for analysis, and _Bacillus anthracis_ was
cultured, sensitive to the following antibiotics: penicillin,
tetracycline, tilmicocina, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacine; it was
resistant to trimetroprima. The animals had not been vaccinated
against anthrax. To date, 12 have died.

The carcasses were incinerated promptly. The people dealing with the
disposals were wearing protective clothing and successfully avoided
personal contamination.
