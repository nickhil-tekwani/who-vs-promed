Farmers have lost an estimated 1703 cattle and game valued at NGN 13 million [USD 82 600] to rabies during the period 2008 to 2012. This came to light following a recent survey conducted by the chief veterinarian of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry, Dr Emmanuel Hikufe. Hikufe presented his findings last Monday during the opening of the 3-week Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (FELTP) workshop currently underway in Swakopmund.

Hikufe said human and animal rabies is increasing every year. "This clearly indicates how ineffective the current control programmes are," he said. He explained that a significant number of dogs have rabies, hence the high transmission rate of the disease to humans and wild animals. "A large number of cattle and game, especially kudus, died of rabies during the period under review, which resulted in a huge loss of income to farmers," he said. He went on to say that most human and dog deaths due to rabies occurred in the northern communal area, especially the north-central regions.

According to Hikufe, children in the age group 0-16 are the most affected, representing 83 percent of all deaths reported. He says the time has arrived to establish a national rabies committee comprised of all relevant stakeholders. "Once the committee is established, a more aggressive national rabies control strategy should be formulated and fully implemented to intensify public awareness about rabies," he said. He further noted that a strict, unified policy should be developed to control stray dogs, and an annual budget for rabies control activities should also be created. "An effective rabies control strategy will prevent deaths, especially among young children, and prevent loss of livestock and income for farmers," he said.

[Namibia has experienced through the years several massive outbreaks of rabies in kudu antelopes. During 2008/2009, the number of dead antelopes due to rabies was estimated to reach 20 000. Similar outbreaks were observed in earlier years, with the largest one during the years 1977-1985, when an estimated loss of 30-50 000 antelope (20 per cent of the population) was reported, apparently involving oral spread of rabies infection between individuals (Ref 1).
