A disease caused by a parasite and transmitted by the bite of the sand fly [leishmaniasis] is spreading rapidly in the city of Raqqa, Syria. Raqqa is the putative capital of the caliphate proclaimed by ISIS in the territory it controls in Syria and Iraq.

The Express, a British media outlet, reports today that leishmaniasis is becoming widespread amid the loss of medical personnel and the lack of medicine.

This is not the 1st report from the Middle East about the increase in leishmaniasis cases. In Nov. 2014, a paper titled War and Infectious Diseases: Challenges of the Syrian Civil War was published on PLOS. The authors note that the illness has been endemic in parts of Syria for decades. It is emerging in Lebanon, with over 1000 cases reported in 2013. Most were in refugees from Syria.

In January 2015 the Independent ran an article titled "Washington warns 'perfect storm' of conditions leaves Isis-controlled Iraq and Syria vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious disease." The piece notes that nearly half of all Syrian hospitals have been closed or damaged. In regions controlled by ISIS, health care workers have left and the supply of critical medicine is dependent upon agencies such as the Iraqi Red Crescent.

Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine [Houston, Texas], is quoted by the Independent at describing the Syrian leishmaniasis outbreak as "out of control."

Treatments exist for leishmaniasis but are highly dependent upon the species of the parasite and the form the illness takes. In addition, the various medications used may be affected by supply issues.

The CDC states: "In general, all clinically manifest cases of visceral leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis should be treated, whereas not all cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis require treatment ... The treatment approach depends in part on host and parasite factors. Some approaches/regimens are effective only against certain Leishmania species/strains and only in particular geographic regions."

The city of Raqqa lies in ruins, despite its role as the capital of the Islamic State. A coalition of nations has been using air power to strike ISIS units and the damage from the ISIS conquest of the city has never been repaired. The Express report suggests that as many as 2500 cases of leishmaniasis may have been contracted in the city and its environs.

It remains unclear if the illness is affecting ISIS fighters. It is clear that civilians in the territory of the caliphate, in refugee camps and along the front lines of this ongoing war have little access to needed medical care. The growing number of cases of leishmaniasis is symbolic of all the other medical woes that the population is suffering.

[The paper discussing the conflict in Syria mentioned here is: Sharara SL and Kanj SS. War and infectious diseases: challenges of the Syrian civil war. PLoS Pathog. 2014,10:e1004438. Another paper in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases also predicted a sharp increase in leishmanaisis in Syria (Petersen et al. Infectious disease risk from the Syrian conflict : Latest outbreak news from ProMED-mail. International Journal of Infectious Diseases 2013;17:e666-e667).

It is not surprising that leishmaniasis is increasing in Raqqa, and the report underlines that disease control and treatment of sick people is not ideal in this part of Syria. The situation is very much comparable to the alarming increase in the numbers of leishmaniasis cases and lack of treatment in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime (reported also by ProMED; see archive references below).

In the newspaper article it is speculated whether leishmaniasis also affects people fighting for ISIS; there is no reason to believe it will not. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers from Europe and the US were infected, and people fighting for ISIS will probably be more exposed to sandfly bites than people living in towns like Raqqa. - Mod.EP
