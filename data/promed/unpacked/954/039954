Two more polio cases have surfaced from Landikotal tehsil in Khyber tribal district, after which the number of reported cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reached 4 this year [2020].

According to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), a 2-year-old [male child] from Nekikhel and another child from Torwela have been diagnosed with polio. The samples of these 2 children were sent for laboratory tests in 2019, so these cases will be counted in the tally of 2019, which stands at 141 now.

The 2 cases in Landiktoal were reported 2 days after the emergence of 3 new polio cases in Qambar, Dadu and Sajawal districts of Sindh. Among them, 2 children contracted the crippling disease in 2019, but the cases were confirmed on Friday [24 Jan 2020].

On [21 Jan 2020], the 1st case of polio in Pakistan in 2020 surfaced in Lakki Marwat, the district with the highest number of cases in 2019.

The year 2019 was worse for Pakistan in polio eradication efforts, as 141 cases surfaced in Pakistan, including 96 cases in KP. Most cases in KP surfaced in Lakki Marwat, where 32 children were diagnosed with the crippling disease. In 2018, only 12 cases were reported, while in 2017, 8 cases were reported.

Currently, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 countries in the world which have not fully eradicated polio. The main cause behind the emergence of so many polio cases is refusal of parents to cooperate with the vaccination teams. According to media reports citing Health Ministry data, over a million parents refused to cooperate with vaccination teams in 2019. Most of the refusal cases were reported in April last year [2019] when rumours spread in Peshawar that many children had fainted after consuming vaccination drops. A total of 1 089 087 parents refused to give vaccination drops to their children in 2019.

The emergence of so many polio cases in Pakistan, particularly in KP, has brought the federal and provincial governments under pressure over their performance and strategy to control the spread of disease.

Experts believe that polio vaccination efforts cannot succeed completely until the refusing parents are convinced to cooperate with vaccination teams.

[The End Polio Pakistan website has not added all of the media reported cases as yet, so it's a bit difficult to follow at times and know which cases were 2019 onset and which were 2020 onset. The above media report clearly states 2019 onset and puts the tally for 2019 as 141 cases, but the media reports from Friday's [24 Jan 2020] report is less clear (see Poliomyelitis update (10): global, Pakistan (BA, SD) 20200124.6911971).

Polio cases have reached 4 this year [2020]. Two cases were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 2 from Sindh, and in 2019, the total numbers of cases reported were 139. An official from the Emergency Operation Center (EOS) said that both the cases from 2019 were reported from Sindh.

An 8-year-old boy, resident of district Qambar, got infected with the contagion but died before the diagnosis. A 24-month-old infant from district Dadu, Tehsil Johi is diagnosed with the contagion. All cases of polio came from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A child of 42-months, resident of district Sajawal, became handicapped as a result of the virus. Officials from KPK said that they were receiving reports [from] 2019 in 2020. National Coordinator of EOS Rana Safdar said that 3 polio drives have been initiated to address the problem.

[As I said above, it becomes harder to distinguish and reconcile the national figures. The summary is basically that there is continued circulation and transmission of the WPV1 in Pakistan, most recently in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. We await the official confirmations to clarify the actual 2019/2020 divisions. - Mod.MPP
