Epidemiology:
Austria is currently experiencing the longest outbreak of mumps since
mumps vaccination was first introduced into the national immunisation
programme in 1974. A total of 87 cases have been reported. The main
affected provinces are Kaernten (known in English as Carinthia,
located in southern Austria), Niederoesterreich and Wien (both in
northeast Austria). The age group most affected is people between 18
and 30 years old.
The provincial health authorities in Karnten were informed of an
increased number (n=16) of cases of mumps in adolescents and young
adults aged 16-20 years that occurred in 5 neighbouring health
districts in Kaernten in April and May 2006. On 22 May 2006, the
Austrian Agency for Health of Food Safety's department for infection
epidemiology was asked for help to investigate a temporal and
geographical cluster of mumps. As mumps is not a notifiable disease
in Austria, data protection issues have hindered the investigation of
this outbreak, and active case finding by personal interviews of the
87 passively ascertained cases was not possible.
By 14 Jun [2006], 47 cases of mumps from 5 neighbouring districts in
Kaernten had been serologically (blood samples) confirmed in the
national reference laboratory in Vienna. Data on possible or probable
cases are not yet available. In 2 further Austrian provinces local
medical laboratories have noticed an unusually high number of mumps
cases since April 2006 (18 cases in Niederoesterreich and 13 cases in Wien).
By 14 Jun [2006], there were 2 serologically confirmed cases of mumps
meningitis, 5 serologically confirmed cases of orchitis, and one
serologically confirmed case of pancreatitis, and another case
involved a pregnant woman.
Investigation:
After the first alert in Kaernten, mumps information sheets (one type
for healthcare providers and another type for the affected
population) were disseminated to local physicians and hospitals in
the 5 districts. The local physicians and hospitals were asked to
complete a questionnaire which, despite data protection requirements,
should enable a proper case series investigation. Currently,
demographic data, clinical onset, case classification (possible,
probable or confirmed case), complications (such as meningitis and
orchitis), admission to hospital and history of mumps infection and
mumps vaccination is being collected. In order to identify sources of
infection and people at risk of mumps infection, data are being
collected on contact history between 25 and 14 days before clinical
onset (swelling of one or more salivary glands) and between the 2
days before clinical onset and the 9th day after clinical onset
(period of infectiousness).
Initial analysis of case data suggested that there could be a link
between the initial cases in Kaernten, namely attendance at an Easter
festivity on 16 Apr [2006], which may have been the occasion on which
the mumps virus was introduced to a community with a high proportion
of susceptibles. We hypothesise that adolescents and young adults
born before 1994 have either not been vaccinated or have been
vaccinated with one dose only.
Routine vaccination programmes and current responses:
The bivalent mumps-measles (MM) vaccine was introduced in Austria in
1974, and was replaced in 1994 by the trivalent mumps, measles and
rubella (MMR) vaccine. Reliable data on vaccination coverage for MMR
in Austria are not available.
Since 31 May [2006], MMR vaccine has been offered to the population
of these 5 health districts by local health authorities, physicians
and hospitals. Between 500 and 600 people have so far been
vaccinated. The vaccination campaign is being publicised in the media.
Further information on the outbreak will be provided when it becomes
available..

[As mentioned by Mod.CP in the earlier posting on this outbreak (see
below), there has been a recent resurgence of mumps in young adults
in several parts of the world, most often related to inadequate
vaccination (either a history of a single dose of vaccine, or a
history of no vaccine). The above discussion on the demographics of
the outbreak seems to further support this observation. One suspects
that once all of the epidemiologic data are in, the findings will be
consistent with high attack rates in incompletely or never vaccinated
individuals.
