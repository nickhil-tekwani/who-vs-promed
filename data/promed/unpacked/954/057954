Re: ProMED-mail Foot & mouth disease, bovine - Kazakhstan: OIE,
Request for information 20100622.2086
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to ProMED-mail's request for information regarding the
serotype involved in the FMD outbreak in bovines, reported by the
Kazakh Veterinary Services to the OIE on 17 Jun 2010, we have
received the following information from a reliable source:

1. The outbreak is caused by serotype O.
2. Samples have been sent to ARRIAH (Federal Centre for Animal
Health), OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central
Asia and Transcaucasia in Vladimir, Russia, for further typing.
3. No FMD vaccinations have been performed during 2010, prior to the
outbreak, in the affected region Aqmola.
4. FMD vaccinations are normally carried out on a seasonal basis:
young ruminants being vaccinated during autumn, and adult cattle during winter.

[Since, reportedly, samples have been dispatched to the OIE Ref Lab
(ARRIAH), it is anticipated that gene sequencing will be carried out.
Its results, and in particular the relationship of the Kazakh isolate
to the serotype O strains currently circulating in China, South
Korea, Japan, and Mongolia, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
