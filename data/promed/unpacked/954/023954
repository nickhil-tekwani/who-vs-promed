The Preventive Medicine Department under the Ministry of Health reported the deadly mosquito-borne disease [Japanese encephalitis, JE] has claimed 32 lives out of 705 reported cases in the country so far this year [2014].

Over the past week alone, an additional 19 cases have been reported. Son La topped the list of provinces reporting fatalities with 18, followed by Hanoi and Bac Giang with 4 each. Provinces with the highest number of diagnosed cases are Son La, Hanoi, Thai Binh and Ho Chi Minh City.

So far this year [2014], Japanese encephalitis has spread to 39 provinces and cities, affecting 203 people, killing 3. This specific variant of the disease has been concentrated in Son La (36 cases), Hanoi (22 cases) and An Giang (10 cases).

Viral encephalitis, including Japanese encephalitis, is dangerous because it often is deadly and commonly results in severe brain damage. Children under 15 years of age are particularly vulnerable to contracting the disease. In severe cases, a person is likely to experience high fever and symptoms related to the central nervous system.

The MoH warned that to prevent the disease, people should keep their environment, their houses and farms clean to prevent mosquitoes and should sleep in areas protected by mosquito-nets.

They should always maintain good personal hygiene, wash hands often with soap and water and properly cook food and boil all drinking water.

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease, said the MoH.

[Viet Nam is well within the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) endemic area of Southeast Asia. As indicated in a GIDEON summary of the disease posted on 18 Jun 2010 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20100618.2051), Japanese encephalitis was 1st reported in Viet Nam in 1960. Most cases of Japanese encephalitis in Viet Nam occur in the south during the rainy and early dry season, and in the north during late summer and autumn. Nationally, 73 per cent of the population lives in areas of risk.

Viet Nam has had active JEV transmission and human cases again this year [2014]. The virus reservoirs are wild birds, especially ardeids, and pigs may act as amplifying hosts. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors of the virus often have extensive breeding areas such as rice fields, making vector control difficult. As stated in the report above, vaccination is an effective way to prevent JEV infection, but no mention is made of recent vaccination campaigns in high risk areas. The 8 Aug 2014 report stated that in preventing JE, the National Extended Vaccination Program and the local Health Department have decided to vaccinate all the children under 15 that have yet to receive vaccination against JEV in Son La province (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140807.2669178).
