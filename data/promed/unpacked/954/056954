Health authorities are warning people to take care in spas after seven
Melbourne boys caught hepatitis A in a domestic spa [hot tub].
The cases, believed to be the first involving a domestic spa, involved boys
aged between eight and 15 who attended a party in the eastern suburbs after
a football club function. One of the boys became ill on the night [?] and
tests revealed he had hepatitis A, which causes severe inflammation of the
liver, resulting in tell-tale jaundice (yellowing of the skin and
especially of the eyeballs), nausea and, often, acute fever.
A Human Services Department medical officer, said the boys were "whale
spitting" in the spa - taking mouthfuls of water and spitting it at one
another.
He said this was more likely to have been the transmission route rather
than sharing food and drink because 10 young females at the party who did
not enter the spa were unaffected. The adults present and another 10 young
males were also unaffected.
The state's chief health officer, Dr. Graham Rouch, said the sick boys had
broken one of the cardinal rules of spa and pool safety: not swallowing the
water.
"Inevitably they would have swallowed some water. Spas are fairly
high-risk venues and not easily or frequently well-managed and ... even a
domestic spa can be a problem", Dr Rouch said.
"The public health message is that spas do provide an environment for
potential health problems." The pool had been treated with hydrogen
peroxide, but Dr. Rouch said spas had to be regularly monitored to ensure
that whatever disinfecting system used was working because the high
temperatures and bubbling effect dissipated some chemicals such as chlorine
much faster.
The incidence of hepatitis A [in Australia?] has dropped from about 2000
cases a year in the 1960s to 370 this year. It is most commonly
transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the infection getting onto
fingers and hands and then being swallowed. Young children are
particularly susceptible.
Dr. Rouch said the seven boys affected in the spa would [be] ill for
several weeks, but then would be immune from the disease - unlike hepatitis
B and C, which have long-term consequences.

[For information on the dangers of Spas and Hot Tubs
<http://www.q-et.net.au/~legion/Legionnaires_Disease_Spas_Hot_Tubs.htm

Aside from an indication that one boy became clinically ill on the night of
the party, we have no information about the time of onset for these cases.
We presume that the boy who became ill "on the night" might be the index
case, but cannot rule out other common source(s) from the information
provided. Presumably, the investigation is ongoing. - Mods.CHC/ES]
