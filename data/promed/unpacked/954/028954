[Since the reported start of the FMDV serotype O
epizootic in China, 9 outbreaks, involving
bovines (cattle and buffaloes), small ruminants
(sheep and goats), and swine have been officially
reported from 6 provinces. The provinces, and
their respective reported start dates, were the
following: Guangdong (22 Feb, 4 Mar); Gansu (14
Mar, 7 Apr, 17 Apr); Shanxi (25 Mar); Jianqxi (28
Mar); Guizhou (13 Apr); Ningxia (23 Apr). A map,
showing the scattered locations of all 9 outbreaks, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>.
The exact location, and time frame of the 2nd
outbreak in Guangdong is somewhat ambiguous; see
the final commentary of this posting, at the bottom. - Mod.AS]

[Subscribers are encouraged to visit the web-site
of the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for the
genotyping results of the other 13 Hong-Kong
samples, showing that this epizootic is being
caused by virus(es) of the FMDV serotype O,
Mya-98 topotype. This topotype has been
identified, since 1998, in several
south-east-Asian countries. The report includes
also a dendogram, showing the relationship of the
current HK isolates to earlier strains from the
region. According to the WRL quarterly report
Oct-Dec 2010, FMDV O SEA topotype (Mya-98
lineage) has been detected in samples from
Myanmar and Malaysia in 2009. See also Ref 1.

There is no 2010 notification from the Hong-Kong
authorities on FMD on OIE's web-site. However,
follow-up report No 1, submitted by China on 12
Mar 2010, included information on FMDV in swine
in Longcheng, Longgang, Shenzheng, GUANGDONG
(1108 susceptible animals, 69 cases, 1108
culled). The included map seems to indicate that
the location of the said farm is within the territory of Hong Kong; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9023>.
Hong-Kong has served, for decades, as a useful
sentinel for FMD in China, with a commendable
record of samples submissions to the WRL
(Pirbright). The continuation of this tradition
of transparency, aa apparent from the above WRL report, is relieving.

It is also relieving to note that a sample from
cattle, collected on 08 Apr 2010 in South Korea,
has already been submitted to the WRL and
genotyped; see the Genotyping Report, dated 12 April 2010, at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000H%20O%20South%20Korea%202010.pdf>
According to the results of this test, the South
Korean strain is closely related to the Hong Kong
strain (5 of the Chinese isolates found closely
related -- 99.06 percent -- to the S. Korean
isolate). It will be interesting to note if the
Japanese virus is similarly closely related to
these strains. Hopefully, samples from Japan have
been submitted; their genotyping will allow the
completion of the epidemiological picture.

A recent FAO press release included the following
statement: "The routes taken by the virus have
not been identified, but experts say it is
possible the infection occurred through food
waste, with pigs eating infected meat scraps.
Understanding how biosecurity breaches occurred
is important to prevent similar events elsewhere" (see at
<http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/41702/icode/>. - Mod.AS]
