Health officials in Malaysia are showing concern over the increases in cases of the "monkey malaria" _Plasmodium knowlesi_ in humans in recent years, according to a Sun Daily report today [2 Mar 2014].

University of Malaya Department of Parasitology consultant Datin Dr Indra Vythilingam said the number of cases had increased significantly since 2004. "We have seen a lot of people with monkey malaria," she told the Sun today [2 Mar 2014].

_Plasmodium knowlesi_, often considered the 5th human malaria species (along with _P. falciparum_, _P. vivax_, _P. malariae_ and _P. ovale_) because it has been seen in humans, is still mostly known as a malaria of macaques in southeast Asia, where 78 percent of the monkeys tested were positive.

In 2011, in a paper published in the journal PloS Pathogens, researchers from Malaysia and London warned that this species of malaria, most frequently seen in macaques, could eventually target humans. Researchers at the time were concerned about this huge reservoir of _P. knowlesi_ in the monkeys and the increasing human populations and deforestation. The Sun Daily reports that in 1992, the parasite only accounted for one percent of reported malarial infections in Malaysia, but cases had increased to 35 percent in 2011.

Malaysian health authorities are taking measures to get the monkey malaria under control. These measures include setting up a surveillance system, an integrated vector management system, early detection and prompt treatment, preparedness and outbreak response, capacity-building, and operational research.

_Plasmodium knowlesi_ is mostly found in Southeast Asian countries, particularly in Borneo, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.

_Plasmodium knowlesi_ is absent in Africa. This may be because there are no long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques (the reservoir hosts of _P. knowlesi_) in Africa, and many West Africans lack the Duffy antigen, a protein on the surface of the red blood cell that the parasite uses to invade. Mosquitoes belonging to the _Anopheles leucosphyrus_ group are known to transmit _P. knowlesi_ from monkeys to humans.

[It is not entirely clear whether this article refers to a percentage increase in the number of _P. knowlesi_ cases or to an increase in absolute numbers. Before 2008, _P. knowlesi_ was diagnosed as _P. malariae_ based on microscopy of blood films. A percentage increase -- as alluded to -- since 1992 is simply a function of the increasing use of molecular diagnostics and may not reflect a real increase.

Infection with _P. knowlesi_ is transmitted from Macaque monkeys, and so far, human-to-human transmission via mosquito is not believed to take place. The Macaque monkeys are not found outside Southeast Asia, and thus _P. knowlesi_ is not found outside the habitat of Macaque monkeys. - Mod.EP
