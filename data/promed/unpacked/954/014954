There are new worries in the region's poultry industry about a deadly
bird disease that has turned up in Delaware.

According to health experts with Mountaire Farms, flocks at about 20
chicken farms in the Seaford and Gumboro areas have been infected
with laryngotracheitis, or L.T. The disease is [caused by] a herpes
virus that is considered highly contagious.

Experts stress the disease is NOT avian influenza.

Poultry companies are vaccinating farms for L.T. in parts of Sussex
County and Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore. A letter to growers from
Mountaire says all farms within 6 miles of those that test positive
for L.T. will be barred from transporting and spreading chicken waste.

A poultry health specialist at the University of Maryland, Nathaniel
Tablante, says the virus does not spread to humans, and chickens
infected with L.T. are safe to eat.

[Laryngotracheitis is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a
herpes virus. This disease most often affects chickens and is rarely
found in turkeys, peafowl, or pheasants.

The virus most often enters a flock by an infected bird that is not
showing clinical signs. Clinical signs include coughing and gasping,
watery eyes, swollen sinuses, nasal discharge, and bloody secretions
from the trachea.

Infected birds have difficulty breathing and stretch their necks
forward in an effort to breathe easier. They often cough and spew
blood. However, the outbreak can be mild and resemble infectious bronchitis.

Incubation has been as short as 2 days but is usually 5 to 7 days.
Recovered birds may be carriers for extended periods. The virus can
be mechanically transmitted by visitors or by equipment. Hence, good
biosecurity of the premises will decrease the chances of allowing
this disease in.

Infectious laryngotracheitis must be differentiated from the
diphtheritic form of fowlpox, especially with tracheal lesions.
Fowlpox virus produces intracytoplasmic inclusions. Some may confuse
the very early stages with Newcastle disease virus infection.

Vaccination may reduce losses, but may not be approved in all states. - Mod.TG]
