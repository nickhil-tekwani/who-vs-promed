Cases of dengue fever continue to increase in Costa Rica
----------------------------------------------------
According to the most recent report from the ministry of health, 12
885 cases of dengue fever have already been registered in Costa Rica,
and the number continues to increase. Eduardo Lopez, vice minister
for health, commented that 38 of the detected cases correspond to
dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]. These numbers are already higher than
those registered for 2002, when 12 251 cases of dengue fever were
recorded, 27 of which were of DHF.

Lopez announced that the country's medical centers receive an average
of 600 new cases each week and that the coastal zones are the most
affected.

The health authorities have expressed their concern that the rainiest
months of the year are still to come.

The number of dengue casualties rises to 6
--------------------------------------------------
Government sources announced that with the deaths of a 6-month-old
girl and a 9-month-old boy, the number of victims of dengue fever in
El Salvador has reached 6.

Herbert Betancourt, minister for health, reported that the children
died in a hospital in the capital, and commented that the last victim
was recorded in March [2003].

Groups of physicians, epidemiologists, and soldiers are carrying out
extensive fumigation campaigns and "home by home" inspections in the
capital, San Salvador, and peripheral areas, where, according to
Betancourt, the largest number of cases (almost 80 percent) is
concentrated. The official also urged the population to collaborate
in the elimination of mosquito breeding sites so that the outbreak
could be controlled.

So far this year [2003], at least 4076 suspected cases of dengue
fever have been registered, among which 1522 cases of classic dengue
fever and 81 cases of DHF have been confirmed.

In 2002, DHF caused the deaths of 9 children and one adult, and more
than 4000 cases of dengue fever were registered.

The authorities in Mumbai have admitted that the dengue situation in
the city is much more serious than previous years. Doctors say the
number of dengue cases has risen in the month of October [2003], and
every day at least one new patient is admitted with the disease.

What's even more alarming is that while 120 dengue cases were
reported [during 2002] there had just been one death. But [in 2003],
187 cases have been reported with 5 deaths.

And it's not just the big hospitals but even small nursing homes that
are reporting a rise in the number of cases. "Statistics may show
that there's been an increase in numbers this month. The
Brihannmumbai Mumbai Corporation is taking preventive steps to
control it," says Dr Prakash Doke, Additional Director Health
Services, Mumbai.

Doctors say the rise in cases points to the dismal state of
sanitation and hygiene in the city. It is also a clear indication of
just how ineffective the BMC's cleanliness drive across the city has
been.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has reported that 9 people have
died from dengue today. While 257 new cases were reported with the
MCD today, the total figure has gone up to 1216 -- with 938 being
reported from Delhi alone.

Officials also confirmed 4 deaths, including that of a physician at
AIIMS, 2 deaths in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, one each from Lok
Nayak Jaya Prakash Narain Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Hindu
Rao Hospital.

In Delhi, South Zone is worse-hit with 163 cases reported, followed
by 108 from Shahdara (South), 106 from Shahdara (North) and 98 from
Civil Lines. Officials confirmed that that there are 2000 suspected
cases admitted in the various government hospitals; they held a
meeting with 28 representatives of various private hospitals and
nursing homes today.

The number of MCD-confirmed cases is equal to the number of cases
confirmed by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, many
doctors in the city are questioning the accuracy of the total cases.

According to NICD sources, the institute received about 1519 samples
as of 14 Oct 2003, out of which 990 were positive. "The government
should send circulars to private labs to report all the positive
cases there. Most of the tests are done in the private labs, as NICD
accepts samples only till 5:30 in the evening and that too on working
days," said a health official.

Though the Delhi government has agreed that there has been a delay in
the response mechanism, the MCD has intensified its power spray and
fogging operations. According to the MCD, about 96 371 houses were
checked for mosquito breeding on 15 Oct 2003 and [mosquitoes were]
found in 332 houses; 238 were served notices and 140 offenders were
prosecuted. [This is a very low house index -- less than half of one
percent -- to support a dengue epidemic. - Mod.JW]

'Unusual' symptoms
-----------------------
Apart from the high-grade fever and other common dengue symptoms, the
doctors in the city are witnessing unusual manifestations in some
patients. On Tuesday, a pregnant woman admitted at LNJP Hospital
presented with symptoms of acute liver failure without a cause. After
investigating the case, doctors found that it was a very rare
manifestation of dengue. The woman was treated and later delivered a
healthy baby. The same hospital had a patient who had developed
severe inflammation in the leg. Investigation showed dengue to be the
underlying cause.

"Some people are coming up with symptoms of acute liver failure,
inflammation of muscles, encephalitis, and cardiac involvement.
Though the cases are rare, [they] still need to be kept in mind,"
said Dr N.P. Singh, nodal officer of the Delhi government. According
to him, doctors need to follow the guidelines laid down. "There is no
need to panic. Transfusion is needed when platelet count is below 1
lakh," he added. [One lakh = 100 000. - Mod.JW]

Nearly 1000 people have been diagnosed with dengue fever in Karnataka
[so far in 2003] and 7 deaths have been reported.

The monsoon has brought the usual spurt in cases, with mosquitoes
that spread the disease breeding in stagnant water. Doctors say there
has been a clear increase in the number of cases admitted to
hospitals in Bangalore this year. The monsoon related increase in
dengue cases should have ended by now, but 197 cases have been
reported in the state in the last month alone. "Definitely this year
there has been a steady increase, and as far as intensive care is
concerned, we really haven't had a respite at all in the last 4
months," says Dr Jose Chacko, Manipal Hospital.
