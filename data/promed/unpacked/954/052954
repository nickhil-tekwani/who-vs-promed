Wyoming state veterinarian, Dr. Jim Logan, has been notified by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory that there is a new case of brucellosis in a cattle herd in Park County, which is in the Wyoming Brucellosis Designated Surveillance Area. Serologic testing at both laboratories has shown reactor level results on 3 animals from one herd. Further testing, including bacterial culture, will be conducted to confirm serology results.

Logan and assistant state field veterinarian, Dr. Thach Winslow, are working with the owner of the infected cattle as well as the owners of 6 contact herds to determine risk levels and conduct an epidemiologic investigation. The herd with known _Brucella_-positive animals is under quarantine at this time, and quarantines will be issued to contact herd owners as the investigation proceeds. Contact herd owners are currently under hold-order movement restrictions, and no sexually intact cattle can be moved until the herd has been cleared by a complete risk assessment and appropriate brucellosis testing is conducted.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause cattle, elk, and bison to abort their pregnancies, typically late term. All of Wyoming's brucellosis cases since 1988 have been determined to have been caused by transmission from infected wildlife to cattle or domestic bison. Wyoming's last cases were found in late 2015, and the last affected herd was released in June of 2017.

For more information, contact the Wyoming Livestock Board field office at 1-307-857-4140.

[The disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ occasionally is isolated from seropositive cows but does not appear to cause clinical signs and is not contagious from cow to cow. In some countries, the disease in cattle is caused by _B. melitensis_. The syndrome is similar to that caused by _B. abortus_. _B. melitensis_ is not present in the USA.

Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some cattle resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows spontaneously recover.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water or may lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the midcervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin in both people and animals.

Efforts are directed at detection and prevention, because no practical treatment is available. Eventual eradication depends on testing and eliminating reactors. The disease has been eradicated from many individual herds and areas by this method. Herds must be tested at regular intervals until 2 or 3 successive tests are negative.

Noninfected herds must be protected. The greatest danger is from replacement animals. Additions should be vaccinated calves or nonpregnant heifers. If pregnant or fresh cows are added, they should originate from brucellosis-free areas or herds and be seronegative. Replacements should be isolated for about 30 days and retested before being added to the herd.

Vaccination of calves with _B. abortus_ Strain 19 or RB51 increases resistance to infection. Resistance may not be complete, and some vaccinated calves may become infected, depending on severity of exposure. A small percentage of vaccinated calves develop antibodies to Strain 19 that may persist for years and can confuse diagnostic test results. To minimize this problem, calves in the USA are mostly vaccinated with a vaccine of Strain RB51. It is a rough attenuated strain and does not cause production of antibodies, which are detected by most serologic tests.

Whole-herd adult cattle vaccination using Strain 19 or RB51 has been practiced in certain high-incidence areas and selected herds in the USA with much success (see https://www.merckvetmanual.com/reproductive-system/brucellosis-in-large-animals/brucellosis-in-cattle).

It is standard for the state veterinarian's office to initiate tracings of the animals moved into a herd (trace- ins) and animals moved out of the herd (trace-outs). It helps determine if the disease was moved into the herd and, if so, which other herds may be infected, or if potentially other infected animals have moved out of the herd to another herd. This can take a bit of time and may or may not uncover other affected animals. We wish them luck. - Mod.TG
