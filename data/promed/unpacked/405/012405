Following reports earlier this year [2008] of rabid skunks
circulating in eastern counties of Colorado, the state lab at the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has confirmed a
rabid skunk in the vicinity of Sloan's Lake in Northwest Denver.
According to epidemiologists at the state health department, this is
the 1st rabid skunk found in the metro area since 1976.

Rabies is a virus that affects the nervous system of humans and other
mammals, resulting in a fatal disease. The virus is shed in the
saliva of infected animals. People and animals get rabies from the
bite of a rabid animal [mammal] or contact with saliva from such an animal.

Testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
determined that the skunk found near Sloan's Lake was infected with a
bat strain of the rabies virus. "This probably means the infected
animal found and ate a rabid bat," said John Pape, an epidemiologist
with the state. "We occasionally find rabies cases in terrestrial
animals that turn out to be infected with a bat strain of the rabies
virus. These are usually isolated incidents with no further spread to
other animals."

"This incident serves as a good reminder that you should keep pets
currently vaccinated and take a few simple precautions to avoid
contact with wildlife," Pape emphasized. Having pets vaccinated is
the simplest and most effective way to protect pets and family
members from this deadly disease. Pet owners are encouraged to
contact their veterinarian and get their pets up to date on vaccinations.

"We have a cooperative surveillance project with local health
departments, animal control agencies and the Division of Wildlife to
track the distribution of the disease," said Pape. "While this was
found because of our increased surveillance for skunk rabies in
eastern Colorado, it is not related to that outbreak. However, we
will increase monitoring of skunk populations in this area to insure
the disease is not more widespread" explained Pape.

Pape said, "Skunks are highly efficient at transmitting rabies to
other animals, much more so than bats."

Cases of bat rabies are reported statewide each year but rarely
result in spillover infection in other animals. To date in 2008, 89
skunks have been tested, and 18 (20 percent) have been positive. Of
308 bats tested, 42 (14 percent) have been rabies positive. A rabid
raccoon and cat also were reported this year [2008] in Kiowa County,
where skunk rabies is known to be circulating.

"People who suspect they or their family members have been in contact
with a rabid skunk or any other rabid animal should consult with
their physician. There is a vaccine that can be used to prevent
rabies in humans who have been exposed to rabies from a wild animal,"
said Dave Cohn, M.D., associate director, Denver Public Health, an
infectious disease physician.

Signs of rabies in animals include abnormal behavior such as
nocturnal animals being active in the day, wild animals approaching
humans or other animals, difficulty with walking or movement and
unusual animal sounds such as excessive bellowing in cows or
hissing/chirping in bats. Some animals with rabies will be very
aggressive (furious rabies) while others may appear almost catatonic
(dumb rabies) [There was even a case of a rabid skunk in California
that was behaving in a friendly manner. - Mod.TY].

Skunks and other wildlife should not be handled or fed. If a wild
animal allows a person to approach and handle it, the animal is
probably ill or injured and will bite in self-defense. A healthy
animal usually will remain well hidden and avoid human contact.
Suspected rabid animals should be reported immediately to local
public health or animal control authorities.

The following precautions should be taken to prevent possible
exposure to rabies:

- Do not feed wild animals as this just brings them closer to your
family and reduces their natural fear of humans.
- Teach children to stay away from wild or dead animals.
- Do not allow pets to roam freely, as this increases the chance they
may be exposed without your knowledge.
- Keep your pet's rabies vaccination current, and maintain vaccination records.
- Contact your veterinarian if your dog or cat is bitten or scratched
by a wild animal.
- If a family member or pet has been bitten or scratched by a wild
animal, if possible, safely contain the wild animal in case rabies
testing is needed. People with possible rabies exposure should
consult with a physician without delay.

[Skunks are particularly dangerous rabies transmitters because they
have large amounts of virus in their saliva and are tenacious biters,
inflicting traumatic wounds. Skunk rabies is concentrated in the
central USA from Texas to Ontario, Canada and in the Central Valley
of California. The bat rabies virus variant was found in the skunk
reported here in Colorado. The report does not mention ongoing
transmission of the bat variant virus by skunks, but that did occur
in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2001. The bat rabies virus variant is found
throughout the continental USA. Articles on rabies surveillance in
the USA, with maps of distribution by reservoir species, and the
Arizona skunk rabies outbreak are cited below.
