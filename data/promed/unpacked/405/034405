Comprehensive prevention and treatment of high fever disease
(highly pathogenic blue ear disease [porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome, PRRS])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the appearance of high fever disease in China in 2006,
outbreaks of this illness have occurred to varying degrees throughout
the country. In 2007, there were signs that the disease was waning,
with some decrease in both morbidity and mortality. But with the
change in weather and renewal of pig herds, transmission of this
illness re-emerged to varying degrees in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and
other provinces. So at this time, in order to prevent unnecessary
losses, all pig farmers are again being warned not to lower their
guard or be careless.

Epidemiology
------------
The illness can infect pigs of any age and size. But looking at the
situation since 2007, young piglets seem to be more susceptible.

Morbidity
---------
In the early phase of the outbreak in 2006, morbidity could reach
80-100 percent and mortality could reach 60 percent and above. But
the situation in 2007 was trending toward improvement, with morbidity
and mortality both declining by varying degrees.

Transmission pathway
--------------------
This disease can be spread via semen and vertically. Contact
transmission is the main means of transmission.

Clinical symptoms and pathological changes
------------------------------------------
Body temperature rises to 40-41 deg C (104-105.8 deg F) and there are
even some cases above 42 deg C (107.6 deg F.) But on some pig farms
where disease occurs pig body temperatures are not high.

In the early stage of illness, pigs secrete clear nasal mucus; in
later stages, purulent nasal discharge. Pigs cough, have difficulty
breathing, and have redness of the conjunctiva.

Cutaneous changes
-----------------
The area of the ears, buttocks, belly, and the skin of other areas
turn purple. In rare cases, there are hemorrhages on the back.

Digestive tract symptoms
------------------------
In some cases there is vomiting, diarrhea, watery yellow stool, and
distended abdomen; or constipation [or] alternating constipation and diarrhea.

Sows [experience] abortions and stillbirths and deliver weak-born
piglets; anoestrus and reduced breeding rate: after delivery.

Piglets squeal, fall, paddle, and die suddenly.

On pathological examination, the kidney has hemorrhages, the heart is
weak, there is pulmonary [hepatisation],[congestion] etc.

Prevention program
------------------
When pigs are brought in from elsewhere, add 150-200 g of Funikang
[soluble chloramphenicol powder], 200 g of Weiduolikang [multivitamin
product], and 100-150 g of APS powder to each ton of feed for 7 days;
after observing stability in the pig herd, vaccinate against hog cholera.

Self-breeding and raising farms
-------------------------------
7 days after parturition, one day before weaning, and 7 days after
weaning use 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg of Saifulong [unidentified
product], respectively, for health maintenance. For post-weaning
piglets add 150 g of APS and 250 g of Saifulong to each ton of feed
for 7 days. Use medicine once again after 20 days.

[The names of Chinese (commercial) drugs have been maintained in the
report above for the sake of authenticity; knowledgeable sources are
invited to explain their meaning.

According to the following information, gathered from various Chinese
sources and kindly supplied by Rapporteur Dan Silver, there are 11
approved suppliers of inactivated highly pathogenic PRRS vaccine in
China and one approved supplier of a live vaccine. All inactivated
vaccines were approved in 2007 under a special measure issued by the
Ministry of Agriculture. Most of the approved suppliers are well
scattered geographically. This seems to be intentional, and it would
suggest that each manufacturer is meant to supply its local province
or region. It is even more likely that each supplier's product will
end up in local markets if local governments are buyers, as appears
to sometimes be the case; however, there seem to be no legislative
restrictions that would prevent a supplier from distributing
nationwide in a commercial fashion.

At least one website says that fake and/or unapproved highly
pathogenic PRRS vaccines are also being sold in China.

An example of user instructions from one supplier was compared to the
instructions from other suppliers; no significant differences were
found. It seems that most, if not all, suppliers of inactivated
vaccine use the same template and information for their IFUs
[instructions for use], with small variations.

There is only one approved supplier of live vaccine; according to its
marketing literature, the live vaccine has "greater than 95 percent
genetic homology to domestic variant strain," referring to the highly
pathogenic PRRS strain in "high fever disease." A later article,
dated September 2007, put the figure at "above 98 percent."

In previous postings we mentioned investigations into the genotyping
of the (most probably similar) Vietnamese PRRS virus, as well as into
its pathogenicity; these studies were, reportedly, undertaken by the
Plum Island (USA) laboratory. Final results of the said
investigation, and/or any additional available data on the Chinese
highly pathogenic PRRS virus, obtained by research institutes in
China or elsewhere, is hereby requested.- Mod.AS
