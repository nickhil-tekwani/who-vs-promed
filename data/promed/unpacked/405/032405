TOXOPLASMOSIS - DNA FINGERPRINTING:REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
==========================================================
Date: Mon, 19 May 1997 09:52:44 -0400 (EDT)
From: on <dmacpher@fhs.csu.McMaster.CA> (Dr. D. W. MacPherson)
We are working on tools which we hope will allow us to genetically
fingerprint isolates of Toxoplasma gondii. We believe that this type of
tool will be useful in investigation of outbreaks, and may also be helpful
in transmissibility studies and virulence studies.
We would like to obtain "isolates" of Toxoplasma gondii from geographically
distinct areas of the world eg. several isolates from varying distances
away from us as possible! We are able to extract DNA from paraffin
embedded, formalized tissue so paraffin blocks or half a dozen ribbons cut
from a paraffin block would be very gratefully accepted. Any tissue source
would be appreciated (cat, human, etc.) with a little information: the
animal source and geographic source of the isolate. All contributors will
be acknowledged in any subsequent publications.
Specimens may be sent to: Dr. D. W. MacPherson
Regional Parasitology Laboratory
St. Joseph's Hospital/McMaster University
50 Charlton Avenue East
Hamilton, Ontario
CANADA L8N 4A6
[Although we don't generally send out requests for specimens, the use of
DNA fingerprinting may become an important tool in outbreak investigation.
Exactly how it will help is an extremely interesting question.
Furthermore, there will be a wide geographic representation, hopefully.
Hence, it will be informative to watch the progress of Dr. MacPherson
research. -Mod. p.c.]
