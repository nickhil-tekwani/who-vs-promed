Dirty or contaminated water was found in tests conducted on samples taken from patients affected by a diarrhea outbreak in New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City, the Department of Health (DOH). Health assistant secretary Eric Tayag reported that of 1212 inmates affected by diarrhea, 220 were hospitalized in the report, and 50 inmates remained in the hospital. The 2 fatalities were a result of dehydration and diabetes.

_Shigella_ species originating from contaminated well water are reported to be the cause based on the results of the evaluation of the microbiologist. Health secretary Paulyn Ubial reviewed the collected samples sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).

[This report suggests that shigella bacillary dysentery was the cause of this large prison outbreak. Cholera was previously suggested to be the waterborne cause.

Clinically, dysentery presents with febrile bloody diarrhea with mucus, whereas cholera generally causes little or no fever and watery "rice water" diarrhea. - Mod.LL
