Ivory Coast Reports Yellow Fever Outbreak
-----------------------------------------
ABIDJAN: At least 16 people have been diagnosed with yellow fever in Ivory
Coast, leading to fears of an epidemic of the deadly mosquito-borne disease,
a health official said on Sat 14 Jul 2001. A spokesman for the West African
country's Public Hygiene Institute told state television that 16 cases of
yellow fever had been diagnosed since late March, mainly in the west of the
country. He did not say if any of the patients had died.
"When there is one case of yellow fever we regard it as an epidemic
situation, given that yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes, which we
have in this environment," he said. "But we do not have an explosive
epidemic as in some other countries."
An outbreak in neighboring Guinea killed nearly 200 people and infected over
20 000 late last year. Ivorian health authorities are planning vaccination
programs in the affected areas, the spokesman added.

[According to a statement from WHO on 31 May 2001, the Ministry of Health of
Cote d'Ivoire had reported 4 cases of yellow fever, which included 3 deaths.
Diagnosis had been confirmed by IgM detection in a sample collected on 23
Mar 2001 from a 17 year-old woman who died 24 Mar 2001. It must be presumed
that a fair proportion of the 16 cases reported now have had a fatal
outcome. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
