The operator of a fan "Voyager of the Seas" Facebook page (not operated by the cruise line) posted the following:

"If you were on the Voyager of the Seas relocation cruise from Singapore to Sydney, and you have a really bad cough, then I suggest you go see a doctor, as you may have whooping cough..."

A large number of passengers have posted comments in response to this post. Many passengers on the cruise say that they are ill. Many people say that they are having their blood drawn and are seeing doctors to have their throats swabbed. Others say that it has been confirmed that they have been diagnosed with whooping cough.

Passengers complain that they have heard nothing from Royal Caribbean. One person who heard back from the cruise line remarked: "I've heard from RC, and they told me they are not compelled to notify all passengers..."

[ProMED would appreciate information regarding what may be an outbreak of pertussis linked to a cruise ship that went from Singapore to Sydney. It would be very interesting to know the demographics of the travelers and their ages, which can help determine whether their past pertussis immunizations were from the better tolerated but with waning immunity acellular vaccine or from the older, more reactogenic but with longer lasting immunity whole cell killed _Bordetella pertussis_ vaccine. - Mod.LL
