[According to the report above, a total of 82 919 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 1 case in the 24 hours since yesterday's (10 May 2020) report. The newly reported case is a single imported case reported by Inner Mongolia. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

There were 15 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, all locally acquired cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 760, and 38 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. The past 2 days have shown an increase in locally transmitted cases both in Hubei province (?and possibly in Wuhan). The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. While there had been locally transmitted cases in both Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, there was one new reported case in Guangdong on 6 May 2020 and 1 report of a case in Heilongjiang today (10 May 2020]. In recent days, there have been clusters of locally transmitted cases in Jilin and a cluster of 5 cases in Wuhan as well of concern. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus has been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

- Of the new cases [35, confirmed yesterday - 10 May 2020], 6 were imported cases; 29 were locally transmitted cases. All 29 local cases are related to the Itaewon nightclub cluster.
-- 20 were persons who visited one of the clubs in Itaewon. 9 were contacts of confirmed cases.
-- 14 additional cases have been confirmed between 0:00 and 12:00 today, raising the total confirmed cases from this cluster to 86.
-- Further efforts to identify contacts, infection sources, and epidemiological investigation are underway.
-- By region: Seoul City=51, Gyeonggi Province=21, Incheon City=7, Chungbuk Province=5, Busan City=1, Jeju Province=1.
-- By chain of transmission: Visitors of Itaewon clubs=63; Contacts (e.g. family, acquaintances, coworkers)=23.

- Noting that anyone who visited any of the nightlife entertainment venues including any clubs or bars from [24 Apr 2020] to [6 May 2020] is likely to have been exposed to the virus, KCDC asked everyone who visited these locations during the above period to:
-- stay home;
-- contact a local public health center or dial 1339 (KCDC call center);
-- visit a screening clinic to get tested, regardless of symptoms.

- KCDC also asked municipal governments and healthcare institutions to actively help such people get tested regardless of symptoms or which specific venue they visited.

- The newly amended COVID-19 Response Guidelines (8th edition) will go into effect today [11 May 2020].
-- The wording in the case definition has been amended to further clarify examples of COVID-19 clinical symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, loss of smell or taste, and pneumonia.
- Recommendation to test following Patients Under Investigation (PUI) more proactively/liberally:
> a person living with a person with COVID-19 clinical symptoms (whether at home or at a facility);
> a person who has come in contact with a household member, friend, or acquaintance within 14 days of their entering Korea from overseas;
> a person who has visited an institution or location where a confirmed case has been found, in consideration of history local transmissions in the community.
-- For discharge criteria for symptomatic confirmed cases, minimum time period has been added.
> Before: discharge from isolation if clinical and laboratory criteria are met
> After: discharge from isolation if clinical and laboratory criteria are met after 7 days have passed since onset of illness

- KCDC released the newly amended "Guidance for Disinfection of Group Care Facilities and Public Use Facilities (Edition 3-2)".
- Alternative disinfection methods using the likes of ultrasound, high-intensity UV irradiation, and LED blue light are not recommended as they have not been proved to be effective and may irritate the skin and respiratory track or cause eye damage. (Also not recommended by US CDC or WHO).
- Indiscriminate spraying of disinfectants in outdoor environment should be refrained, as there is no scientific evidence suggesting effectiveness and excessive use of disinfectant may increase the risk of health problems and environment pollution.
- The guidance recommends that frequently touched indoor surfaces* should be wiped frequently with disinfectants such as diluted sodium hypochlorite (a.k.a. household bleach).
* Such as elevator buttons, hand rails, door knob, armrests, backrests, desks, lighting controls, keyboards, switches, blinds, etc.

- KCDC asked people to be highly precautious as the local transmission of COVID-19 is currently increasing.
- Nightlife entertainment venues such as nightclubs are recommended to refrain from operating in compliance with administrative orders of 8 May. Such venues that must operate against the order must comply with infection control/prevention measures. They must also comply with any additional measures enforced by local municipalities, in accordance with the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act.
> includes prohibition of eating/drinking indoors, mask wearing at all times, designating infection control manager, making a log of all visitors and checking identification card, etc.;
> establishments that fail to comply will face penalties and/or civil damages.

- KCDC requested that the general public carefully follow the 5 Infection Prevention Rules and avoid visiting any place that makes it easy to come in close contact with many people including but not limited to nightclubs and bars.
-- "5 Basic Infection Prevention Rules for Everyone":
-- stay home for 3-4 days if you get sick;
-- keep a distance of 2 arms' length between you and other people;
-- wash your hands for 30 seconds. Cough/sneeze into your sleeve;
-- ventilate your space at least twice a day and disinfect regularly;
-- keep in touch with family and friends while maintaining physical distancing.

- KCDC reminded the public to stay home and not go to work if having fever or respiratory symptoms and to call the KCDC call center (1339 or area code + 120) or contact a local public health center and get tested if having prolonging fever over 38 degrees or aggravating respiratory symptoms.
-- KCDC also asked healthcare institutions to liberally test patients with suspected symptoms.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 27 cases and 2 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (10 to 11 May 2020) when there were 35 newly confirmed cases and 0 deaths. A total of 10 936 confirmed cases and 258 deaths were reported today (11 May 2020), up from 10 909 cases and 256 deaths yesterday (10 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 39 consecutive days and below 50 for 32 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 4 days. Of concern is that all but 5 of the newly confirmed cases were locally transmitted today (11 May 2020) and 6 yesterday (10 May 2020). 12 of the 27 newly confirmed cases were in Seoul, and 4 were in Gyeonggi, 2 were in Daejeon, and 1 each in Daegu, Incheon, Gyeongbuk, Gyeongnam, and in Quarantine. Cases in Daejeon, Gyeongbuk, Gyeongnam, and Quarantine were the imported cases, the remaining 22 cases were locally acquired. Presumably the new cases in Seoul and possibly Gyeonggi are associated with the Itaewon nightclub cluster.

The Itaewon club district in Seoul, had 86 cases now identified (as of 00:00 11 May 2020) associated with the district, including club attendees, and their families and coworkers.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the growing Itaewon nightclub cluster is a major concern at this time. With the outbreak associated with the Itaewon club district in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 219 814 cases, including 30 739 deaths, up from 219 070 cases and 30 560 deaths reported on 9 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 10 and 11 May 2020 was 744 newly confirmed cases, compared with 802 newly confirmed cases between 9 and 10 May 2020 -- a gradual but steady decrease continuing. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 77.2% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 48.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only other province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 9 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 9 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna, is the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 63 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 62 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 109 286 total cases, 6685 deaths
Date: Mon 11 May 2020

Iran on Monday [11 May 2020] warned of a setback in its efforts to contain the novel coronavirus unless health protocols are observed more closely, as it reported 45 new COVID-19 deaths. The southwestern province of Khuzestan has become the new focal point of Iran's COVID-19 outbreak with authorities reimposing strict measures to halt its spread. "We have regressed in Khuzestan due to the increase in hospitalisations and not observing health protocols," Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi said in televised remarks. "This can happen to any other province if we are not careful," he added, noting that tighter measures would be reimposed in other places too if needed.

Authorities have shut down state bodies, banks, and non-essential businesses again in 9 of Khuzestan's counties. Iran's government spokesman Ali Rabiei said "less than 50 percent" of Khuzestan residents have observed health protocols. "We've seen a rising trend of infection and death (in Khuzestan) which shows protocols and social distancing are not being observed," he said in a televised news conference. The health ministry stopped publishing provincial figures for the coronavirus last month [April 2020].

State television aired images on Monday [11 May 2020] showing many maskless residents of the capital out and about. Some of those interviewed explained that they now felt the weather was too hot to wear masks, while others thought the heat could kill the virus.

The new fatalities brought to 6685 the overall confirmed death toll in Iran, according to health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. He also said that 1683 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours, raising the total to 109 286. Out of those hospitalised, 87 422 have recovered so far while 2703 were in critical condition.

Iranian police have shut 1300 websites and arrested 320 people accused of spreading rumours about the virus, state news agency IRNA reported on Saturday [9 May 2020]. They were accused of "disturbing public opinion", the news agency said.

[In the 24 hours from 10 to 11 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 107 603 to 109 286, an increase of 1683 compared with 1383 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (10 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6640 to 6685, an increase of 45 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, the UK, Russia, Italy, France, Germany, Brazil, and Turkey. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature. A caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so relying on the daily number of deaths at this point may be premature as well. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

In other media reports, there is discussion that the president plans on opening all mosques, but ensuring preservation of social distancing:
Iran's Health Ministry has announced details of protocols on the reopening of mosques across Iran ahead of the Qadr nights (Laylat al-Qadr [19 May 2020]) when people stay awake and pray from midnight till dawn. "The health ministry made it clear that social distancing must be observed by worshippers attending mosques. "Qadr night rituals must be held with a limited capacity for worshippers and preferably in open spaces," said deputy health minister Alireza Raisi on Monday [11 May 2020]. He said each worshipper must maintain a distance of at least 1 metre [3 ft] from other people in front, at the back and on the sides. "Those taking part in Qadr night ceremonies must wear masks and gloves, take with them their own prayer mats and copies of the holy Quran," he added. "If the rituals are held indoors, a maximum of 1/4 of the whole space must be used," he said. He noted a maximum 2 hours has been allocated to the rituals on each night. In Islamic teachings, the Qadr night (Laylat al-Qadr) is the night when the holy Quran was 1st sent down from Heaven to the world and also the night when the 1st verses of the Quran were revealed to the prophet Muhammad."

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 385 834, including 81 795 deaths, an increase from 1 367 638 cases and 80 787 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 347 151 (25.1%) cumulative case reports and 1745 (9.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 183 662 as of 9:30 PM on 11 May 2020, including 14 928 confirmed deaths and an additional 5128 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in California (1286 -- 7.1%), Illinois (1266 -- 7.0% of total), New Jersey (1129 - 6.2%), Virginia (989 - 5.4%), Texas (965 -- 5.3%), Maryland (786 -- 4.3%), Ohio (706 -- 3.9%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Georgia. Illinois moved up from number 4 to number 3, and Georgia moved up to number 10.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, UK, Russia, Italy, France, Germany, Brazil, New Jersey, and Turkey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Illinois, 14 Massachusetts, 15 India, 16 Canada, 17 California, 18 Peru, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between Italy and France (it would be number 6).

The US military has confirmed 8046 cumulative cases, with 220 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 11 163 cumulative cases and 211 new cases today (11 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (49 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2973 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (no newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2256 cases (58 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Massachusetts with 669 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Tennessee with 559 newly confirmed cases, Minnesota with 528 new cases in the past 24 hours, and Indiana with 501 newly confirmed cases. 28 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 373 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24-hour period from 10 to 11 May 2020, bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 227 436 [268 143] as compared with 224 390 [262 783] confirmed cases on 10 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 30.01, a continual slow decrease over the past 29 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 30.01 today (11 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 227 436 [268 143] cases, an additional 257 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 20 cases were admitted to ICU (slightly more than half of the number admitted to the ICU on 10 May 2020). 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7325551,43. Castile and Leon, Catalonia, and Navarre, all in the northern part of the country, are the most affected communities by population-based rates. - Mod.MPP]
