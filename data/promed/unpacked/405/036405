Myiasis, the infestation of human or animal tissue with fly larvae
(maggots), is spreading fast among livestock. The government cannot
control it due to lack of funds, according to officials at the Yemeni
Ministry of Agriculture's General Department for Animal Resources (GDAR).

The disease, which 1st appeared in December 2007, has now been
detected in the governorates of Saada, al-Hudeidah, Hajjah and al-Mahwit.

Ghaleb al-Eryani, GDAR's director-general, told IRIN on 30 Mar 2008
that his department lacked the funds to fight the disease and as a
result, surveillance and field teams had been unable to continue their work.

"The allowances of field teams have not been paid, and they will stop
working as of 31 Mar 2008," he said, warning of a disaster should the
situation remain unresolved.

Al-Eryani said his department submitted an emergency plan requiring
750 million riyals [about USD 3 750 000] to the Cabinet early this
year [2008], but the latter approved only 50 million riyals [about
USD 250 000]. "The approved 50 million-riyal budget has not even been
paid, and we are fighting myiasis using funds allocated for
veterinary campaigns in 2008," he said as he appealed to
international organisations to assist Yemen in fighting the disease.

According to al-Eryani, pesticides and anti-parasite medicines should
be sprayed fortnightly, but this was not happening, as the field
teams had run out of pesticides.

"This is the 1st time we have encountered such a disease, and we are
fighting it without experience. It is beyond the resources of Yemen," he said.

According to the latest GDAR figures, the number of villages affected
by myiasis was 3413, while the number of affected animals cured was
16 750. The animals include goats, sheep, cattle, camels and donkeys.
Some 464 animals have died of the disease.

Some 16 795 barns have been sprayed since the outbreak of the
disease. There are 42 field teams in the 5 infected governorates, but
those operating in Saada have stopped working since 14 Mar 2008 for
lack of funds, according to GDAR.

According to GDAR, Yemen has 15 million sheep, 1.4 million cattle and
250 000 camels.

Khaled Saeed, in charge of surveillance in al-Hudeidah Governorate,
told IRIN a child was recently infected with myiasis in the
governorate. Eight people have contracted the disease since December
2007. No one has died.

Saeed said the productivity of infected animals decreases, as they
recover very slowly. He added that another consequence of the disease
was rising meat prices.

Saif al-Bahri, a field surveillance officer at GDAR, said field
workers were at increasing risk from the anti-myiasis pesticides, as
they are not provided with safety equipment. "They are at risk of
nasal sinus inflammation, skin eruption, and asthma. Some of the
field workers have been infected," he said.

The disease is curable. Al-Bahri said "It is cured normally through
removing the maggots and antibiotics. The period of treatment ranges
between one and 2 weeks. If the infected person is left without any
treatment, the disease might kill him" [An official medical
confirmation of the mentioned human cases will be helpful. - Mod.AS].

Al-Bahri further said the beginning of summer and the rainy season
presented an opportunity for myiasis to spread rapidly. "If myiasis
infects monkeys, it will be difficult to control, as it is difficult
to control these animals. There are a lot of monkeys in the
mountains," he told IRIN, adding that many dogs in some of
al-Hudeidah's districts had been infected.

Outbreaks of Old World Screwworm (OWS) have been reported in western
Yemen, in February 2008, near the border area with Saudi Arabia and
across the relative green upland areas of the country.

The OWS fly causes myiasis, a disease caused by the fly's larvae
feeding on the host's necrotic or living tissue, and which may affect
both humans and animals. Within Yemen, the affected areas hosts
almost 50 percent of the total animal national stock, estimated at 15
million sheep, 1.4 million cattle and 250 000 camels.

The recent events in Yemen are of direct relevance to all the
countries in the Arabian Peninsula as there is mounting evidence of a
progressive spread of OWS, across the Middle East. Incursions of OWS
have been reported in Bahrain in 1977, in Oman in 1983, in the United
Arab Emirates in 1988, in Iran in 1994 and in Iraq in 1996. This
spread is possibly related to a combination of factors including
movements of people and livestock, land use and climatic change.

In an effort to contain the spread of the disease, the Yemen General
Directorate for Animal Resources launched a swift, rigorous
insecticidal campaign in the affected areas. The Ministry of
Agriculture and Irrigation requested FAO assistance in order to
evaluate the OWS epidemiological situation. FAO, together with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and in collaboration with
the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development (AOAD), provides
technical support, mainly in risk assessment and entomological
aspects. FAO initiated the production of OWS risk maps, in
collaboration with the Universit Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. The 1st
generation of these maps has been meanwhile made available to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of Yemen. Further FAO support
aims at training of national staff in OWS risk assessment and
modeling, epidemiology, and ecology. Training materials and teaching
aids regarding screwworm fly ecology, behavior and control are made
available to assist technical staff.

At some stage in the future, the OWS infestation in the Middle East
may perhaps be contained by means of the Sterile Insect Technique
(SIT) application. Given the trans-boundary nature of the problem, it
is in the interest of Yemen, the Middle East region as a whole, and
the international agencies AOAD, IAEA and FAO to closely follow the
events and work together involving all relevant disciplines.

[Old world screwworm (OWS) is a disease caused by _Chrysomya
bezziana_, a fly which is an obligate parasite of mammals during its
larval stages. OWS is one of the internationally reportable diseases
included in OIE's list of MULTIPLE SPECIES DISEASES. The
internationally agreed requirements pertaining to OWS are specified
in article 2.2.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Larvae
feeding on the skin and underlying tissues of the host cause a
condition known as wound or traumatic myiasis, which can be fatal.
Infestations are generally acquired at sites of previous wounding,
due to natural causes or to animal husbandry practices, but they may
also occur in the mucous membranes of body orifices.

Female flies are attracted to wounds at the edges of which each
female lays an average of 175 eggs. The larvae emerge within 12-24
hours and immediately begin to feed, burrowing head-downwards into
the wound. After growth involving 2 moults, the larvae leave the
wound and drop to the ground into which they burrow to pupate. The
duration of the life-cycle off the host is temperature dependent,
being shorter at higher temperatures, and the whole cycle may be
completed in less than 3 weeks in the tropics.

Treatment is generally effected by application of organophosphorus
insecticides into infested wounds, both to kill larvae and to provide
a residual protection against re-infestation. Preventive measures
include the spraying or dipping of susceptible livestock with
organophosphorus compounds and, more recently, use of avermectins as
subcutaneous injections to animals "at risk." Strict control of the
movement of animals out of affected areas also acts as a preventive measure.

For further information, subscribers are referred to CHAPTER 2.2.8.
of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
Animals, available on-line at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00047.htm>.

The confirmation of the presence and spread of OWS in Yemen by FAO
should ring alarm bells in the Middle and Near East; a map,
presenting the distribution of predicted OWS risk for livestock in
the area, based on eco-climatic suitability, is available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/foto/2008/OWS_map.gif>.

Last but not least: the absence of an official report by the Yemenite
authorities to the OIE, which is definitely required according to the
stipulation of the Animal Health Code, is rather concerning. When
submitted -- hopefully, at the soonest -- confirmation or otherwise
of the above rumors on the possible infestation of various animals
species, such as dogs and monkeys, as well as of humans, is
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
