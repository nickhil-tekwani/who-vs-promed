A mystery illness is wiping out up to 80 percent of adult oysters along French coastlines in the latest plague to hit the embattled molluscs, which are struggling to cope with global warming.

For the past month, oyster farmers have watched powerless as their shellfish have died in droves with experts at a loss to explain the causes.

"In some areas, 50 to 80 percent of saleable oysters aged between 2 to 3 years have died out," said Olivier Laban, president of the shellfish producers' federation of Arcachon-Aquitaine, western France.

"We have no idea what the origin of this blight is," he told Le Figaro.

Tests are underway at Ifremer, France's marine research institute, with samples taken from oysters along the West coast and the Mediterranean.

"All the samples show mortality rates that are higher than normal," said Tristan Renault, mollusc specialist at Ifremer.

University of B.C. researchers are a step closer to eradicating a parasite that has been killing oysters infected with the dreaded Denman Island disease on the West Coast.

The researchers announced Thursday [25 Jul 2013] that they have captured the elusive _Mikrocytos mackini_, a parasite that infects mainly Pacific oysters and leads to unsightly green lesions and death of the shellfish. It was welcome news to the province's multi-million-dollar oyster industry.

Harmless to humans, the Denman Island disease, which is caused by the _M. mackini_ parasite, was 1st detected on the island in 1960. But until now, researchers have been unable to study the parasite because they can't grow it in a Petri dish.

"_M. mackini_ has eluded capture for more than 50 years because it lives inside the oyster's cells and has proved impossible to grow and study in a lab," said Patrick Keeling, a professor in UBC's botany department, who led the microbial investigative team.

The research team, from UBC and the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, isolated the parasites from infected oysters and analyzed their genes using sequencing technology.

Keeling said while his team is studying the parasite from a biological and evolutionary perspective, the hope is that the data will be used by other scientists to study how to treat the disease.

For example, Keeling said they already know that the parasite doesn't use oxygen, and with that information, they can compare it to other organisms with similar traits, such as giardia, a parasite that lives inside the intestines of infected humans or other animals.

"There might be similar treatments, drugs that are used against these things that don't use oxygen," he said.

Details of the findings were published in the journal Current Biology.

Keeling said the _M. mackini_ is part of a group of amoebae called Rhizaria that was discovered only a few years ago.

"These parasites have an extremely reduced metabolism. They can't survive in oxygen, and its mitochondria -- or cellular powerhouse -- can't produce energy, so they probably steal most things from the oyster host in order to survive," he said.

Denman Island disease makes oysters unappealing, but it is not considered a health threat. "The issue is that (the disease) makes the oysters unsellable because they look gross," he said.

Roberta Stevenson, executive director of the B.C. Shellfish Grower's Association, welcomed the UBC research as another step in learning how to better detect the Denman Island disease. But she said the industry has not had to deal with a case of Denman Island disease in 20 years. Stevenson said oyster seeds, or larvae, imported mainly from Hawaii, Washington and Oregon, are screened for all known diseases, including the oyster herpes virus that crippled France's industry 2 years ago. "By no means is (the Denman Island) disease a threat to our industry," she said, adding that she is looking forward to seeing whether the UBC research will lead to eradicating the disease from B.C.

For now, she reminded consumers that while the disease sounds scary, it only kills oysters, and there is no threat to humans.

[The 1st article is very sad indeed. The picture contained on the original news article is quite disgusting and sad. This is sad for the fate of the oysters and for the predicament of those whose livelihoods depend upon the oysters.

The 2nd article very encouraging news and a great piece of science to identify and grow the culprit of the disease.
