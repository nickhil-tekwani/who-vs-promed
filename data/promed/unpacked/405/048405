I would like to comment on the post written on Thu 6 Jan 2010 (Typhoid
fever update 2010 (01): tourists, Nepal).

First of all, without the results of proper investigation, testing and
diagnosis, it may be premature to suggest that one particular Jewish
canteen in Pokhara, Nepal is the cause for this disease. Enteric fever
is rampant in Nepal, and without a thorough investigation, it may be
unfair to label one center as the source.

Secondly, I would like to comment on some of the statements made.
Constipation used to be thought as more common in enteric fever than
diarrhea. This may no longer be accepted on the basis of a large case
series, including work from South and Southeast Asia, including our
own data. A recent report from our group based on a large cohort of
over 600 culture proven patients studied in Nepal showed that diarrhea
is a common presentation in enteric fever. The same large study also
showed (contrary to what is stated in one part of the write up) that
paratyphoid is not any less aggressive than typhoid fever. In our
report and in other reports, it is becoming clear that there is an
enormous overlap between the clinical syndromes caused by typhoid and
paratyphoid fever. Paratyphoid fever should no longer be considered a
more mild form of enteric fever.

The presence of paratyphi A in Nepal, India, Indonesia and China,
representing up to 50 percent of enteric fever cases, is now well
documented and was 1st publicized as far back as 1995. We have seen
several cases of paratyphoid A enteric fever that have been evacuated
to Bangkok hospitals from Nepal who had current _S._ Typhi vaccines.
Also, it has been our impression that Israeli tourists are usually
vaccinated with Ty21 or Vi vaccines before leaving home. It would be
very interesting to know what salmonellae were identified in the
patients reported recently.
