Agromod Produce, Inc. of McAllen, Texas is recalling all papayas,
because they have the potential to be contaminated with salmonellae,
an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in
young children, frail, or elderly people, and others with weakened
immune systems. Healthy persons infected with salmonellosis often
experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting,
and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with salmonellae
can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing
more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (that is, infected
aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.

Fresh, Whole Papayas were distributed nationwide and to Canada
through retail stores and wholesalers.

Agromod is recalling all Blondie, Yaya, Mananita, and Tastylicious
Brand papayas sold prior to 23 Jul 2011. Each Blondie Brand papaya can
be identified by a blue and orange sticker label with green and white
lettering on the fruit that states Blondie 4395 Mexico. The Yaya Brand
Papayas can be identified by a yellow, red, orange, and green label
with white, green, and red lettering that reads Yaya Premium Papayas
Yaya PLU-4395 Mexico. Each Mananita Brand Papaya can be identified by
a green, yellow, and red sticker label that states Mexico Mananita
4395. The Tastylicious Brand Papayas can be identified by a white and
blue sticker with red and white lettering that states 4395
Tastylicious Mexico.

The papayas were imported from Mexico and are possibly linked to 97
reported cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona, including 10
hospitalizations, in 23 states throughout the USA. Recent sampling by
the FDA found the outbreak strain in 2 papaya samples collected at
Agromod Produce, Inc. location in McAllen, TX and at the USA border
destined for Agromod Produce, Inc. The shipments that tested positive
with the outbreak strain were not distributed in the USA. Distribution
of the product has been suspended while FDA and the company continue
their investigation as to the source of the problem.

This recall is being made with the knowledge of the US FDA.

Consumers who have purchased the Blondie, Yaya, Mananita, and
Tastylicious Brand papayas are urged to return it to the place of
purchase. Consumers with questions may contact the company at (800)
385-7658, Monday-Friday 10:00 am-5:30 pm CST.

The papaya (from Carib via Spanish), papaw, or pawpaw is the fruit of
the plant _Carica papaya_, the sole species in the genus _Carica_ of
the plant family _Caricaceae_. It is native to the tropics of the
Americas, and was first cultivated in Mexico several centuries before
the emergence of the Mesoamerican classic cultures
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carica_papaya).

The fruit do not grow off the branches of the plant like apples and
citrus fruit do, but rather in a pattern reminiscent of coconuts as
can be seen at
http://www.traditionaloven.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/pawpaw_tree.jpg.
Despite the method of growth, by virtue of growing above the ground
(unlike cantaloupe), the outside of the fruit requires falling to the
ground to be contaminated from tainted water or fertilizer or by
beginning contaminated later during the route from tree to table. The
pathogens subsequently contaminate the edible inner flesh of the
papaya from cutting through the outer skin.

The papaya is referred to as pawpaw in Australia. In the USA, pawpaw
(_Asimina_) also known as a prairie banana, Kentucky banana, or Ozark
banana, is a genus of 8 or 9 species of small trees with large leaves
and fruit, and is native to southeastern North America. The genus
includes the largest edible fruit native to North America. However,
this fruit is not related to the pawpaw described in the article
above, associated with the salmonella outbreak. - Mod.LL]
