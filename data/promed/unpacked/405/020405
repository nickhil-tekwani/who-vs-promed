Chicken livers contaminated with _Salmonella [enterica_ subtype]
Heidelberg have now sickened 179 people in 6 states, the CDC reported
Tue 22 Nov 2011. That is 22 more cases in 4 more states than the CDC
reported 9 Nov 2011.

The kosher broiled chicken livers, sold by Schreiber Processing Corp.
of Maspeth, New York, under the MealMart brand, were recalled 8 Nov
2011. The chicken livers had been distributed to New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Florida.
Customers may have incorrectly thought the word "broiled" in the label
meant the chicken livers were ready-to-eat, however they were not
fully cooked, the CDC has speculated.

In its latest report on the outbreak, the CDC said New York has now
identified 99 cases of salmonellosis linked to the chicken livers, New
Jersey has confirmed 61 related cases, Pennsylvania 10, Maryland 6,
Ohio 2, and Minnesota 1. Those ill range in age from younger than 1 to
97 years old. Median age is 13. Of 126 people whom CDC has information
about, 25 have been hospitalized. The illnesses began in March 2011
and continued through October 2011.

In August 2011, the CDC noticed a "sustained increase," about 30 to 40
cases per month since June 2011, in the number of _S._ Heidelberg
isolates with the outbreak strain reported by New York and New Jersey
to PulseNet, the national foodborne illness surveillance system. Those
states typically report only about 5 cases of _S._ Heidelberg a
month.

New York City conducted an enhanced epidemiologic investigation, which
traced the source of the outbreak to the chicken livers. Lab tests in
New York then identified the outbreak strain in samples of the
MealMart chicken livers and in chopped liver made from the MealMart
chicken livers.

Consumers should discard any of these chicken liver products still in
their homes, the CDC said. It also advised that chicken livers should
be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees and when partially
cooked chicken livers are repackaged for sale, retailers should
clearly label them as requiring further cooking.

[The number of cases identified in this outbreak has increased by 22
and more states have been involved but most of the cases have been in
New York and New Jersey. It is not clear how many cases occurred
because the livers were thought to have been adequately cooked despite
the labelling and how many occurred because the product had been
repackaged without the needed warnings or were already transformed into
chopped liver. - Mod.LL]
