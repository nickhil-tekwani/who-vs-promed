Avian Botulism Season Begins In Earnest
In the last month, confirmed or suspected mortality in migratory water
birds due to avian botulism has been reported to the US National Wildlife
Health Center from over 30 sites in 10 states by wildlife personnel from
both federal and state agencies. North and South Dakota have the greatest
number of die-offs and the greatest number of birds affected. Avian
botulism is occurring at some sites in this prairie pothole area where it
has not occurred for the past several years. Other states with mortality
in migratory water birds due to avian botulism include Nebraska, Kansas,
Montana, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Washington, and California. The primary
species affected are dabbling ducks such as green-winged teal, mallards,
and northern shovelers. Coots and a variety of shorebird species are also
affected. The total mortality reported to the Center to date from these
die-offs is approximately 40,000 birds and mortality is ongoing at most of
the sites. National Wildlife Health Center personnel assist wildlife
biologists by providing technical assistance in the management of avian
botulism and diagnostic evaluation of carcasses collected during outbreaks
to confirm a cause of death.
