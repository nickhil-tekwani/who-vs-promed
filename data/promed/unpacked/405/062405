Glomerella leaf spot -- a new disease affecting Golden Delicious apples in NY?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Delicious trees in Hudson Valley Lab research orchard are yellowing and defoliating. Upon closer inspection, it may not be physiological leaf blotch (necrotic leaf blotch or Golden Delicious leaf blotch), but a fungal disease, glomerella leaf spot.

Look for dead spots on leaves with a concentric ring pattern. If you are seeing the symptoms you may want to consider an application of fungicide to slow it down, especially on late-maturing apple cultivars. Golden Delicious, Gala, Pink Lady, Goldrush, and Pristine cultivars are known to be susceptible. This disease can result in fruit rots, as well!

[2] Bitter rot, lenticel infections - Michigan

Lenticel infections and bitter rot of apples
--------------------------------------------
Two relatively uncommon diseases of apples, lenticel infection and bitter rot, show up in the stressful weather conditions of 2012 in Michigan.

One type of disease appears as numerous small, dark spots, arranged somewhat uniformly on the skin surface. Initially, the spots are quite shallow, but over time they often become wider and deeper into the fruit. These infections are more common on the side of the fruit receiving direct sunlight. Isolations from these tissues show a range of fungi such as _Cladosporium_ and _Alternaria_; all of these fungi are generally considered to be weak. We hypothesize that the combined heat and sunlight weakened the lenticels of the skin, allowing the pathogens to colonize the area. No spray program is particularly effective against lenticel spot.

Bitter rot, caused by the closely related fungi _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ and _Colletotrichum acutatum_, can also show up in hot years. Bitter rot spots usually appear on the side of the apple directly exposed to the sun. Lesions are light to dark brown, flattened, and may have a pink, slight orange to light tan mass of spores. Flattened and concentric lesions are characteristic of this disease. The disease overwinters in dead limbs and mummified fruit. Large diameter wood from pruning should be removed from the orchard to minimize the spread of the disease.

[Both glomerella leaf spot and bitter rot of apple and pear are caused by _Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_) and/or _C. acutatum_. Different strains can affect either leaves or fruit or both (see link below).

Symptoms on leaves include irregular spots. Every leaf of the tree can be affected and trees may be completely defoliated by harvest leading to loss of vigour and reduced yield. On apple and pear fruit, the fungi cause flattened rotting areas, often with concentric rings of spores, which may lead to serious yield losses before and after harvest. The pathogens are also responsible for anthracnose diseases of a range of other tree crops.

On woody species, the fungi generally have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs, fallen leaves and mummified fruit, which are often the main sources of inoculum for such crops. Spread may occur with infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect and human activities), and water splash. Disease management may include fungicides and phytosanitation to reduce inoculum.

_Cladosporium_ and _Alternaria_ species reported above in lenticel infections have more often been reported in association with minor fruit rots, including core rot.
