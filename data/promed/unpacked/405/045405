Government of Canada identifies new strain of influenza
-------------------------------------------------------

****It is not a new strain of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 flu virus
currently circulating in Canada.
****There is no evidence that this new human strain of the virus is
present in the herd of swine.****

The Government of Canada is working closely with the Province of
Saskatchewan to assess the public health risk from a new strain of
influenza that has been detected in the province. The new strain was
detected in 2 workers on a hog farm in Saskatchewan. The workers
suffered only mild illness and have recovered fully. A 3rd case is
under investigation. Scientists at the Public Health Agency of
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg have determined
that the new strain is made up of genes from human seasonal flu and
swine flu viruses.

"We are working closely with the province of Saskatchewan to learn as
much as we can about this new flu virus," said Health Minister Leona
Aglukkaq. "Preliminary results indicate the risk to public health is
low and that Canadians who have been vaccinated against the regular,
seasonal flu should have some immunity to this new flu strain."
Initial testing of some of the pigs on the farm suggests they were
infected with swine influenza A virus, a common flu found in herds of
swine.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with
Saskatchewan public heath officials on further surveillance of workers
in Saskatchewan's hog industry, including those on the affected farm.
PHAC is prepared to provide field epidemiological assistance to
Saskatchewan. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is providing
advice to the province on swine herd surveillance. CFIA is also
providing further diagnostic support to the initial testing performed
by the Province at the national reference laboratory in Winnipeg.

"As required under the WHO's International Health Regulations, Canada
has notified the WHO about the detection of this novel influenza
virus," said Dr. David Butler Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health
Officer. "The Government of Canada remains vigilant and we will
continue to keep Canadians informed of any new developments."

New flu virus attacks Sask. hog barn workers
--------------------------------------------
Health and veterinary officials on Tuesday [7 Jul 2009] reported that
2 hog barn workers had been ill with a new strain of flu. Both
recovered and animals in the barns were healthy, officials said. Dr.
Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer, stressed
that the virus identified was "non-pandemic," adding that the 2
workers did not contract the H1N1 swine flu virus currently in the
news. Officials could not say how the workers came to contract the new
virus, but said they had not been outside of the country. A 3rd worker
may have also contracted the same new strain, they added. According to
McKinnon, the workers experienced mild flu-like symptoms about 2 weeks
ago and they were tested at the time to determine if they had
contracted [pandemic H1N1 2009 virus]. McKinnon said the lab results
revealed something different and unusual. Further examination
determined that a new strain of flu had emerged.

These events do happen, and they do happen occasionally," McKinnon
told reporters at a news conference in Regina. "In the current
heightened scenario, we've picked this one up. It will probably not
transmit. It will probably go no further than it's gone already. "This
happens every now and again with influenza viruses." The fact that
workers associated with the pork industry contracted the virus was
noted, but officials said the animals and the food were fine.

"These animals are healthy when they go to slaughter," Dr. Greg
Douglas, chief veterinary officer for the Saskatchewan ministry of
agriculture, told reporters. "All the checks and balances are in place
to make sure that we keep this confined."

McKinnon said the virus may have been a "one-off" event, noting that
laboratories have not come across any other examples of the strain
detected."In the past, most of these events do not end up transmitting
from human to human, and result in what's called a dead end," McKinnon
said.

McKinnon said that workers associated with the barns, which are
located in eastern Saskatchewan, will be administered general flu
shots. It was believed that the current seasonal influenza
immunization would be effective against the new strain. Officials said
the virus was still being investigated and hesitated before giving it
a name. McKinnon finally settled on "non-pandemic influenza A virus."
"It does have the potential, possibly, of being a new virus that
spreads," McKinnon noted. "That's why we have put in all these
measures and will be extremely careful and vigilant about what's
happening here."

John LaClare, president of Big Sky Farms, confirmed Tuesday [7 Jul
2009] that the affected workers came from that company's barns, but
declined to say which one. The company operates 45 hog barns across
Saskatchewan. LaClare repeated the observations of health and
veterinary officials that the flu identified did not affect any
animals. "2 of our workers have been confirmed to have experienced the
novel, non-pandemic influenza A virus," LaClare said on Tuesday. "Both
received treatment, have returned to work after a complete recovery
and there's no evidence of the virus in any of our hogs. It's a flu
virus," LaClare added. "Viruses circulate all the time and I think it
would be very difficult to track down the actual cause and not a good
idea to speculate at this point where it might have come from."

[These reports do not identify the new influenza A virus virus as the
H1N1 serotype. As the current seasonal influenza virus vaccine is
predicted to have some protective value, it must be presumed to be the
H1N1 (or H3N2) serotype. The affected persons are all workers on the
same hog farm, but so far the animals are not known to be infected
with this virus. Its origin has not been determined, But it appears
not to be directly related to or derived from the pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]

[It is unfortunate for the swine industry that another virus is
associated with these animals. It is important to realize this is NOT
a food safety issue. - Mod.TG]
