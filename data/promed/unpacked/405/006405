[David Lennette was kind enough to let us know of the death of his father,
Edwin H. Lennette, M.D., Ph.D. and provided the information below. - CHC]
Edwin Lennette died of respiratory failure (following surgery) on 1 Oct
2000. His long career included leading the Viral and Rickettsial Disease
Laboratory (VRDL) of the California Department of Public Health (later, the
Department of Health Services) to become one of the premier diagnostic,
training, and research laboratories while he was its director.
Dr. Lennette was born in Pittsburgh, PA on 11 Sep 1908, and grew up in that
city. He attended the University of Chicago, earning a B.S. degree in 1931,
and a Ph.D. degree in 1935. His Ph.D. degree is believed to be the first
awarded specifically in the field of virology. He completed an M.D. degree
at Rush Medical College (of the University of Chicago) in 1936. Following
his internship in Chicago, he spent brief periods at the Pathology
Department of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO and
at the Rockefeller Foundation laboratories in New York City. The
International Health Division (IHD) of the Rockefeller Foundation then
assigned him to spend most of the WWII years in Brazil, working on yellow
fever and encephalitis viruses. In 1944, the IHD transferred him to work on
hepatitis and encephalitis at their laboratory in Berkeley CA. This
laboratory was transferred to the California Department of Public Health,
and is where he returned as its second director in 1947, following an
unproductive year as chief of the Medical-Veterinary division of the Army
facility at Fort Detrick MD.
During the next 31 years, he led this laboratory to become world-renowned
as a training laboratory as well as a leading laboratory for the diagnosis
of viral and rickettsial diseases. The VRDL, as it was known, also
conducted substantial programs of research on Q-fever and arthropod-borne
encephalitis, polioviruses and other human enterovirus infections, and the
role of viruses in causing human cancer. Many of the people trained at the
Berkeley VRDL went on to become leading scientists and administrators of
laboratories and health agencies around the world.
During this era, Dr. Lennette not only published many scientific papers,
but also edited several books that became classics in their field. He also
served as a consultant to many government agencies, and participated in too
many advisory committees to mention.
After his retirement from public service in 1978, Dr. Lennette went on to
serve as President of the California Public Health Foundation. He also was
acting director of the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center in Lake Placid NY
during 1981 and 1982.
An oral history of his career was completed in 1986, and the transcript was
deposited in the Regional Oral History Collection of the Bancroft Library
at the University of California, Berkeley. At the time of his death, Dr.
Lennette was working on a manuscript about the history of the development
of diagnostic virology.

[This is a sad day for me and, I am sure, many others. Edwin Lennette was
an occasional contributor but strong supporter of ProMED-mail. I met him
many years ago, long after he had become a legend in virology. His books on
diagnostic procedures, written with Nathalie J. Schmidt were standards and
have been updated by both Dr. Lennette and Dick Emmons, who worked with Ed
for many years.
I was in awe of Ed Lennette at first and, although he put me at ease
immediately, I remained in awe of him. His encyclopaedic recall was
wondrous and his insights remarkable. To the end he stood tall for
knowledgeable and insightful process, as opposed to technical procedures,
relied on by so many in the rapidly moving field of diagnosis. Whenever, as
Moderator for Virus Diseases of ProMED-mail, I commented harshly about an
organization misinterpreting or overinterpreting its own data, suggested a
different, albeit "old fashioned", method, or simply said someone was
wrong, I could expect a telephone call or e-mail from Ed saying,
essentially, "Right on, baby."
At least as much as I enjoyed hearing about his experiences, rereading his
early papers with Hilary Koprowski, Bill Hammon and many more of the
founding fathers of virology, I enjoyed his company. Great sense of humor,
socially adventurous, generous of his time, patient with young people,
through sorrow and disappointments Ed Lennette maintained his love of life.
Ed Lennette was one of the great people in my life and in the lives of many
others. To say that he already is missed is a gross understatement. -
