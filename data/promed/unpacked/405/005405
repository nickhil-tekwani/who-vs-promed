[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 26 newly confirmed cases in China, 1 of which was imported and 25 acquired locally (22 in Beijing municipality, 3 in Hebei province). While there is no mention of association with the outbreak in Beijing, Hebei province has had locally acquired cases previously associated with the outbreak ongoing in Beijing. No new deaths were reported. One new case was reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1869 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 2 were imported. There were 2 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time, and 2 cases were reported on 14 and 18 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 48 cases with no new deaths, compared with 67 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (19 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 72 consecutive days. Today's (20 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 40 cases were locally transmitted and 8 were imported. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (16), Daejeon (10), Gyeonggi (8), Gangwon-do (2), Dae-gu (1), Gwangju(1) and Chungnam (1). Imported cases were in airport quarantine (4), Gyeonggi (2), Seoul (1), and Gyeong-do (1). Note that 8 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases (same as yesterday, 19 Jun 2020).

The impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. That said, it looks as if the proportion of locally acquired cases is decreasing daily, and provinces outside of Seoul, Gyeonggi and Daejeon have seen little local transmission.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 238 275 cases, including 34 610 deaths, up by 264 cases and 49 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (19 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +251 cases and 47 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 157 newly confirmed cases, down from 216 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4914_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4914_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (165) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 9 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), with only 4 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Emilia-Romagna 28 cases, Piedmont 27 cases Lazio 14 cases and Liguria 10). The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 47 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 31 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 202 584 total cases, 9507 deaths
Date: Sat 20 Jun 2020

Iranian health authorities Saturday [20 Jun 2020] announced more than 100 new deaths from coronavirus and another 2000 cases of the illness, as the country's fight against the pandemic entered its 5th month. Iran reported its 1st coronavirus cases on 19 Feb 2020, and it has since struggled to contain the outbreak, the worst in the Middle East. The Islamic republic's official figures have shown an upward trajectory in new cases of infection since early May 2020.

Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said there were 115 fatalities in the past 24 hours, bringing the country's death toll to 9507. There were also 2322 new cases of infection, with the total number of confirmed cases now at 202 584, she added.

There has been skepticism at home and abroad about Iran's official figures, with concerns the real toll could be much higher.

President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday [20 Jun 2020] warned that stress created by the disease could leave people "depressed". He called on experts and artists to prepare Iranians mentally "to fight the virus for a long time. Without perseverance and continuity, we risk losing all our gains," he said during a meeting of a taskforce set up to fight the pandemic. Rouhani also confirmed his government's decision to allow provinces to make their own decisions on restrictive measures, implemented with "the president's approval".

Seven of Iran's 31 provinces -- Khuzestan, Khorasan Razavi, Kermanshah, West and East Azerbaijan, Golestan and Kurdistan -- are currently "Red," the highest level on its colour-coded risk scale, Lari said.

[As of 19 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 202 584, including 9507 deaths, an increase of 2322 cases and 115 deaths since 19 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to restrictions being lifted too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 330 578, including 121 980 deaths, an increase from 2 297 190 cases and 121 407 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 208 763 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 20 Jun 2020, including 17 563 confirmed deaths and an additional 4681 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, New York, and Illinois. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California (surpassing New Jersey in the past 24 hours), New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Maryland. A total of 39 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
