The aid group Medecins sans Frontieres says the 1st victim of the latest Ebola outbreak in Uganda was a 3-month-old girl and that of the 65 people who attended her funeral, 15 later contracted the deadly disease. At least 11 of those who attended the baby's funeral have since died, the group said in a statement on Wednesday [1 Aug 2012].

Funerals in Uganda are typically elaborate affairs that draw huge crowds. In a national address this week, Uganda's president urged people to avoid unnecessary contact with each other and discouraged handshakes. Medecins sans Frontieres says that while that is good advice, people without symptoms are not contagious, and avoiding contact with others' bodily fluids is the best way to limit an Ebola outbreak. Ebola is highly infectious and kills quickly.

The hospital at the center of an Ebola outbreak in Uganda is now dealing with 30 suspected cases, including 5 from Kibaale prison, Dr. Dan Kyamanywa said Thursday [2 Aug 2012]. Three patients at Kagadi hospital have been confirmed as having the virus, said Kyamanywa, a district health officer. Doctors are now testing the suspected cases urgently so they can separate confirmed cases from those who do not have the disease, aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres stated. Suspected cases are still trickling into the hospital, Kyamanywa said.

At least 16 people have died in the current outbreak.
