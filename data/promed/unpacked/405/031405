31 Jul 2017 Sierra Leone: The legacy of Ebola in Sierra Leone -- a country at risk?
http://www.transconflict.com/2017/07/the-legacy-of-ebola-in-sierra-leone-a-country-at-risk-319/
[There are over 4000 [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] survivors in Sierra Leone, according to the country's health ministry. Many face stigma and discrimination in their families and communities, and thousands more face ongoing physical and mental health problems. Joint pains, fertility concerns, and eye problems, as well as livelihood and other economic issues, are daily ordeals for [EVD] survivors, according to research such as that carried out by the International Medical Corps in the middle of the crisis.

In 2016, the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] and the Government of Sierra Leone through the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs agreed on an Annual Work Plan to address these issues.

Sierra Leone's Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and Children's Affairs is Dr Sylvia Blyden. On launching the project, she noted that "Under the leadership of the UNDP and the Government of Sierra Leone, we'll have so many success stories out of this project." However, the signing of this work plan has not so far changed the predicament of Ebola survivors.

UAB is one of them. Among the 1st people to survive [EVD], UAB lives in an unfinished building in Goderich, west of Freetown. During the early days of the outbreak, UAB volunteered to work as a hygienist in a treatment centre near his community, where he contracted the virus. He remembers what it felt like living with the disease.

"It was one of the greatest fears of my life. I saw infected people dying like animals every day. There were few survivors. 10 or 11 patients would come, and only one would survive. That was how severe things were. Seeing the hopeless situation of others made me think I was going to die," UAB says.

When UAB was discharged, things were not easy. His family had already burnt most of his personal belongings and documents. "Even my elder brother didn't come to visit me because he feared that I might infect him. I felt disappointed and very discouraged."

Though he survived both Ebola and the stigma that followed, UAB now lives with a medical complication called urethra rapture. The condition makes it difficult for him to urinate freely. He explains with tears in his eyes. ...]

[When the survivors of EVD, especially those who contracted the disease caring for others, continue to be stigmatized, that is a shame on those who conduct or condone such treatment. Education is critical to bring survivors back into the fold of the community. And now with the terrible news of torrential rain and mudslides in Sierra Leone, the community will need everyone pulling together to get through this latest tragedy. - Mod.LK]

12 Aug 2017 Sierra Leone News: Training on human/animal interactions and disease
http://awoko.org/2017/08/11/sierra-leone-news-training-on-humananimal-interactions-and-disease/
[The Conservation Society Sierra Leone, with support from Welthungerhilfe [an organization for development and humanitarian aid] ended a 4-day training in zoonotic originated health diseases in Sierra Leone for community representatives from Gola Rainforest National Park [GRNP] Rangers and other stakeholders at the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Food Security training hall at Chinese farm along Wahman Abu Road in Kenema.

The Biodiversity Officer for the Conservation Society, Papanie Bai Sesay, said the objective of the training is to develop, share, and apply knowledge and understanding on the prevention of zoonotic originated health epidemics in Sierra Leone. These diseases are relevant to broaden the knowledge of rangers, multipliers and community members in relation to wildlife and human interactions and early warning signs.

Abdul Rashid, Program Manager Conservation Society, said zoonotic diseases include [Ebola virus disease (EVD)], Lassa fever, rabies, and monkey pox, [among other diseases], and that the training will enhance participants in knowledge of animals, sick animals and how to detect or spot strange behaviors among wildlife. Participants also learn about a strong reporting link between community members, multipliers, rangers and the GRNP/District Health Management Team (DHMT). [Rashid] maintained that participants will commit themselves to follow what they learned, and will strengthen relationship between communities and rangers. In addition, they will be willing to volunteer to take records of dead/sick animals in their communities for early warning systems for reporting.]
[This seems like an excellent approach to educate the community about veterinary health and serve as an early warning system. - Mod.LK]

6 Aug 2017: Action follows 60 Minutes investigation questioning whether protective gear for Ebola was defective
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-quarantines-its-own-equipment/
[The [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it has "quarantined" some of its own stock-piled equipment following a 60 Minutes report that questioned whether the gear, recommended for protection against the Ebola virus, was defective.
The 60 Minutes story quoted former employees and internal company documents regarding MICROCOOL surgical gowns made by Halyard Health (formerly a division of Kimberly-Clark). The investigation first aired in May 2016 and was on the [US] CBS Television network.
Based on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, 60 Minutes reported that MICROCOOL gowns were part of the US Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies for use in future outbreaks and emergencies. The stockpile is maintained by the CDC.
In response to an inquiry from 60 Minutes, the CDC sent the broadcast a statement saying, "The gowns are being quarantined within the SNS [Strategic National Stockpile] inventory and there are no current plans to use them."]
The CDC's full statement can be found at the URL above. ... - more]

RNA persistence in semen

3 Aug 2017: Ebola RNA persists in semen longer than 2 years
https://tinyurl.com/y9j62dq4
[Citation. Fischer, WA II, Brown J, Wohl DA, et al. Ebola RNA persists in semen longer than 2 years. Open Forum Infect Dis. 2017; doi:10.1093/ofid/ofx155; https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofx155

Abstract
--------
Among 149 men who survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) donating semen 260-1016 days after EVD onset, Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA was detected in 13 (9 percent). Of 137 men donating semen 2 years after EVD onset, 11 (8 percent) had an EBOV RNA-positive specimen. The mechanism underlying the persistence of EBOV RNA in semen is unclear, as is whether the detection of viral RNA represents the presence of infectious virus.

Background
----------
The well-documented sexual transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) by 2 men who survived the 2013-2016 West Africa epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) coupled with the detection of EBOV RNA in semen months after recovery from EVD has raised concern for the continued risk of sexual transmission of Ebola virus by asymptomatic survivors.]

[It is difficult to imagine infectious virus is not sequestered in a protected area in the male genital tract of those individuals who have RNA persisting in the semen for 2 years after exposure. Such prolonged presence of RNA will not help combat the stigma survivors are experiencing, discussed above. - Mod.LK]
