Regional Governor of Haskovo Stanislav Dechev has called a meeting of the Regional Epizootic Commission in relation to an outbreak of ovine rinderpest found in the Yambol region, said the press office of the Regional Administration in Haskovo. The emergency meeting will be held today [21 Jun 2018] at 2.30 p.m. in the Small Hall of the Regional Administration. An outbreak of plague of small ruminants was found in the municipality of Bolyarovo, Yambol region, and the meeting will discuss measures and prevention.

[The term "Ovine rinderpest" is one of the synonyms of Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), a disease caused by a _Morbillivirus_ in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. The other synonims of PPR are: Pseudorinderpest, Goat Plague, Pest of Small Ruminants, Pest of Sheep and Goats, Kata, Stomatitis-Pneumoenteritis Syndrome and Pneumoenteritis Complex.

From the above report it may be assumed that the disease has already been confirmed, becoming Bulgaria's 1st ever outbreak of this highly infectious animal disease. An official notification is expected.

Bolyarovo is situated about 20 km [approx. 12 mi] from Turkey's European territory, Thrace (map at https://tinyurl.com/y7ljzyhwO). Turkey is a PPR-infected country; the existence of PPR infection in Turkey was officially declared in 1999, but there had been some previous reports of the presence of the virus in the country. Its current circulation in Thrace deserves to be checked.

Bulgaria has been preceded by Georgia as a European country into which PPR has spread (in 2016; see 20160209.4007066).

A list of the 56 OIE member countries officially recognised as free from PPR, updated May 2018, is availables at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/peste-des-petits-ruminants/list-of-member-countries-free-from-ppr/.

PPR is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
