New Skin Infection Concerns Doctors, Activists
---------------------------
Public health officials in California are alerting male homosexuals to the
dangers of a new skin infection that is communicable during sex.
The San Francisco Health Department has sent out informational
bulletins on methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) to
chiropractors, masseurs, and gymnasium and sex-club operators, alerting
them to increases of the infection. Officials also have held informational
forums at homosexual community centers. More recently, Los Angeles health
officials also have identified an increase in MRSA among male
homosexuals. Officials, however, can't provide numbers of staph infections
because MRSA is not a reportable disease in California.
"We've heard anecdotally that there are increases, but we haven't been able
to substantiate it," said Colleen Johnson, a San Francisco Health
Department spokeswoman. "We will be creating a surveillance system in the
next couple of months, but it will take a while in order to have enough
data for it to be accurate."
The Health Department is working with the University of California, local
health authorities and doctors to prevent the infections from spreading,
she said.
"What's new is that some of these are being spread by skin-to-skin
[contact], and the skin-to-skin contact seems to be of a sexual nature,"
said Dr. John Diggs, a medical consultant to the Family Research Council.
"The difference is that this is treatable and that it can be spread through
more casual contact. It doesn't have to be contact of a sexual nature," he
added. However, the disease could spread rapidly among homosexual men, who
have high rates of sexual promiscuity, Diggs said.
Doctors are not accustomed to seeing MRSA in their offices, Diggs said.
It's the kind of infection they expect to see in patients who might be
hospitalized or who are otherwise debilitated with diabetes or
chemotherapy, he said.
Since early last summer, for example, the San Francisco Health Department
has identified an increasing number of patients with soft tissue infections
among city jail inmates, the department reported.
The infections can [result in] pneumonia, bladder, skin, and blood
infections. In some cases, the disease can be fatal, doctors report. But in
order to control an epidemic, officials need to have some idea what the
incidence is. While no official figures are available on the number of
staph infections, a San Francisco doctor estimated the city's cases number
between 200 and 300.

[This article points out the difficulties in assessing the order of
magnitude of a health problem in the absence of reliable data on the
incidence and prevalence of a disease. In this case, skin infections caused
by MRSA are not officially reportable events, especially on an outpatient
basis, though there are laboratory data maintained on staphylococcal
isolate antibiotic sensitivity patterns. An additional challenge to the
development of a surveillance system for MRSA skin infections is the
current trend to treat outpatient infections empirically with antibiotics,
and not collecting specimens for culture and antibiotic sensitivity
profiles unless an infection proves resistant to therapy. With
dissemination of information on the increase in MRSA in an area, physicians
may automatically prescribe antibiotics that will treat MRSA infections
without obtaining specimens for cultures; another challenge of balancing
cost and benefit in today's cost-cutting environment. - Mod.MPP]
[Community-acquired MRSA is becoming more common in a variety of areas in
the USA including Florida, Texas, the New York City greater metropolitan
area including New Jersey, and California. It appears that several clones
are circulating, and there is evidence that the California strains have
already been seen in NY.
In addition to cost issues, the more frequent empirical use of vancomycin
for presumed community-acquired staph infections may increase selective
pressure for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. We are already using
vancomycin in some cases of life threatening illness where
penicillin-resistant _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is suspected. It is
important that clinicians change the antimicrobial agent if these more
resistant organisms are not isolated. - Mod.LL]
