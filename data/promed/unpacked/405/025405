Yellow fever in Senegal - WHO Update
------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health officially confirmed 15 cases of and 2 deaths from
yellow fever in Mbacke and Bambey departments, Diourbel region. Laboratory
confirmation was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut
Pasteur in Dakar. All cases except one have been reported in the city of
Touba. The other case was reported in Bambey, 70 km west of Touba.

A mass immunization campaign began on 1 Oct 2002. A total of 322 000 people
have been vaccinated in 2 health districts, Mbacke and Touba. National
vaccine stocks are not sufficient to immunize the target population in
Diourbel region, and additional vaccine is needed.

In response to a request for international assistance from the Ministry of
Health, WHO staff from the West Africa sub-regional team, the Regional
Office for Africa and headquarters are in Senegal helping to contain the
outbreak. The first members of the team arrived in Senegal on 10 Oct 2002.
They are working with the Ministry on the management of the vaccination
campaign, including safety and monitoring for adverse events, enhancing
yellow fever surveillance in the country and the coordination of the program
to control the outbreak.

The Ministry has also requested additional vaccine and supplies. WHO and its
partners in the yellow fever sub-group of the International Coordinating
Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and
UNICEF are working to meet this request. Additional funds are urgently
needed to complete this mass vaccination campaign.
