Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Kiambu and _S._ Thompson infections linked to imported Maradol papayas
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 21 Jul 2017, 64 more ill people were added to this investigation from 15 states. As of 3 Aug 2017, 109 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Kiambu (48) and _S._ Thompson (61) have been reported from 16 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each are listed:.

States / Case count
Connecticut / 4
Delaware / 1
Iowa / 2
Kentucky / 2
Louisiana / 1
Maryland / 6
Massachusetts / 3
Michigan / 1
Minnesota / 4
North Carolina / 2
New Jersey / 26
New York / 36
Oklahoma / 2
Pennsylvania / 7
Virginia / 11
Wisconsin / 1
Total / 109

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 May to 22 Jul 2017. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 95, with a median age of 36. Among ill people, 63 percent are female. Among 74 people with available information, 50 (68 percent) are of Hispanic ethnicity. Among 76 people with available information, 35 (46 percent) were hospitalized. One death was reported from New York City.

Investigation update
--------------------
In ongoing interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of the 59 interviewed, 28 (47 percent) reported eating papayas. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy Hispanic people in which 16 percent reported eating papayas in the months of May and June 2017 in the week before they were interviewed.

Investigators used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to learn more about the DNA fingerprint of the strains of _Salmonella_ isolated from Maradol papayas that Maryland health officials collected from a grocery store in that state. Samples from these papayas yielded outbreak strains of _S._ Kiambu and _S._ Thompson. Both samples were from Caribena brand Maradol papayas imported from Mexico. Investigators compared WGS results of _Salmonella_ isolates from the papayas to clinical isolates from ill people in the PulseNet database.

WGS showed that the _S._ Kiambu papaya isolate is closely related genetically to _S._ Kiambu isolates from ill people. WGS also showed that the _S._ Thompson papaya isolate is closely related genetically to _S._ Thompson isolates from ill people. This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating contaminated Maradol papayas imported from Mexico.

FDA tested other papayas imported from Mexico and isolated several types of _Salmonella_, including serotypes Agona, Kiambu, Gaminara, Thompson, and Senftenberg. Through this testing, the FDA has also identified Maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche papaya farm in Mexico as a likely source of the outbreak. The agency is working to identify other brands of papayas that may have originated from Carica de Campeche and facilitate recalls. More information is available on FDA's website.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them. Further investigation by FDA and regulatory officials is under way to determine the point in the supply chain where the papayas were contaminated. Updates will be provided when more information is available.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified a Mexican papaya farm it believes may be the source of the deadly multistate salmonellosis outbreak, with the number of infected people having risen significantly since the last update.

The FDA is advising consumers to avoid all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm in the Yucatan Peninsula, after numerous positive salmonella detections were made. The outbreak of the strains _Salmonella_ Kiambu and _S._ Thompson has left one person dead in New York and has now infected 108 others across 16 states, according to the CDC. So far 35 people have been hospitalized.

Last week [week of 24 Jul 2017], Texas-based papaya supplier Grande Produce initiated a limited recall of its products. "The FDA is now advising that consumers avoid Caribena brand Maradol papayas and all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm located in Campeche, Mexico as a result of the FDA's traceback investigation and testing," the FDA said in an update.

"The FDA is working to identify the brand(s) that these papayas are sold under and facilitate recall(s). Meanwhile, consumers should ask their retailers about the source of their papayas." It said papayas from Carica de Campeche tested positive for _Salmonella_ serotypes Kiambu, Thompson, Agona, Senftenberg and Gaminara. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is pending for these samples, and the Carica de Campeche farm has been added to Import Alert (IA) 99-35.

Since the CDC's earlier update, 6 more states have reported ill people: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. Previously people have been infected in the states of Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. New York and New Jersey have seen the highest number of cases.

The FDA said it had increased testing of papayas from Mexico in an effort to see if fruit from other farms could be contaminated. If it finds _Salmonella_ in other shipments, those farms will also be added to the alert. Since 2011 papayas from Mexico have not been allowed to enter the country without documentation that shows they have tested negative for the bacterium, it said.

"Farms/companies have been able to request addition onto the "green" list of IA 21-17 when they have had 5 consecutive shipments test negative for _Salmonella_," the FDA said. "In contrast, farms/companies who want to request removal from the "red" list of IA 99-35 must present substantive documentation demonstrating that they have made corrections to prevent contamination, including, for example, a root cause analysis to identify potential sources and routes of contamination.

"The FDA traceback and traceforward investigation is still ongoing and additional brands may be identified; the FDA will update its advice as we learn more.

[It is interesting that the epi curve supplied with the outbreak report shows that the serotype Kiambu cases occurred first and the more recent cases are almost all serotype Thompson (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-07-17/epi.html). We await the overall scope of the outbreak. - Mod.LL
