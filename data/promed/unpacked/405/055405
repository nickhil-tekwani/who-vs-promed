Noteworthy, an outbreak of scrapie was reported in January 2008
within a bedouin flock in Kuseife (Beer Sheva district), Israel,
about 45 km southwest of Tqou'. Nine cases, including 7 deaths, were
reported among the 682 sheep in the said flock. The remaining 675
sheep, as well as (seemingly, unaffected) 275 goats in the flock,
were destroyed in line with Israel's scrapie control policy.

Israel's notification about the said event (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6697>)
included a map and the following comments regarding the affected
population and the epidemiology:

"The flock belongs to a Bedouin in the Negev desert in southern
Israel. The owner reported few days ago that 2 sheep were observed
with characteristic clinical signs of scrapie, such as scratching.
One of the 2 sheep died, and the 2nd was destroyed. Both of them were
sent to the Kimron Veterinary Institute. One more sheep was observed
with the same clinical signs during the visit of the Veterinary
Services to the flock. The owner is reporting that, since January
2006, 6 more sheep were observed with the same clinical signs; the
authorities were not notified about these cases. All the affected
animals were 3 to 4 years old. The owner says that no new animals
were introduced into the flock in the past 10 years. All the animals
which were sold were sent directly to slaughterhouses".

No information on the breed(s) involved has been included in either
of the reports. In view of the significance of breed susceptibility
to scrapie, such information from both parties will be helpful. It
will be also interesting to obtain an update about the ongoing
Israeli sheep breeding project, which aims at the detection,
selection and propagation of genotyped, scrapie-resistant rams.

Since the husbandry system in both mentioned flocks may be similar,
it will also be interesting to investigate whether contacts between
them or common sources of genetic material can be traced or excluded.
