Mexico: Public Health Alert Declared in Southern Border States of Mexico
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CANCUN: Officials in Mexico's southern border states have declared a
public health alert in the region following an outbreak of dengue
fever in Central America. The alert covers Quintana Roo, Chiapas, and
Campeche, where some 231 cases of the disease have been reported this
year, including 30 of the potentially deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever.
The outbreak has most affected Quintana Roo (where 157 cases have
been reported, including 21 dengue hemorrhagic fever cases) and
Chiapas, with 56 reported cases, Quintana Roo state Health Secretary
Dagoberto Garcia said. Garcia said 18 dengue cases, including 3 cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever, have been reported in the Caribbean
resort city of Cancun. One of the country's most popular tourist
destinations, Cancun received 1.5 million visitors in the first half
of 2002.
Garcia said another 150 part-time health workers have been hired for
the remainder of 2002 to bolster the fight against infectious
diseases. According to Cancun health official Arturo Toledo, the
measure would also serve to contain diseases like malaria, cholera,
measles, and whooping cough, which he said had increased with the
influx of illegal immigrants from Central America.

Malaysia: 4-fold Increase in Dengue Fever in Kuala Lumpur
------------------------------------------------------------
Kuala Lumpur City Hall's public relations officer Shariffuddin
Ibrahim said that the number of dengue cases in the city had
increased 4-fold in the first 6 months of this year with some 703
cases recorded. There were 226 dengue cases and 23 cases of dengue
haemorrhagic fever reported so far compared to last year's 223 cases
of dengue fever for the same period.
High-risk areas have been identified as Setiawangsa, Desa Tun Hussein
Onn and Datuk Keramat.
City Hall had last week launched a campaign to educate public on
preventive measures and increasing operations to look for and
eliminate mosquito-breeding sites. Developers have also been directed
to prevent mosquitoes from breeding at construction sites. "Anyone
caught doing so will risk having their sites sealed." City Hall
enforcement officers will carry out checks on building sites and
buildings that have been completed but are still unoccupied.
Sharifuddin said everyone should play their part in keeping their
neighbourhood clear of mosquito-breeding areas.
"City residents should take precaution against being bitten by
mosquitoes, especially at night by using mosquito nets, insect
sprays, or mosquito coils," he said. Meanwhile, Dr Ang Kim Teng, head
of vector-borne disease controls programme in the Health Ministry,
said the public needed to be aware of the problems leading to dengue.
"Many are still unaware that the _Aedes_ mosquito causes dengue and
the it can be prevented."

China: Dengue Fever Outbreak in Guanzhou
----------------------------------------
Guangzhou has announced a major mosquito extermination campaign
following an outbreak of dengue fever in the city. A large number of
dengue fever cases were reported between 19 May and 15 Jul 2002,
exceeding the total number of cases last year, according to the
Guangzhou-based Information Times. The report did not say how many
cases were involved. It said the authorities were alarmed, as the
outbreak had spread from Dongshan district to Liwan district.
Dengue fever is caused by a virus which is transmitted by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito. The mosquito breeds in stagnant water. Guangzhou
health officials said the amount of mosquito larvae found in still
water samples had reached an alarming level and the city urgently
needed to clean up still water in flowerpots, buckets, and ponds. A
massive campaign will be launched this week, officials said.
It is not known how many people in Guangzhou have been killed by the
mosquito-borne disease. The report said 60 percent of dengue fever
patients in Guangzhou had been taken to hospital.

Taiwan: Serious Outbreak of Dengue Fever in Kaohsiung
-----------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan is suffering from the most
serious dengue fever threat in 14 years, with 383 people being
infected by the mosquito-borne disease this year, said a report
reaching here from Taipei on Mon 22 Jul 2002. Of the 383 reported
cases, 10 involve the more fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever, and all of
the cases have been confirmed as having originated in Taiwan.
In Taipei City, despite the fact that there has not been a single
dengue fever case reported, health officials put some districts on
red alert against a possible outbreak as the density of the mosquito
population has reached as high as the fourth level; i.e., 20-34
mosquitoes or mosquito larvae found in every 100 households. Taipei's
health officials urged residents to undergo a medical checkup if they
have traveled to Southeast Asia or southern Taiwan over the past 2
weeks [or] have developed dengue fever symptoms such as a sudden high
fever, severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, or muscle and joint pains.
Almost all the reported cases of dengue fever in Taiwan 4 years ago,
including cases of the more fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever, were
found to have originated from abroad, brought in by returning
visitors to Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, said the
report.
In late 1980's, Taiwan suffered a serious dengue fever threat with
thousands of cases reported in Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan in
southern Taiwan.
