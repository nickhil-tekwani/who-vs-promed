------------------------------------------------------
Following a regional epidemic during the 1990's, Latvia has continued to experience a high incidence of diphtheria (1). This phenomenon is difficult to explain on the basis of poor vaccine uptake. The following graph compares WHO estimates of vaccination (DPT3) coverage with diphtheria rates reported in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/DiphtheriaLatvia.png (2, 3).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his continued contributions. If indeed, diphtheria vaccine coverage is not the issue, it is possible that there are problems with the vaccine's immunogenicity.

The reader is referred to the following source: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33039.pdf to read about the stability of the diphtheria toxoid vaccine. In summary, it is stable for several years at refrigerator temperatures but can become less immunogenic at ambient temperatures and does not tolerate freezing. - Mod.LL
