O'treng village doesn't look like the epicenter of anything. Just off
a muddy rutted-out road, it is nothing more than a handful of
Khmer-style bamboo huts perched crookedly on stilts, tucked among a
tangle of cornfields once littered with deadly land mines. Yet this
spot on the Thai-Cambodian border is home to a form of malaria that
keeps rendering one powerful drug after another useless.

This time, scientists have confirmed the 1st signs of resistance to
the only affordable treatment left in the global medicine cabinet for
malaria: artemisinin.

If this drug stops working, there's no good replacement to combat a
disease that kills one million annually. As a result, earlier this
year [2009], international medical leaders declared resistant malaria
here a health emergency.

"This is not business as usual. It's something really special, and it
needs a real concerted effort," said Dr. Nick White, a malaria expert
at Mahidol University in Bangkok who has spent decades trying to
eradicate the disease from Southeast Asia. "We know that children
have been dying in Africa -- millions of children have died over the
past 3 decades -- and a lot of those deaths have been attributed to
drug resistance. And we know that the drug resistance came from the
same place."

Malaria is just one of the leading killer infectious diseases
battling back in a new and more deadly form, the AP found in a
6-month look at the soaring rates of drug resistance worldwide. After
decades of the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, diseases like
malaria, tuberculosis and staph have started to mutate. The result:
The drugs are slowly becoming ineffective.

Already, The Associated Press found, resistance to malaria has spread
faster and wider than previously documented. Dr. White said virtually
every case of malaria he sees in western Cambodia is now resistant to
drugs. And in the Pailin area, patients given artemisinin take twice
as long as those elsewhere to be clear of the parasite, 84 hours
instead of the typical 48, and sometimes even 96.

Mosquitoes spread this resistant malaria quickly from shack to shack,
village to village, and eventually country to country. And so
O'treng, with its 45 poor families, naked kids, skinny dogs and
boiling pots of rice, finds itself at the epicenter of an
increasingly desperate worldwide effort to stop a dangerous new
version of an old disease.

Bundled in a threadbare batik sarong, 51-year-old Chhien Rern, one of
O'treng's sick residents, sweats and shivers as a 103-degree fever
rages against the malaria parasites in her bloodstream. Three days
ago, Chhien Rern started feeling ill while looking for work in a
neighboring district. So she did what most rural Cambodians do: She
walked to a little shop and asked for malaria medicine. With no
prescription, she was handed a packet of pills; she's unsure what
they were. "After I took the drugs, I felt better for a while," she
says. "Then I got sick again." The headaches, chills and fever,
classic symptoms of malaria, worsened. Chhien Rern's daughter
persuaded her to take a motorbike taxi past washed out bridges and
flooded culverts to the nearest hospital in Pailin, a dirty border
town about 10 miles from O'treng.

Doctors say there's a good chance Chhien Rern was sold counterfeit drugs.

People generate drug resistant malaria when they take too little
medicine, substandard medicine or -- as is all too often the case
around O'treng -- counterfeit medicine with a pinch of the real
stuff. Once established, the drug-resistant malaria is spread by
mosquitoes. So one person's counterfeit medicine can eventually spawn
widespread resistant disease.

Yet in most parts of the world, people routinely buy antimalarials
over the counter at local pharmacies and treat themselves.

A recent study out of neighboring Laos found 88 percent of stores
selling artemisinin-based drugs, the same ones scientists are
desperately trying to preserve, were actually peddling fakes. Worse,
nearly 15 percent of the counterfeits were laced with small hints of
artemisinin, which could prompt resistance. The researchers found
indications that some were made in China, feeding smugglers' routes
that snake through Myanmar and into Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet
Nam.

The counterfeits, along with outdated drugs, are jumping continents.
In Africa, where malaria is endemic in 45 countries, the fake drug
industry is thriving. A 2003 World Health Organization survey found
between 20 percent and 90 percent of antimalarials randomly purchased
in 7 African countries failed quality testing, depending on the type
of drug.

WHO and Interpol formed a task force 3 years ago to try to stop
counterfeiters, seizing millions of fake malaria, tuberculosis, HIV
and other pills in Southeast Asia and Africa. But officials say the
work is only as good as the countries' legal systems.

"One of the problems is that there's not really any enforcement, so
what happens when they find a drug that's counterfeit or
substandard?" says David Sintasath, a regional epidemiologist at the
nonprofit Malaria Consortium in Bangkok. "The policy is to take it
away from them. That's good until the next month when they get their
next shipment, right?"

Countless unlicensed shops in Cambodia sell artesunate, a single-drug
therapy that has been banned in the country. Artesunate, a modified
version of artemisinin derived from a Chinese herb, has been hailed
as miracle treatment worldwide because it works so well with so few
side effects. But Cambodian surveys have shown that many patients
take artesunate alone instead of mixing it with another antimalarial
drug, making it easier for resistance to build.

"The drug has been around for a long time and misused for a long
time, and this is all encouraging the parasite to develop
resistance," says Dr. Delia Bethell, of the U.S. Armed Forces
Research Institute of Medical Science, whose research has been at the
forefront of identifying emerging resistance on the border.

Back in western Cambodia a few miles from O'treng village, shopkeeper
Nop Chen turns a flashlight on a glass case full of drugs he hawks
from inside his cramped roadside house. He digs through the many
boxes and produces 2 different types of artemisinin-based
antimalarials. Both lack the full amount of a 2nd required
medication, mefloquine, necessary to treat the strain of malaria in
the area and ward off more resistance.

But Nop Chen, a former Khmer Rouge medic, points to a small Cambodian
seal on the boxes and says he feels confident the drugs are the real
deal. Still, he acknowledges he is not licensed to sell the pills,
and he's unsure where they originated.

"I'm not concerned because it's got the sticker and the stamp," he
says, squinting at the Khmer script on the labels. "Because of the
logo, I trust it to not be fake; it was made in Cambodia."

Walk past O'treng's cluster of sagging huts; cross another cornfield,
and hike a twisted mile on a dirt track to a wooden shack where a
string of smoke is curling through the wooden floor planks in a
largely futile effort to keep mosquitoes away. It's here that a
skinny 13-year-old boy wakes up on the floor nauseous and burning
with fever.

He recovered from malaria 2 months ago, but now the dizziness and
headaches are back. He's been sickened by the disease 6 or 7 times in
his short life, too many to remember. He knows that if he doesn't get
to a hospital soon, he could die.

With no new treatments in the pipeline, normally reserved scientists
are quick to use words like "disaster" or "catastrophe" when asked
what might happen if they don't contain the disease that's ravaging
this boy before it spreads to Africa. There, malaria already kills an
estimated 2000 kids daily.

For the past 50 000 years the malaria parasite has been evolving and
migrating alongside humans. It moves within the huts of O'treng and
into neighboring towns when men like the young boy's father and older
siblings float from job to job.

Some work is close enough for them to return home at night, but other
jobs keep them away for stretches of time. They sleep in tight rows,
sweating and weary, in disintegrating bamboo huts with workers who
are also traveling, and possibly infected with malaria.

The concept of containing drug resistance has never been tried
before. Scientists wonder: How do you control the spread of a
resistant parasite transmitted by mosquitoes that bite people who
live and work in infested jungle areas, then scatter in all
directions all the time?

This area, the former stronghold of the murderous Khmer Rouge, has a
notorious history. Burmese migrant workers who once mined rubies and
sapphires in these now deforested hills are believed to have helped
transport strains resistant to the drug chloroquine back to Myanmar a
half century ago. From there, it spread to India and later over to
Africa until the drug was useless worldwide.

A decade later, history repeated itself when resistance to the drug
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine followed the same path.

Now, in western Cambodia, scientists are concerned because the
artemisinin-based drugs are taking longer than usual to kill the
parasites. Earlier this year [2009], an army of aid agencies and
experts from the WHO began racing to this impoverished corner on the
Thai-Cambodian border to divvy up a USD 22.5 million grant from the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at stopping this virulent new
strain.

But grants haven't stopped lines of Cambodians, sick or not, from
queuing up every morning at Thailand's border, charging past the
checkpoints in search of work or goods. Some may carry resistant
strains in; others may bring them home.

And grants haven't stopped the parasite from spreading in the O'treng
area, despite widespread bednet distribution, awareness campaigns and
enhanced surveillance systems. Some scientists say the only sure way
to fix the problem is to eradicate malaria entirely from western
Cambodia.

"It's really dangerous," says Dr. Rupam Tripura, who's conducting a
study in Pailin for the Wellcome Trust-Mahidol University-Oxford
Tropical Medicine Research Program. "What will happen to the
mosquitoes? Can you kill those living in the jungle? No, so you
cannot kill the strain."

If O'treng is the epicenter of this emerging disease, Phoun Sokha is
the point man aimed at controlling it.

At 47, Phoun Sokha is the village malaria worker who lives at the
mouth of the hamlet and proudly displays an orange plastic kit that
resembles a tackle box.

Phoun Sokha is serious about his packets of medicine and his rapid
tests to prick blood from sick villagers' fingers to determine if
they have malaria and if so, what type. He makes sure patients are
taking their free medicines and checks to see if they're improving.
If not, Phoun Sokha can even arrange transportation to the hospital.
But treating O'treng's malaria patients can be frustrating.

"Some of the patients, when they went to the hospital, after one
month, maybe they get malaria again," he says.

Today, the village boy who has fought malaria so many times before
heads home from the hospital after a few days of treatment. He
clutches a new mosquito net he hopes will prevent yet another
infection. Together, the recovering boy and his weathered mom shuffle
past sick neighbor Chhien Rern's shack before disappearing among the
tassels of the cornfield toward their home. But all is not well.

Under a tattered quilt, the boy's 9-year-old sister is curled on a
thin mattress atop the wooden floor inside the family's open-air home.

She had malaria alongside her brother 2 months ago. They share a
mosquito net that she burned a hole in when she stayed up one night
reading by the light of a makeshift candle. Her brother thinks that's
how the mosquitoes infected them.

"Very afraid of dying," says the sister, who has started taking
medicine provided by the village malaria worker. "I feel worse than
before. I cannot walk myself or stand up by myself and cannot eat
well."

The boy understands. He gently lifts his little sister's limp body,
scooping her up, his strength returning. She reaches weakly for her
mother.

Like her big brother, this child doesn't know about counterfeit drugs
or antimalarials. She only knows she's sick. And the medicines don't
seem to work as well anymore in this little village she calls home.

[The increasing resistance to artemisinin at the Thai-Cambodian
border is of great concern. As pointed out in the article, resistance
to other antimalarials -- chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and
mefloquine -- originated in the same area. The main drivers of the
developing resistance are under-dosing and counterfeit drugs.

The study from Laos cited in the text is "Sengaloundeth et al. A
stratified random survey of the proportion of poor quality oral
artesunate sold at medicine outlets in the Lao PDR - implications for
therapeutic failure and drug resistance. Malar J. 2009;8:172." The
study found that 88 percent of the drugs purchased at local markets
contained no or substandard amounts of artemisinin. Many people
cannot afford to buy a full treatment course and may therefore be
under-dosed even if the drugs contained correct amounts of
artemisinin.

A recent editorial in Expert Opinion of Anti-Infective Therapy
suggested that the only rational way of stopping the spread of
artemisinin resistance was to deliver the drug free of charge
(Schlagenhauf P and Petersen E. Antimalaria drug resistance: the
mono-combi-counterfeit triangle. Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther.
2009;7:1039-42).

If the artemisinin based therapies were delivered free, full courses
could be provided at no cost to the patient, thus removing the market
for counterfeit drugs.
