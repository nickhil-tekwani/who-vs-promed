[from a previous posting: Dr. John S. Moran wrote:
The pain caused by an injection immune globulin (IG) depends on the volume
and the site. If properly administered, with a slap preceding needle
insertion, 5ml of IG can be delivered through a 20 gauge, 1.5 inch needle
into the buttock of most adults with very little pain. This is because a
1.5 inch needle will not penetrate to the gluteal muscle of most adults.
For small or lean persons, 5 ml injections of IG into the buttocks are much
more painful because the IG is actually injected into muscle .
In the case of post exposure prophylaxis, the pain caused by the injection
of IG will depend on the site of exposure. A fat person bitten on the hand
quarters should have little to fear. On the other hand, the pain that
person bitten in a more sensitive area will experience will be limited
only by the mercy of the treating physician.
In any case, there is no "painful series" of injections.
******
One should not be left with the impression that the instillation of any
vaccine
designed for IM (in the muscle) administration into fat is either desirable
(to minimize pain) or adequate. If this were so, we could certainly find
better sites than the deltoid or gluteal regions for routine immunization.
Fat tissue is both poorly vascularized and immunologically unreactive, and
therefore unsuitable for either passive or active immunization.
The valid point made in the post by Dr. Moran is that the rabies
vaccination series involving a painful and lengthy series of intraabdominal
injections is now obsolete, having been replaced by much better tolerated
and more effective IM vaccines. These are designed for IM administration,
and injection into fat is not appropriate even if it is less painful. This
is especially true for diseases like rabies where vaccine failure is not
acceptable. The comments bring to mind a study done by a friend on optimal
needle lengths for immunization specifically so that the vaccine reached
muscle.
Although the focus was on Hepatitis B vaccine, the implications were
broadly targeted:
