In the past few days, 2 turkey vultures found dead on the University of Wyoming main campus have been determined to be the latest Wyoming victims of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

Wyoming Game and Fish Department personnel collected the turkey vultures and submitted them to the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL). As part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, the WSVL is approved to test for HPAI. The vultures were found to have Eurasian HPAI, first detected in the US in January [2022].

While this viral disease may be highly lethal to birds, current assessment by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that HPAI is not a human health concern at this time. However, there have been rare human infections with this strain of H5N1 HPAI overseas. People should exercise care and avoid contact with sick or dead wild birds and poultry.

Since being detected in the US in January [2022], the virus has spread to poultry in at least 29 states, affecting over 28 million domestic birds and untold numbers of wild birds. The WSVL first detected HPAI in Wyoming poultry in late March [2022]. Subsequently, HPAI has been diagnosed in various domestic and wild bird species across the state. Current information on HPAI in the U.S. may be found on the USDA-APHIS website.

People are advised to not pick up or handle any dead wild birds they may encounter and report clusters of dead wild birds to the Game and Fish Wildlife Health Laboratory at (307) 745-5865. If you have domestic poultry or pet birds that are dying or ill, contact your veterinarian who can evaluate the birds to determine if they may be infected with HPAI and arrange to submit appropriate samples for testing. You also may call the Wyoming Livestock Board at (307) 777-8270 or (307) 777-6440.

To help mitigate the spread of this virus, Gov Mark Gordon instituted an emergency rule Monday that states "all poultry events, including exhibitions, swaps, tours, sales and competitions, are prohibited."

For more information on HPAI, visit the USDA-APHIS website (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/emergency-management/hpai/fadprep-hpai).

The Game and Fish Department maintains an up-to-date map of wild birds diagnosed with HPAI in Wyoming on the agency's website. (https://wgfd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=cc8c7e8b81f44d0e91c1ad16f54ee81a)

[2] New York: several wild bird species
Date: Sat 23 Apr 2022 4:00 pm EDT

State officials are cautioning about a new wave of bird flu that is being reported across New York.

The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) announced that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus has been detected in multiple wild bird species in several areas of the state.

While cases have been reported in birds statewide, there have been no known HPAI human infections documented in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the new cases in New York "do not present an immediate public concern."

DEC cautioned that HPAI outbreaks in wild birds are cyclical and tied to their migration patterns when concentrated in higher numbers.

According to DEC, HPAI is caused by a virus carried by free-flying wild birds such as ducks, geese, gulls, and shorebirds.

The most recent HPAI strain is believed to have come from Europe, where it has been spreading since 2020 before coming to North America in 2021, according to DEC.

The 1st case of the European HPAI strain was reported in Suffolk County on Long Island in a domestic flock. It has spread north since then.

As of Friday, [22 Apr 2022], HPAI has been found in captive chickens, pheasants, and ducks in these counties: Dutchess; Ulster; Monroe; Fulton.

HPAI was also detected in wild birds in these New York counties: Cayuga; Clinton; Montgomery; Monroe; Onondaga; Seneca; Suffolk; Nassau; Livingston; Wayne.

Wild birds include snow geese, Canada geese, tundra swan, mute swan, sanderling, mallard duck, redhead duck, ring-necked duck, wood duck, hooded merganser, great blue heron, bald eagles, great horned owls, snowy owl, cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, fish crow, and turkey vulture.

"Generally, influenza viruses can infect some wildlife species without causing signs of disease, but new strains can emerge that cause illness with high mortality in both wild birds and domestic poultry," DEC officials noted. "These strains are designated as highly pathogenic, or HPAI. HPAI outbreaks in wild birds are often cyclical and tied to migration when birds are concentrated in large numbers.

"As birds spread out on the landscape during the nesting season, disease transmission is expected to decrease."

While there is no immediate public health risk, the public has been advised to report dead birds to DEC regional tracking offices to monitor the spread of HPAI.

The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. This is the case of birds of prey and scavengers, which are exposed to the virus when feeding on other infected birds. - Mod.PMB]
