Clinical presentation of 27 deaths in Sarawak 14 April - 22 June 1997
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the urgent questions now posted by concerned pediatricians,
I apologise for not posting this information earlier, as there were some
troubling ethical and moral issues I had to sort out first.
I was appointed by the Minister of Health, Malaysia 13th June 1997 to an
independent panel of three members, to review the epidemic in Sarawak (as a
community pediatrician with public health training and someone not directly
involved with the management of the cases.) With the assistance of the
pediatricians, case notes of 27 of the initial deaths, and 326
admissions during the period 14th April - 22nd June 97 were
retrospectively reviewed.
This posting is a summary of the salient findings in one of the two reports
that were submitted to the Minister 22 July 1997. It does not include
epidemiological, therapeutic or pathological data, and is solely based on
documented case charts and laboratory reports available at the time.
The Ministry of Health Malaysia is in the final stages of the country
report, which I am sure will provide a more complete picture, in due course.
In view of the clinical urgency and need for vigilance in other countries,
I hope by presenting the clinical findings in Sarawak now, I may be able to
help pediatricians elsewhere have some idea as to the range of clinical
problems the children in our deaths and admissions had. Whether the
Taiwan outbreak is due to the same infection or not remains to be
confirmed.
During the outbreak of sudden unexplained pediatric deaths in Sarawak in
1997 (April to July) , the questions the clinicians wanted answered
urgently were:
What should we look for?
What constitutes a case?
What should we investigate for when we do have a suspect case?
Over a period of nine days in mid April 1997, the pediatricians in Sibu (in
the central region of the state of Sarawak) had three unexplained pediatric
deaths (17mo, 9mo and 6 month infants).
All three were admitted after a short febrile illness, in compensated
shock, with tachycardia (180 -200/min) and tachypnea (one gasping) , lung
crepitation (liver size normal) , poor perfusion. All died within 24 hrs
of admission.
One had fits, another had Right upper limb weakness, two had vomiting and
changes in mental status (irritability, drowsiness).
There was no record of skin rash. Lumbar puncture was not done.
Echocardiography revealed a poorly contracting dilated left ventricle.
In the child with fits, LDH was 512IU/l, CK was not done. CPK for the
second case (AFP) was 1500, 148 IU/l in the third. CXR showed normal heart
size with pulmonary edema.
Pediatricians in the state were alerted. From the fourth case onwards,
specimens were sent for viral studies with the Institute of Health and
Community Medicine, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, which coincidentally was
running a Japanese B encephalitis surveillance study.
During the outbreak, the criteria for hospital admission were all cases of :
- suspected myocarditis (* see below) ,
- acute flaccid paralysis,
- aseptic meningitis,
- shallow mouth ulcers,
- rash on hands and feet in a child less than 3 years old
- and looking ill ( poor oral intake, high fever, vomiting, fits, altered
consciousness, tachypnoea,)
- heart rate more than 160/min)
* The Acute Viral Myocarditis clinical diagnostic guidelines used were:
(National Heart Institute, Kuala Lumpur 21 June 1997)
symptoms
- unexplained tiredness
- cough, dyspnoea
- in association with a febrile illness
clinical signs
- tachypnoea, usually mild
- inappropriate and persistent tachycardia:
neonate 180 -200/min
infant <6months < 180
6mo - 1yr <160
1 - 4 yrs <130
- basal crepitation of lungs
- gallop rhythm
- CXR may show cardiomegaly of varying degrees with features of pulmonary
edema
- Echocardiography: Left ventricular function (LV ejection fraction < 60%)
with chamber dilatation (reference range given) often regional in nature
Summary of clinical presentations of the 27 deaths 14 April - 22 June 1997
There were 17 males and 10 females, mean age 19 months (5-53 months) with a
mode 22 months.
The mean survival time from admission to death (excluding the two brought
in died) was 11hr 41min (35 min - 29Hrs). 9 cases died within 6-10 hrs
The majority of cases were admitted critically ill, with tachycardia and
compensated shock. Most died within 24 hours of admission despite
respiratory and inotropic support.
In the presence of a clinical Hand Foot and Mouth epidemic in the state,
only 16 had documentation to suggest the presence of hand, foot or mouth
lesions
Painful ulcers on the palate and tongue are striking features.
All except one had a fever history. GIT symptoms were seen in more than
half, with vomiting more common than diarrhoea.
Respiratory symptoms were present in less than a third. Half had
neurological symptoms of seizures and definite limb paresis in addition to
less specific complaints of drowsiness, irritability or headache.

Sinus tachycardia is universal.
Cardiomegaly was not a feature, but signs of left heart failure were found
(lung crepitation, pulmonary oedema and poor periferal perfusion despite
normal BP). This was confirmed by echocardiography in some cases.
Liver enlargement was present in five.
BP is maintained to the terminal event.
Cardiac enzymes were definitely raised.
The renal and liver functions were not abnormal.

Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis were marked.
CSF normal in two and six had pleocytosis with normal protein and glucose
The children were not malnourished nor anemic. There was no documentation
in their Under Seven records to suggest immunodeficiency, or coexisting
cardiac or neurological abnormalities.

Conclusions (made by the study group at that time)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The condition is probably communicable, as shown by the two cousins dying
within a week of each other, and siblings of fatalities admitted. The
outbreak coincided with the extensive travelling during the school holidays
as well as the Gawai festivities.
This agent(s) causes a febrile exanthema with central nervous system and
cardiac dysfunction, without significant renal or hepatic involvement.
Despite the low CSF cell counts, the definite fits and mono/limb paresis
are striking features.
The intractable heart failure seems to be more left ventricular as the
liver was noted to be enlarged in only 5 cases. The raised CPK, AST, and
LDH in the absence of significant liver, renal, muscular (7 children had
fits only two of these had CK results - 115, 259) or hematologic pathology
is consistent with injury to the myocardium and/or brain.
The marked thrombocytosis may have contributed to the tissue anoxia and
metabolic acidosis.
Virology results (Institute of Health and Community Medicine, Unimas only)
(I do not have access to the results from other labs)
Of the 27 fatal cases, no specimens were available for 6 (this included the
first three cases which alerted the pediatricians)
21 had samples for viral culture & PCR -
4 No growth
17 Viral isolated - Adenovirus (fastidious - untypable with current probes)
2 with EV71 (serum, throat swab, rectal swab)
1 with enterovirus (typing in progress) (serum)
1 with Echo 25 (serum)
PCR was weakly positive for EV in 2 others (brain & heart)
None of the fatal cases had enteroviruses as a single infection. The
adenovirus was cultured from the heart, brain, csf, throat swabs and serum
(also adrenal and lung in one autopsy case).
Enterovirus was isolated from the serum, throat and rectum, not from brain,
csf, or heart.

Questions
------------
Is this strain of adenovirus the sole agent responsible for the cardiac and
neurological findings, and causing death?
What is the significance of the dual infections with enteroviruses?
This outbreak occurred in the midst of a widespread clinical Hand foot and
mouth outbreak - is this of clinical relevance and in some way contributory
to death?
In all cases presenting with shock should echocardiogram be routine to
exclude LV dysfunction, BEFORE fluid resuscitation as this precipitated the
pulmonary edema in some of our cases?.
Or is the pulmonary edema (frothy red aspirate) a result of infection of
the lungs by this particular strain of adenovirus?
I pray we find the answers soon. - TPT

Interesting References (among others on EV and adeno) that you may want to
read:
"It is of note that all of the samples that amplified enterovirus RNA were
histologically correlated with inflammation, whereas most of the PCR
positive adenovirus heart samples showed no evidence of inflammation. This
could possibly occur if the enteroviruses elicit a stronger inflammatory
response as compared to the adenoviruses" [1,2
On other presentations of myocarditis - "a syndrome mimicking acute
myocardial infarction, but with normal coronary arteries , may also occur"
