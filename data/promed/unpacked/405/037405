What had been happening before the 1st suspected case of FMD was
found in Miyazaki? Asahi.com tries to recreate it from what we are
told by the persons involved.

A water buffalo in a farm in Tsuno-cho, Miyazaki had diarrhea in late
March 2010. It was one of the 42 water buffalos kept for mozzarella
production. The veterinarian who visited to see the buffalo reported
it to Miyazaki Livestock Hygiene Service Center on 31 Mar 2010.

The prefectural government (the Center) also visited and inspected
it, but the animal did not have the symptoms of vesicles in the mouth
or on the hooves or salivation, which are the typical symptoms of
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. The feces were examined, but no
bacterium or virus to cause the diarrhea was found, and the diarrhea
stopped without finding any causative agent.

This was how the 1st abnormality was noticed. Then we had the next
incident in another farm 600m south of the buffalo farm.

"There is a cow having a slight ulcer in the mouth", said another
veterinarian who called the Center on 9 Apr 2010. He said when he
visited the farm 2 days before, one of the cattle had fever, lost
appetite and had a slight salivation the night before.

The FMD control manual prepared by the prefecture says, "vesicles in
the mouth appear 6-8 hours after the onset and usually rupture within
24 hours" [See comment].

The vet found a 3 mm ulcer in the mouth on his visit on 9 Apr 2010,
but the lesion was not a blister, and it was forming a crust. It was
already 4 days since the animal had fever. It should have presented
blisters and heavy salivation if the disease were FMD.

The Center visited and inspected all the cattle in the farm, but it
judged that the risk of FMD was low. The febrile period was only a
day.

The incubation period of FMD is about one week for cattle. The vet
visited the farm to see the cattle every day until 12 Apr 2010, but
no other abnormal animal was found.

The vet looked back on the case and said, "the initial symptoms were
different from the ones described in the textbook. It does not mean I
didn't consider the possibility of FMD, but I could not diagnose it
from these symptoms."

In the evening of 16 Apr 2010, 2 other cattle had similar symptoms.
These were kept just next to the cattle which had fever earlier that
month. They were considered to have some viral infection. At this
time, the 1st animal recovered almost completely. On the next day,
the Center revisited the farm and tested for infectious diseases, but
the result they got by 19 Apr 2010 was negative.

The Center sent the sample to the Exotic Diseases Research Station, a
branch of the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), on 19 Apr
2010, just to be safe. This was the 1st time the Miyazaki Prefecture
communicated with the national organization. The sample was found
positive for FMD in the early morning of 20 Apr 2010.

[The above 17-day-old article has been kindly submitted by Michiyo
Yamazaki in view of the recent unfolding discussion re. the delayed
recognition of the FMD infection, in a buffalo and in cattle, in
Miyazaki (see 20100509.1520, 20100605.1864).

The issue of ageing of lesions mentioned in the article and other
issues related to clinical FMD diagnosis in cattle, sheep and pigs is
available in FAO's web-page "Training material"
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/en/eufmd/training_material.html>.

For those interested, photos of FMD lesions in water-buffalos,
experimentally infected, are available in ref 1. The paper provided
some interesting observations following experimental infections
(including in-contact infections) in Indian water buffalos:
1. In buffalo with FMD, buccal, dental pad/gum and foot lesions are
prominent but not tongue lesions.
2. The incubation period for buffalo may be variable and prolonged.
3. Direct contact produced clinical disease in cattle and buffalo in
7 days and 9 - 21 days, respectively.
4. In India, where farmers sometimes rear both buffalo and cattle
together for milk production, it is observed that FMD is often overt
in cattle but covert in buffalo, making it difficult to establish the
origin and source of infection.
5. Buffalo may be infected whilst showing only minor clinical signs;
they can then act as a source of infection for healthy cattle and
other buffalo upon direct contact.

Miyazaki prefectural government announced on 6 Jun 2010 that 5 "super
seed bulls" which were evacuated during the prevailing FMD outbreak
were confirmed to have no infection so far in the final antibody
testing. They were found negative on the genetic test on 5 Jun 2010,
and the prefectural government conducted the antibody test to be on
the safe side.

The local government conducted it for the possible lift of movement
restriction around the evacuated site of Ohae, Saito-city. Animals of
2 livestock farms within 10 km from the site will also be checked,
and the restriction will be lifted at 0:00 a.m. 13 Jun 2010 if
everything goes well.

"Seed bulls are the treasure of Miyazaki, and I am relieved to have
the higher possibility of saving lives of those 5 bulls, but I take
it seriously that we've already lost another 50 bulls," said Hideo
Higashikokubaru, Governor of Miyazaki on 6 Jun 2010.

Miyazaki prefectural government and Hyuga-city started destroying and
burying approximately 600 vaccinated swine kept by a farm in the
city. This is the 1st case of destroying healthy, vaccinated animals.

Hyuga-city also plans to slaughter and bury cattle (about 900 cattle
in 76 farms) in 3 common burial sites [landfills] in the city from 7
to 12 June 2010. They say they've got consent from the neighboring
residents.

Destroying and burying of the vaccinated animals will go into full
swing, and the greatest need now for the relevant 8 local
municipalities is to secure the landfill sites.

The cities of Hyuga, Saito and Miyazaki, and the towns of Tsuno,
Kawaminami and Kijo have already secured or are holding talks to
secure the common burial sites for farmers who cannot find it on
their own. The towns of Takanabe and Shintomi are considering to
secure the common burial sites along with burial sites each farmer
finds on his own, but they are facing difficulty in obtaining the
consent of residents around the candidate sites. Eight local
municipalities have a gap in the progress of work.

In Kawaminami, the burial is steadily conducted, with small-scale
farms using the common burial sites in each district. The town also
started securing the burial site for vaccinated [non-infected]
animals.

In Tsuno, most of the farms with FMD-suspected animals have already
secured the sites, and farms with vaccinated animals also started
securing them. The town's policy is to share the burial sites in each
of 12 to 13 areas.

[According to the official web-site of Japan's MAFF, as of 6 Jun
2010, a total of 275 animal holdings, all in Miyazaki prefecture,
have been confirmed as FMD-infected. - Mod.AS]
