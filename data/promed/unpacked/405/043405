Livestock producers should be aware that the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is currently experiencing a nationwide shortage of tuberculin, the product that is used for tuberculosis testing. As a result, Wisconsin is unable to procure as much of the product as possibly needed. This shortage could potentially impact animal movement and herd accreditation plans for bovines and cervids.

If you or your clients have animal movement plans, prepare for the delays caused by the shortage.

The USDA is actively working to acquire a supply.

[This is huge news as it can impact the cost a producer incurs for the extra time (Days? Weeks? Months?) prior to being able to move animals. In some cases this may affect breeding dates and times, and may affect transport to some shows as well.

So how did the USDA find itself in a "shortage situation" of such a critical part of the tuberculosis control program? When do they anticipate having an adequate supply to meet the needs of the producers? Has the USDA taken any steps to help the producer?

Generally movement to harvest (slaughter) is not affected by such testing. - Mod.TG]
