Officials said Tuesday that pork tongue in gelatin was the likely culprit
in a listeri[osis epidemic that has killed seven people in France.
Dominique Gillot, the deputy minister for health and social action, advised
everyone against eating the product "while waiting for formal confirmation."
Since the end of November, the bacteria, which most often flourishes in
cheese and meat products, has contaminated 23 people, killing seven of them
and leading to one abortion. Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany has called
the poisonings an "epidemic."
A 74-year-old man hospitalized in Grenoble since Thursday with
listeri[osis is an unrelated case, local officials there said Tuesday -
not part of the epidemic.
A statement from the Labor Ministry said that epidemiological tests have
pointed to pork tongue in gelatin as "very likely the main mode of
transmission" of the _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria. It said, however,
that no brand name had been identified and that tests were continuing. The
pork tongue "was eaten by the majority of people" who contracted the
illness and were questioned, the statement said.
A bacteriological investigation of the food chain is in progress, the
ministry statement said, and should allow for confirmation of the initial
findings in the coming days.

How would "newborns" acquire _Listeria_ from processed meat? Did their
parents not wash their hands, or is processed meat a part of newborn diets
in France?

[John Marr's question relates an indication in the prior posting of this
thread that 2 newborns were among the 7 patients who have died to date.
This does serve to point out an inconsistency in the fragmentary
information received to date. I will await more definitive information
before posting again in this threat. - Mod.ES
