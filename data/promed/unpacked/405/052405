[Re: ProMED-mail Undiagnosed deaths, bovine - Australia (04): (NS) RFI 20141120.2972760]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Dr Ian Roth, Chief Veterinary Officer of New South Wales (Department of Primary Industries, NSW 2800, Australia), has provided the following response to the request for information in the posting cited above,] and information additional to archive no. 20140208.2263522]

The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) is continuing investigations into a disease of cattle in the western area of New South Wales (NSW). The disease has been called "3D syndrome" as the major signs noticed by landholders are drooling, diarrhoea, and death. The Department has prepared information on 3D syndrome which can be accessed at http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/health/specific/cattle/cattle-deaths-with-drooling-and-diarrhoea-3d-syndrome.

Since the previous posting, a detailed review of laboratory investigations has been conducted with a case definition published (see "Information for vets" at the URL above). Based on this case definition, 3D syndrome accounted for 12 investigations on 4 properties. The review also established that cases of calf diarrhoea had incorrectly been included as 3D syndrome (13 investigations on 7 properties) as had other diseases (a mix of endemic diseases that occur in New South Wales). This has resulted in a reduction in the estimate of losses due to 3D syndrome. However given the extensive nature of the properties and that investigations are generally based on investigations of single animals, it is impossible to give accurate figures on stock losses.

A mortality survey of landowners has been conducted in Western NSW extending geographically beyond investigations referred to above. Landowners were asked about mortalities that occurred in the period 1 Oct 2013-31 Mar 2014. Surveys were posted to 550 farmers with responses received from 227 (41 percent). These indicate that overall mortalities were within what would be expected in extensive holdings. Landholders that had recorded mortalities but had not sought veterinary assistance are being followed up with a detailed questionnaire.

In addition a detailed questionnaire of property owners has been conducted with landholders where veterinary investigations into 3D syndrome had occurred. Factors that indicate this is not a transmissible disease include:
- The small number of affected properties despite cases having been observed since 2006
- The presence of affected and unaffected mobs on the same property
- There have been no reports of cattle moved from the properties having spread the condition elsewhere nor have introduced cattle been reported with higher morbidity

In conjunction with the extensive range of tests for infectious agents (see ProMED-mail posting 20140208.2263522 [published 8 Feb 2014]), there is no suggestion 3D syndrome is caused simply by the presence of a transmissible agent. Individuals who state otherwise are subject to confirmation bias confusing coincidence with correlation with causality.

NSW DPI is making progress in determining the cause of 3D syndrome. However the small number of affected properties makes separating risk factors from confounding factors difficult. It is most likely the disease occurs as a consequence of multiple factors acting together or sequentially. These factors are most likely to include plants within the paddock (but not a straightforward toxicity). Landholders are constantly encouraged to make contact with veterinarians to have animal health problems investigated. The outcome of these investigations and other surveillance activities are published in Animal Health Surveillance (see http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/aboutus/resources/periodicals/newsletters/animal-health-surveillance). A report from one of the properties with calf diarrhoea is available at http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/516625/AHS-Q1-2014.pdf.

Purchasers of livestock can be assured of high standards of Animal Health from NSW and Australia. It is the view of the NSW Food Authority that the incident does not present a food safety risk.

[While it seems there are still more questions than answers, we appreciate the prompt response regarding this strange syndrome.
