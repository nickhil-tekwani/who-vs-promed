Meningococcal disease in Chad
-----------------------------
From 29 Dec 2008 to 5 Apr [2009], the Ministry of Health of Chad reported
922 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 105 deaths (case
fatality rate: 11.4 per cent). So far, 3 districts have crossed the
epidemic threshold, including a district in the capital, N'Djamena, while 5
districts are on alert.

So far, 33 specimens of cerebrospinal fluid have been found positive for
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 and 30 specimens for _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup A, by latex, culture, and PCR, suggesting that both
serogroups are responsible for the epidemic.

The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis Control has provided 164 000 doses of trivalent ACW
vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign in affected areas of Dourbali,
Goundi, and Pala district. In addition, 704 300 doses of trivalent vaccine
have been released this week [week of 20 Apr 2009], which will be used for
an immunization campaign in the capital, planned to start next week. WHO,
UNICEF, Medecins sans Frontieres, and the International Federation of Red
Cross (IFRC) are working with the Ministry of Health, Chad to implement
vaccination campaigns as well as other emergency control measures,
including case management and surveillance in neighbouring districts.
