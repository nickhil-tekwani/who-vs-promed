French dairy group Lactalis could have been producing _Salmonella_-tainted baby milk since 2005, its chief executive was quoted as saying, adding the growing crisis was likely to cost the company hundreds of millions of euros.

Lactalis has recalled 12 million tins in France and around the world after several babies were taken ill in 2017 after drinking _Salmonella_-contaminated milk produced at a factory in western France. French authorities have said there were 38 _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype Agona infections reported between mid-August and December 2017, 36 of them clearly linked to Lactalis milk. A group representing victims' families say at least 10 more cases are unaccounted for.

The same strain of _Salmonella_ was also responsible for some infections in 2005, Lactalis Chief Executive Emmanuel Besnier told French business paper Les Echos, adding it was possible other infections had occurred since then. "It can not be excluded that babies have consumed contaminated milk over this period," Besnier said, questioning the effectiveness of 16 000 tests performed by an unidentified private laboratory that had revealed nothing.

Besnier said Lactalis was stopping production at one of its facilities at the factory in Craon due to the outbreak. In 2005, the plant was owned by Celia, a company taken over by Lactalis in 2006. "If the analysis of end-products had revealed the presence of _S._ Agona, we would of course not have marketed the products and we would have avoided the crisis," Lactalis said in a statement.

The victims' association said it had read Besnier's comments with "dismay". "These are several hundred million boxes concerned and several hundred thousand tons of products sent to more than 80 countries. This is a health scandal of unprecedented scale," it said in a statement. "This implies that the victims could have been much more numerous."

Besnier said the scandal was "the biggest crisis I've ever had to face as a boss. We can't say definitively but (the cost) will be very high, several hundred million euros," he told Les Echos. "This case could cost us our export license for a still undetermined period," he added.

Besnier did not give details of what the costs would be.
