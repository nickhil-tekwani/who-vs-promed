New Caledonia and Australian experts have on Thursday [20 Mar 2008]
announced they had agreed on a joint approach that would avoid the
mass cull of thousands of cattle after the introduction of a tick
fever imported with Australian infected bulls in November last year [2007].

A team of top experts, sent by the Australian government, has been
assessing the situation in New Caledonia for the past 5 days. Their
main mission was to assist local authorities to contain and possibly
treat a contamination from the Australian-introduced tick fever,
known as babesiosis.

The "assessment mission" is headed by Australia's health services
chief veterinary Andy Carroll, who also happens to be a specialist in
the bovine tick fever currently affecting the French Pacific territory.

After assessing the situation, Carroll told local media New
Caledonian authorities had agreed to prefer the chemical treatment of
the ticks, instead of a massive cull that could have proved
catastrophic for local breeders.

Last week, back in Australia's federal capital Canberra, Agriculture
Minister Tony Burke told Parliament one of the possibilities would be
to treat affected cattle in New Caledonia with a chemical called
Imazol [should read Imizol], which would kill the tick fever
organisms in the cattle and prevent further transmission of the
disease to ticks.

"They have an approach of treating the animals, whereas we, in New
Caledonia, have a policy of complete eradication of the disease," New
Caledonia's Agriculture Minister Eric Babin said last week ahead of
the Australian mission.

But the [Imazol] treatment was finally the preferred solution, mainly
because it would be less traumatizing, New Caledonia's government
announced on Thursday [20 Mar 2008]. The treatment would be applied
to as many as 4500 cattle.

Cattle farmers throughout New Caledonia welcomed the announcement
with a sigh of relief.

New Caledonia's President Harold Martin hailed the Australian
government's "swift response" to the crisis and the fact Canberra had
sent "top level experts" to help implement a plan to combat the infection.

As part of the deal, Australia will also bear the costs of the
[Imazol] chemical treatment and will deploy 4 veterinarians to
provide backup to local veterinary and health services. The treatment
is expected to begin at the weekend. However, the emergency measures
introduced earlier this month [March 2008], including a system of
confinement, remain in place.

New Caledonia's government had passed emergency regulations that de
facto set up exclusion zones for New Caledonia's 17 cattle farms that
have been in contact with one or several of the 43 Australia-imported animals.

All pastures are also closed to grazing for up to 10 months so that
any tick that could be there cannot contaminate more animals.

Buffer "protection" and "surveillance" zones also surround the
exclusion zones so as to prevent any contamination to neighboring
farms. Furthermore, New Caledonia's quarantine services will remain
closed for the next 2 months, which in effect means no animal,
whatever its race, can be introduced into the French Pacific territory.

"The owners of animals that were scheduled to arrive into New
Caledonia for the next 8 weeks have been notified so that they can
take appropriate steps," the local government said in a release after
its latest cabinet meeting.

Since last week, New Caledonia's local government has been taking a
series of drastic steps in response to the situation.

But on the official level, both New Caledonia's government and
Australian authorities insisted the situation was the result of
"shared responsibilities" and was therefore to be solved through a
"cooperative approach."

After it was established that an infected, Australia-imported bull
had contaminated at least one local animal, emergency animal health
measures have been put into place to contain a potential outbreak.

The 43 Australian infected bulls arrived in New Caledonia on 23 Nov
2007. But apparently contrary to the procedure, they had been
injected with a vaccine [according to previous publications, a live,
tissue culture derived _B. bovis_ vaccine. - Mod.AS].

New Caledonian authorities said at the time the accompanying
certificates and declarations upon entry into New Caledonia falsely
stipulated that the animals had never been vaccinated and had never
come in contact with ticks.

[Bovine babesiosis, an OIE notifiable cattle disease, is caused by
protozoan parasites of the genus _Babesia_, order _Piroplasmida_,
phylum _Apicomplexa_. Of the species affecting cattle, 2 -- _Babesia
bovis_ and _B. bigemina_ -- are widely distributed and of major
importance in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America.
According to reputable sources, the current event in New Caledonia
involved _B.bovis_. The principal vector of _B. bovis_ is the tick
_Boophilus microplus_. The tick is present there, but up to November
2007, the island was regarded free of the parasite.

_B. bovis_ infections are characterized by high fever, ataxia,
anorexia, general circulatory shock, and sometimes also nervous signs
as a result of sequestration of infected erythrocytes in cerebral
capillaries. Infected animals develop a life-long immunity against
re-infection with the same species.

Calves rarely show clinical signs of disease after infection; this
feature has been exploited in some countries to immunise cattle
against babesiosis. Most of these live vaccines contain specially
selected strains of _Babesia_ and are produced in
government-supported production facilities as services to the
livestock industries, in particular in Australia, Argentina, South
Africa, Israel and Uruguay. Generally, such vaccinations are
restricted to enzootically-infected regions. For further details, see
chapter 2.3.8. in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00059.htm>.

Cattle can be cleared from _Babesia_ infection by repeated treatment
with long acting highly efficient chemicals like Imizol or Diminazene
aceturate. However, the drug has not the same effect in all infected
cattle, and some of them may still carry parasites after the end of
the treatment regime. This is particularly true when involving _B.
bovis_, which is more resistant to anti-babesia drugs than _B. bigemina_.

The rate of infection of the ticks depends upon the level of
parasitemia in the bovine host, but even very low parasitemias in
carrier cattle may infect ticks. In addition, there is currently no
reliable technique to detect latent carriers of _Babesia_ parasites
among previously infected cattle. Consequently, the chances of
achieving successful and complete eradication of _B.bovis_ by
chemotherapy is questionable.

According to experts consulted, it can be assumed that at present
babesiosis has not spread over the whole island and is limited to
restricted areas, therefore the general recommendation was to
slaughter all cattle in the infected herds as an efficient method to
prevent the spread of the disease.

Since babesiosis has been transmitted to local cattle, some pastures
are probably already infested with _B. bovis_ infected ticks. It has
been supposed that a generation of _Boophilus_ ticks will die off in
6 to 8 months in absence of bovine hosts. The reported decision to
exclude the exposed pastures from grazing for up to 10 months is thus
certainly justifiable.

Readers are encouraged to read ProMED-mail posting 20080313.1006 to
understand why the title was originally Tick fever. At the beginning
of the situation, it was unclear exactly which disease may have been
transported to New Caledonia. In order to maintain the tread and
avoid reader confusion, the title will remain Tick fever instead of
Babesiosis. - Mod.AS/TG].
