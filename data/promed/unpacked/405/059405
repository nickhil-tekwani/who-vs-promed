Deputy Public Health Minister Anuthin Chanweerakul yesterday, 10 Sep
2006, warned flood-affected villagers of leptospirosis, after 1400
cases were found in the past 8 months resulting in 31 deaths.
Anuthin insisted the disease could be prevented if people refrained
from wading through floodwater and muddy ground with bare feet, as
leptospirosis enters the body via wounds and scratches. He urged
flood-affected people to wear plastic boots and said the ministry had
prepared medication and supplies for the timely treatment of
leptospirosis patients.
Director-general of the Disease Control Department Dr Thawat
Sunthrajarn said 60 people in Nan province had contracted
leptospirosis; 44 were now hospitalized and 6 had died. Since the
diagnosis took some time to confirm, people with leptospirosis
symptoms would immediately be given antibiotics. Most people were
cured if they sought medical attention early enough, he said.
The disease, caused by leptospira bacteria, usually occurs during the
rainy season from Aug to Nov, and most cases were found in the
northeast and northern regions, Thawat said.
The leptospirosis scare had spread among Nan residents, prompting
villagers to wear boots whenever they went out, while some demanded
vaccinations for all family members. Chin Nantachai, a village
headman in Tha Wang Pha district, urged the government to send more
plastic boots to villagers.
In Phitsanulok, where many areas were flooded and some were suffering
from stagnant water, residents were warned of leptospirosis following
the discovery of 10 cases in Phrom Phiram, Bang Rakam, Bang Krathum
and Muang districts. In Kalasin there were 100 leptospirosis patients
but no deaths had been reported, said public health official Dr
Somyos Srijaranai.

[This spirochetal, zoonotic disese is generally spread from chronic
carrier animals -- often rodents but larger domesticated farm animals
may be implicated -- to humans through water contaminated with
infectious urine. Because of its association with water, outbreaks
are generally associated with flooding.
It is not clear from this posting how many cases of the 800 mentioned
were in the Northeastern area of Thailand where the province and city
of Nan are located as can be seen at the following URL:

Additionally, the methodology used to diagnose leptospirosis
(serology, dark field microscopy, culture) is also not stated. - Mod.LL]
