The Head of the Nazarabad Veterinary Department added that: "It was found with the follow-ups that the disease symptoms of the abandoned livestock were of anthrax, that is why immediate action was taken to carry out vaccinations, health measures and active and passive care [surveillance] of the livestock in the livestock farms located within a radius of 3 kilometers from the said [index] livestock farm.

[Nazarabad is a city in, and the capital of Nazarabad County, Alborz Province, Iran. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazarabad_County)

Alborz is a province in northern Iran, close to the Caspian sea.

Until recently anthrax was rarely reported in Iran. That 20 dead cattle were found after the event and the carcasses dumped in a desert area indicate it is still under-reported. Awareness would have initiated an immediate veterinary response as soon as the 1st animals died. The owner hid this decimation of his herd from the authorities. When anthrax is sporadic it is very important for the veterinary service to maintain awareness of the possibility of acute unexpected deaths, for the livestock owners to quickly inform their veterinarian, and thus initiation of diagnostic laboratory confirmation and the proper disposal of any carcasses. Hopefully, this report in the local newspapers and television will reawake this need and awareness.

We apologise for the late reporting of this news. Somehow the proper initial response went astray. Our thanks to Mahmoud for reminding us and resubmitting this news report. - Mod.MHJ
