People inoculated against COVID-19 are just as likely to spread the delta variant of the virus to contacts in their household as those who haven't had shots, according to new research. In a yearlong study of 621 people in the United Kingdom with mild COVID-19, scientists found that their peak viral load was similar regardless of vaccination status, according to a paper published on [Thu 28 Oct 2021] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal. The analysis also found that 25% of vaccinated household contacts still contracted the disease from an index case, while 38% of those who hadn't had shots became infected.

The results go some way toward explaining why the delta variant is so infectious even in nations with successful vaccine rollouts, and why the unvaccinated can't assume they are protected because others have had shots. Those who were inoculated cleared the virus more quickly and had milder cases, while unvaccinated household members were more likely to suffer from severe disease and hospitalization.

"Our findings show that vaccination alone is not enough to prevent people from being infected with the delta variant and spreading it in household settings," said Ajit Lalvani, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London who co-led the study. "The ongoing transmission we are seeing between vaccinated people makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated to protect themselves."

Vaccination was found to reduce household transmission of the alpha variant -- first discovered in the UK in late 2020 -- by between 40% and 50%, and infected vaccinated individuals had a lower viral load in the upper respiratory tract than those who hadn't had shots. The delta variant has been the dominant strain globally for some time, however.

The research also showed that immunity from full vaccination waned in as little as 3 months. The authors said there wasn't enough data to advise on whether this should lead to a change in the UK's booster policy, where 3rd doses are currently being offered to older and more vulnerable people 6 months after their 2nd shot.

Community transmission and viral load kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the UK: a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study. Lancet Infectious Diseases. Published: 29 Oct 2021 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(21)00648-4

Summary
Background
"The SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant is highly transmissible and spreading globally, including in populations with high vaccination rates. We aimed to investigate transmission and viral load kinetics in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with mild delta variant infection in the community.
Methods
"Between [13 Sep 2020], and [15 Sep 2021], 602 community contacts (identified via the UK contact-tracing system) of 471 UK COVID-19 index cases were recruited to the Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19 in Contacts cohort study and contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples from daily sampling for up to 20 days. Household and non-household exposed contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory tract. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 231 contacts exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked delta variant-infected index cases. We compared viral load trajectories from fully vaccinated individuals with delta infection (n=29) with unvaccinated individuals with delta (n=16), alpha (B.1.1.7; n=39), and pre-alpha (n=49) infections. Primary outcomes for the epidemiological analysis were to assess the 2ary attack rate (SAR) in household contacts stratified by contact vaccination status and the index cases' vaccination status. Primary outcomes for the viral load kinetics analysis were to detect differences in the peak viral load, viral growth rate, and viral decline rate between participants according to SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status.
Findings
"The SAR in household contacts exposed to the delta variant was 25% (95% CI 18-33) for fully vaccinated individuals compared with 38% (24-53) in unvaccinated individuals. The median time between 2nd vaccine dose and study recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected individuals (median 101 days [IQR 74-120]) than for uninfected individuals (64 days [32-97], p=0.001). SAR among household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was similar to household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (25% [95% CI 15-35] for vaccinated vs 23% [15-31] for unvaccinated). A total of 12 (39%) of 31 infections in fully vaccinated household contacts arose from fully vaccinated epidemiologically linked index cases, further confirmed by genomic and virological analysis in 3 index case-contact pairs. Although peak viral load did not differ by vaccination status or variant type, it increased modestly with age (difference of 0.39 [95% credible interval -0.03 to 0.79] in peak log10 viral load per mL between those aged 10 years and 50 years). Fully vaccinated individuals with delta variant infection had a faster (posterior probability >0.84) mean rate of viral load decline (0.95 log10 copies per mL per day) than did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha (0.69), alpha (0.82), or delta (0.79) variant infections. Within individuals, faster viral load growth was correlated with higher peak viral load (correlation 0.42 [95% credible interval 0.13 to 0.65]) and slower decline (-0.44 [-0.67 to -0.18]).
Interpretation
"Vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and accelerates viral clearance. Nonetheless, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts. Host-virus interactions early in infection may shape the entire viral trajectory."

The study points to vaccine waning as early as 3 months following vaccination, thus it is important for all eligible people to receive booster shots. Furthermore, the findings support continued public health and social measures to curb transmission -- such as mask wearing, social distancing, and testing, even in vaccinated individuals. - Mod.LK]

[2] Vaccination

The Infectious Diseases Society of America strongly supports CDC's recommendation that unvaccinated people previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 get vaccinated as soon as possible after they have fully recovered. New data demonstrate a higher, more robust and more consistent level of immunity with vaccination than with COVID-19 infection alone. Vaccination after COVID-19 infection significantly improves protection from reinfection and hospitalization.

Vaccination offers the best protection against COVID-19, even after infection. People shouldn't assume catching COVID-19 and recovering generates enough immunity to keep them safe in the long term. "Everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated needs to get vaccinated, regardless of their previous infection status. The COVID-19 vaccines help maximize protection against reinfection, serious illness, hospitalization, and death."

Today, CDC published new science reinforcing that vaccination is the best protection against COVID-19. In a new MMWR examining more than 7000 people across 9 states who were hospitalized with COVID-like illness, CDC found that those who were unvaccinated and had a recent infection were 5 times more likely to have COVID-19 than those who were recently fully vaccinated and did not have a prior infection.

The data demonstrate that vaccination can provide a higher, more robust, and more consistent level of immunity to protect people from hospitalization for COVID-19 than infection alone for at least 6 months.

"We now have additional evidence that reaffirms the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, even if you have had prior infection. This study adds more to the body of knowledge demonstrating the protection of vaccines against severe disease from COVID-19. The best way to stop COVID-19, including the emergence of variants, is with widespread COVID-19 vaccination and with disease prevention actions such as mask wearing, washing hands often, physical distancing, and staying home when sick," said CDC director Dr Rochelle P Walensky.

The study looked at data from the VISION Network that showed among adults hospitalized with symptoms similar to COVID-19, unvaccinated people with prior infection within 3--6 months were 5.49 times more likely to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated within 3-6 months with mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines. The study was conducted across 187 hospitals. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. They prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. CDC continues to recommend everyone 12 and older get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 vaccination can provide immunity and protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness.
What is added by this report?
Among COVID-19-like illness hospitalizations among adults aged ≥18 years whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, the adjusted odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among unvaccinated adults with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were 5.49-fold higher than the odds among fully vaccinated recipients of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine who had no previous documented infection (95% confidence interval = 2.75-10.99).
What are the implications for public health practice?
All eligible persons should be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, including unvaccinated persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.LK]

[3] Monoclonal antibody
Date: Thu 28 Oct 2021

Researchers this week published interim results in The New England Journal of Medicine from a Phase 3 study of the COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment sotrovimab, sponsored by Vir Biotechnology and GlaxoSmithKline. The study found that compared to the placebo group, COVID-19 patients who received sotrovimab had a significantly reduced risk of hospitalization or death and that the treatment, which was administered by intravenous infusion on an outpatient basis, was safe.

Of the 583 study participants included in this analysis, 3 participants who received sotrovimab and 21 participants in the placebo group experienced disease progression that led to hospitalization or death, representing a risk reduction of 85% in people with COVID-19 who received the monoclonal antibody treatment. Among the participants who were hospitalized, 5 participants were admitted to intensive care units and one participant died, all of whom were in the placebo group.

These results are part of an interim analysis of the COMET-ICE Trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multicenter trial that enrolled participants across 37 sites in 4 countries, including at the COVID-19 Clinical Research Center (CCRC) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Fred Hutch scientists at the CCRC, which opened in October 2020, have collaborated with health care providers, research institutes, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries and volunteer study participants to study the safety and efficacy of five potential COVID-19 treatments. These studies focused on understanding whether providing outpatient treatment early in the course of COVID-19 infection could reduce severe disease, hospitalization and long-lasting symptoms.

"We've lost more than 4 million people globally to COVID-19, and many more have experienced serious illness, so it's clear that we need multiple strategies to control the pandemic," said Dr Adrienne Shapiro, a physician-researcher at Fred Hutch and University of Washington Medicine, and the corresponding author of the study. "Effective vaccines are the foundation for prevention and curbing the epidemic, but COVID-19 treatments are still needed for people who are immunocompromised or for people who don't have access to COVID vaccines yet."

The study authors pointed out that sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment that targets a highly conserved epitope of the virus, could be more effective at blocking variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus because this region of the virus doesn't appear to mutate as rapidly as other parts of the virus. In lab studies, sotrovimab was effective against delta and all other circulating variants of concern. Based on the science of how this antibody treatment was identified, study authors hypothesized that sotrovimab could remain effective even if the virus continues to evolve and create new variants of concern.

"These results are possible because of cooperation among scientists at numerous trial sites across 4 counties and thanks to the participants, including those here in Seattle, who volunteered to help move the science forward," said Dr Rachel Bender Ignacio, a physician-scientist at Fred Hutch and UW Medicine, and the medical director of the COVID-19 Clinical Research Center at Fred Hutch. "We've been honored to play a part in better understanding ways to help people with COVID-19 heal more quickly and hopefully minimize spread of the virus."

To qualify for study enrolment, participants were required to have a positive COVID-19 test, be within 5 days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and have at least one risk factor for developing a more serious course of illness. Risk factors were defined as being 55 years of age or older or having at least one of the following health conditions: diabetes for which medication was warranted, obesity, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or moderate to severe asthma.

The study was initiated before COVID vaccines were widely available in the US. Early treatments that can prevent hospitalization for COVID-19 continue to be important for people who are not yet vaccinated and for those who are immunocompromised such as cancer patients, bone marrow transplant recipients and people who take immunosuppressive medicines. When used in tandem with vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions, treatments for COVID-19 could reduce the overall spread and burden of COVID-19 disease.

"As long as people are getting COVID-19, there is a need for effective treatment to prevent serious illness and death," said Dr Shapiro. "Based on these efficacy results, we are excited for the potential of sotrovimab--which now has emergency use authorization from the FDA--to reduce hospitalizations and thus relieve the burden of hospital crowding, another serious consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic."

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107934?query=featured_coronavirus

Discussion
"This trial has implications beyond showing the therapeutic value of sotrovimab. First, the results indicate that a single binding antibody against the non-receptor-binding motif, which does not directly block the ACE2 receptor interaction, can be clinically therapeutic, and thus the results suggest a role for other receptors. (27) Second, because sotrovimab has potent effector function, the efficacy and absence of safety signals suggest that effector function is neither detrimental nor associated with antibody-dependent enhancement.(26) In fact, preclinical models of COVID-19 suggest that the potent effector function of this agent may be beneficial. (13,14)

"The results of this interim analysis of COMET-ICE indicate that sotrovimab can be a therapeutic agent for outpatients with COVID-19. Notably, a 500-mg dose may also permit intramuscular administration, which may increase the convenience of and access to therapeutic antibody agents for patients with COVID-19. Studies are currently under way to evaluate this route of administration. Given its in vitro activity against variants of interest and concern,14 as well as its ability to neutralize other sarbecoviruses, we speculate that sotrovimab has the potential to remain therapeutically active even as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve.

Conclusions
"Among high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, sotrovimab reduced the risk of disease progression. No safety signals were identified."
