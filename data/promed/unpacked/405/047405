Hepatitis B prevalence reaches 75 per cent in Guangdong Province
---------------------------------------------------------------
SHANGHAI: The use of dirty needles in injections and acupuncture has helped
give the southern province of Guangdong one of the highest rates of
hepatitis B infection in the world, officials and experts said yesterday.
Blood samples taken from patients during hospital visits [show that] 10
million people - 75 per cent of the province's population - have had the
potentially lethal disease, said Luo Huiming, of the Guangdong Disease
Control and Prevention Center. He said early surveys indicated that two
thirds of China's 1.26 billion people had been infected, compared with
about one in 20 Americans. As with HIV, hepatitis B is spread by contact
with infected blood or through sex, but hepatitis B is easier to catch
because it is 100 times more concentrated in the blood and can survive
briefly outside the human body.
Because of years of screening, most of China's blood supply is probably
safe from hepatitis B, said Liu Chongbo, a researcher at the China Academy
of Medical Prevention.
About 60 per cent of those who have had the disease caught it during
childhood, usually during routine vaccinations. Mothers also infect their
children during birth or while breastfeeding, Liu said. Most of those
infected with hepatitis B survive. But in some cases, the virus [continues
to] attack the liver, causing cirrhosis and cancer. These diseases kill
about 300 000 people in China each year, about 80 per cent of whom had
hepatitis B, Liu said.
Experts also blame an illegal trade in needles that have been inadequately
cleaned and repackaged. They also [say that] there [are] increasing reports
of infection from acupuncture, a traditional Chinese remedy in which dozens
of needles may be stuck into the skin. Effective vaccinations exist and are
now required for children in the United States. But at [US] $25, they are
too expensive for most Chinese and are not covered by national health
insurance.
