Uganda issues new banana disease alert
--------------------------------------
Uganda has put its national crop disease surveillance network on
alert for a possible outbreak of a new incurable banana virus. The
Director for Crop Resources in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Opolot
Okasaai, said the _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV), is likely to
strike from across Rwanda or DR-Congo, threatening the local banana industry.

This will be a major blow to the agricultural sector following a
recent banana bacterial wilt disease (BBWD) attack, which has
devastated over 50 districts in the country [see ProMED-mail post no.
20090311.1006 for update].

Already Rwanda, DR Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, and Gabon have reported
the [BBTV] problem. Dr Okasaai said all available banana varieties in
the country were vulnerable. Following the new threat, the government
has sent a scientific team to Rwanda to assess the danger. "We are
also alerting all farmers and district agricultural officers,
especially on the western borders, to be on the look out," Dr Okasaai
said. Dr David Talengera, a senior banana researcher at the National
Agricultural Research Laboratories, said, "We intend to develop
guidelines on handling this disease."

Scientists have also developed a national banana virus index. The
viruses identified are abaca mosaic potyvirus (AbMV), banana bract
mosaic potyvirus (BBMV), banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), cucumber
mosaic cucumovirus (CMV), and banana streak badnavirus (BSV). BSV is
reported to be the major virus problem affecting banana production in Uganda.

Uganda has one of the highest per capita matooke (green bananas)
consumption in the world. Matooke occupies 38 percent of Uganda's
arable land, accounting for food security to over 12 million
Ugandans. But in the last 5 years, production has sharply decreased
due to numerous diseases and pest attacks.

[2] Cuba: BSV species, 1st report

[Ref: E Javer et al: Identification of _Banana streak virus_ species
Goldfinger, Imove, Mysore, and Obino l'Ewai in _Musa_ spp. in Cuba.
BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 18: August 2008-January 2009]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Banana streak virus_ (BSV) species are widespread in _Musa_ spp.
They are naturally transmitted by several mealybug species in a
semipersistent mode and by activation of endogenous sequences
integrated in the genome of _Musa balbisiana_, one of the progenitors
of synthetic and natural hybrids. Typical symptoms include yellow
streaks on leaves, splitting of the pseudostem, and abnormal
emergence of the bunch from the middle of the pseudostem, bearing
fewer fruits of smaller size.

Although leaf streaks and pseudostem splitting symptoms have been
previously observed in Cuba, BSV species were never identified.
Bacilliform particles were observed by immunosorbent electron
microscopy in plantain but the polyclonal antiserum used was raised
against several badnavirus species and is therefore not specific to
BSV. Given that this virus has never been confirmed in Cuba, field
surveys were started in 2007, to study the occurrence, incidence, and
diversity of BSV species in dessert and cooking bananas. Leaf samples
were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic plants nationwide,
and indexed separately for the four BSV species, Goldfinger (BSGFV),
Imove (BSImV), Mysore (BSMysV), and Obino l'Ewai (BSOLV) by multiplex
immunocapture PCR.

All 4 BSV species were detected in several samples each: BSGFV was
detected in FHIA25 hybrid (AAB) in Havana, Granma, and Pinar del Rio;
BSMysV was detected in cv. Yangambi km5 (AAA) in Granma and Santiago
de Cuba; BSImV was detected in FHIA25 hybrid in Havana and Pinar del
Rio, and in Giant Dwarf Cavendish (AAA) in Ciego de Avila; BSOLV was
detected in FHIA18 hybrid (AAAB) in Havana and in FHIA21 hybrid
(AAAB) in Havana, Pinar del Rio, Granma, Cienfuegos, and Santiago de
Cuba. Samples co-infected by species BSGFV and BSImV, were identified
in FHIA25 hybrid from Havana and Pinar del Rio whereas samples
co-infected by species BSGFV and BSOLV were detected in FHIA21 hybrid
from Havana, Pinar del Rio, Granma, and Cienfuegos.

For each BSV species, a selection of amplification products was
sequenced. The sequences share 96-100 percent homology with reference
sequences of BSGFV, BSImV, BSMysV, or BSOLV, respectively. This
report presents the 1st confirmation and identification of BSV species in Cuba.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus
_Babuvirus_ (family _Nanoviridae_) and only affects _Musa_ species.
It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of
chlorosis, stunting, and death of the host plant. The virus is
spreading in Africa (see ProMED-mail post no. 20090127.0372),
Australasia, and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is transmitted by the
banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_, and infectious insects may be
spread on plant material. The virus is also spread with infected
suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (for example
cutting tools).

Disease management is difficult and may include vector control,
removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material, and frequent
scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV is
usually impossible. Tolerant varieties may still support virus
replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs. For more
information on BBTV see previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.

_Banana streak virus_ (BSV; genus _Badnavirus_) is a highly variable
virus with many strains of different levels of virulence. Several
separate related viral species have now been classified in the banana
streak group. Symptoms may include chlorotic leaf streaks, leaf
necrosis, death of pseudostem, or there may be no symptoms at all.
BSV is thought to be transmissible by mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_),
and diseased plant material may serve as a reservoir. It is
transmitted by seed but not by mechanical means. Disease management
mainly relies on pathogen exclusion. For more information on BSV see
ProMED-mail post no. 20070810.2601 and links below.

All banana viruses mentioned above can also be transmitted with
tissue cultures, which are often used to propagate and transfer new
hybrids of the crop. Virus indexing of these cultures is therefore
vital to prevent pathogen introductions to new areas.

Cultivated bananas are related to either _Musa acuminata_ (A) and/ or
_M. balbisiana_ (B), and the specific genetic background of
hybrids is indicated by these letters.
