Macedonia mumps epidemic tops 2000 cases
----------------------------------------
Another 135 cases of mumps were registered in [FYR] Macedonia on
Thursday [5 Feb 2009], raising the total number of infected to over
2000 across the country, the Health Ministry said. Of the
newly-infected patients 10 had to be hospitalized due to the severity
of their condition. Around 50 patients, mainly children, have been
hospitalized in total. Earlier this week, health authorities kicked
off an emergency mass vaccination campaign to deal with the outbreak,
aimed at all children aged 15-19 that had not been vaccinated before.
Some parents asked schools to shut down provisionally until the
outbreak is contained, but authorities have not reached a formal decision yet.

Mumps is a viral infectious disease that mainly attacks children. It
is spread from person to person through contact with respiratory
secretions such as saliva, but can also be spread by sharing food,
drinks, and kissing. Symptoms including swelling of the glands close
to the jaw, fever, headache and muscle ache. Mumps is considered a
mild to moderate disease, but carries the risk of complications
including hearing loss, meningitis, sterility in men and spontaneous
miscarriage.

[This mumps epidemic in FYR Macedonia is unusually large. However the
report gives no indication of the period of time involved in the
accumulation of the 2000 cases and the recent increment of 135 cases.
Clarification would be welcome. - Mod.CP
