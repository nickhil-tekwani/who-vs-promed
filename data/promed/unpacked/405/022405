Contagious agalactia - United Kingdom
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 31 Oct 2014 from Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 24 Oct 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 24 Oct 2014
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical disease
Causal agent: _Mycoplasma agalactiae_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, Wales
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Oct 2014
Outbreak status: resolved (25 Oct 2014)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 4 / 1 / 0 / 4 / 0 /
Affected population: One out of 4 goats in a single consignment imported onto a smallholding from an area endemic for contagious agalactia tested positive for the pathogen _Mycoplasma agalactiae_.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 25 / 0 / 0 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals.
Epidemiological comments:
- The animals were tested as part of our risk based post import checks regime and serology results were inconclusive for one animal.
- Restrictions were placed on all the animals and further tests detected the presence of the pathogen in milk samples from that animal.
- All animals were clinically well but have been humanely destroyed and cleansing and disinfection were carried out on the small holding.
- No other susceptible animals were present at the holding and there are no contact tracings with other susceptible species. The initial epidemiological investigations have concluded that the risk of spread of the pathogen is very low and the United Kingdom (UK) Veterinary Services have not confirmed the presence of the disease in the UK. Note by the OIE World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department: Since this is the 1st time that contagious agalactia is identified in the history of the country, the reason for notification as 1st occurrence applies to the country but the event is in fact limited to a zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge (OIE's reference laboratory) / Goats / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 24 Oct 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Contagious agalactia is a disease of sheep and goats that is characterised by mastitis, arthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis, and has been known for nearly 200 years. It occurs in Europe, Asia, the USA, and North Africa, and is mainly caused by _Mycoplasma agalactiae_ (Ma). An upsurge of contagious agalactia, caused by Ma, has been seen in sheep in Spain and France recently with increased cases reported in and around the Pyrenees and new outbreaks being reported in Corsica. Frequent and numerous outbreaks occur in Iran and Mongolia. In recent years, _M. capricolum_ subsp. _Capricolum_ (Mcc) and _M. mycoides_ subsp. _Capri_ (formerly _M. mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ LC [LC = large colonies]) have also been isolated from sheep and goats with mastitis and arthritis in many countries, including those in South America and Australasia.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.7.5 "Contagious agalactia", available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.05_CONT_AGALACT.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2013)

The following information was obtained from: "Mycoplasma diseases of ruminants 2008" (http://tinyurl.com/nw62to6, CAB International (Nicholas R, Ayling R, McAuliffe L, editors), chapter 8 "Contagious agalactia" pp. 98-113:

- Geographical distribution
"CA [contagious agalactia] has been reported in southern Europe, in particular France, Portugal, Spain, Greece, and Italy (Bergonier et al, 1997), the Balkans including FYR Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania (Cokrevski et al, 2001), Turkey (Ozdemir et al, 2005), Israel (Bar-Moshe et al, 1984), Jordan (Al-Momani et al, 2006), India, the USA, South America, and North Africa (Nicholas, 2002). Serious problems exist in Iran, where over 1300 cases were reported in 2006 (OIE, 2008). _M. mycoides_ LC has also been reported from arthritic goats and cattle recently in New Zealand (OIE, 2004)."

- Molecular epidemiology
In this section the following is noted: "As _M. agalactiae_ shows differing prevalence across the world, and as it is currently absent from some countries, notably the UK, there is a need for molecular epidemiological techniques which enable a high degree of strain differentiation, allowing the tracing of the source of disease outbreaks."

For further information on contagious agalactia, including a chapter on geographic distribution, subscribers are referred to the article published in 2014, "_Mycoplasma agalactiae_, an Etiological Agent of Contagious Agalactia in Small Ruminants: A Review," available at http://www.hindawi.com/journals/vmi/2014/286752/

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to contagious agalactia are spelled out in 14.4 chapter of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://tinyurl.com/kfcbnoh.

Pictures of clinical signs and post mortem lesions, can be seen at http://tinyurl.com/nw62to6

There is no evidence that _M. agalactiae_ is a threat to human health (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/contagious_agalactia.pdf). - Mods.CRD/AS
