About 280 of 490 children and 4 teachers reported gastro-intestinal
symptoms withn a one-week period . Although the outbreak had an explosive
onset (143 cases on the first day), no common source has yet been
identified. Norwalk-like virus has now been confirmed as the etiological
agent by the laboratory. Symptoms, incubation time, duration, and evidence
of secondary spread within the childrens' families were consistent with a
viral etiology, probably Norwalk-like virus. Reported symptoms included
vomiting (most frequent symptom), diarrea, and sometimes fever. Incubation
time was 10 and 48 hours. Stool samples were negative for bacterial
pathogens. 7 of 13 stool samples examined by the CDC laboratory were
positive for Norwalk-like virus genotype 1 by PCR.
