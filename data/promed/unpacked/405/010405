I respectfully suggest that this seems to be an issue regarding the
definition of "native." In a natural history sense, "native" is similar
to, but not the same as, "endemic". The classification of a mammal as
"native or non-native" certainly does not follow the same rules as
classifying a disease as "endemic or exotic." There are several sources
that state that the opossum is not native to California. Some from the
internet include the following:
A link from California Fish and Game's website, states that that "opossums
are not native to California."
<http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/species/nuis_exo/nuis_exo.shtml>
The National Park Service's website for the Presidio of San Francisco
states that "...this species was introduced to California in 1910."
<http://www.nps.gov/prsf/nathist1/wildlife/mammals/virginia_opossum.htm>
Biologists generally do not consider a species "native" if it has been in
an area for such a short span of time (relatively speaking)....and
certainly not if it was introduced by humans. I think few people would
consider the rabbit to be a species "native" to the continent of Australia,
but it has certainly been an "endemic" problem there since the late 1700's.

[The discussion about the marsupial in question has been fascinating, but
no one has addressed the issue of how a parasite from a land-dwelling
marsupial found itself in a sea otter. Perhaps we simply do not know, or
there are no research dollars to find out. If someone can answer that
question it would be appreciated, but otherwise, the discussion on the
marsupial is terminated. - Mod.TG]
