Last month Vermont became the 31st state to confirm a case of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome [HPS. As of 8 May 2000, 250 cases had been reported in
the USA since it was first identified in 1993. Of those, 101 victims died.
This year [2000, California, Kansas and Colorado have each reported one
death. On Friday [26 May 2000, California officials reported the second
case this spring in Yolo County in the north. The victim is recovering.
"We get calls from people in California saying we're going to New Mexico
and asking how to avoid [HPS infection. We say there are cases in
California, too. We need to change some thinking there," said Joni Young,
hantavirus surveillance coordinator for the Centers for Disease Control &
Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
Canadian authorities reported the death Friday [26 May 2000 of a
68-year-old southwestern Manitoba woman of the disease, bringing their
death toll to 13.
Dr. Harvey Artsob of the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal
Health in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said all confirmed cases of the virus in
Canada have been in the western provinces. "But we find the virus
coast-to-coast in deer mice and the potential for the disease exists across
the country."
Young, Artsob and Colorado state epidemiologist John Pape say there is no
doubt many cases go undetected because doctors are not familiar with the
disease.
