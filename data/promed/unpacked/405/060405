13 cases investigated for link to Pennsylvania store outbreak
-------------------------------------------
A salmonella outbreak, linked to Sheetz convenience stores in Pennsylvania,
may have crossed the line into Ohio. The Ohio Department of Health is
reporting 13 laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonella in people who had
eaten at Sheetz. However, as of Tuesday afternoon [20 Jul 2004], just 2 of
those 13 cases were confirmed to be the same bacterial strain -- known as
Javiana -- that's being investigated in Pennsylvania.
3 of Ohio's cases are in Summit County, and 4 are in Stark. There are 2
cases in Mahoning County and one each in Medina, Cuyahoga, Lorain, and
Tuscarawas counties.
Pennsylvania health officials said, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that 110 people
were sickened in that state after eating at Sheetz. The Food and Drug
Administration reported additional illnesses in Maryland and West Virginia.
It's too soon to say, however, whether any of Ohio's cases are linked to
Sheetz, health officials said.
"All we know right now is that we have 4 cases of salmonella," said Stark
County Health Commissioner William Franks. "The investigation has not been
completed in terms of what they ate, where they ate, and whether there's
any connection."
"There is a lot of salmonella around," said Dr. Marguerite Erme, head
of epidemiology at the Akron Health Department. "Just because you've eaten
at Sheetz, that doesn't mean that eating at Sheetz caused the illness."
The local health departments are performing "very extensive food
interviews" with those who were infected, as well as with acquaintances who
may have eaten at Sheetz without getting sick.
"You have to get down as close to possible to the source [of the
infection]," Erme said. "You can't just say, 'it's this sandwich.' It may
only be one component of the sandwich.''
Pennsylvania officials had believed that tainted tomatoes or lettuce, or
both, were to blame for the illnesses, because those who got sick ate those
foods, and because they ingested a strain of salmonella usually found on
produce. But, tests of the tomatoes -- supplied by Wheeling, WV based
Coronet Foods -- turned up a different strain of salmonella than that
identified in those who have been sick.
"We have to keep looking," said Richard McGarvey, a spokesman for the
Pennsylvania Health Department.
Sheetz, based in Altoona, PA, pulled all tomatoes and lettuce from its
300-plus stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia,
and North Carolina, after the salmonella cases were 1st reported last week
[2nd week July 2004]. The stores sanitized their deli areas, switched
suppliers, and brought in new produce.
Those sickened in Pennsylvania bought sandwiches from at least 16 Sheetz
stores, company officials have said.

Salmonella investigation now focused on tomatoes
--------------------------------------------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun trying to find the sources
of the tomatoes, used in sandwiches at Sheetz convenience stores, to
determine what might have caused a regional salmonella outbreak.
FDA is moving ahead with the tomato search -- called a "trace-back" -- even
though public health officials haven't yet determined whether tomatoes,
lettuce, or some other food product was the vehicle for the salmonella
contamination, said Ellen Morrison, director of crisis management at FDA.
State agriculture officials found, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that one tomato
sample from Sheetz was contaminated with salmonella. But, it turned out
that it was a different strain of the bacteria than the one blamed in the
multistate outbreak, which has sickened roughly 160 people.
"Normally, we wait for a particular food to be implicated in an outbreak
before we begin a trace-back," said Morrison. "But, we felt, as a
precaution, we should begin a trace-back of the tomatoes."
The number of Pennsylvanians sickened grew by 20 yesterday [Tue 20 Jul
2004], to 130 cases, with anywhere from 16 to 50 people with salmonella in
other states linked to the outbreak.
Morrison noted there may never be a finding of just how food served at
Sheetz became contaminated.
"What people don't necessarily understand is that trace-back is not always
going to give you a definite answer," Morrison said.
Investigators looking at salmonella outbreaks linked to tomatoes in 1990
and 1993, for example, found practices, in a South Carolina packing shed,
that might have allowed for contamination. But, the precise cause wasn't
found, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a food safety expert at the University
of Minnesota.
Sheetz purchased 99 percent of the sliced Roma tomatoes distributed by its
supplier, Coronet Foods of Wheeling, WV. FDA officials visited Coronet
Foods last week [2nd week July 2004], a company official said, and they are
expected again this week, according to a West Virginia public health official.
An official of Coronet Foods said, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that the form of
salmonella found on its tomatoes does not typically cause illness in
humans. But, an investigator with the CDC disputed that.
"Just about any strain of salmonella can cause sickness in humans," said
Dr. Patricia Griffin, a salmonella expert with CDC.
The 130 cases in Pennsylvania are spread among 31 counties.
Allegheny County officials said yesterday [Tue 20 Jul 2004] that they have
recorded 12 salmonella cases associated with the outbreak. Even so, Dr.
Bruce Dixon, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, commented:
"The new cases are pretty much over."
Maryland has seen 20 cases of salmonella among people who had contact with
Sheetz, although it's not clear if they all ate at the stores. Nonetheless,
12 of them have probable, or confirmed, cases of the Javiana strain of
salmonella.
Ohio has seen 13 cases among patients reporting a food history at Sheetz,
including 2 sickened by the Javiana strain.
West Virginia was reporting 17 salmonella cases yesterday [Tue 20 Jul 2004]
among people who ate at Sheetz in June or July 2004. 2 of those were
sickened by the Javiana strain.

[It does appear that the organism isolate from the tomato was not _S.
enteritidis_ subtype Javiana. If this is the case, the source of this
multistate, spreading outbreak of salmonellosis remains uncertain. - Mod.LL]
