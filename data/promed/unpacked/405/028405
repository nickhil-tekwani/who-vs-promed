A new outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was detected by
Corrientes province sanitary authorities in the same San Luis del
Palmar area where another outbreak had been reported, but the numbers
of affected animals had not been accurately determined, according to
livestock industry sources.
New cases were discovered in a field near the community of San Juan,
where the first outbreak was detected in early February 2006, which
led to the destruction of more than 3600 animals. The area is still
under quarantine and surveillance by personnel from SENASA (National
Service for Agricultural Quality and Safety, according to its Spanish
initials), who already issued a warning of the possibility of a new
outbreak in nearby paddocks.
Production Minister Mr. Alfredo Aun and other officials held a meeting last
night to analyze the situation in light of the new cases, and it is expected
that by tomorrow [23 Feb 2006] some measures will be implemented to alleviate
the crisis affecting livestock farmers in the affected area, including the
possibility that the disease may spread to the 8 departments in which an
emergency had already been declared.
