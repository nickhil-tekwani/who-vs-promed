One case of botulism because of eating octopus escabeche led to concern and new recommendations issued by the Food Science area in Rio Negro (Argentina) Ministry of Health. A male subject living in Bahia Blanca developed the disease, and he has already been discharged.

The patient went to the Fiesta Nacional del Ajo (an event celebrating garlic) in Medanos, a place near Bahia Blanca, and he purchased a bottle containing marinated octopus. The seller declared he bought the octopus in San Antonio Este port.

According to the report, this product does not have an official authorization from the Departments in the local municipality. The product is sold in a bottle whose label shows an octopus in black and orange colors. Once the case was detected, a report to the Rio Negro local health authorities and the San Antonio Oeste Municipality was made indicating what the implied product was, in order to find the informal manufacturer and then seize the products. The manufacturer has not been found yet. Recommendations were issued because of the long religious holiday (the Christian Holy Week), considering that during this time period, Christian people (particularly Catholics) tend to more frequently eat fish and shellfish.

The provincial food science area pointed out that although botulism is not a frequently notified condition, "it is the most dangerous of poisoning cases". The toxin is produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria, and it is one of the most potent known poison substances.

Symptoms may start with gastrointestinal manifestations, followed by headache, vertigo, double vision, difficulty talking and swallowing, and progressive paralysis of the respiratory system. These symptoms may occur from 12 to 36 hours up to many days after eating the contaminated food. Botulism may lead to death.

It was also mentioned that in this Rio Negro area, the manufacture and trade of homemade pickled products are at risk, such a marinated fish and shellfish, Andean hare (vizcacha), wild boar, bell pepper, and other vegetables. Health authorities indicated that the most risky foods involved in these intoxication cases are low-acidity homemade pickled products, such as marinated meat, fish, and shellfish. Products with neutral or alkaline pH, such as asparagus and bell pepper, are thought to be particularly dangerous. It was also mentioned that foods contaminated with botulism toxin "do not always show alterations in their appearance, smell, or taste, the bottles/cans are not deformed, and their general aspect is normal. The toxin is destroyed by heat."

During the last 10 years, 7 cases of botulism had occurred in the area and 2 patients died. In January 2005, 2 persons developed the disease in Bariloche after eating homemade pastry. Both patients recovered, but with some sequelae. During the next year (2006), a case was reported in San Blas, Patagones community, because of eating homemade pickled oysters with no sanitary authorization. The affected person, a 49-year-old Cordoba tourist, died after spending some days hospitalized in Zatti Hospital in Viedma, where he was referred to. The epidemiological investigation was performed in Rio Negro. In February 2008, eating homemade pickled octopus with no sanitary authorization led to another case of botulism in a patient native to Tandil who recovered uneventfully, while in December 2009, 2 additional cases were reported. The affected persons were a couple who developed the disease after eating homemade pickled octopus in San Antonio Oeste. The woman died, and her husband recovered after spending 75 days in the hospital. Now, 6 years later, there is this new case in Bahia Blanca after eating marinated octopus purchased in San Antonio Este port.

[Escabeche (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escabeche) refers to a dish of either poached or fried fish (escabeche of chicken, rabbit or pork is common in Spain) marinated in an acidic mixture (pickled) before serving, and to the marinade itself. The dish is common in Spain and Latin America, and popular in Catalonia, Portugal, Provence and the Philippines. Influences of the dish appear as far as Asia-Pacific with adjustments to local food staples. It is usually served cold after marinating in a refrigerator overnight or longer. The acid in the marinade is usually vinegar, but can also include citrus juice. Escabeche is a popular presentation of canned or potted preserved fish, such as tuna, bonito or sardines. In the New World, versions of the basic marinade are often used with foods other than fish and meats -- for example, cassava or green bananas and chicken gizzards (Puerto Rico), jalapeno peppers (Mexico), etc. The origin of the word escabeche is Persian, and was brought to Spain by the Arabs during the Moorish conquests. The word derives from al-sikbaj, the name of a popular meat dish cooked in a sweet and sour sauce, usually vinegar and honey or date molasses.

If done properly the process of pickling will produce a pH low enough so any _C. botulinum_ spores will not germinate, producing the vegetative form that produces this potent neurotoxin. Care must be taken in home canning, whether making an escabeche or anything else, to produce an appropriately low pH. - Mod.LL
