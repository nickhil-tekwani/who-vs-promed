Infant botulism can be fatal, and there have been 6 cases in Canada in 2018. Canadian health agencies are investigating a spike in confirmed cases of infant botulism across the country. Between Jan and Apr 2018, 3 babies in Ontario, 2 in British Columbia, and 1 in Alberta suffered from the rare but potentially fatal form of food poisoning. It's a worrying trend, since there were no cases reported in Canada in 2017, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Typically, about 2 cases are reported per year, although 7 were identified in 2015.

The Public Health Agency of Canada said they have not identified the cause of the recent cases, but officials are looking for possible common exposures. "To date, none of the food samples tested have been positive for botulism," said Dr Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health. "Collecting a thorough history from the parent on anything consumed or put in the mouth by the infant is an important part of the investigation."

One known and avoidable cause of infant botulism is honey -- both raw and pasteurized. Although the natural sweetener is sometimes used on soothers, as a natural cough suppressant, or to replace sugar in homemade baby food, doctors recommend that parents keep honey away from children under the age of one. Here's everything you need to know about infant botulism and honey.

What is infant botulism and what causes it?
-------------------------------------------
It is a rare illness caused by food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterial spores. The spores germinate and grow in the infant's large intestine and produce a neurotoxin. It affects infants exclusively because adults and children more than 12 months old have more good bacteria in their gut that can help to prevent spore germination and release of the toxin. Botulism can also occur in adults who have altered gut flora or if the toxin has already been produced on contaminated food. The spores can also enter through open wounds.

What are the symptoms?
----------------------
Symptoms tend to revolve around a lack of muscle strength and movement. The earliest signs include difficulty feeding, weak sucking, trouble swallowing, and increased drooling. The baby may also make fewer facial expressions and have a different cry or trouble breathing. From there, the baby will become increasingly weak or "floppy." Although constipation is one of the most common signs, it may be overlooked as it is also a symptom for many other illnesses. Symptoms usually start to appear between 6 and 36 hours after ingesting contaminated food or drink, but it can take up to 10 days.

Why is honey so bad for infants?
--------------------------------
Botulism spores can be carried into a beehive on dust, dirt, or pollen and contaminate the honey. Pasteurization cannot reliably kill the spores and while that is no problem for adults and older children, whose intestinal bacteria can prevent germination and toxin production, babies under 12 months may not be able to do so. Even a little taste of honey is enough to make a baby sick. While most cases of infant botulism are not caused by honey -- only 3 of the 42 cases reported in Canada between 1979 and 2013 were linked to the sweet stuff -- it is the only avoidable source of exposure to the bacteria.

Other sources
-------------
The bacteria can be present in improperly canned or fermented foods, but people can also inhale botulism spores or ingest them when they come into contact with contaminated dirt. This makes it extremely difficult to identify avoidable sources other than honey or contaminated food. "It's just in the environment or dust," explained Bryna Warshawsky, the medical director of communicable disease at Public Health Ontario. "About 15 to 20 per cent comes from honey, the rest they don't really have a source."

Can it be treated?
------------------
There's no public vaccine for infant botulism, but it can be treated. Babies should be taken to a doctor as soon as possible so they can receive an antitoxin. They may also require a respiratory aid or a feeding tube. Stool samples are important for doctors to analyze to identify the toxin.

[The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL] Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Although not specifically stated in this post, botulism immune globulin (BIG) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
