Pennsylvania: mumber of hepatitis A cases still increasing
----------------------------------------------------------
MONACA: At least 130 people have contracted hepatitis A in an outbreak at a
mall's Mexican restaurant, authorities said on Thu 6 Nov 2003. At least 2
people were in critical condition. The Pennsylvania Health Department is
investigating the cause of the outbreak at Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant at
the Beaver Valley Mall, about 25 miles north west of Pittsburgh.
Officials suspect the virus was spread by a worker who failed to wash his
or her hands before handling food. An estimated 5000 people dined at the
restaurant between 22 Oct and 2 Nov 2003. Health Department spokesman
Richard McGarvey said officials ordered 8000 shots of immune globulin, an
antibody treatment that greatly reduces the chances of contracting the
disease if given within 14 days after exposure. About 2800 people were
immunized on Wed and 2400 more Thu 6 Nov 2003, McGarvey said.
The mall's restaurant has been closed since Mon 3 Nov 2003. Symptoms of
hepatitis A include fever, nausea, diarrhea, jaundice, fatigue, abdominal
pain, and loss of appetite. The disease usually clears up in about 2 months
[may be as little as 1 or 2 weeks, or several months. - Mod.SH]. While the
number of cases is at a historic low, outbreaks have occurred throughout
the nation. In September, about 280 people in Georgia and Tennessee were
sickened by contaminated green onions, including 210 people who ate at
restaurants in the Atlanta area. Pennsylvania health officials declined to
discuss the conditions of those sickened by the outbreak. University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center spokeswoman Lisa Rossi said 2 or 3 people were in
intensive care.

Hepatitis outbreak claims first fatality
----------------------------------------
A patient infected with hepatitis A died last night at UPMC Presbyterian,
the first fatality stemming from an outbreak of sickness that has been
traced to a Beaver County restaurant. The person who died was one of 3
patients who had been hospitalized in critical condition, said hospital
spokeswoman Susan Manko. Two other patients remained in fair condition.
Allegheny County Health Department Director Dr Bruce Dixon said it is
"decidedly unusual" for someone to die of hepatitis A, noting that less
than 1 per cent of those stricken with it die from the illness. The
fatality occurred as the number of confirmed hepatitis A cases rose to 185
yesterday and Pennsylvania officials worked to prevent those who were
sickened from inadvertently causing future outbreaks. The state Department
of Health announced late yesterday that it is extending a clinic at the
Beaver County Community College, offering shots of immune globulin today
and Monday. The antibody treatment lessens the chance of acquiring the
disease if given within 14 days of exposure.
While the majority of people treated at the clinic thus far have been those
who ate at the Chi-Chi's restaurant in the Beaver Valley Mall since Oct 22,
an increasing number are people with close contact to those recently
diagnosed with hepatitis. Public health authorities are keeping an eye out
for newly sick people who work in day care centers and restaurants. "It
continues to be a scramble to prevent additional cases. We don't want a
repeat of the Chi-Chi's," said Dr Andre Weltman, a public health physician
with the state. A sick restaurant employee who didn't follow hand-washing
rules is a possible cause of the hepatitis A outbreak.
When the Health Department finds restaurant and day-care workers who have
hepatitis A, it gives immune globulin to all other workers in the
establishment, Weltman said. The department also investigates to determine
what kind of job the sick worker performed and, depending on the
circumstances, advises patrons to also receive shots. "In 99 per cent or 98
per cent of the cases, you don't have to worry about the patrons," said
Richard McGarvey, spokesman for the Health Department.
People who ate at the Beaver Valley Chi-Chi's before Oct 22 and have no
hepatitis symptoms should take special care to wash their hands after using
the bathroom, Weltman said. The virus is contained in feces and an infected
person can shed the virus for up to 2 weeks before symptoms appear.
Transmission of the virus from person to person requires more than just
casual contact, however. Typically, a person is exposed to the virus by
eating a contaminated food item or placing a contaminated utensil or other
object in his mouth. Weltman noted that while the current number of cases
suggests that several hundred people might ultimately get sick, that's just
a fraction of the estimated 11 000 meals served at that Chi-Chi's last
month. "I don't want people to be upset just because they happen to know
someone who happened to eat there," he said.
Three investigators from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention will be assisting in the investigation and were expected to
arrive in Pennsylvania last night or sometime today. The state's public
health resources are being consumed by the prevention efforts and
assistance is needed with the ongoing investigation, said Jessica Seiders,
a state Health Department spokeswoman. As of 4 pm yesterday, a total of
6847 people had been screened and nearly 6400 had received shots of immune
globulin in 3 days at the clinic.
Restaurant inspections in Beaver, Butler and Washington counties have been
temporarily halted so that workers can concentrate on educating restaurant
employees in the area, said Donna Pinkham, spokeswoman for the state
Department of Agriculture. Those inspectors have visited 250 restaurants in
Beaver County this week, asking managers to inquire about the health of
workers and whether they had close contact with people involved in the
outbreak. All Pennsylvania restaurants will be required by December to
implement new food code regulations and Beaver-area establishments are
being asked to do so sooner, said John Stella, the Agriculture Department's
food safety regional supervisor. The new regulations prohibit bare-hand
contact with food that's ready to be served and demand that sick employees
be excused from work, he said. "We're going to every restaurant in Beaver
County in person," he said. "There have been employees from Chi-Chi's that
are working at other establishments, or had worked at Chi-Chi's and now
work somewhere else." In some cases, those restaurants are being asked to
call the Health Department. But none of those situations has constituted a
public health threat, said McGarvey.
Agriculture inspectors visited the Beaver Valley Chi-Chi's yesterday
morning and the inspection went well, Stella said. The restaurant might
reopen on Monday, he said. Officials with Prandium Inc, the Irvine,
California-based parent company of Chi-Chi's, didn't return phone calls
seeking comment. The outbreak in Beaver County was the latest dose of bad
news for Prandium, which operates 128 Chi-Chi's restaurants in 20 states.
On Oct 8, the company put those eateries under Chapter 11 protection in US
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Of the 185 confirmed cases
reported as of yesterday, Pennsylvanians accounted for 158. There were 21
cases in Ohio, 4 in West Virginia, one in Florida and one in South
Carolina. The number of confirmed cases among Chi-Chi's employees remained
at 4 . Although a 47 year old man reportedly was being evaluated for a
possible liver transplant Thursday as a result of the outbreak, no update
on his condition was available yesterday. In addition to the patients who
were in critical condition, UPMC continued to treat 2 other patients who
were in fair condition. Doctors at Children's Hospital said they have
treated 5 patients with confirmed cases of hepatitis A and 2 patients with
suspected cases during the week, said hospital spokesman Marc Lukasiak. All
patients were evaluated, treated and released except for one who was in
fair condition. The children ranged from 4 months to 10 years old. Many
hepatitis A patients have sought care at The Medical Center, Beaver, but a
hospital spokesman would not release numbers yesterday. Central Blood Bank
officials said yesterday there is a small risk that blood donors exposed to
hepatitis A could transmit the virus through donation. So the blood bank is
asking that people who ate at the Beaver Valley Chi-Chi's between Oct 1 and
Nov 2 and have donated blood to contact the blood bank so that their
products may be removed from inventory.
