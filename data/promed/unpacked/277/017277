Ivermectin may offer a more effective and/or practical alternative
treatment for psoroptic mange in wild big horn sheep than dipping.

If my understanding is correct, it has proven to be an effective
treatment for psoroptic mange when administered via in-feed or
slow-release bolus formulations, and I believe that the in-feed
delivery mechanism may have been demonstrated in (experimentally
infected) Rocky Mountain big horn sheep. There have been variable
results for other species of psoroptic mange using injectable
formulations (not sure about _P. ovis_ in that regard).

Ivermectin also exists in "pour-on" formulations that are popular for
external administration to cattle, and they may present more practical
alternative delivery mechanisms (e.g. via rubbing posts or back-rubs)
for wild species.

Ivermectin has also proven to be a more practical and effective
treatment for sarcoptic mange in pigs than has dipping.

[I appreciate David reminding us of Ivermectin treatment. It has
proven effective for a number of mite conditions. It will be
interesting to see whether it can be used in these bighorn sheep. -
