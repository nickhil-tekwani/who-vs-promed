The latest ECDC report on measles and rubella shows that 8326 cases of measles were reported by 29 EU [European Union] and EEA [European Economic Area] countries from January to November 2012. France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom accounted for 87 per cent of all reported cases, and there were no measles-related deaths during this timeframe. However, 7 cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis.

Although the number of reported cases was substantially lower in 2012 than in the same period in 2011, measles transmission has continued at the European level.

[The incidence of rubella data provides an indirect estimate of the success of the measles vaccination campaigns in the region, since the vaccine universally used is the triple MMR: measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. - Mod.CP]. In total, 28 536 cases of rubella were reported during the period December 2011 to November 2012 by the 26 EU and EEA reporting countries. Poland and Romania accounted for 99 per cent of all reported rubella cases in the 12 month period. Reported cases in 2012 are higher than for the same period in 2011, and the highest notification rate was among adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age.

Measles and rubella are targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. ECDC closely monitors progress towards interruption of endemic transmission of both diseases through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Measles and rubella vaccinations are routinely delivered in the form of the MMR vaccine in Europe, and the 1st of the 2 recommended doses is normally given during the 2nd year of life.

[The ECDC report indicates that whereas transmission of measles virus infection in Europe remains low, rubella virus infection is on the rise. This is somewhat unexpected in view of the fact that the same MMR triple vaccine that is used to protect against both diseases simultaneously is universally available. This situation may presumably be a consequence of different policies and priorities in the various EU/EEA countries. - Mod.CP]

[2] UK (HPA report)

http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2013/news0613.htm#msls


The number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles with onset dates in 2012 is 2016 (provisional), the highest annual total since 1994, when enhanced laboratory confirmation began.

From January [2012], the monthly totals increased to peak in May 2012, decreased during the summer, and then increased again after schools returned in September 2012. Almost 70 per cent (1374/2016) of all cases were in children between the ages of one and 18 years with the highest proportion occurring in those under 5 years of age. Only 92 (6.7 per cent) of the cases aged under 19 had documented receipt of at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine.

More than 40 per cent of the cases in 2012 were reported in the North West region. During the 1st half of the year, cases were mainly associated with a large ongoing community outbreak in Cheshire & Merseyside suspected to be fuelled by transmission among preschool children. In the 2nd half of 2012, cases were more widely distributed across the North West in association with several clusters in schools.

The 2nd highest number of cases were reported from the South East region, where they were mainly part of a community-wide outbreak in Sussex, which started in the Steiner community in 2011 and continued into 2012 amongst unvaccinated school-age children.

Since the end of July 2012, many cases were linked to an outbreak in travelling communities that has affected almost all regions in England and Wales. In the latter part of the year, the cases outside the travelling communities were associated with nurseries and school outbreaks across Wales, North West and South West regions.

Throughout the EU [European Union] and EEA [European Economic Area] countries, there were 7392 measles cases reported between January and November 2012. The UK, along with France, Italy, Romania, and Spain, accounted for 87 per cent of these cases. Although no deaths occurred in the period across Europe, 7 cases of acute measles encephalitis were reported.

http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10207012.More_cases_of_suspected_and_confirmed_measles_are_confirmed_in_region/


The number of confirmed and suspected measles cases in the region have risen, according to new figures. Since the beginning of September 2012, when the numbers started increasing, 63 confirmed cases and 63 suspected cases of the illness have now been reported, according to the Health Protection Agency [HPA] in the North East. This is an increase of 7 confirmed and 14 suspected cases on the previous week. The majority of cases in the outbreak continue to be in unvaccinated school children and young adults aged between 10 and 30 years.

Julia Waller, spokeswoman for the HPA in the North-East, said: "Measles is highly infectious, and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region. Furthermore, if they become ill with measles, they could also be a risk to people who are not able to be immunised, such as babies who are too young to be vaccinated. There is no treatment for measles, but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine, and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection. That's why we're urging parents to make sure that their children are fully immunised and have had 2 doses of the jab."

The viral illness begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. This is followed with a rash that starts on the face and spreads down the upper body, extending to the arms, hands, legs, and feet. To prevent spreading the illness, the HPA is advising people with symptoms to stay away from school, nursery, or work until at least 4 full days have elapsed after the development of a rash. You should also avoid contact with pregnant women, people with weak immune systems, and babies.

A measles outbreak across Sussex has contributed to the highest level of cases nationally for 18 years. There were 330 confirmed cases of the disease in the county during 2012, although the actual number is higher because samples are not taken from every patient. Brighton and Hove was the worst affected with 195 people falling ill, while East Sussex had 90 and West Sussex 45. The outbreak made up a significant part of the 2016 confirmed cases in England and Wales throughout the year [2012], according to figures from the Health Protection Agency (see part [2] above).

The increase is blamed on poor take up rates for the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). Around 95 per cent of a community needs to have both doses of the jab in order for it to have the best protection against the virus spreading.

HPA head of immunisation Mary Ramsay said: "Coverage of MMR is now at historically high levels, but measles is highly infectious and can spread easily among communities that are poorly vaccinated and can affect anyone who is susceptible, including toddlers in whom vaccination has been delayed. Measles continues to circulate in several European countries that are popular with holidaymakers. It is often associated with being a disease of the past and, as a result, people may be unaware that it is a dangerous infection that can lead to death in severe cases."

An outbreak of measles has been reported in 5 communities of Kaduna-South Local Government Area of Kaduna State. It was gathered that several persons in Barnawa, Kakuri, Tudun Wada, Kinkinau and some few areas within Kaduna metropolis have been affected by the disease. Speaking to Daily Trust, a resident of Kakuri said: "Many children and a few adults have been affected. If you visit hospitals in our area, you will see many people suffering from the disease there."

When contacted, the Kaduna state commissioner for health, Turaki Kalik, confirmed the incident, adding: "Adequate arrangements have been made to stop the disease from spreading. We received reports of outbreaks of measles in Barnawa, Kakuri, Tudun Wada, Kinkinau and some other areas, and we have mobilised resources and manpower to ensure that it is brought under control," Kalik said. According to the commissioner, the outbreak was due to the change in weather and some other factors [?]. "We are anticipating outbreaks of meningitis, as well as Lassa fever. So, as I speak to you, the state government is fully prepared with drugs and other necessary items in case it happens," he added.

Special assistant to the chief minister of health Khawaja Salman Rafique said on Tuesday [5 Feb 2013] that 2971 cases of measles have been reported in the province since December 2012. He said that the government was keeping a watchful eye on the measles situation, and necessary arrangements had been made for controlling the disease as well as treatment of patients in hospitals. He said measles had started receding. Rafique was addressing a press conference on the measles outbreak at the committee room of the Health Department on Tuesday [5 Feb 2013]. Special secretary Babar Hayat Tarar, director general health Dr Nisar Ahmad Cheema, additional secretary health (Estt) Asfandyar Khan, UNICEF provincial chief Dr Rana Mushtaq, and director EPI Dr Tanvir Hussain were also present on the occasion.

Rafique said that guidelines had been given to all the hospitals and district offices of the Health Department for controlling measles and treatment of patients. He said that the meetings of steering committee comprising pediatricians were being held on a regular basis. He said action will be taken against any officer found guilty of negligence in controlling measles. Dr Cheema said that MMR injections had not been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Pakistan and, as soon as the recommendation was made by the WHO, the injection would be included in the EPI programme.

Rafique said that parents were being advised through print and electronic media. He added that female health workers were approaching parents at the community level to ensure that their children were vaccinated. He said that children from the ages of 6 months to 10 years were being vaccinated under the mop-up campaign in areas from where measles cases had been reported.

Heath authorities have confirmed the 1st case in Taiwan this year [2013] of measles contracted overseas, an 8 month old girl who returned from China in early February 2013. The baby developed a rash and fever in late January 2013 during a trip to Hunan province in China with her mother to visit relatives, said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Department of Health's Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

When the child and mother returned to Taiwan on 2 Feb 2013, an alert was triggered on the airport's body temperature equipment, and the baby was subsequently hospitalized and quarantined, Chou said. The patient is recovering, the CDC added. Health authorities have been tracking the other passengers on the flight from [mainland] China and monitoring the staff at the hospital that admitted the child, but there have been no other cases of measles so far, the CDC said.

The number of confirmed cases of measles in [mainland] China was 1501 in January 2013, more than 3.5 times the number for the same month last year [2012], according to the CDC. Visits to areas where measles is common are not advisable for children under one year old, Chou said. But if such visits are necessary, the children should be vaccinated before travel, he added. The Taiwan government provides free vaccinations against measles, mumps, and rubella for children one year old and over.

Two rare cases of measles on the Central Coast have public health officials acting quickly to keep it from spreading. On Sunday [3 Feb 2013], we went to find out who may have been exposed and how you can stay protected.

The Santa Cruz Public Health Department said if you were at New Leaf Market or Liberty Bank in Felton on 26, 28, or 29 Jan 2013, you may have been exposed to measles. Store manager Mike Macallair said the daughter of an employee recently took a trip to India without being vaccinated and came back with the disease. "She came down with it after they figured out what it was, and she had a mild infection, but she had come to work several days," said Felton New Leaf Market store manager Mike Macallair. So they contacted public health right away. Every employee was tested, and most were immune. But several weren't, and on Sunday [3 Feb 2013], they were given an immunization to make sure [the virus] doesn't spread.

At New Leaf Market, if customers are concerned, they're being given a sheet of paper with information on exposure to measles. So how do you know whether you're not at risk? Public health officials said there are 3 ways persons can be protected: "By having had their 2 measles shots growing up, by being born before 1957, or by having been in the Army," said Santa Cruz County Public Health interim director Dr Ira Lubell.

Typical symptoms are a cough, fever, watery eyes, runny nose, white spots in the mouth, and a rash. County public health said the last time they had a few cases was in 2005. "Santa Cruz has always had one of the lowest community immunization participation rates in the state," said Dr Lubell. Measles can be deadly for anyone. But Santa Cruz County Public Health officials said it's even more dangerous for anyone who is pregnant or who has a weak immune system.
