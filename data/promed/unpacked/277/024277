Bird flu virus in Novosibirsk region harmless to humans
-------------------------------------------------------
The avian influenza virus that killed birds in the village of Suzdalka in
Novosibirsk region is an H5N2 type and is not dangerous to humans, said
Alexander Shestopalov, an official at the Vektor State Research Center.
"This virus is considerably less pathogenic for poultry than H5N1, which is
found in South-East Asia, and is absolutely harmless to humans," he said.
The virus comes from the Mediterranean and was probably brought to
Novosibirsk region by migrating birds, he said.

[It is relieving to note that the location of this current outbreak is not
far distant from the H5N1-affected areas in China and south eastern Asia.
The Russian statement about the Mediterranean origin of the H5N2 strain
needs substantiation. Is it based upon comparative sequencing results?
Avian influenza outbreaks caused by H5N2 strains have been reported
recently from Japan, Italy, USA (Texas), South Korea, and South Africa. The
latter, affecting ostriches, was designated HPAI, and the others were of
low pathogenicity. The H5 outbreak in North Korea in Mar 2005 remains
untyped. - Mod.AS]
