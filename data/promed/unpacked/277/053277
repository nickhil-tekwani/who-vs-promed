The Ohio Department of Health is reporting Lyme disease cases in the state this year are up 33 percent from 2016. The department says 241 cases of Lyme disease have been reported in 60 Ohio counties so far in 2017. There were only 160 cases in 2016.

The increase in cases coincides with the increase of the blacklegged tick in Ohio.

Lyme disease is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected deer tick. Symptoms can include a flu-like illness, muscle pain, and headache; a bull's-eye shaped rash is often also seen at the site of the bite as well.

Ohio Department of Health Medical Director Dr. Clint Koenig says: "Lyme disease is still very important to think about, even in cold weather. You still need to take precautions, like wearing bug repellent, to make sure you are protected while outside enjoying the fall season." Fall hunting season has begun and deer gun season begins on [Mon 27 Nov 2017].

Here are some tips on how to avoid tick bites before and after you hunt:
- When possible, walk in the center of trails and paths to avoid brushing up
against ticks.
- Apply bug repellent to everyone in your party, including pets.
- Tuck your pants into your boots or socks and tuck your shirt into your
pants to prevent ticks from crawling inside clothing.
- Shower immediately after returning from the outdoors to remove unattached, ticks.
- Check dogs for ticks after returning from tick habitats.
- Remove any attached tick immediately by grasping it with tweezers, as close to the skin as possible, and pulling it straight out. Do not twist or jerk.

There are currently no vaccines to prevent tickborne diseases. If detected at an early stage, Lyme disease can be treated successfully with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

[In 2016, a total of 36 429 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC (https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/static/2016/annual/2016-table1.html). According to the CDC, in 2015, a total of 38 069 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC, an increased number compared with the number reported annually between 2010 and 2014; however, cases did not surpass the number reported in 2009, the year with the highest case counts; the geographic distribution of high incidence areas appeared to be expanding, with the number of counties with an incidence of greater than or equal to 10 confirmed cases per 100 000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 424 in 2015 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/64/wr/mm6453a1.htm?s_cid=mm6453a1_w).

The number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in the U.S. state of Ohio was 58 in 2005 and was below that level until it rose to 74 in 2013, then rose again to 94 in 2014, 112 in 2015 and 122 in 2016 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html). - Mod.ML
