Botulism in the Rostov region, Russia
-------------------------------------
9 cases of botulism have been reported in the Rostov region so far in
January 2005. These cases are connected to the use of smoked fish and
home-canned food. Despite numerous warnings to the population about the
danger of using tinned products and homemade smoked fish, an increase in
cases has been recorded. During the same period in 2004, only 4 persons
developed botulism.
