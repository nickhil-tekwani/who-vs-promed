A new case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] was confirmed by the Epidemiology Office of the Ministry of Health, raising the number of cases to 16 so far this year [2014].

The patient, a 50-year-old woman from La Enea, Guarare district in Los Santos province, is in serious condition in the intensive care unit.

It is worth mentioning that the woman is the sister of a patient who died of the same condition in the year 2000.

The Director General of Health, Carlos Galvez, stated that new cases have not been reported for several weeks, which indicates that there still may be [new] infections because the rodent is circulating [the virus], and preventive measures must be maintained.

[Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. No ecological details are provided concerning the environment where the woman may have acquired her infection.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
