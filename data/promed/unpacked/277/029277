Health officials in Spain are reporting an outbreak of rubella in the Aragon region in northeastern Spain, according to a local news source (computer translated).

The outbreak that has affected 12 people in Zuera is the 1st seen since 2012 in the region. Spain achieved elimination status for rubella as of 2015, according to the World Health Organization.

Rubella, also called German measles, is a disease spread by the coughs and sneezes of infected people. Symptoms include a rash and fever for 2-3 days. Rubella is very dangerous for a pregnant woman and her developing baby. If a pregnant woman gets rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts (blurred vision), heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage.
