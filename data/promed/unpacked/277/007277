New strain of measles virus suggested as etiological agent
---------------------------------------------------
The mysterious disease that has claimed the lives of at least 46 children
in Saharanpur (Western Uttar Pradesh) could well be a new strain of the
measles virus, say experts. Earlier outbreaks due to a different measles
virus have been noticed in Warangal (Andhra Pradesh) as well as in Haryana.
The experts had initially said the mysterious deaths in Saharanpur were
probably caused by Japanese encephalitis virus, which is spread by the
mosquito, _Culex vishnoi_. However, a team from the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD) failed to find this mosquito, which transmits
the disease from the pigs and birds to humans. Gorakhpur in the north is
the only region of Uttar Pradesh where this mosquito has been found so far.
The vector is known to thrive in paddy fields.
Director general of health services S P Aggarwal did not rule out the
possibility of a "measles-like virus". On whether the disease was
infectious, he said the organism was not airborne, as no hospital worker
had yet contracted the disease. He said the mysterious disease could not be
called an "epidemic" as the cases had occurred over a period of [6 weeks].

[The identification of the etiologic agent as a "new strain of measles" or
a "measles-like virus" cannot be given credence. No evidence has been
advanced to indicate that the illness resembles measles, apart from the
circumstance that mainly (exclusively?) children are affected. Mutant forms
of measles virus and atypical strains of measles virus have been cited in
the past (for example, see: "Unexplained deaths - India (North Bengal) (08)
20010306.0454") to explain undiagnosed outbreaks of disease in India, but
never substantiated. Measles viruses occur globally and are well
characterized; there is no evidence that the strains of measles virus
present in India differ from known epidemic forms. - Mod.CP]
