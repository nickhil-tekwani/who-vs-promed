A warning has been sent out advising farmers to check animals appearing to have lost condition this winter [2014-15] for untreatable viral disease maedi-visna (MV).

Disease screening has found a "worrying number" of infections in the UK, suggesting the virus is spreading through the industry, says Scotland's Rural College [SRUC].

Out of 31 tested flocks, 23 per cent -- 7 farms -- had the disease, which causes clinical signs of pneumonia. MV is difficult to diagnose and has no cure or vaccine.

"Farmers have started to heed our previous warnings about the disease," said St Boswells based SRUC Veterinary investigation officer Lynn Gibson.

"Commercial flocks from throughout the UK have taken the opportunity to screen their animals using the MV diagnostic test package."

From the Icelandic for "ill-thrift", maedi-visna is caused by a retrovirus, brought into the UK via imported animals [see comment] and leads to poor body condition, fertility problems, mastitis, smaller and weaker lambs, and higher mortality.

Lynn Gibson advises that the 1st things to look for are barren ewes and thinner sheep. MV can take years to develop, allowing it to time to spread through a flock.

"The 1st indications of a problem can include an increase in barren ewes or the numbers of thinner sheep meaning more are being culled from the flock as unproductive.

"Sheep never develop immunity to MV and with no effective treatment or cure the only option with heavily infected flocks is to depopulate and restock from reliable sources.

"We recommend any flock owners finding they have ewes which have lost condition since tupping (mating) time should check for MV. It is something to take seriously, not ignore. Disease in sheep flocks reduces productivity and income in a sector already operating on narrow margins."

[Maedi-visna appears to have been imported into Great Britain during the 1970's (see reference below); its alarming increased incidence has been discussed in ProMED-mail posting 20131109.2047194.

Maedi-visna (MV) is a persistent lentivirus infection of sheep, also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). Maedi-visna is an Icelandic name that describes 2 of the clinical syndromes recognised in MV virus (MVV)-infected sheep. "Maedi" means "laboured breathing" and describes the disease associated with a progressive interstitial pneumonitis, and "visna" means "shrinkage" or "wasting," the signs associated with a paralysing meningoencephalitis.

MV is often grouped together with the closely related goat disease caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE), as the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). The diseases, which are not zoonotic, are included in OIE's list in the section "Caprinae diseases" (diseases of sheep and goats), as a common entity, titled "caprine arthritis-encephalitis and maedi-visna."

One source of CAEV and MVV transmission is colostrum and milk. The source of horizontal transmission in the absence of lactation remains unknown; however, faeces and lung fluids are known to harbour infectious virus. Ovine lentiviruses have been identified in most of the sheep-rearing countries of the world, with the notable exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialised countries, and seems to have coincided with the international movement of European breeds of dairy goats. Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive, mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder, and central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both species, and its economic significance may be underestimated. Laboured breathing associated with emaciation caused by progressive pneumonitis is the predominant feature in clinically affected sheep, whereas polyarthritis is the main clinical sign in goats. However, most lentivirus-infected sheep and goats are largely asymptomatic, but remain persistent carriers of virus and are capable of transmitting infection via colostrum or milk and respiratory secretions.

The most practical and reliable approach to confirming a diagnosis of MV or CAE is a combination of serology and clinical evaluation. Although serology represents the most cost-effective method of diagnosing persistently infected, clinically normal animals, it should be understood that testing errors occur. Virus isolation can be attempted from live clinical or subclinical cases by co-cultivating peripheral blood or milk leukocytes with appropriate ovine or caprine cell cultures.

No vaccines against CAE-MV are available. The above and additional information is available in OIE's Manual, Chapter 2.7.3/4, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.03-04_CAE_MV.pdf.

To control the spread of MV, industrialized countries have set and implemented schemes for MV-free flocks accreditation. For the scheme under implementation in Scotland, see http://www.sruc.ac.uk/download/downloads/id/683/mv_rules_and_co
