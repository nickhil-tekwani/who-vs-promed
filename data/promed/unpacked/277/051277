A new cased of [a] hantavirus [infection] was reported from Tonosi district, Los Santos province. Health authorities indicated that the patient, a 24-year-old woman, is hospitalized in the intensive care unit of Joaquin Pablo Sayas Hospital [in Las Tablas, Los Santos].

In the Los Santos province, 60 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been reported [this year (2014)].

Hantaviruses cause a serious acute virus disease. Field mice (mainly long-tails) shed virus in saliva, feces, and urine, transmitting it to people.

The virus is transmitted:
- most frequently via inhalation when one breathes in open or closed places (sheds, vegetable gardens, pastures) where feces of urine of infected rodents spread the virus, contaminating the environment;
- by direct contact through touching dead or live rodents or their feces of urine;
- by bites of infected rodents.

The symptoms [of hantavirus infections] are similar to those of influenza with fever, muscle pain, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting and, sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea. After a few days, there can be respiratory problems that may become worse [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome].

[The number of reported cases of Choclo virus infection in Los Santos province has increased from 58 on 7 Oct 2014 to 60 reported above. The Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from Las Tablas. Although not specified in the report above, or previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.

The Director of the Charata Hospital, Dr Maria Oliva, confirmed that the tests on a citizen from Tres Estacas, where positive for a hantavirus [infection], was positive. It is worth recalling that the man had been hospitalized in Resistencia [capital and largest city in Chaco province], where the physicians of the Sanatorio Frangioli hospital issued an alert. A few days before, the man's wife who had a similar clinical picture, had died in Charata.

On Wednesday afternoon [8 Oct 2014], Charata Hospital officials reported that the [samples] from the Tres Estacas patient, sent for testing to Pergamino [Buenos Aires province], were positive. "We request that the community take all precautions, as we have been telling them, mainly regarding cleanliness, rodent control, household cleanup and washing everything with bleach in water," said Dr Oliva.

"The suspected case had been handled responsibly over the past 2 weeks, including rodent control and serological tests of the family to detect possible infections. We are at ease because, until now, this is the only case" she stated.

Concerning the woman who died, Dr Oliva said, "We don't know the type of case it was because she was not a hospital patient or [reviewed by] public health." It is worth recalling that the woman died a few days before her husband was admitted to the clinic with similar symptoms.

Several weeks before, the Minister of Health, Jaime Parra Moreno, and the Director of Epidemiology, Betina Irigoyen (who took the sample from the patient following the alert from physicians at the Sanatorio Frangioli hospital), were present in Charata and Tres Estacas and they also met with the patient, who has recovered.

At that time Dr Irigoyen said that there had been no locally acquired cases in the province, since [?] the 2 [cases] reported in Tres Isletas in 2009, but no details have been released yet about this confirmed case in southeast Choco.

The Charata Hospital Director took advantage of the opportunity to request that the community, "not forget that we have to be alert, we are in the summer season, and we need to take preventive measures ... for diseases such as hantavirus [infections] that require preventive cleanup work."

[The previously reported suspected cases of a hantavirus infection in Tres Estacas (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140929.2813454) has now been confirmed. Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in Choco province may have been caused by Oran virus infection.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Oran hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
