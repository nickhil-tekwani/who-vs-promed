Distemper, a serious and highly contagious animal disease, has broken out
among raccoons on the Eastside, and health officials are encouraging dog
and ferret owners to make sure their animals are vaccinated and kept away
from wildlife.

On Friday [16 Apr 2010], King County health officials learned that 2 dead
raccoons -- one from Bellevue, the other from Redmond -- tested positive
for the disease. Several dead raccoons have also been picked up in
Issaquah, and are assumed to have died of distemper as well, said King
County spokeswoman Christine Lange.

Humans and cats aren't affected by canine distemper, but it's highly
contagious among dogs, ferrets, raccoons, coyotes, skunks, weasels, and
harbor seals. "Dogs are normally vaccinated against canine distemper, but
the disease has become generally uncommon and some pet owners are not
getting their pets vaccinated," said Sharon Hopkins, the veterinarian for
Public Health -- Seattle & King County, in a press release from the King
County health agency, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and
PAWS. If you don't know whether your pet has been vaccinated, call your
veterinarian, Hopkins said.

Distemper causes encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, in animals.
Infected animals may have runny eyes and stagger, tremble, foam at the
mouth or snap, according to veterinarians. It can be transmitted by bodily
fluids, including urine and feces, and is nearly always fatal, Lange said.

"While we have seen an increase in the number of raccoons this year [2010]
at our wildlife hospital that appear to be infected with canine distemper,
we encourage people not to panic," said PAWS' wildlife veterinarian John
Huckabee. "The best way to avoid potential exposure to pet dogs and ferrets
is to avoid feeding or otherwise attracting wildlife, intentionally or
unintentionally."

People are encouraged to feed pets indoors, and secure garbage, compost,
bird feeders, and chicken food to keep wild animals out. Residents should
also secure pet doors so that raccoons cannot enter indoor living spaces.
"Remove any reason for wild animals to come across your yard," Lange said.
"Don't give them a chance to come up to your house or be around your
property." Just because a raccoon is moving around during the day, it may
not necessarily be sick, Lange said, but an ill raccoon might foam at the
mouth, snap at you, or be slow to move. If you live in King County and come
across a raccoon that appears to be sick, call (206) 296-PETS to receive
information and suggestions about potential resources. Animal control
officers will pick up dead raccoons.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife offers advice for dealing with problem
wildlife on its website at <http://wdfw.wa.gov/wlm/living/>, and the PAWS
Wildlife Center, (425) 787-2500 x817, offers tips for solving and
preventing conflicts.

Lange said there has also been in outbreak in Los Angeles, where more than
40 dogs have come down with the disease. Wildlife officials said diseases
run in cycles through wild animal populations, and overpopulation will
often cause an outbreak.

Canine distemper is a viral disease that infects foxes, coyotes, skunks,
raccoons, and unvaccinated dogs and other carnivores.

Clinical signs of distemper include discharge from the nose and eyes, a
rough coat of hair, often an emaciated appearance, and disorientation or
wandering aimlessly. The clinical signs become progressively worse as the
disease is usually fatal.

There is a neurological component to the disease. Animals may tremble,
convulse, or display what is referred to as "chewing gum fits". The animal
appears to be smacking its lips and chewing gum. The animal may turn,
circle, or even bend its body so that this "chewing" appears to be directed
at a flank. These neurological clinical signs can mimic rabies. Although
distemper virus poses no threat to human beings, because the signs can
appear similar to rabies, it is appropriate to contact a physician
immediately. Distemper and rabies can only be distinguished by examining
the animal's brain.

Transmission of the canine distemper virus (CDV) requires close contact, as
the virus does not survive long outside of the body. A healthy animal (dog,
raccoon, etc.) may contract canine distemper from direct contact with an
infected animal or its bodily fluids and waste.

Once an animal is infected with CDV, it begins to shed the virus
approximately 5 days later. CDV seems to always be present in the
environment. An animal may continue to shed the virus until its death,
which may take as long as 6 weeks; usually, the course of the disease is
much shorter.

Young animals are most susceptible to the disease. Consequently, we see the
disease manifest more in the spring and summer when young animals are more
obvious. Not all raccoons get the disease. However, those that do are
capable of passing it to other animals, including our domestic animals. It
is strongly recommended that people vaccinate their dogs against this
disease. There is prevention (vaccination) but there is no good treatment.

CDV tends to move in 5-7 year cycles. This may be the beginning of a cycle,
and residents are again reminded to vaccine their pets.
