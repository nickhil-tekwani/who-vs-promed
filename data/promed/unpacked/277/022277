I am writing with a comment on the report [referenced above]. I believe that the moderator may have misinterpreted the initial report and do not believe that the authorities in India are claiming that the tiger as confirmed positive with SARS-CoV-2. The report actually states: "National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had issued alert after tiger was found COVID-19 positive in US." There is some ambiguity over the tiger being referred to (is it the tiger confirmed in the Bronx Zoo [New York, USA] or the tiger that died in Pench [National Park in Madhya Pradesh state, India]?). The fact that they are referring to a diagnosis being made in the USA would imply that it wasn't the tiger from Pench. Indian authorities do not routinely export wildlife tissues for diagnosis overseas, and even if they did, they would require coordination of CITES [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] export and import licenses, which would take time to acquire.

My interpretation of this article is that a tiger died in Pench on 4 Apr 2020. On 5 Apr 2020, news agencies started reporting on a COVID-19 infection in a captive tiger in the Bronx Zoo. Presumably in reaction to the US report, the Indian authorities advised that all contacts with the Pench tiger undergo quarantine as a precaution.

Finally, I agree with the moderator that tissues from the Pench tiger warrant further analysis and histological examination. The report mentions a respiratory infection and "abnormal behaviour," both of which could be indicators of a known threat to wild tigers, namely, canine distemper virus (CDV). While it is quite possible that impaction was the proximal cause of death, it would seem prudent to test samples for CDV as a precautionary measure.

In the post [referenced above], the moderator states that a wild tiger was confirmed positive for COVID-19, which the referenced news report does not state. The news report included in the posting mentions, "COVID-19 positive tiger in US," which seems to suggest the agency is referring to the positive zoo tiger case, which raised the level of concern within the agency for possible infection in tigers in the reserve, but not that the wild tiger was confirmed with COVID-19. The news report does not state that COVID testing was performed on this wild tiger. So, review of the interpretation by the moderator and additional information from the forestry department would be valuable. As was also stated by the moderator, additional diagnostics would indeed be useful to determine the cause of death, including whether COVID-19 may have been present and potentially a cause for the pulmonary disease and death. If the latter occurred, this would indeed be a very important finding.

[Thanks to Drs Gilbert and McAloose for their comments.

In the referenced news report of the Free Press Journal, the headline read, "Madhya Pradesh: Pench forest staff quarantined after death of corona positive tiger is fit now," and a subheading added, "Entire staff were on isolation after T-21 tiger died of COVID-19" (https://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-pench-forest-staff-qurantined-after-death-of-corona-positive-tiger-is-fit-now). However, as Dr Gilbert and Dr McAloose rightly point out, the remainder of the article does not mention any positive test of samples from the "T-21" tiger.

The explicit header and subtitle and the fact that the death was not recent (or news) made me think that the main goal of the report was to announce that the tiger had died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, 2 days have passed since that news report was published, and there is no other source stating that the dead tiger was tested to detect SARS-CoV-2. Until reliable information about the post-mortem exam and tests done is provided, I'm inclined to disregard the above cited news report because its claims of death due to COVID-19 are very likely mistaken. - Mod.PMB
