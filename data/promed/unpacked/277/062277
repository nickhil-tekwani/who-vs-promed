[2] North Korea
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2009

North Korea acknowledged for the 1st time on Wed 9 Dec 2009 that
swine flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] has hit the nation,
a day after South Korea's President offered to help its impoverished
neighbour fight the virus reported to have already killed dozens.

The North's Ministry of Public Health confirmed 9 cases of swine flu
in the border city of Sinuiju, near China, and in the capital
Pyongyang, according to the official Korean Central News Agency
[KCNA]. KCNA, however, made no mention of any deaths. The relevant
agency is "further perfecting the quarantine system against the
spread of this flu virus," while properly carrying out prevention and
medical treatment, KCNA said.

It is the 1st time that the reclusive North has confirmed a swine flu
outbreak in the country. The regime has remained silent despite
reports that the virus already has killed more than 40 people in
Sinuiju and Pyongyang and was spreading fast.

The acknowledgment came a day after South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak offered to "unconditionally" help North Korea if reported
outbreaks were true. Lee instructed the Cabinet to check the reports
and study ways to send swine flu medication in humanitarian aid.

The Unification Ministry said on Wed 9 Dec 2009 that it is working
with other related agencies on the matter and plans to offer talks
with the North. "We will provide aid as early as possible without any
conditions," ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung said.

[President] Lee has halted unconditional aid to the North since
taking office early last year [2008], prompting Pyongyang to suspend
reconciliation talks and other joint projects in protest. Still, Lee
has said he is willing to provide limited amounts of humanitarian assistance.

The 2 sides remain in a state of conflict, with the 1950-53 Korean
War ending in a truce not a peace treaty.

[It is safe to conclude now that no community, however reclusive, can
protect its population from pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection.
