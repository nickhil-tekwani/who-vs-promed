Thousands of dead birds at Great Salt Lake; no tie to bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of dead birds are washing up on the Great Salt Lake shore. "We've
received a lot of calls -- everybody's worried about avian influenza," said
Leslie McFarlane, wildlife-disease coordinator at the Utah Division of
Wildlife Resources.

But the dead birds are free of bird flu. Avian cholera killed more than 15
000 birds on the lake last fall [2007], most of them eared grebes, a
duck-like bird. The common bacteria can quickly spread through a bird
population, McFarlane said. The salt water preserved the birds, even though
they've been dead for months. "People are worried that it's a new die-off
and it's not," McFarlane said. "We're really careful of monitoring our bird
deaths."

The bacteria do not affect other people or animals, and the birds have been
dead long enough that they no longer are carriers. The DWR was aware of the
deaths last fall. "They died clear out in the middle of the lake and there
was no way to access them to pick them up," McFarlane said. "Now they are
just washing in and they don't pose any threat or anything."

The DWR won't be picking up the birds this spring, either. They could be
anywhere on the lake, and there's not enough people to search for them,
McFarlane said. When temperatures rise and the birds hit the shoreline,
they'll decompose in a day or two. "People won't have to be stepping over
them when they visit the lake," McFarlane said.

Hundreds of thousands of birds migrate through the area, she said, and the
15 000 or so deaths won't hurt the overall population. If someone sees sick
or newly dead birds on the shore or sandbars, they should contact the DWR
as a precaution, McFarlane said.
