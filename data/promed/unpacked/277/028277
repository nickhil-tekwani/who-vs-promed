A little-reported malaria epidemic has been quietly claiming children's lives in the South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Although the disease is endemic to the country, this most recent outbreak has been particularly severe in both scale and severity. The MSF-supported hospital in Baraka has struggled to cope with the endless stream of patients, often children under 5 years old who are referred in need of urgent intensive care.

Throughout 2014, the MSF team in Baraka treated a record 89 776 patients for malaria, more than double the number of people treated the previous year (42 390) [2013] or the year previously (42 305) [2012].

[Malaria is endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Key data on trends in the number of malaria cases and mortality can be found at the WHO website (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_cod_en.pdf?ua=1).

It is seen that the number of malaria cases and the number with fatal outcome has been increasing over the past 10 years. This may reflect increased registration of cases nore than a true increase in the number of cases.

The increase reported here seems to be a real increase, but there is no information on why an increase in transmission should have occurred. Home treatment is the usual practice in Africa, and if the drugs available at local markets suddenly fail, this could be one reason. We expect that artimisinin combinations are obtainable, but if these have been counterfeited, and do not contain what they are supposed to, this will result in a huge influx of cases to the health care facilities.
