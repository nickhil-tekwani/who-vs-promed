[WHO posted a report on the Yellow Fever (YF) epidemic in Burkina
Faso on 11 May 2004, which was re-posted on ProMED-mail the same day.
It said: "As of Mon 10 May 2004, the Ministry of Health, Burkina
Faso, has reported a total of 25 suspect cases of yellow fever in the
districts of Bobo-Dioulasso and Gaoua. Of the 16 samples collected, 4
were laboratory-confirmed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Yellow
Fever at the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal. The 4 confirmed cases
were from Bobo-Dioulasso."
Bobo-Dioulasso is in SW Burkina Faso, on a crossroads of the trade
routes of West Africa, and has been communicating directly with Mali,
Cote d'Ivoire & Ghana, none of which have reported seeing YF so far
in 2004. But, WHO posted an alert on 1 Jun 2004 advising mass
vaccination in Burkina Faso because of the outbreak (see 1st ref.
below).
The figures in this new notification mean that the final official
case count, as of 29 Aug 2004, was only 9 confirmed cases, including
2 deaths. It is not stated whether the epidemic was aborted by mass
vaccination. (It would also be interesting to know the final
diagnosis for the 16 - 9 = 7 cases with samples that were clinically
YF but not lab confirmed.) - Mod.JW]
