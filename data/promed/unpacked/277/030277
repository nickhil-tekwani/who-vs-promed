Scientists are working to save the sweet potato industry in Papua New
Guinea (PNG) and the rest of the South Pacific. The vegetable is the
staple food of many islanders, whose crops are declining because of
viruses that cut yields. The Solomon Islands was also seeking
assistance in controlling the problems.
Sweet potato research specialist Eric Coleman (Queensland Primary
Industries Department, Australia) has been in the PNG highlands as
part of a AUD 2 million (USD 1.6 million) project to identify the
cause of the insidious yield decline.
Mr Coleman said PNG had an amazing variety of sweet potatoes, which
had been attacked by some of the 22 known viruses that could affect
the vegetable. "As you get more viruses, the sweet potatoes get
longer, skinnier, and uglier," he said. "We have done a lot of
domestic work to improve the quality of the sweet potato. That is
because we have removed viruses and delivered a product to farmers
who plant a material that is basically disease free."
Identifying genes that could make sweet potatoes disease resistant
was an 'elusive' process to this point, so the emphasis had to be on
removing viruses. "What we are trying to do in PNG, where there are
thousands of varieties, is apply our techniques which can identify
those 22 viruses," he said.
"We are centering the work in the highlands because everyone there
grows sweet potato or yams. I am fairly sure our technology -- the
way we identify and remove viruses -- will work. But no one has
really assessed what viruses are there. We could find viruses we do
not know about." Mr Coleman said.
"Australians consume 2 kg (4.4 lb) sweet potatoes per person per
year. In PNG the per capita consumption is 500 kg (1102 lb). I think
that puts the urgency of this exercise into perspective," Mr Coleman said.

[Sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_) is among the major food crops in
the world and is cultivated in all tropical and subtropical regions
particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Although weevils are
the most damaging problem of sweet potato worldwide, diseases caused
by viruses follow closely in importance. Food security in the Pacific
region is based on the local staples of taro, yams, breadfruit, and
sweet potato. It is becoming one of the major issues there, both at
the national and household level, while the traditional "food
gardens" of the Pacific Islands are disappearing.
Multiple viral infections are common in field plants with the
potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement) or cross-protection
(competitive suppression). Synergism is characterised by a much more
dramatic increase in symptom severity and virus amounts than could be
expected by simply adding up the effects of the partner viruses (for
more information see ProMED-mail 20070624.2042)
Some of the viruses known to affect sweet potato are: _Sweet potato
chlorotic stunt virus_ (SPCSV, genus _Crinivirus_); _Sweet potato
feathery mottle virus_ (SPFMV), _Sweet potato latent virus_, and
_Sweet potato mild speckling virus_ (all genus _Potyvirus_); _Sweet
potato mild mottle virus_ (genus _Ipomovirus_); _Cucumber mosaic
virus_ (genus _Cucumovirus_); Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus and
C-6 virus (both putative members of the genus _Carlavirus_).
Co-infection of SPCSV with SPFMV results in sweet potato virus
disease (SPVD), a synergistic disease that causes a yield reduction
of up to 60 percent. The yield losses reported might even be
underestimated because symptomless plants may not necessarily be
virus-free and these latent infections may have a yield decreasing
effect. Synergistic diseases involving some of the other viruses have
also been reported, and an experimental yield increase of at least 40
percent has been observed in tested virus-free cultivars of sweet
potato. The epidemiology of the synergistic viruses and their
respective vectors will necessarily be highly complex.
In addition to the viruses reported so far, further viruses (possibly
including new species) can be expected to exist in sweet potato due
to the predominantly vegetative propagation of this crop, which
increases the risk of a build-up of viruses. Virus-free planting
material will need to be provided to farmers regularly since 'clean'
plants may become infected in the field.
