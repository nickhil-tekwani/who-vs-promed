Federal health officials have confirmed that a salad packed with boxed
meals shipped to Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge dealerships was responsible for
food poisoning in 333 dealership employees. The large meals, assembled by
HoneyBaked Foods Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, included ham and-or turkey with
several side dishes, packed in ice and shipped by next-day delivery.
HoneyBaked Foods is a catalog business not affiliated with the Honey Baked
Ham Co. of Troy.
DaimlerChrysler AG has sent out about 3000 of the meals over the past two
years to congratulate dealerships that received the company's Five Star
rating for sales performance. The company stopped shipping the meals in
early February after the first reported illnesses.
HoneyBaked Foods said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
determined that four kinds of salad made by another company was the source
of the outbreak, which caused one- to two-day bouts of nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea. The CDC said the symptoms were similar to those from a
Norwalk-type virus, one of the most common causes of food-borne illness.
CDC epidemiologist Alicia Anderson said of the 333 people the CDC found had
become sick from the meals, 11 were briefly hospitalized.
HoneyBaked Foods president Dan Kurz said the salads were prepared by a
Toledo-based catering service. He said HoneyBaked will no longer buy foods
from the service. DaimlerChrysler spokesman Mike Aberlich said the company
will no longer ship meals to dealerships, but will instead give dealers
money to buy their own meals. The company will still work with HoneyBaked
Foods to arrange catering. DaimlerChrysler has about 4500 Chrysler, Dodge
and Jeep dealerships in the United States.
