Bad meat could be the source of an infectious outbreak in a barracks in Turkey that has killed one soldier and hospitalized 1046, said Dr Tur Yildiz Bicer. The outbreak was detected on [Tue 23 May 2017] at the First Manisa Infantry Brigade training center in western Manisa, but the Ministry of Health has not offered any official conclusions, pending the outcome of an investigation by a team of 10 experts.

Bicer, who is also a deputy of the main opposition group, the Republican People's Party (CHP), visited the soldiers being treated at the provincial hospital. As he later told the newspaper Hürriyet, tests concluded that soldiers were infected with salmonellosis through turkey meat, which was rarely served on the barracks menu. "In the samples were found traces of _Salmonella_ bacteria, which are transmitted through meat, especially poultry, if it is not well cooked or is not stored according to health regulations," said the doctor. Soldiers ate turkey meat the night the outbreak began.

He also reported that most of the patients belonged to a barracks whose dining room is subcontracted to a private company which manages 12 military units throughout the country. However, there was also a group of 64 who were hospitalized with similar symptoms, but were members of the 6th regiment of the Gendarmerie of Manisa, which have their own food service.

A possible explanation is that both dining services made purchases from the same supplier. However, they have not yet performed an analysis of the water supply of the affected quarters, due to lack of time, Bicer said.

Manisa's governor Mustafa Hakan Güvencer tried to unlink the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea present in those affected with food poisoning, instead claiming that they were suffering from 'stomach flu' due to the change of season.
