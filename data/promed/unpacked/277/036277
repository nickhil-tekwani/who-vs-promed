About 90 per cent of camels in the Gulf region are carriers of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which requires the urgent need for a vaccine, according to a leading Health Ministry official.

In addition, the virus can be transmitted over a 1 meter [metre] distance, Abdullah Asiri, undersecretary for preventative health at the ministry, was quoted as saying in a local publication on [Tue 24 Feb 2015]. Asiri said that 50 per cent of camels in Al-Ahsa region carry the virus. A person who comes into contact with infected camels can transmit the virus to family members without showing symptoms of the disease, he said.

He said mass extermination of these camels was not an acceptable solution, so research should be accelerated to develop a vaccine. Younger camels are most able to transmit the disease to humans. Most viruses come from animals, mutate on their own, and are then transmitted to humans, he said.

The rapid transmission of the disease over the past year was mainly due to contact with infected patients within health facilities, especially in emergency departments, Asiri said.

Patients have been advised not to visit health facilities for minor ailments, or cases of the ordinary flu, but should only seek treatment if they suspect being infected by MERS after contact with animals.

Members of the public should visit primary health care centers because they are fully equipped to handle such cases. He urged people to avoid contact with animals, especially camels. If they must make contact, then they should wear masks and gloves, and refrain from rubbing their eyes or noses after touching them.

[Some of the data in the report above, such as the 1 meter [metre] distance aerosol spread of MERS-CoV from camels, are in need of scientific substantiation. Are seropositive camels regarded as "carriers"?

Notably, Al-Ahsa (also Alhassa, Al-Hasa) region was the location where a cluster of MERS-CoV cases in human patients was recorded in May 2013 (see 20130502.1686948).

Motivating camel owners to vaccinate their animals against a virus which does not cause clinical disease in their animals, is to become one of the main challenges for health authorities if a vaccine becomes available and a mass camel vaccination policy is adopted to prevent MERS-CoV in humans.

A recent Reuters communication included the following international experts' comments (see also item [3] in 20150225.3186568):
"Saudi Arabia has not done enough to investigate and control the deadly Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, United Nations health experts said [Mon 23 Feb 2015]. They said that cases were surging again, but that Saudi health officials and scientists appeared unable to explain where the infections start and how they spread. Scientists and public health experts from the World Health Organization [WHO], the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization[FAO] and the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] visited Saudi Arabia last week [week of 16 Feb 2015] to investigate. MERS causes coughing, fever, and breathing problems, and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Initial studies have linked the virus to camels, but disease experts note that many infected people report no contact with camels. The WHO says 1026 confirmed cases -- including at least 376 deaths -- have been reported since MERS emerged in 2012. About 85 percent have been in Saudi Arabia."
