In May [2009], Louie, a 16-year-old quarterhorse, was competing in
barrel-racing events for his proud owners, [a couple from] Niota.
Today [8 Sep 2009], Louie is clinging to life as staffers at
Countryside Veterinary Services in Louisville work to battle a
disease that can cause a healthy horse to deteriorate within a matter of weeks.

"He's a barrel-racing horse and he is known around quite a few states
(surrounding Tennessee)," [the owner] said. According to her, nearly
3 weeks ago, Louie was in the pasture when she noticed he was not
following the other horses too well. She checked on him later and
found he was hot and sweaty, so she left him out overnight to cool
off. The next day, she noticed a green discoloration on Louie's nose
and mouth, so she called the veterinarian.

[She] said Dr. Hugh McCampbell treated the horse for choking.
However, when the discharge causing the discoloration later turned
from green to a clear, gel-like consistency, the [owners] knew
something serious was wrong with Louie, who became severely
dehydrated nearly overnight.

Realizing that Louie was very sick, [the owner] said the vet called
the University of Tennessee's College of Veterinary Medicine, which
diagnosed either equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) or rabies;
he then directed them to Countryside Veterinary Services.

EPM is a progressive neurologic disease caused by protozoal infection
of the central nervous system of horses. "We're trying a new
medication on him," [the owner] said. "He's still under guarded
treatment ... but we're hoping he's going to come through this."
However, the medication, called Marquis, is expensive.
"For this type of medication it's about USD 250 a week or USD 1000 a
month," she said, adding there are some signs of improvement. "Our
medical expenses are really getting up there."

So, far, the cost for Louie's care has reached more than USD 5000 for
the medication and his stay in the intensive care unit at the
veterinary practice, [she] said, but it will take up to 2 weeks to
see a marked change in Louie's condition; if swallowing doesn't
return, he will be euthanized. "Within 2 weeks if he doesn't shown
signs of swallowing, we'll have to make the decision [regarding
euthanasia]," she said.
Louie, a registered quarterhorse with the Barrel Racing Association,
could live up to 30 years if EPM doesn't cut his life expectancy in half.

According to "Horse Ring" (<http://www.horsering.com>), horses are
infected with EPM through fecal-oral transmission as the horse
consumes food and/or water contaminated by droppings left by
opossums. An estimated 30 percent of the horses in the United Stated
have been exposed to the organism, but only a fraction of these
animals ever show clinical symptoms.

There is no vaccine to help combat the prevalence of EPM, but some
measures may be taken to minimize the risk of contraction
- as an obvious initial strategy, steps should be taken to keep
opossums away from the horses. To this end, some suggestions are to
make foodstuffs inaccessible with the aim of keeping the mouse
population down to a minimum;
- another alternative is to feed heat treated grains where the
EPM-causing contaminants have been killed as a result of the food processing.

[The horse owner] said EPM has a 2- to 4-month incubation period, so
Louie was sick long before he began showing symptoms. Also, she said
she understands that the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency is
looking out for EPM in horses and rabies in other animals this summer [2009].

Louie's owners visit him every day or so and [say] they appreciate
the veterinary staff caring for him. "They have thoroughly taken care
of our horse," she said.

[The owner] said the signs of EPM can be mistaken for lameness and
she wonders how many horse owners had their horses euthanized because
they didn't know that medication is available to treat EPM. "We have
heard of so many people with horse trouble around here (and if it is
because of EPM) it is treatable if it's caught in time," she said. In
addition, anyone wishing to help with Louie's care may send
contributions to Countryside Veterinary Services, 2930 Little Dug Gap
Road, Louisville, TN 37777.

[Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is a common neurologic
disease of horses in the Americas; it has been reported in most of
the contiguous 48 states of the USA, southern Canada, and several
countries in Central and South America. In other countries, EPM is
seen sporadically.

Most cases of EPM are caused by an Apicomplexa protozoan,
_Sarcocystis neurona_. Horses are infected by ingestion of _S.
neurona_ sporocysts in contaminated feed or water. The organism is
assumed to undergo early asexual multiplication (schizogony) in
extraneural tissues before parasitizing the CNS. Because infectious
sarcocysts are not formed, the horse is considered an aberrant,
dead-end host for _S. neurona_. All _Sarcocystis_ spp have an
obligate predator-prey life cycle. The definitive (predator) host for
_S. neurona_ is believed to be the opossum (_Didelphis virginiana_).

Because the protozoa may infect any part of the CNS, almost any
neurologic sign is possible. The disease usually begins insidiously
but may present acutely and be severe at onset. Signs of spinal cord
involvement are more common than signs of brain disease. Horses with
EPM involving the spinal cord have asymmetric or symmetric weakness
and ataxia of one to all limbs, sometimes with obvious muscle
atrophy. When the caudal spinal cord is involved, there are signs of
cauda equina syndrome. EPM lesions in the spinal cord also may result
in demarcated areas of spontaneous sweating or loss of reflexes and
cutaneous sensation. The most common signs of brain disease in horses
with EPM are depression, head tilt, and facial paralysis. Any cranial
nerve nucleus may be involved, and there may be seizures, visual
deficits including abnormal menace response, or behavioral
abnormalities. Without treatment, EPM often progresses to cause
recumbency and death. Progression to recumbency occurs over hours to
years and may occur steadily or in a stop-start fashion.

Postmortem diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of protozoa in CNS
lesions. An immunoblot (Western blot) test for _S. neurona_ is used
as an aid to antemortem diagnosis. In horses with neurologic signs,
demonstration of specific antibody in CSF (by immunoblot) is highly
suggestive of EPM. A positive immunoblot test in serum only indicates
exposure to _S. neurona_. Conversely, a negative immunoblot result,
in either serum or CSF, tends to exclude the diagnosis of EPM. In a
few horses with EPM, CSF analysis reveals abnormalities such as
mononuclear pleocytosis and increased protein concentration.

Depending on the clinical signs, differential diagnoses may include
cervical stenotic myelopathy, trauma, aberrant metazoan parasite
migration, equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy,
myeloencephalopathy caused by equine herpesvirus 1, equine motor
neuron disease, neuritis of the cauda equina, arboviral (Eastern or
Western, equine, West Nile) encephalomyelitis, rabies, bacterial
meningitis, and leukoencephalomalacia.

The only FDA-approved treatments for EPM are ponazuril and
nitazoxanide, both as paste formulations. An alternative approach is
the use of antifolate drugs, such as, sulfadiazine, or
sulfamethoxazole in combination with pyrimethamine). The sulfonamide
can be given with or without trimethoprim. Pyrimethamine must be
given at least 1 hour before or after hay is fed. Treatment is
usually continued for 6 months. Anemia may develop after prolonged
treatment with antifolate drugs and is best prevented by provision of
high quantities of green forage. At least 60 percent of horses
improve with treatment, but less than 25 percent recover completely.
Relapses are common in horses that remain positive on immunoblot and
rare in those that become negative.

No proven preventive is available. A conditionally approved vaccine
is marketed, and its efficacy continues to be evaluated. There is
interest in using antiprotozoal drugs for prevention; however,
evidence-based protocols are not yet available. The source of
infective sporocysts is probably opossum feces, so it is prudent to
prevent access of opossums to horse-feeding areas. Horse and pet feed
should not be left out; open feed bags and garbage should be kept in
closed galvanized metal containers, bird feeders should be
eliminated, and fallen fruit should be removed. Opossums can be
trapped and relocated. Because putative intermediate hosts cannot be
directly infective for horses, it is unlikely that control of these
populations will be useful in EPM prevention.

Opossums are North America's only marsupial and are quite fascinating
creatures. It is unfortunate that they are the host for an agent of
such devastation in our equine companions.
