[The outbreak, situated on Albania's border with Kosovo, is not surprising. Albania borders another LSD-infected country, namely former Yugoslavian Macedonia (FYROM). Other 2 Balkan countries, which are currently threatened since they share borders with LSD-infected territories, are Romania and Montenegro.

Albania's veterinary authorities seem to have opted for an LSD control policy which differs in 1 main measure from EU's policy: no stamping-out is applied. Wide-scale LSD vaccination, if timely and effectively applied, may spare mass culling.

EU-members are obliged, according to the prevailing legislation, to destroy entire holdings in which even a single case of LSD has been recorded. The number of cattle destroyed since the start of the LSD epizootic in the 2 affected EU member countries (Greece and Bulgaria) is as follows (in brackets: clinical cases/died): Greece - 10 595 (771/83); Bulgaria - 1937 (117/0).

Other affected Balkan countries have different policy. The figures in Serbia, which applies "modified stamping out" were 84 (138/0). FYROM named its policy, in the OIE reports, "stamping out" but in fact a modified stamping out has been applied: out of 473 susceptible animals in the affected holdings, 46 had clinical disease of which 1 died; 193 animals have, reportedly, been destroyed, 116 slaughtered. - Mod.AS
