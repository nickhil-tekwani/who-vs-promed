Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: suspected human transmission.

Epidemiological comments: 5 tigers and 3 lions were housed in 2 enclosures at a zoo. The 1st tiger showed clinical signs of disease on [27 Mar 2020]. By [3 Apr 2020], 3 additional tigers and all lions were showing clinical signs. Clinical signs consisted of a dry cough and some wheezing; one animal had inappetence. None of the animals were in respiratory distress. The lions and tigers were isolated and no other animals at the zoo have shown any signs of respiratory disease. Samples were collected from the 1st affected tiger and it was confirmed positive for SAR-CoV-2/COVID-19. The other animals with clinical signs are also presumed to be infected. All animals are stable and are recovering. It is assumed that an asymptomatic zoo employee infected the animals.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
