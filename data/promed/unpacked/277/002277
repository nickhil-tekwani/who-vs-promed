Rapid breath test detecting COVID-19 infection launches clinical trial
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Israel based Scentech-Medical announced it had received approval from the Shamir Medical Center Review Board for a new clinical trial to demonstrate its ability to monitor the antibody levels and type of antibodies developed by the population of subjects getting vaccinated for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Scentech, which is merging with NextGen Biomed Ltd, reports that using the test developed for the analysis and quantification of volatile compounds in breath can detect coronavirus patients, active, symptomatic, and asymptomatic carriers.

Every pathogen has a unique genetic expression that creates a metabolic fingerprint, which can be detected by a rapid smell test (RST), says the company. It may even indicate the body's immune response reflected by the type and level of antibodies expressed by the body. As part of the research, Scentech-Medical will test subjects getting vaccinated to map biomarkers specifically related to antibodies of type IgM and IgG, stated the press release issued on 4 Jan 2021 [article stated 2020, but I assume they meant 2021. - Mod.LK]

The test to monitor antibody levels and type will provide a quick indication as to the efficacy of the vaccines currently available. Moreover, such a test can indicate the immune system's response to various types of vaccines. The company's VOX system detected differences among various test groups: positive subjects, negative subjects, and negative subjects with antibodies for the coronavirus.

Scentech-Medical reported that 784 participants were tested using the company's VOX system, alongside PCR and serological tests. From that total, 41 tested positive in PCR, and 742 tested negative for coronavirus, out of which 68 showed the presence of antibodies based on serological tests.

Scentech-Medical is also working on completing its global analysis system, which combines advanced artificial intelligence and unique algorithms developed by the company. This system is aimed for the rapid and automated analysis of data collected by the company's devices to monitor disease spread, detect new mutations of the coronavirus, and identify recent disease outbreaks in real-time on both a local and global level. The development of the worldwide analysis system is expected to enter alpha testing within a month.

Scentech-Medical focuses on developing technologies for the early and rapid detection of diseases in real-time, through the analysis of volatile compounds founds in the breath, using non-invasive, effective, and low-cost tests. The technology developed by the company detects the presence of unique metabolic processes, which are associated with pathogens or the body's response to pathogens.

Scentech Medical's laboratory, located in the Weizmann Science Park, Ness Ziona, Israel, is uniquely suited for mapping biomarkers in exhaled breath thanks to its state-of-the-art equipment and a team of highly skilled researchers.

[A rapid breath test as a diagnostic tool could be very powerful if it were able to be used to identify antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or natural infection, as well as a specimen for detection of the virus itself. The ability to "monitor disease spread, detect new mutations ..., and identify recent disease outbreaks in real-time on both a local and global level" using a rapid non-invasive technique is the approach surveillance should take.

"Breath biomarkers largely arise either as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) captured from the air or as non-volatiles found within respiratory droplets from exhaled breath aerosols. Both sources are of great interest for research and medical applications as they provide complementary information. Many exhaled VOCs are the products of metabolism and so reflect biochemical activities within the body.

"Respiratory droplets can contain non-volatile metabolites, proteins, DNA and viral pathogens offering insights into other biological processes.

"Due to their volatile nature, VOCs in breath are typically small molecules. They can arise from both external sources (food, smoking, pollution, chemicals) and from within the body itself, as such they can reflect biochemical and metabolic activity as well as environmental effects. Endogenous VOCs are often the product of metabolic processes and, as such, the metabolic effects of diseases are reflected in the pattern of exhaled VOCs. Samples are typically analyzed and VOCs identified using detailed chemical analysis tools such as mass spectrometry. Non-invasive Breath Biopsy represents an adaptable and accessible means to detect and measure VOCs as biomarkers for disease.

"Biomarkers originating from all parts of the body are captured in breath, making Breath Biopsy applicable to a wide range of diseases including inflammatory, respiratory, liver, metabolic, cardiovascular and infectious diseases as well as various cancers. The nature of Breath Biopsy, and breath biomarkers, make them perfectly suited to addressing two of the major challenges of healthcare today: early detection and precision medicine."

"Abstract
---------
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid, cost effective, accurate, and non-invasive testing for viral infections. Volatile compounds (VCs) have been suggested for several decades as fulfilling these criteria. However currently very little work has been done in trying to diagnose viral infections using VCs. Much of the work carried out to date involves the differentiation of bacterial and viral sources of infection and often the detection of bacterial and viral co-infection. However, this has usually been done in vitro and very little work has involved the use of human participants. Viruses hijack the host cell metabolism and do not produce their own metabolites so identifying virus specific VCs is at best a challenging task. However, there are proteins and lipids that are potential candidates as markers of viral infection. The current understanding is that host cell glycolysis is upregulated under viral infection to increase the available energy for viral replication. There is some evidence that viral infection leads to the increase of production of fatty acids, alkanes, and alkanes related products. For instance, 2,3-butandione, aldehydes, 2,8-dimethyl-undecane and n-propyl acetate have all been correlated with viral infection. Currently, the literature points to markers of oxidative stress (e.g. nitric oxide, aldehydes etc) being the most useful in the determination of viral infection. The issue, however, is that there are also many other conditions that can lead to oxidative stress markers being produced. In this review a range of (mainly mass spectrometric) methods are discussed for viral detection in breath, including breath condensate. Currently MALDI-ToF-MS is likely to be the preferred method for the identification of viral strains and variants of those strains, however it is limited by its need for the viral strains to have been sequenced and logged in a database."

PMID: 33400782
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody measurements can be used to estimate the proportion of a population exposed or infected and may be informative about the risk of future infection. Previous estimates of the duration of antibody responses vary.

Methods
We present 6 months of data from a longitudinal seroprevalence study of 3276 UK healthcare workers (HCWs). Serial measurements of SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike IgG were obtained. Interval censored survival analysis was used to investigate the duration of detectable responses. Additionally, Bayesian mixed linear models were used to investigate anti-nucleocapsid waning.

Results
Anti-spike IgG levels remained stably detected after a positive result, e.g., in 94% (95% credibility interval, CrI, 91-96%) of HCWs at 180 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels rose to a peak at 24 (95% credibility interval, CrI 19-31) days post first PCR-positive test, before beginning to fall. Considering 452 anti-nucleocapsid seropositive HCWs over a median of 121 days from their maximum positive IgG titre, the mean estimated antibody half-life was 85 (95%CrI, 81-90) days. Higher maximum observed anti-nucleocapsid titres were associated with longer estimated antibody half-lives. Increasing age, Asian ethnicity and prior self-reported symptoms were independently associated with higher maximum anti-nucleocapsid levels and increasing age and a positive PCR test undertaken for symptoms with longer anti-nucleocapsid half-lives.

Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies wane within months, and faster in younger adults and those without symptoms. However, anti-spike IgG remains stably detected. Ongoing longitudinal studies are required to track the long-term duration of antibody levels and their association with immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

Abstract
--------
We analyzed 21 676 residual specimens from Ontario, Canada collected between March-August, 2020 to investigate the effect of antibody decline on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates. Testing specimens orthogonally using the Abbott (anti-nucleocapsid) and then the Ortho (anti-spike) assays, seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4%-1.4%, despite ongoing disease activity. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibody-positive specimens decreased over time (p=0.015), and the GMC of antibody-negative specimens increased over time (p=0.0018). The association between the two tests decreased each month (p less than 0.001), suggesting anti-N antibody decline. Lowering the Abbott antibody index cut-off from 1.4 to 0.7 resulted in a 16% increase in positive specimens.

[The study by Lumley et al was a longitudinal seroprevalence study of healthcare workers in the UK. Both PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 and healthy (or potentially asymptomatic infected individuals) were included in this study. The authors mentioned that the incidence of COVID-19 fell substantially in their hospital, thereby precluding any conclusions about reinfection possibilities due to lack of exposure of the healthcare workers or of boosting of pre-existing antibody responses. The anti-N antibodies demonstrated decline, showing a half-life of 85 days; whereas the anti-spike antibodies persisted for the 180 days of the study. They also observed waning immunity more pronounced in those with asymptomatic and milder infections.

The study by Bolotin et al was a population-based study where seropositivity by both tests (anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike protein) was the basis for calling a positive test result. Samples were tested for 5 periods of time encompassing a total of 5 months. The study documented a decline in the anti-nucleocapsid determinations over the 5 month period. The authors concluded that the anti-N antibody decline was significant enough to affect results of population based seroprevalence studies. They cite examples of other serosurvey studies with conflicting results.

We posted a study by Choe et al in Korea, where they used 4 different immunoassays: an antinucleocapsid (anti-N) panimmunoglobulin (pan-Ig) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA); an anti-N IgG ELISA; an antispike (anti-S) IgG; and an anti-S1 spike subunit IgG ELISA.

Their results included: anti-N pan-Ig detected in 53 (91.4%), anti-N IgG in 15 (25.9%), anti-S IgG in 50 (86.2%), and anti-S1 IgG in 40 (69.0) (p less than 0.01).

These 3 studies above seem to suggest that using an anti-N immunologic assay may underestimate the true prevalence of antibody in individuals in an area, but combining it with anti-spike assays may be more reliable testing. - Mod.MPP]

The Iranian Minister of Health has confirmed the detection in Iran of the 1st case of a new strain of coronavirus, which was first identified in the UK. In remarks at a televised speech on Tuesday [5 Jan 2021], Health Minister Saeed Namaki said the presence of the new strain of the coronavirus in Iran does not mean any new panic, urging people to observe the health protocols more strictly.

The minister said the 1st carrier of the mutated coronavirus is an Iranian national who has returned home from the UK. The new variant of coronavirus was detected after a long process of screening, he added, saying the patient had been admitted to a private hospital and was tested positive with the mutated strain after several procedures. The patient is currently in good health condition, the minister noted.

The passenger has acted quite wisely after arriving in Iran and has self-isolated despite holding a negative PCR test result upon arrival, Namaki said, noting that the new strain of COVID has not been detected in any of the people in contact with the patient. He further dismissed reports about another case of the mutated coronavirus in the western provinces, saying a physician suspected of being infected underwent several tests and more than 240 people in contact with that doctor were also screened, but there was no trace of the new strain.

The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) said Tuesday [5 Jan 2021] it has discovered the state's 1st confirmed case of the UK COVID-19 strain, raising alarms among hospitals that the pandemic's upward climb could become even worse. The UK variant, also known as B.1.1.7, is believed to be much more contagious than the typical SARS-CoV-2 virus. Though the variant is not believed to be more lethal or cause more severe illness, it has deepened officials' concerns as the US is gripped by its 3rd and so far worst wave of the virus. Hospitals nationally and in Georgia are seeing record numbers of COVID-19 patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged states to test for the variant, which has been found in at least 5 states, including California, New York, and Colorado.

DPH said a Georgia resident, an 18-year-old man with no travel history, is isolating at his home. State officials also working to identify the teen's close contacts. DPH said the agency will monitor any close contacts and test those individuals for the variant. "The emergence of this variant in our state should be a wake-up call for all Georgians," said DPH Commissioner Dr Katheen E. Toomey. "Even as we begin roll out of a COVID-19 vaccine, we must not let down our guard and ignore basic prevention measures -- wear a mask, social distance, and wash your hands frequently." DPH had said it would start testing for the variant this week. DPH said in a news release the strain was found during an analysis of a sample sent from a Georgia pharmacy to a commercial lab.

Saratoga County officials say they are working with the state to trace all potential exposures that a jewelry store employee had with others, after it was revealed Monday [4 Jan 2021] that he had the state's 1st case of a more contagious coronavirus strain 1st detected in the United Kingdom.

The state swabbed and tested 5 more people associated with the N. Fox Jewelers store in Saratoga Springs on Monday [4 Jan 2021]. 4 of them tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, but further testing was underway Tuesday [5 Jan 2021] to determine whether they were infected with the new B.1.1.7 strain, the county said. Of the 4 who tested positive, 3 were previously known to be positive, and one had been ill and isolating before learning of their test result, the county said. No additional people had tested positive for the variant as of Tuesday evening [5 Jan 2021], the county said.

The variant strain was first detected in the UK last fall [2020] and has since been identified in California, Colorado, Florida and 37 countries. While scientists estimate the strain is anywhere from 40 to 70 percent more infectious than the last one, they say it does not appear to be more lethal and is unlikely to change the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines currently being rolled out.

Gov. Andrew M Cuomo said Tuesday [5 Jan 2021] that the strain's arrival in New York constitutes a new, serious danger and could be a "game changer."

Eli Rosenberg, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University at Albany, said a more contagious virus may mean that governments need to raise their bar for vaccine coverage. Experts have said anywhere from 75 to 85 percent of the population will need to be vaccinated against coronavirus for any meaningful level of herd immunity to be achieved. "There's this classic mathematical relationship between transmissibility and herd immunity," Rosenberg said. "And basically as something spreads more easily you need to have higher coverage for herd immunity... if this becomes the (dominant) strain, then the bar is moved on vaccine coverage."

On Tuesday [4 Jan 2021], Cuomo encouraged anyone who believes they may have been exposed to the strain while visiting the Saratoga Springs jewelry store, located at 404 Broadway, between [18-24 Dec 2020] to schedule a test. The state set up a free test site just for patrons of the store in the Saratoga Spa State Park, located at 99 E. West Road in Saratoga Springs. ...The site will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily until Friday [8 Jan 2020]. "Anyone who was exposed, anyone who was exposed to someone who was exposed, please contact us," Cuomo said,

While the new strain was first identified in Saratoga Springs, it's unlikely the problem is confined to the Saratoga or even broader Capital Region, said Rosenberg. "All of this with the Saratoga case, with the UK cases -- you have to remember that they're all based on small samples," he said. "So for every one we're detecting, there's a whole lot we're not."

In New York, the state's Wadsworth Laboratory and private laboratories have sequenced nearly 5000 random coronavirus samples since March [2020], said Jonah Bruno, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health. The pace of sequencing picked up in December [2020], as the transmissibility of the UK variant was making headlines. Of the more than 1600 samples Wadsworth has sequenced so far, 870 have occurred since [23 Dec 2020], Bruno said.

Canada along with provinces and territories remain on the lookout for more transmissible variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, the country's top doctor said Tuesday [5 Jan 2021]. So far, there have been 9 cases detected in Canada of a variant virus first identified in the United Kingdom. There have been no reports of other variants of concern in this country such as the one 1st reported in South Africa, according to Dr Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer. "To date the cases that we know of, that's been genomically identified, have been in travellers or their contacts," said Tam.

Cases of the UK variant have been detected so far in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec, but so far not in Manitoba. To identify variants, Tam said Canada has been doing genomic sequencing of viruses throughout the pandemic at a rate of about 5 per cent of total cases. Tam also said the provinces and territories, clinical networks and laboratories are monitoring for the variant in travellers and specific patient groups such as immunocompromised people and people who have received the vaccine.

Given the identification of cases without known travel from the UK and no known contact with travellers from the UK, it seems as though the 'cat is out of the bag'... this variant virus is out in the community in a number of the countries. According to Mod.EP, in Denmark, the current estimate is approximately 8% of cases are now attributable to the B.1.1.7 virus. We're in a 'seek and ye shall find' stage in following this variant as it travels the globe, and see if it continues to demonstrate increased transmissibility outside of the UK. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO updates (as of 5 Jan 2021)
[A] Weekly epidemiological update
Date: Tue 5 Jan 2021
Source: WHO, Emergency Situational Updates [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---5-january-2021


Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [3 Jan 2021], 10 am CET. Other information collected by epidemic intelligence activities and verified by WHO.

Overview
--------
For the 3rd week in a row over 4 million new cases were reported globally, and new deaths increased by 3% to 76 000. This brings the cumulative numbers to over 83 million reported cases and over 1.8 million deaths globally since the start of the pandemic. Recent reports of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 have raised concern about and interest in the impact of viral changes. As of [5 Jan 2021], the VOC-202012/01 variant initially detected in the United Kingdom has been detected in a small number of cases in 40 other countries/territories/areas in 5 of the 6 WHO regions, and the 501Y.V2 variant initially detected in South African in 6 other countries/territories/areas.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
For the 3rd week in a row over 4 million new cases were reported globally, although this week saw a slight decrease compared to the previous week. However, this and other short-term trends in data should be interpreted with caution owing to the end-of-year holiday season, as numbers may be influenced by presentation, testing, and reporting delays. The decrease seen last week in new deaths has been reversed with deaths rising by 3% to 76 000 (Figure 1, Table 1). The Region of the Americas accounted for 47% of all new cases and 42% of all new deaths globally in the past week. New cases and deaths remained high in the European Region, which accounted for 38% and 43% respectively, showing a slight decrease in new cases and a slight increase in new deaths. New cases and deaths continue to decline in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the African Region, while both new cases and deaths remain low in absolute numbers, for the 4th week in a row, the Region is reporting the largest percentage increase globally in weekly reported case numbers and this week there was a further 13% increase in new cases and 28% increase in new deaths. In the Western Pacific Region, new cases remained comparable to the previous week, but new deaths rose by 10%. As we welcome the New Year [2021], and look eagerly towards COVID-19 vaccination campaigns worldwide, the current epidemiological situation with near record numbers of new cases and deaths, makes it imperative to continue to adhere to safety measures to prevent further transmission and loss of life.

Recent reports of different variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have again raised interest in and concern about the impact of viral changes. In the last months, 2 different variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to WHO as unusual public health events from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, referred to as VOC 202012/01, and the Republic of South Africa, named 501Y.V2. Preliminary epidemiologic, modelling, phylogenetic and clinical findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 has increased transmissibility, and preliminary data also indicates that there is no change in disease severity (as measured by length of hospitalization and 28-day case fatality), or occurrence of reinfection between variant cases compared to other SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the United Kingdom. To date, outside of the United Kingdom, 40 countries across 5 of the 6 WHO regions have reported cases of VOC 202012/01, while outside of South Africa 6 countries, in 2 of the 6 WHO regions have reported cases of 501Y.V2. The authorities in both countries are conducting further epidemiological and virological investigations to further assess the transmissibility, severity, risk of reinfection and antibody response to these new variants, as well as potential impact on countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (with 1 325 424 cases, just under a 3rd of global cases and unchanged from last week), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (343 784 cases, continuing last week's rapid increase with a 36% increase), Brazil (252 018 cases, an 11% decrease), the Russian Federation (186 539 cases, a 7% decrease), and India (136 115 cases, a 13% decrease).

Today's (5 Jan 2021) reports still reflects continued weekend reporting artifact during a holiday weekend. In some countries that had no or decreased reporting over the holiday, there is "catch up" reporting, and in other countries they continue to not report over the weekend. Hence drawing any firm conclusions on interpretations will still have to wait.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (225 555), the UK (60 916), Brazil (57 447) and Sweden (32 369) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 024 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (4-5 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (16 countries) include the USA, UK, Brazil, Sweden, Russia (24 246), Spain (23 700), France (20 489), Germany (18 349), India (17 909), Colombia (16 835), Italy (15 375), Turkey (14 494), South Africa (14 410), Argentina (13 790), Czech Republic (12 921), and Mexico (11 271). A total of 54 countries (down from 61 countries on 31 Dec 2020) reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 54 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 13.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 9.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 20.1% increase in daily reported cases and a 20.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 725 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours and over 86.75 million cumulative reported cases with over 1.87 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Sobering data is that the comparative 7-day averages are reflecting renewed significant increases of newly confirmed cases and deaths both globally and in the USA where transmission continues to be out of control, probably beginning to be indicative of the Christmas weekend travel and gatherings, approximately 10 days ago. - Mod.MPP]
