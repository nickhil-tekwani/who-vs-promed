Hepatitis E kills 2, leaves 60 infected in Kitgum
-------------------------------------------------
Latest statistics in Kitgum District indicate that the deadly hepatitis E
[virus infection] has killed 2 people and left 60 others infected in the
last 2 weeks. The figure now brings the total number of infections in the
district to 1010, while the death toll stands at 160, since the disease
broke out last year [2008].

During the district's review meeting on Tuesday [26 May 2009], Mucwini,
Amida, Lukung, Matidi, Palabek Gem, town council and Padibe sub-counties
were singled out among the high risk areas with special treatment units
opened for patients.

The district secretary for health, Mr Tony Blair Toolit, told journalists
that the continued infections were due to the people's negative attitude
towards the preventive measures. "It's unfortunate that we still continue
to lose people to this disease that can easily be avoided. We appeal for
better health practices in homes," Mr Toolit said. He explained that the
district has now introduced a new strategy to ensure compliance to health
standards in homes which include levying a fine of 5000 Ugandan shillings
[USD 2.24] on every homestead found without a proper latrine or a minimum
of 3 months in prison among other penalties. According to Mr Toolit, most
returning IDPs [Internally displaced persons] have prioritised building
huts [rather than] latrines, increasing the risks of oral-fecal infections.

Meanwhile, the district has also introduced exchange visits for
sub-counties hit by the disease to enable them to learn better practices
from their counterparts that have no reports of the disease. Hepatitis E
has since spread to other districts like Pader, Amuru, and Yumbe in West
Nile, killing hundreds there.

[Since the last report on 6 May 2009 the death toll in Kitgum district has
risen by 4. The number of new cases does not appear to be declining and the
spread of the disease has not been halted. The provision of adequate
latrines and supply of clean water remain the principal restraints on progress.
