UNMIL Humanitarian Situation Report No. 133 7-13 Jan 2008; Government
confirms outbreak of cholera in southeast Liberia
-----------------------------------------------
Last week, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare confirmed that
the suspected outbreak of acute watery diarrhea in the southeastern
counties of Maryland and Grand Kru is a cholera outbreak. Test
results have confirmed one case of cholera, and 4 fatalities were
reported in Maryland and Grand Kru Counties.
Between 5 Dec 2007 and 11 Jan 2008, the total number of cases
reported at the 2 major health facilities in Maryland County (J. J.
Dossen Hospital and Pleebo Health Centre) was 299 patients. There are
no confirmed figures on the number of cases in Grand Kru County. ICRC
confirmed that the cases of acute watery diarrhea/suspected cholera
have so far been reported in Garraway and surrounding areas.
In addition to these officially confirmed cases, there were
unconfirmed reports of an estimated 54 cases of acute watery diarrhea
in Karluway District in Maryland County. In River Gee County, it is
also being reported that there is an apparent outbreak of diarrhea.
According to Dr. Moses Pewu, Acting Chief Medical Officer of Liberia,
most of the figures reported are for people who can reach the 2 major
facilities in Maryland County, and the situation in other parts of
Maryland and Grand Kru Counties is unknown.
A comprehensive response is in place, and it includes case
management, improvement of water and sanitation facilities, hygiene
promotion and awareness/sensitization. UNICEF has dispatched an
assessment mission, including a consignment of drugs, water
testing/purification materials and awareness/sensitization materials
to be used in Grand Kru and Maryland Counties.
WHO dispatched a cholera kit containing materials and medication for
the treatment of 500 people. MERLIN, Solidarites, the Liberia
National Red Cross Society, ICRC, UNMIL and other organizations are
working with the County Health Team to respond to the outbreak. So
far, the response to the outbreak in Maryland County has stabilized
the situation, while the situation in Grand Kru and River Gee
Counties is being monitored.

[2] Cholera - Malawi

Cholera remains a major threat in rural and peri-urban areas in
Malawi, with recurrent outbreaks during the rainy season from
November to April, and is particularly a major risk factor in flood
situations because of the possible and immediate breakdown of water
and sanitation facilities. Food shortages and malnutrition have a
direct effect on individual susceptibility to diseases, and thus the
level of a possible epidemic will be directly related to people's
access to food and safe water. So far, 434 cholera cases and 5 deaths
have been reported in Mulanje, Blantyre, Chikwawa, Thyolo,
Chiradzulu, Nsanje and Nkhotakota districts since the current
outbreak that started on the 5 Nov 2007.
The last cholera season 2006/2007 ended on the week of 17 Jun 2007,
with a total of 309 cases, 6 deaths in 12 districts countrywide and
within a period of 11 months (August 2006 to June 2007). This season
seems to be of major concern, as more cases have already been
reported within a period of 2 months only.

[3] Cholera - Congo DR: (Katanga)

In 3 days, a cholera epidemic has killed 6 patients recently admitted
in the general referral hospital of Daco in the city of Likasi,
Democratic Republic of Congo, medical sources told APA here. The
death of a patient following epidemic diarrhea and vomiting led to
fear in the dwellers of Likasi city, estimated at over 600 000 inhabitants.
According to Dr Jacques Mpoyo, director of the referral hospital, 91
people suffering from cholera were taken into care last week, whereas
30 others received treatment, he said, appealing for more appropriate
means to eradicate the disease.
Dr Kashindji Numbi, inspector of the health district of Likasi, urged
people through a local radio broadcast to observe preventive measures
to contain the epidemic. The shortage of drinkable water in Likasi
city could be behind this epidemic, sources said.

[4] Diarrhea, dysentery - Zimbabwe: (Harare)
Date: Mon 14 Jan 2008

The Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has accused the
government of playing down the outbreak of diarrhea in many city
suburbs. According to the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, more
than 400 cases have been recorded in Mabvuku and Tafara, hit by an
acute water shortage over the past year. CHRA disputed this,
insisting at least 15 000 may have been affected.
CHRA argues Mabvuku and Tafara, being big suburbs with large
populations, could have more victims of the outbreak. The association
says its research showed the government and the council were
understating the number of victims, having counted the households
affected. Some areas in Mabvuku have had no water since last March 2007.
CHRA information officer Mfundo Mlilo says the situation in the twin
suburbs was "very disturbing" because both the Zimbabwe National
Water Authority (Zinwa) and the council had shown a lack of
commitment to solve the crisis.
Mlilo said the diarrhea outbreak was not confined to the 2 suburbs
but to others as well, where cholera and dysentery had been reported.
These include Hatcliffe and Hatcliffe Extension, Epworth,
Marlborough, Msasa, Mufakose, Budiriro, Glen View, Chitungwiza, Mbare
and Hatfield, said the association.
The outbreak has been attributed to erratic water supplies by Zinwa
and the failure by the council to collect garbage and repair burst
sewer pipes on time.
The Standard established during a survey that Hatcliffe has had no
tap water for the past 2 months, and residents say they have been
using unprotected wells. As a result, many people had succumbed to
waterborne diseases.
An Epworth clinic nurse who spoke on condition of anonymity said they
are attending to cases of dysentery and stomach problems "everyday."
She said "I would say that we attend to at least 10 to 15 cases of
some sort of diarrhoea or stomach problems."
At Mbare clinic, a nurse put the figure at 20 a day with diarrhea
complaints. Mbare has raw sewage flowing in the streets and piles of
garbage in different parts of the suburb, especially near the vast
bus terminus.

[5] Cholera, diarrhea - Zimbabwe: (Harare)

Zimbabwe's capital Harare will go without water for a week, the
state-run water authority announced Sunday [13 Jan 2008] in the
latest set-back for struggling residents. Zimbabwe National Water
Authority (ZINWA) general manager Lisben Chipfunde blamed the cut,
which starts Monday [14 Jan 2008], on major power outages at the main
Morton Jaffray treatment plant. Parts of Harare's sprawling dormitory
town of Chitungwiza will also be affected.
"Harare and parts of Chitungwiza will this whole week experience a
loss of water supplies due to problems beyond our control," Chipfunde
told the state-controlled Sunday Mail newspaper. "We are really
concerned about the frequency of power cuts, which are affecting our
plant." News of the cuts come after record rains in December 2007.
Zimbabwe's dams are now 87 percent full, reports said earlier this
month [January 2008]. Lake Chivero, Harare's main water supply, is
already overflowing.
Despite the rains, Harare's more than 1.5 million residents struggle
with long water cuts exacerbated by power shortages, burst sewage
pipes and mounting piles of uncollected refuse.
The Sunday Mail also reported that more than 400 cases of diarrheal
diseases, including cholera, had been diagnosed in recent weeks in
the twin eastern suburbs of Tafara and Mabvuku. There have been a
number of deaths.
