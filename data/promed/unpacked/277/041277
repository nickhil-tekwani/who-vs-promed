70 percent of waterfowl in southern Viet Nam positive for the bird flu virus
-----------------------------------------------
Up to 70 percent of waterfowl in Viet Nam's southern Mekong delta
have tested positive for the bird flu virus strain H5N1, local
newspaper Labor reported on Wednesday [3 Aug 2005].
Local veterinary agencies culled 4620 poultry, mainly ducks and
chickens, after they detected small outbreaks of bird flu in the
capital city Hanoi and the 3 southern localities of Can Tho, Ben Tre
and Dong Thap last month [July 2005], the country's National Steering
Committee on Anti-Bird Flu was quoted as saying in the report.
To minimize possible new outbreaks, Viet Nam is vaccinating chickens
and ducks in northern Nam Dinh province and southern Tien Giang
province against bird flu viruses, including H5N1, on a trial basis.
It will vaccinate some 43 million poultry, including chickens, ducks,
geese and doves, within several months, starting in early August 2005.
On Tuesday [2 Aug 2005], the deputy head of Viet Nam's Preventive
Medicine Department under the Health Ministry, Nguyen Van Binh, said
the country detected 3 human cases of bird flu infection last month.
A 26-year-old woman from southern Ho Chi Minh City and a 24-year-old
man from southern Tra Vinh province have died of the disease, while a
49-year-old woman from northern Ha Tay province has remained
hospitalized.
The department, in mid-July 2005, confirmed that a total of 60 local
people from 23 localities had been infected with bird flu since late
December 2004, of whom 19 died.
The ministry is the sole agency in charge of announcing the official
number of human cases of bird flu infections in Viet Nam.

Viet Nam Begins Mass Vaccination of Poultry
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam this week [1st week August 2005] began administering the 1st
of about 20 million shots to the nation's poultry stock, in the
largest-scale bird flu vaccination program ever conducted here.
Officials will have to overcome considerable logistical hurdles for
the program to be a success: the vaccine must be kept cool, and
millions of chickens running freely must be caught by hand twice,
once for the initial injection and 3 to 4 weeks later for booster
shots [see comment].
At first, To Long Thanh, vice director at the National Center for
Veterinary Diagnosis, wasn't sure the country could accomplish that.
But over the past several months, he's become convinced the country
is doing the right thing by moving forward with the pilot program to
vaccinate millions of chickens and ducks in 2 provinces.
Thanh said that if all goes well, the program could be expanded to
nearly all provinces by year's [2005] end.
Officials and volunteers on Saturday [30 Jul 2005] began giving about
91 000 injections in parts of Tien Giang province and [will start]
[started?] vaccinating another 2.9 million birds on Monday. Nam Dinh
province was set to begin its trial vaccinations Thursday [4 Aug
2005] and will immunize 4.2 million birds next week.
Of all the countries in Asia, Viet Nam has been the hardest hit by
avian influenza. The virus has killed 41 people here. 12 have died in
Thailand, 4 in Cambodia and 3 in Indonesia.
Since late 2003, about 45 million birds have died or been slaughtered
in Viet Nam. The losses have devastated farmers, and the government
has not been able to fully compensate them.
"The first thing is that in Viet Nam and in some Southeast Asian
countries, the culling shows it is not stamping it out," Thanh said,
sitting among stacks of bird flu books and reports in his small Hanoi
office. "That means that you can cull or kill or destroy a lot of
poultry, but it cannot eliminate or reduce the pathogenic virus."
International health officials fear the virus could eventually begin
spreading from person to person, killing millions worldwide. So far,
most human infections have been traced back to contact with birds.
The World Health Organization said it was pleased with Viet Nam's
decision to vaccinate, but it warned that healthy birds can still
carry the virus.
"The vaccination program will need to be accompanied by an intensive
surveillance program so that we can continue to monitor the
distribution and evolution of the virus once the beacon of
large-scale poultry deaths has been switched off," said WHO
epidemiologist Peter Horby in Hanoi.
The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) also applauded the
action. "It's a learning curve for Viet Nam. I think it's wise that
they're doing 2 pilot areas to get lessons from that experience
before they go wider," said Juan Lubroth, an animal health official
with the FAO in Rome. "I think a vaccine is a tool, if applied
correctly, will be very, very successful."
The Vietnamese government has earmarked about USD 37 million for some
400 million doses of the vaccine to be used nationally.
It will use 2 Chinese vaccines for the pilot program, an H5N2 vaccine
for chickens and an H5N1 vaccine for ducks, Thanh said. Earlier this
year [2005], similar vaccines were tested on a smaller number of
poultry in Viet Nam. The results have not been fully analyzed, but he
said they show promise.
Avian influenza vaccines also have been used in China, Indonesia,
Pakistan and Mexico, Lubroth said.
