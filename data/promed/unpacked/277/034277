- Saudi Arabia (Jeddah). 21 Jan 2013. Dengue 5 cases blamed on dumping of sewage water. http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20130121150002

[The association of dumping of sewage water and the appearance of the dengue cases is most likely coincidental. The mosquitoes that the residents complain about are probably not dengue virus vectors, which breed in water catchments in and immediately around buildings. This situation illustrates the need for entomological surveillance.
