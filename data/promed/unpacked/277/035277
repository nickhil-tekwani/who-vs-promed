[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 532 224 with 81 340 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 450 884 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 202 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 60 752 cases when compared with the data on 25 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 17 173 (27.3%) cases, Italy accounting for 6203 (10.2%) cases, and Spain for 8271 (13.6%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 84/7% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 16.1% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA has surpassed China in total number of cases, with Italy to do the same tomorrow (27 Mar 2020). A global total of 24 087 deaths have been reported, 20 795 (86.3%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering around or below 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside of China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy will be number 2 by tomorrow (27 Mar 2020). Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain has been accelerating. To get an understanding of how rapidly things increase, look at the last 3 entries to the "greater than 1000 cases list (Thailand, Romania, and Saudi Arabia). The doubling time from approximately 500 to 1000 cases was between 4-5 days.

I repeat my request to see epidemic curves by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is, as I suspect now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days while awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

[This is the 3rd consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or all of Hubei province in the past 24 hours, but now 49 suspected cases are reported, having reported no suspected cases yesterday (25 Mar 2020). Only 1 non-importation case was reported. There are 55 newly confirmed cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours, all but one were importation related.

According to the report above, a total of 81 340 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 55 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (25 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 5 deaths were reported, all in Hubei province (4 in Wuhan). 43 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. And Macau reported 3 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 30.

Of the 55 newly confirmed cases, 54 were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Shanghai (17), Guangdong (12), Beijing (4), Tianjin (4), Inner Mongolia (3), Zhejiang (3), Fujian (3), and Shandong (2), Yunnan (2), Liaoning (1), Jiangsu (1), Sichuan (1), and Shaanxi (1) bringing the total number of imported cases to 595.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 91 cases and 8 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (25-26 Mar 2020) when there were 104 newly confirmed cases. The daily case count has been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 6 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 69.8% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.8% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, for the 1st time in several weeks, for the past 2 days (24/25 Mar 2020) Daegu did not report 40% or more of the newly confirmed cases. Today it reported 37.4%,. Increases in the proportion of newly confirmed case reporting were seen in Seoul at 13.2%, Gyeonggi at 12.1%, and Gyeongbuk at 9.9%. Quarantined imported cases represented 14.3% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. They are now up to 144 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

An example of the degree of testing performed by South Korea is seen in the excerpt from the 26 Mar 2020 report (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030):
From a preschool (Mirae Kieum Preschool) in Gyeonggi Province, one teacher was confirmed with COVID-19. The 48 contacts (children = 33; teachers = 14; parent = 1) of the teacher have been tested, all of which returned negative. In Daegu, testing has been completed for every person at high-risk facilities. Of the 33 256 test results, 224 (0.7%) were positive results. From a healthcare institution (Daegu Fatima Hospital) in Daegu, 19 cases (patients = 10; staff = 5; guardians/caregivers = 4) have been confirmed since [17 Mar 2020]. Most of the confirmed cases arose from the hospital's 71st and 72nd ward. They have been placed in cohort isolation.

----------------------------------------
Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 80 539 total cases. At the moment 62 013 people are positive for the virus, 10 361 people have recovered. There are 24 753 patients hospitalized with symptoms, 3612 intensive care, and 33 648 are in home isolation.

There have been 8165 reported deaths, however this number can be confirmed only after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 80 539 cases, including 8165 deaths, up from 74 386 cases and 7503 deaths reported on 25 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 25 and 26 Mar 2020 was 6153 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5210 newly confirmed cases between 24 and 25 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (34 889), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (10 816), and Venice (6935), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 61.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 6534 cases and represents 8.3% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, hopefully the 27.0% decrease in reported cases over a 72 hour period was a sign of slowing down of transmission, and not of reporting variance, although there has been an increase over the past 2 days. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this lockdown is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 29 406 cases, 2234 deaths
Date: Thu 26 Mar 2020 2:38 AM GST

https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-26/iran-starts-intercity-travel-ban-amid-fears-of-second-wave-of-coronavirus


Iran has started an intercity travel ban, an Iranian official said in a televised news conference on Thursday [26 Mar 2020], a day after Iran's government spokesman warned the country might face a surge of cases in the coronavirus pandemic.

Officials have complained that many Iranians ignored appeals to stay at home and cancel travel plans for the Persian New Year holidays that began on [20 Mar 2020]. The outbreak has killed 2234 people in Iran where there have been 29 406 reported cases of the virus so far.

"Those who have travelled for the Iranian New Year holidays should immediately return to their cities without making any stops in other cities on their way back home," said Hossein Zolfaghari, a member of Iran's national headquarters for fighting the coronavirus.

The authorities have called on Iranians to avoid public places and stay at home, while schools, universities, cultural and sports centres have been temporarily closed. "The closure of universities and schools, as well as suspension of gatherings, has been extended," Zolfaghari said, adding that violators of the measures will face legal consequences.

President Hassan Rouhani said Iran will contain the spread of the virus in 2 weeks, adding that further measures have been taken to ease the economic impact of the outbreak on lower-income citizens. "We will send a letter to Iran's supreme leader today to seek permission on withdrawal of $1 billion from Iran's sovereign wealth fund," Rouhani said in a meeting, broadcast live on state TV. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the last say on all state matters. "This amount will be used to help impacted lower-income people and to assist our health sector."

[In the 24 hours from 24 to 25 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 27 017 to, 29 406, an increase of 2389 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 2077 to 2234 an increase of 157 deaths in the 24-hour period.

As I have mentioned for the past few days, the significant translocation of the population for the holidays is of concern as it may lead to continued intra country/provincial exportations of the virus. There will now be a nationwide "stay at home" aimed at reducing transmission. Hopefully, it will be successful.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 85 594, higher than reported in China. New York state, with 38 977 (45.0%) cumulative cases reports and 6011 (35.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is showing increases. See the Reuters overview in Section [7] below.

The CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 16.3% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.

[Spain has been rapidly accelerating in terms of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. As of today (26 Mar 2020), there have been a total of 56 188 cases with 8578 cases confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is 113.03. It is now 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy.

Reviewing the tables and data from Section [1] above (and prior posts) above, on 2 Feb 2020 there had only been 1 case reported, by 1 Mar 2020, there were 84 cases, in 1 week, by 8 Mar 2020 there were 673 cases, in another week by 15 Mar 2020 there were 7845 cases, by 22 Mar 2020 there were 28 768 cases (an almost 4 fold increase), and by 26 Mar 2020 4 days later there were 56 188 cases -- a 4 day doubling time. A very sobering set of statistics, seeing how rapidly this virus is transmitted through the community.

[A daily newsletter was produced by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the ebolavirus outbreak. Now that transmission of the ebolavirus has been interrupted (waiting for 2 incubation periods for announcement), the Ministry has been issuing the same platform bulletin daily in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.- Mod.MPP]

Epidemiological evolution of COVID-19 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo:

- Since the start of the epidemic declared on [10 Mar 2020], the cumulative total is 54 confirmed cases;
- in total, there were 4 deaths and 1 person recovered;
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Kinshasa and 1 in North Kivu (the origin of this case is under investigation);
- 1 new death from confirmed cases.

News

A new COVID-19 affected area in the DRC
---------------------------------------
- The Technical Secretary of the Multisectoral Committee for the Pandemic Response [CMR] to COVID-19, Prof Muyembe Ntamfum, announced in his communication on Thursday [26 Mar 2020], that a new area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been affected by the COVID-19 disease;
- it is the province of North Kivu in the east of this country. The origin of the case, he said, is still under investigation;
- he also raised awareness of the signs of COVID-19. To this end, Prof Muyembe reported that a patient with COVID-19 has signs or symptoms like sore throat, dry cough, cold, fever, headache, and difficult breathing;
- "these symptoms are not specific to COVID-19, because in our case, malaria and typhoid fever, 2 very common diseases, have the same picture. Only the consulting doctor or nurse can say whether or not this is a suspected COVID-19 case," he said;
- he thanked the Congolese people for their unconditional support for the COVID-19 response teams;
- in addition, this same Thursday [26 Mar 2020], UNICEF handed over to the CMR COVID-19 Technical Secretariat a large batch of communication and hygiene kits, including handwashes, soap, and some communication tools for awareness-raising on the COVID-19.

[Yesterday (25 Mar 2020) I was very concerned about COVID-19 taking hold in Kinshasa, with an estimated population in 2018 of 13.2 million inhabitants (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.URB.LCTY?locations=CD). Today I am very concerned about the confirmation of a case in North Kivu, one of the main areas involved in the ebolavirus outbreak from 2018 to 2020, and especially because it is an area of extreme civil unrest, with a number of different rebel groups that were attacking ETUs (Ebola treatment units) and the population living in the area. The MOH announcement does not specify where in North Kivu the case was identified but 2 of the 3 major cities (Beni and Butembo) were areas of peak ebolavirus activity. Even though 54 days have passed since the last confirmed case of ebolavirus disease was identified (2 incubation periods is 42 days), the most recent WHO Disease Outbreak News update, today, 26 Mar 2020 says, "However, due to challenges related to continued insecurity and population displacement in previous hotspots, limited access to some affected communities, and potential shortages of resources amidst other local and global emergencies, there remains a high risk of re-emergence of the virus." (https://www.who.int/csr/don/26-March-2020-ebola-drc/en/) Thus, there are active outbreak and response activities ongoing in the area. I fear the consequences of an outbreak of COVID-19 in that zone.

Returning to the situation with COVID-19 in Kinshasa, 2 newly confirmed cases were reported there in the past 24 hours. No mention is made of transmission chains, if there are multiple importations, or established community-based local transmission.

[6] N95 filtering facepiece respirator decontamination

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19 has severely stressed the worldwide healthcare system and has created dangerous shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs). In an effort to extend the stockpile of N95 FFRs at our institution and reduce risks associated with reuse of untreated, contaminated N95 FFRs, we developed a surface decontamination procedure involving the delivery of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) to used N95 FFRs. The evidence base supporting this program includes: 1) UVGI has been shown to effectively inactivate a wide range of human pathogens including coronaviruses and other human respiratory viruses; 2) UVGI has been demonstrated to inactivate human respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses, on various models of N95 FFRs; 3) levels of UVGI needed to inactive human respiratory viruses are well below the level of irradiation that adversely affects the fit and filtration characteristics of N95 FFRs; and 4) UVGI can be safely administered when appropriate safeguards are in place. We also recognize there is uncertainty regarding how long an N95 FFR maintains properties to achieve adequate fit, requiring providers to inspect FFRs before and after reuse. Any organization considering a decontamination strategy (including UVGI, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, warm moist heat, etc.) to deal with lack of supply or potential lack of N95 FFR should validate their own procedures, including desired surrogate microbial reduction and retained filter efficiency and fit. Herein, we briefly describe our procedure to surface decontaminate and reuse N95 FFRs.

The number of US coronavirus infections climbed above 82 000 on Thursday [26 Mar 2020], surpassing the national tallies of China and Italy, as New York, New Orleans, and other hot spots faced a surge in hospitalizations and looming shortages of supplies, staff, and sick beds. With medical facilities running low on ventilators and protective masks and hampered by limited diagnostic testing capacity, the US death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, rose beyond 1200.

"Any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the healthcare system," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference. He described the state's projected shortfall in ventilators -- machines that support the respiration of people have cannot breathe on their own -- as "astronomical." "It's not like they have them sitting in the warehouse," Cuomo added. "There is no stockpile available." At least one New York City hospital, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan, has begun a trial of sharing single ventilators between 2 patients.

While New York was the coronavirus epicenter in the United States this week, the next big wave of infections appeared headed for Louisiana, where demand for ventilators has already doubled. In New Orleans, the state's biggest city, Mardi Gras celebrations late last month [February 2020] are believed to have fueled the outbreak. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would be out of ventilators by [2 Apr 2020] and potentially out of bed space by [7 Apr 2020] "if we don't flatten the infection curve soon. It's not conjecture, it's not some flimsy theory," Edwards told a press conference. "This is what is going to happen." About 80% of Louisiana's intensive care patients are now on breathing machines, up from the normal rate of 30-40%, said Warner Thomas, chief executive of Ochsner Health System, the state's hospital group.

Scarcities of protective masks, gloves, gowns, and eyewear for doctors and nurses -- reports abound of healthcare workers recycling old face masks, making their own, or even using trash bags to shield themselves -- have emerged as a national problem. "Our nurses across the country do not have the personal protective equipment that is necessary to care for COVID-19 patients or any of their patients," Bonnie Castillo, head of the largest US nurses union, National Nurses United, told MSNBC.

In an ominous milestone for the United States as a whole, at least 82 153 people nationwide were infected as of Thursday [26 Mar 2020], according to a Reuters tally from state and local public health agencies. China, where the global pandemic emerged late last year [2019], had the 2nd highest number of cases, 81 285, followed by Italy with 80 539. At least 1204 Americans have died from COVID-19, which has proven especially dangerous to the elderly and people with underlying chronic health conditions, Reuters' tally showed.

More beds needed
----------------
For New York state, Cuomo said a key goal was rapidly to expand the number of available hospital beds from 53 000 to 140 000. New York hospitals were racing to comply with Cuomo's directive to increase capacity by at least 50%. At Mount Sinai Hospital's Upper East Side location, rooms were being constructed within an atrium to open up more space for beds. At Elmhurst Hospital in New York's borough of Queens, about 100 people, many wearing masks with their hoods pulled up, lined up behind barriers outside the emergency room entrance, waiting to enter a tent to be screened for the coronavirus.

The city coroner's office has posted refrigerated trucks outside Elmhurst and Bellevue Hospital to temporarily store bodies of the deceased.

Deborah White, vice chair of emergency medicine at Jack D Weiler Hospital in the city's Bronx borough, said 80% of its emergency room visits were patients with coronavirus-like symptoms. A ventilator shortfall and surge in hospitalizations has already raised the prospect of rationing healthcare. Asked about guidelines being drafted on how to allocate ventilators to patients in case of a shortage, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy told reporters such bioethical discussions "haunted him" but were unavoidable.

Outside New York and New Orleans, other hot spots appeared to be emerging around the country, including Detroit.

Record unemployment claims
--------------------------
Desperate to slow virus transmissions by limiting physical contact among people, state and local governments have issued stay-at-home orders covering about half the US population. A major side effect has been the strangulation of the economy, and a wave of layoffs. The US Labor Department reported Thursday [26 Mar 2020] the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week soared to a record of nearly 3.28 million -- almost 5 times the previous weekly peak of 695 000 during the 1982 recession.

Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said warmer weather may help tamp down the US outbreak as summer approaches, though the virus could re-emerge in the winter. "We hope we get a respite as we get into April, May, and June [2020]," Fauci said on WNYC public radio.

Washington State Governor Jay Inslee said he may extend a stay-at-home order tentatively set to expire [6 Apr 2020], encouraged by what he called a "very modest improvement" in the Seattle area. Washington experienced the 1st major US outbreak of COVID-19 and has been among the hardest-hit states. As of Thursday [26 Mar 2020], the state reported about 3200 cases and 147 deaths.

In California's Coachella Valley, a region rife with retirees who are especially vulnerable, 25 members of the state's National Guard helped a non-profit distribute food to people stuck in their homes, as most of the regular volunteers are senior citizens. More than 10 000 troops have been deployed in 50 states to provide humanitarian aid during the pandemic.

Highlights
----------
- Three new countries/territories/areas from the Region of the Americas [1], and African Region [2] have reported cases of COVID-19.

- The United Nations launched a USD 2 billion COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan to support the world's most vulnerable countries. More information can be found at https://www.unocha.org/story/un-issues-2-billion-appeal-combat-covid-19.

- The WHO Director-General mentioned many key issues and action steps to effectively combat COVID-19, as well as maintaining physical distance but not social distance. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---25-march-2020.

- WHO published the COVID-19: Operational guidance for maintaining essential health services during an outbreak (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/covid-19-operational-guidance-for-maintaining-essential-health-services-during-an-outbreak) and the Handbook for public health capacity-building at ground crossings and cross-border collaboration (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/handbook-for-public-health-capacity-building-at-ground-crossings-and-cross-border-collaboration) on [25 Mar 2020]. All guidance documents can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance.

- In light of additional evidence, WHO maintains the recommendation of performing hand hygiene and regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. The use of medical masks and respirators are for circumstances and settings where aerosol generating procedures are performed. Greater detail can be found in the 'subject in focus' section below.


Subject in focus: COVID-19 virus persistence: Implications for transmission and precaution recommendations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An experimental study, which evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2), has recently been published in the NEJM (1). In this experimental study, aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions. This is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human coughing or sneezing nor does it reflect aerosol generating procedures in clinical settings. Furthermore, the findings do not bring new evidence on airborne transmission as aerosolization with particles potentially containing the virus was already known as a possibility during procedures generating aerosols.

In all other contexts, available evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites (2-8). The virus can spread directly from person to person when a COVID-19 case coughs or exhales producing droplets that reach the nose, mouth, or eyes of another person. Alternatively, as the droplets are too heavy to be airborne, they land on objects and surfaces surrounding the person. Other people become infected with COVID-19 by touching these contaminated objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. According to the currently available evidence, transmission through smaller droplet nuclei (airborne transmission) that propagate through air at distances longer than 1 meter is limited to aerosol generating procedures during clinical care of COVID-19 patients.

As such, WHO continues to recommend that everyone performs hand hygiene frequently, follows respiratory etiquette recommendations and regularly clean and disinfect surfaces. WHO also continues to recommend the importance of maintaining physical distances and avoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms. These preventive measures will limit viral transmission.

Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, and in alignment with available evidence, WHO maintains the recommendation, in the context of droplet and contact precautions for the use of medical masks for regular care of COVID-19 patients and respirators (N95, FFP2 or FFP3) for circumstances and settings where aerosol generating procedures are performed.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 198. This includes 17 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 49 countries (including 14 territories) from the Americas region, and 41 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 14 878 new cases in the past 24 hours of which 78.3% were reported by the USA, and 11.2% reported by Canada. The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 29 771 (60.5%) new cases and 1964 (81.8%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 17.5 % of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 26.7% of newly confirmed cases, Germany accounting for 16.6% of newly confirmed cases, and France accounting for 9.7% of newly confirmed cases in Europe (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 70.5% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, up from 66.3% yesterday 25 Mar 2020).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [26 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. I keep repeating that it would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
