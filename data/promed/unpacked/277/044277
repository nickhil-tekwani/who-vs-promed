1st report of the A2 mating type of _Phytophthora infestans_ on
tomato crops in Taiwan, Republic of China
-----------------------------------------------
In a study of the _Phytophthora infestans_ population in Taiwan,
samples with symptoms typical of late blight were collected from
field crops in an important potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) and tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) production area in the central highlands region.

Isolates were obtained, and the pathogen was confirmed as _P.
infestans_ on the basis of morphological characters. Mating type was
determined by co-inoculating test isolates and a reference _P.
infestans_ isolate of either the A1 or A2 mating type and examination
for the presence of oospores where the colonies interacted. In 2004,
one isolate of 200 tested and in 2006, one isolate of 102 tested
produced oospores only with A1 reference isolates and were concluded
to be A2 mating type.

In vitro testing showed the 2 A2 isolates were metalaxyl-resistant,
which is typical of recent _P. infestans_ isolates from potato and
tomato in this area. 21 single-sporangial isolates from each were
confirmed as A2. These isolates were characterized and found to have
a multi-locus genotype characteristic of recent _P. infestans_
isolates from tomato and potato in Taiwan, but all previous such
isolates were A1 mating type. Koch's postulates were completed, and
the 2 A2 isolates were found to be highly aggressive on cultivars of
potato and tomato.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of A2 mating type strains of
_P. infestans_ in the field in Taiwan, but currently, their incidence
is very low (less than one percent). One crop from which an A2
isolate was obtained also yielded an A1 isolate, while A1 isolates
were obtained from crops in the vicinity of the other. The concurrent
presence of the 2 mating types of _P. infestans_ poses a risk of
sexual reproduction and oospore formation in tomato or potato in Taiwan.

[Late blight caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_ is a
devastating disease of potato and tomato with up to 100 percent crop
losses. To a lesser extent, it can also affect other solanaceous
crops such as eggplant and capsicum. The pathogen can affect leaves,
stems, and fruit of tomato, causing spots, lesions, and rotting, and
in potato it affects leaves as well as tubers. The disease can spread
rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. It is highly
infectious, and once it is found in a region, all susceptible crops
nearby are threatened. The disease is favoured by cool, moist
conditions, and under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes
seem to be even more rapid than in potatoes. Spread often occurs with
plant material (including tomato transplants or potato seed tubers),
by wind, water, or mechanical means. Disease management requires an
integrated approach and includes phytosanitary measures, removal of
weeds and volunteer crop plants serving as pathogen reservoirs,
limiting free moisture in the crop, preventative fungicide treatments
of planting material, and fungicide sprays of crops. Crop rotation
with non-hosts may reduce available inoculum.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide because new
and even more virulent strains continue to emerge. Some of these can
destroy a plant in a matter of hours and a complete crop within days.
Two mating types of the fungus exist, A1 and A2. Where both are
present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually, leading
to even fitter strains with higher fungicide resistances and
increased yield losses. A1 was the 1st to spread worldwide. A2 began
to spread later and is currently present in northern and Central
America, parts of Asia, as well as in northern Europe, where a
dramatic increase in the frequency of A2 is being recorded recently
in the western parts. The finding of the A2 type in Taiwan severely
increases the risk posed by late blight to national agriculture.
