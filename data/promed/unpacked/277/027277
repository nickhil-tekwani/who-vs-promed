Imported wild poliovirus causing poliomyelitis: Bulgaria, 2001
--------------------------------------------------------------
In March 2001, a 13 month old unvaccinated Roma (that is, gypsy) girl from
Bourgas, Bulgaria developed bilateral leg weakness. The National
Enterovirus Laboratory in the capital city of Sofia isolated a wild type 1
poliovirus from her stool. In April, a second case infected with wild type
1 poliovirus was found in Iambol, about 50 miles west of Bourgas. [This
case was an unvaccinated 26 month old Roma girl with paralysis of both
legs. Subsequent analyses indicated that these viruses were related closely
to a strain isolated from Uttar Pradesh, India, in July 2000. A 3 month old
Roma boy in Bourgas who developed paralysis on 7 May was diagnosed on
clinical and serological grounds.
Following the identification of the poliovirus, the Bulgarian Ministry of
Health implemented contact investigations, screening of children at high
risk, retrospective record review, intensified acute flaccid paralysis
(AFP) surveillance, and mass vaccinations. This report summarizes the
outbreak investigation and supplemental vaccination activities in response
to these polio cases. High [levels of routine vaccination coverage and AFP
surveillance are needed for rapid detection and prevention of the spread of
poliovirus importations in areas and countries where polio is not endemic.
From 1998 to 2000, AFP surveillance in Bulgaria had detected 0.9 non-polio
cases per 100 000 people aged <15 years per year (adequate surveillance is
indicated by a non-polio AFP case detection of >1/100 000 people aged <15
years). In addition, 79 per cent of AFP cases were investigated with
adequate stool specimens* (adequate performance is indicated by an adequate
specimen collection rate of at least 80 per cent). From Jan to Mar 2001, 2
AFP cases were detected in Bulgaria.
After identification of case 1, the number of AFP cases identified
increased rapidly. As of 1 Nov 2001, a total of 33 cases had been
identified, including 30 non-polio cases, corresponding to a non-polio AFP
detection rate of 2.6/100 000 people aged <15 years. Ninety-four per cent
of cases had adequate specimens.
From April to May 2001, serosurveys were conducted among high-risk
children (children from minority communities or residing close to areas
with large minority populations) aged 0 to 83 months. Twelve out of 26 Roma
children [admitted to hospital in Bourgas lacked detectable antibodies.
High-risk children from Sofia were more likely to lack antibodies to all 3
types of polioviruses (9 of 12 children) than children from Dobrich,
Pazardjik, and Plovdiv (6 of 33 children). Stool specimens also were
obtained from children at high risk for exposure. Wild type 1 poliovirus
was found in an 11 month old girl in Karnobat whose sister had shared the
hospital ward with case 1, and in a 15 month old girl in Sofia. These
children had no symptoms compatible with polio.
To control the outbreak, a mass vaccination campaign of high-risk children
began on 19 Apr 2001 in the area of residence of case 1 and was expanded to
the entire Bourgas district and the 3 neighboring districts of Iambol,
Sliven, and Stara Zagora on 27 Apr 2001. A national vaccination campaign
composed of 2 rounds was conducted on 28 May to 1 Jun and 25 to 29 Jun,
aiming to vaccinate all 468 720 children aged 0 to 6 years .
Administrative coverage estimates suggested that 94 per cent of all
children in the country were vaccinated in the first round and 95 per cent
in the second. Because the initial contact investigations revealed that up
to half of the children from high-risk groups were not vaccinated fully by
the routine program, one additional round of mass vaccination was conducted
during October for high-risk children aged 0 to 4 years; another round is
scheduled for November 2001.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This report describes the transmission for several months of a wild
poliovirus imported into a country that had been free of polio for about 10
years. This outbreak of polio occurred because poliovirus was introduced
into population subgroups with low immunity. The last indigenous wild
poliovirus in the 51-country European Region (EUR) of the World Health
Organization (WHO) occurred in November 1998 in Turkey (1). The last
outbreak of polio in Bulgaria occurred in 1991 and involved 46 confirmed
cases from the Roma community (2).
Suboptimal immunity in the Roma population contributed to the 1991 and 2001
outbreaks. Population subgroups with lower vaccination coverage can sustain
the circulation of wild polioviruses for several years within a country
(3-5). High-risk communities are present in all European countries. As
polio is eliminated, areas or population groups with lower immunity remain
vulnerable to importation of wild poliovirus and subsequent transmission (6,7).
When wild poliovirus type 1 was confirmed in this outbreak, WHO immediately
informed authorities in all EUR member states and asked them to enhance AFP
surveillance and rapidly enhance vaccination coverage in hard-to-reach
minority population subgroups. WHO conducted training and consultation to
improve surveillance and vaccination in several countries neighboring Bulgaria.
Bulgarian authorities promptly implemented National Immunization Days
within 64 days of case 1 developing paralysis. High coverage reported for
the campaign countrywide, improved performance of AFP surveillance, and the
absence of wild polioviruses in subsequent stool surveys of high-risk
children suggest that circulation of the wild virus has been interrupted.
The investigations and interventions by the Bulgarian Ministry of Health
exemplify an effective response to possible importation of poliovirus that
is particularly useful as EUR prepares to certify eradication of polio.
Until polio is eradicated, the risk for importation will persist in
countries and areas free of polio.

Notes
* Refers to 2 stool specimens collected at least 24 hours apart within 14
days of onset of paralysis and shipped adequately to the laboratory.
 Vaccination coverage determined by the administrative method (in which
the doses administered is the numerator and the estimated number of
children to be vaccinated is the denominator) is often higher than coverage
determined through surveys because of overestimates in the number of doses
of vaccine administered and underestimates of the size of the population
that should receive vaccination.
§ Mass campaigns over a period of days to weeks in which 2 doses of oral
poliovirus vaccine are administered to all children usually aged <5 years
regardless of previous vaccination history with an interval of 4 to 6 weeks
between doses.
