Teams deployed to stem myiasis outbreak in north east
-----------------------------------------------------
The General Department for Animal Health and Veterinary Quarantine (GDAHVQ)
in Yemen's Ministry of Agriculture has deployed 21 field teams in the north
east to combat a new outbreak of myiasis, an infestation of human or animal
tissue with fly larvae (maggots).

The disease first appeared in Saada Governorate near the border with Saudi
Arabia in December 2007. It then spread to the governorates of Hajjah,
al-Hudeidah, and al-Mahwit, putting livestock at risk. Last summer [2008]
the disease disappeared as a result of high temperatures in these areas.
Mansour al-Qadasi, director-general of the GDAHVQ, said the screwworm fly,
which causes myiasis, thrives in mild conditions with a specific level of
humidity, preferring areas with plants.

"Myiasis has spread to the western region of Tehama, where the temperature
gets up to over 40 deg C (104 deg F) in summer. Because of the high
temperature, last summer [2008] the screwworm moved into the versants of
al-Mahwit's mountains, where the weather was temperate," he told IRIN,
adding that pesticide use in the area had played a role in combating the
infestation.

Over the past 2 months, however, screwworm flies have spread from al-Mahwit
and are now moving west into al-Hudeidah Governorate and north into Hajjah
Governorate, he said. "We are trying to confine the screwworms to this
triangle-like area despite our limited resources. If the disease increases
rapidly, regional cooperation will be needed."

Myiasis has spread to 5 out of 9 districts in al-Mahwit Governorate --
Hufash, al-Mahwit, Melhan, Bani Saad, and al-Khabt. So far the disease has
affected some 4000 animals and killed another 1756 in those districts,
according to Mohammed al-Sirmi, head of the Agriculture Office in al-Mahwit
Governorate. ["Animals" is somewhat vague; which species?! - Mod.AS]

"In al-Mahwit, livestock is the main source of income for a lot of
villagers. The disease has affected their lives: we have found miserable
cases of people who have lost the livestock on which they depended for a
livelihood," al-Sirmi told IRIN.

Yemen has an estimated 15 million sheep, 1.4 million cattle and 250 000
camels, according to GDAHVQ. Raising awareness among villagers was
necessary to combat the disease: "Combating the disease locally is best,
since maggot flies can spread rapidly. When a field team finishes fighting
myiasis in one area, it can be surprised by its appearance in another
area," al-Sirmi said. "Field teams are also carrying out awareness
campaigns to help teach villagers fight the disease. People can fight the
disease. They can cover animals' wounds and remove the eggs from them."

According to al-Qadasi, Yemen recently received assistance from
international organisations to combat myiasis. The UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) purchased medicines for combating myiasis at a cost of
USD 42 000; the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) donated
diagnostic equipment at a cost of USD 50 000. The Arab Organisation for
Agriculture Development (AOAD) provided Yemen with microscopes and training
for field workers.
