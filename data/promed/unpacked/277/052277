Foot & Mouth disease [FMD] in Gazit - Message No 1
----------------------------------------------------
1. On [Wed 4 Apr 2018], suspected cases of FMD were reported from the beef-cattle herd of Kibbutz Gazit. Samples were transferred to the Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI] at Beit-Dagan and today, [Thu 5 Apr 2018], FMD has been confirmed by PCR tests.

2. A 10-km [6.21 mi approx.] radius containment zone has been established around the outbreak's location and put under the relevant official restrictions; the names of the localities which include animal establishments, within the Zone, have been published.

3. Vaccinations:
a. All cattle in the containment zone which had been last vaccinated longer than 6 months ago, are to be immediately revaccinated.
b. Cattle of the ages 2-18 months, which had last been vaccinated longer than a month ago, will be revaccinated.
c. Small ruminants in the containment zone which had been last vaccinated longer than 6 months ago, are to be immediately revaccinated.
d. Small ruminants of the ages 2-18 months, which had last been vaccinated longer than a month ago, will be revaccinated.

[The circular further includes the specified restrictions applied in relation to animal movements for breeding and slaughter, transportation of milk, feed, the requirements re treatment of manure, etc within the containment zone, involving cattle, small ruminants (sheep & goats) and pigs.
It further includes detailed requirements to be applied on the affected herd/premises, including disinfection modes and animal destruction/burial techniques].

[According to available information, no pig farms are present in this part of Israel. However, wild boar are to be found in the area, with dense populations in the Jordan valley which is about 10 km [6.21 mi approx.] to the east of Gazit (see map at https://tinyurl.com/y737bqkp). The outbreak is about 15 km [9.32 mi approx.] from the demarcation line between Israel and the territory of the Palestinian Authority (PA).

In difference with dairy cattle, kept in Israel in a "zero-grazing" system, beef cattle is allowed to graze, kept outdoors, potentially exposed to other beef cattle herds, pasturing small ruminants and wildlife, including wild boars.

Earlier this year [2018] and in late 2017, FMDV serotype O, topotype EA-3, was identified in samples from the West Bank in the PA; see its genotyping results at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2018/WRLFMD-2018-00004-Palestinian-AT-O-approved.pdf. A similar strain was identified in southern Israel in April 2017. Another strain identified in Israel in 2017 (on the Lebanese border) was of serotype: A (topotype ASIA, lineage G-VII).

Serotyping and genotyping of the FMDV strain involved in the current event are anticipated with interest; the results should assist in providing some information on the matching rate of the applied vaccines to the circulating strain.

It will be also useful to obtain information on the vaccination status of the affected herd and about FMDV valencies included in the vaccines applied in cattle and in small ruminants.
