[The following has been extracted from the OIE Technical "Questions and answers" factsheet "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals" (last updated 22 Jan 2021) https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-offer/planning-for-emergencies/covid-19/

"Several animal species have demonstrated susceptibility to the virus through experimental infection, and in natural settings when in contact with infected humans. There is also evidence that infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural settings through contact, such as mink to mink transmission, and mink to cat transmission. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for animal and human health, animal welfare, wildlife conservation, and biomedical research. However, not all species appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To date, findings from experimental infection studies show that poultry and cattle are not susceptible to infection. Up to date information on the susceptibility of different animal species can be found at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/03/en-factsheet-sars-cov-2.pdf.

"As a general good practice, appropriate and effective biosecurity measures should always be applied when people have contact with groups of animals, e.g., on farms, at zoos, and in animal shelters.

"People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus should minimize close direct contact with animals, including farm, zoo or other captive animals, and wildlife". - Mod.CRD
