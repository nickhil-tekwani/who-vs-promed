The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [13 Aug 2015] a confirmed case of tularemia in a 71-year-old man from Bernalillo County. The case was confirmed at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division. 2 earlier cases of tularemia were reported in a 39-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman from Bernalillo County. They have also recovered. The Department suspects the 3 individuals in Bernalillo County contracted tularemia through deer fly bites.

Another 3 cases in the state occurred in a 35-year-old woman from Sandoval County, a 59-year-old woman from San Juan County who was bitten by her infected cat, and a 51-year-old man from Los Alamos County. These individuals were hospitalized but have recovered. There have also been 43 cases of tularemia in 2015 in dogs and cats, with pets from Bernalillo, Los Alamos, Santa Fe, Taos, and Torrance counties.

"Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets so I would encourage people around the state to follow precautions similar to reducing risk to plague," said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. "People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals such as rabbits or rodents or are bitten by infected ticks or deer flies."

Tularemia is a potentially serious illness in people that occurs in many parts of the USA. It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits, and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick and they can give the disease to people. Other possible, but much less likely, exposures are through contact with infected soil or water or by inhaling the bacterium.

Symptoms of tularemia in people usually develop 3 to 5 days after exposure but onset can vary from one to 14 days. Tularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscles aches, and joint pain. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.

"The rabbit population has increased dramatically in many areas of the state this summer [2015] due to abundant rainfall and vegetation, and a lot of them have been getting sick and dying from tularemia," said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. "This has led to an increase in both human and pet cases of tularemia with various types of exposures, including bites from infected insects, bites from infected cats, handling of infected rabbit carcasses, etc."

"The City of Albuquerque maintains a surveillance program for tularemia in wild animals," said Dr Paul Smith, Manager of the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department Urban Biology Division. "We encourage people to report dead animals that have not died from obvious trauma by calling 311 so that we can collect them for testing."

In 2014 there were 5 human cases of tularemia in New Mexico, a 65-year-old woman from Bernalillo County, a 78-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman both from San Juan County, a 66-year-old man from Lincoln County, and a 69-year-old woman from Sandoval County. All 5 individuals were hospitalized and recovered.

Tularemia, plague, West Nile virus, rabies, vesicular stomatitis -- Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory [WSVL] experts are cautioning residents to monitor not only their pets and livestock, but also themselves this summer [2015]. Several cases of tularemia in wildlife and domestic animals have been diagnosed by the WSVL, including in Albany, Platte, and Washakie counties, said Will Laegreid, WSVL director. "There have been a number of human tularemia cases in Colorado this summer [2015] and (Wyoming), and we would like to prevent any more cases in Wyoming if possible," Laegreid said.

The Wyoming Department of Health Public Information Officer Kim Deti said that there have been 8 human cases to date in Wyoming -- 4 in Weston County, and 1 each in Big Horn, Natrona, Converse, and Goshen. She said some of the people have had to be hospitalized.

Wyoming Department of Health state epidemiologist, Dr Tracy Murphy said in a 17 Jul 2015 news release, "Recently, we are hearing about rabbit die-offs, in dead voles near Devils Tower in Crook County and in a Washakie County cat," said. "Tularemia is always a concern but is not common. To see this activity is concerning."

Laegreid said his office has not received any other confirmed cases in Washakie County, regarding domestic and wild animals. "Historically it's been around but there have been none in the past 5 years," Mandy Thoet, veterinarian at Cloud Peak Veterinary Services in Worland, said. "It is zoonotic (can pass to humans), that's why there is a concern," she said.

Echo Study of Tharp Veterinary Clinic in Worland said the cat that tested positive was treated at the clinic and was from Ten Sleep. She said the owners had notice a lot of rabbits dying off in the area. "People need to be aware and to protect themselves, they need to protect their pets," Study said.

To date, 2 human cases of tularemia or "rabbit fever" have been confirmed in Coconino County. They are the 1st confirmed cases in the county since 2005. The 2 individuals were likely exposed from insect bites sometime in July [2015], according to officials with the Coconino County Public Health Services District. The 2 people were not related and it was not the same incident, said Trish Lees, spokeswoman with the district. 1 of the people was in northern region of the county when the bite occurred and the other was in the southern region, Lees said.

"There is no link (between the incidents) that we can verify," she said. She said she cannot release information about what symptoms people experienced or what they may have been doing when they were bitten. Both sought medical attention and were prescribed antimicrobials, she said.

The disease does not spread from person to person.

To see a map of the number of cases of human tularemia in the USA 2004-2013, go to http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/map.html. The states with the most cases are those in the central area of the country centered around Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.

The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria (abnormally frequent urination) may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

People may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antimicrobials. - Mod.LL]
