[BTV-4 has spread in Portugal northward, reaching as far north as Canha (map at <tinyurl.com/2wwtyesr>; latitude 38.77). With temperatures decreasing, the vector season is expected to end soon.

The most recent (22 Sep 2021) presentation of the Portuguese veterinary authorities to EC's PAFF (Plants, Animals, Food and Feed) committee, including control, vaccination and surveillance data, is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2021-10/reg-com_ahw_20210922_bt_prt.pdf.

Most BTV serotypes are known to cause a serious clinical disease in susceptible sheep breeds, while cattle and goats, though undergoing viraemia, remain, in most cases -- save serotype 8, in cattle -- subclinical. BTV-4 is known for its high pathogenicity in sheep; in susceptible breeds (e.g., Sarda dairy sheep), very high case-fatality rates in unvaccinated animals have been seen, in some events exceeding 50%. The differential species susceptibility has been apparent also during the 3 outbreaks in Portugal reported above; only sheep were affected in mixed holdings.

The BTV-8 epizootic, which caused serious losses in Europe's cattle during the years 2006-2008 (recurring, in a lesser magnitude/spread, in 2016), was followed by the introduction of strict EC control policy, including regionalisation and movement restrictions for unvaccinated animals. These measures may raise concerns by cattle breeders when other BTV serotypes are in play, as no clinical cases in cattle are seen. An example of such a conflict is presented in a recent media report, addressing economical aspects of EC-prescribed BT-control policy in Extremadura, Spain, where the cattle farming organizations asked the Ministry of Agriculture to declare Extremadura free of bluetongue until the arrival of spring, as they explain, to alleviate the situation of farmers (for the full report, in Spanish, please go to https://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/extremadura/2021/12/10/ahora-lengua-azul-perdidas-60475130.html; use machine translation.
