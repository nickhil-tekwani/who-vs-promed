Measles - Democratic Republic of the Congo: Background
------------------------------------------------------
The latest outbreak of measles in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (see: Measles - Democratic Republic of the Congo (Katanga)
20070601.1775) highlights the fact that measles rates in this area
have changed little during the past 2 decades.
The relevant data extracted from the Gideon database can be viewed in
graphic form via the following link:

There is little doubt that such outbreaks are related to continued
suboptimal and erratic vaccination coverage.
