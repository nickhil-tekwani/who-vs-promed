China's Health Ministry issues emergency announcement
on poliomyelitis virus discovered in Qinghai
------------------------------------------------------------
According to a Health Journal report, China's Health
Ministry issued an emergency announcement nationwide, on a case triggered by
poliomyelitis virus in Qinghai Province. The Ministry has instructed
local authorities to pull together comprehensive anti-epidemic action plans.
Not long ago in Qinghai, a 16-month old infant boy, who had not
received any vaccine, was reported of having acute poliomyelitis in one
of his limbs. The doctor diagnosed this as a
poliomyelitis-suspected case. The Immunology Department of the Health
Ministry of Qinghai Province isolated poliomyelitis virus from the
fecal sample of the infant. Based on the result of the test, the
department confirmed that poliomyelitis virus type 1 was the cause of the
case. Initially, it was believed that the virus came from external sources
[was imported].
The Health Ministry has dispatched millions of doses of vaccine to the area
concerned.
According to to expert analysis, the imported virus which has caused the
case in Qinghai Province may have spread considerably far. The low
temperature right now does not favour the spread of the intestine-based
poliomyelitis virus, hence, it is the best time to step up immunization.

[Poliomyelitis was thought to have been eradicated from China. Qinghai
(Tsinghai) Province is in west central China, well off the tourist track, so
at the moment there is no threat to international travel - Mod.JW]
