The elementary school in the central Illinois community of Ashmore was closed after half its 100 students failed to show up. Community Unit School District No. 1 Superintendent Jim Littleford said Wednesday [26 Sep 2012] that in addition to 51 students, 5 of the school's staff also reported [having] a flu-like illness.

Littleford said the Coles County Health Department suggested a thorough cleaning of the school Wednesday [26 Sep 2012], which will allow it to reopen Thursday [27 Sep 2012]. Littleford said officials are urging sick students to see physicians. Parents were urged to inform school officials of test results because it could help with an investigation into the cause of the illness.

He said there had been no reports of the illness earlier in the week and none of the district's other schools had more than a few students out.

[A synchronous outbreak of respiratory illness affecting half the pupils and some staff attending a single school is an unusual event and more typical of an outbreak of sudden-onset gastroenteritis (often designated 'stomach flu') caused by norovirus infection. The 24-hour 'thorough cleaning' response of the County Health Department might be effective in containing such an outbreak, but not appropriate in the case of respiratory virus infection. Further information is awaited.
