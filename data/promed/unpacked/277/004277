China rules out bird flu on deaths of 178 geese
-----------------------------------------------
China on Monday [9 May 2005] ruled out bird flu as responsible for the
deaths of 178 spot-headed geese in a nature reserve, but was unable to say
what had killed them. Local officials and state media said the geese had
been dying since 6 May 2005 at the Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve in the north
west province of Qinghai.
"I can confirm these birds have died, but it is not bird flu," said an
official, who refused to be named, at the Qinghai provincial administration
for wild animals and plants. "They died of disease, but we don't know what
it is. We are still investigating; there are no results yet, but no bird
flu virus has been found," he told Agence France Presse.
Xinhua news agency said local animal and bird experts were still probing
the cause of death and had temporarily shut down the viewing platform on
the birds' islet in the nature reserve. The H5N1 strain of bird flu has
been discovered in 8 countries since late 2003, including China, Viet Nam,
Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, and South Korea.
Tens of millions of chickens have been culled as a result, while 36
Vietnamese, 12 Thais and one Cambodian have died.
