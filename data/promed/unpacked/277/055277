[Of 425] persons interviewed, 312 (73.4 per cent) reported that they had had at least one of the 3 defining symptoms since the rains of 14-15 Feb 2012. Among those 312 persons, 173 (55.4 per cent) took leave from school or work. One death during that period was identified retrospectively in a woman aged 33 years with no known underlying disease. The woman had fever and intense joint pain, developed neurologic signs, and died within 2 hours of hospital admission. No samples were available for testing. Her 2 children were symptomatic, CHIKV IgM-positive, and seronegative for dengue and JEV.

MAC-ELISA tests identified CHIKV IgM in 188 (44.2 per cent) of the 425 persons. Of the 6 febrile persons, venous blood samples could be analyzed from 4: 2 had positive PCR results for CHIKV, bringing the total that were laboratory confirmed to 190 (44.7 per cent) CHIKV-positives. One person with fever and joint pains was positive for DENV-4. PCR results found traces of _Plasmodium_ spp. nucleic acid indicative of incubating or recent malaria in one afebrile person. Of the 190 CHIKV-positive persons identified, 10 (5.3 per cent) reported having none of the 3 defining symptoms.

The onset of the epidemic was protracted. Among 140 persons with self-reported fever who recalled an onset date and who had positive results for CHIKV (IgM or PCR), most reported onset occurring approximately 3-5 weeks after a 2-day period of rain. The epidemic curve suggested that the CHIKV outbreak began 3 weeks after the rains, lasted about 3 weeks, and was on the verge of ending when this serosurvey was conducted on 26 Mar 2012.

Laboratory results were analyzed by age group. The analysis revealed a 40 per cent IgM seroprevalence among persons aged 5 years and under; for persons aged 6-45 years, IgM seroprevalence was approximately 50 per cent, declining sharply for each age group after that. Circulation of at least 2 other viruses was identified, including 11 cases of DENV, 7 cases of JEV, and 15 cases of undistinguishable flaviviruses (among these, 10, 4, and 8 cases, respectively, occurred among CHIKV-positive cases).

MMWR Editorial Note:
The serosurvey in Trapeang Roka on 26 Mar 2012 documented a CHIKV outbreak in a medium-size rural Cambodian community of 695 residents. It is the 1st CHIKV serosurvey in Cambodia since the initial isolation of CHIKV in 1961 and the 1st known serosurvey conducted during a chikungunya outbreak in Southeast Asia. The experience of at least one symptom since the rains arrived was reported by 73.4 per cent of interviewees. CHIKV prevalence was 44.7 per cent, and the prevalence of asymptomatic CHIKV infection was 5.3 per cent. A temporal association was noted between an unusually large rainfall on 13-14 Feb [2012] and the subsequent outbreak of cases of CHIKV beginning 3 weeks later and lasting for 3 weeks.

Most persons who were CHIKV-positive cases had clinical signs and symptoms consistent with chikungunya. The level of seroprevalence in this outbreak is consistent with levels from CHIKV serosurveys conducted during outbreaks on Reunion Island (35 per cent) and Mayotte (38-45 per cent), but lower than that of Lamu Island, Kenya (75 per cent). Seroprevalence was lower in persons aged 45 years or older. This might be the result of immunity acquired when the CHIKV Asian strain circulated in Cambodia in the 1960s. The only other published CHIKV serologic study from the Mekong region was conducted in the Bangkok area in 1998-1999, before the emergence of the East/Central/South African genotype. In that study, the prevalence in mothers (using cord blood) was 31.6 percent and 45 percent in women aged over 35 years. This new genotype, which emerged in Africa in 2004 and is emerging in Cambodia, is well known to have an E226V mutation that is more efficiently transmitted by _Ae. albopictus_.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, co-circulating arboviruses (i.e., dengue and JEV) share the same vector and cause similar symptoms. Some symptoms might have been caused by dengue or JEV infection. Some of the clinical cases, therefore, could have been caused by undetected viruses other than CHIKV, and this could explain why clinical cases outnumbered laboratory-confirmed cases. Second, CHIKV IgM seroprevalence might have been underestimated because of suboptimal sensitivity of tests performed on dried blood spots. Third, IgM screening might miss infection still in the incubation period. Finally, the presence of a large team of medical investigators in a rural village might have stimulated over-reporting of symptoms. These also might account for the difference between the clinical attack rate and CHIKV IgM-positive prevalence (approximately 30 per cent).

[There was an earlier chikungunya epidemic reported in Cambodia this year (2012), but the locations of cases in the country were not specified (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120519.1138336). The above report is an interesting account of chikungunya virus infections in a small Cambodian village and is the 1st of its kind in the country. There is no danger of serological cross reactions with dengue or Japanese encephalitis virus antigens confusing the results, since CHIKV is an alphavirus and dengue and JEV are flaviviruses. - Mod.TY
