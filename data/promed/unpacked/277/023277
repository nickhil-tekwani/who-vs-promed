As informed by Rospotrebnadzor, from 30 Dec 2008 to 13 Jan 2009 in the
Petuhovsky district of the Kurgan region, 21 cases of psittacosis were
reported. All the cases are hospitalized, but none is in a serious condition.

Accoding to the investigation, the source of the outbreak is parrots and
canaries, from a large illegal group of these birds captured from smugglers
at a check point on the Russian - Kazakhstan border. Earlier, in
November-December 2008, 15 cases of the infection were recorded in the
Akbulaksky district of the Orenburg region. These cases are also connected
with parrots and canaries, which were confiscated from smugglers (more than
1500 birds) that had been detained trying to be brought into Russia from
the Republic of Kazakhstan.

In this connection, Rospotrebnadzor has disposed to strengthen the sanitary
control at check points on border, paying special attention to decorative
birds from Kazakhstan. It was also recommended to organize spot checks in
shops, trying to prevent the nonauthorized trade of decorative birds.

[According to another source
(<http://www.izvestia.ru/wellness/article3124355/>), dated 15 Jan 2009, a
group of illicit birds which were being attempted to be brought into Russia
from Kazakhstan had been detained by frontier guards in Petuhovsky district
in the middle of December 2008. Some of the birds had already died. The
smugglers were arrested and the cages have transferred to a veterinary
station where dead birds were burnt but a fictitious certificate was made,
implying that all the birds had been destroyed.

The live birds were either stolen with the purpose of resale or
veterinarians gave them to their friends or family. 21 persons with
exposure to these birds are now ill with pneumonia including 2 pregnant
women. - Mod.NP

_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but
most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine
birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however,
including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease
caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated
with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may
affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants.
Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the
bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of
the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been
screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if
untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the
infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of
infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn.
Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for
individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with
birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such
as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store
workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Both of the areas border with Kazakhstan, as can be seen at
