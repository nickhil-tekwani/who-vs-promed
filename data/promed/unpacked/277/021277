_Salmonella_ Outbreaks Linked to Backyard Poultry
-------------------------------------------------

Fast facts
Illnesses: 474 (311 new)
Hospitalizations: 103 (69 new)
Deaths: 1 (1 new)
States: 46 (3 new)
Investigation status: Active

Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that contact with backyard poultry is making people sick. Since the last update on 20 May 2021, one additional serotype (_Salmonella_ Mbandaka) and 311 more illnesses have been added to this outbreak investigation.

Epidemiologic data
As of 17 Jun 2021, a total of 474 people infected with one of the outbreak strains have been reported from 46 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 15 Dec 2020 to 4 Jun 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/epi.html).

Age information was available for 471 people. Their ages range from less than 1 to 97 years, with a median age of 31 years, and 139 (30%) are young children under 5 years. Of 466 people with sex information available, 269 (58%) are female. Of 334 people with information available, 103 (31%) have been hospitalized. One death has been reported from Indiana.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported, as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with the week before they got sick. Of the 271 people interviewed, 209 (77%) reported contact with backyard poultry before getting sick.

Laboratory data
On 7 May 2021, local public health officials in California collected samples from a sick person's duck environment for testing. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the _Salmonella_ Hadar found on the ground and in the duck's poop and sleeping area match the outbreak strain.

On 1 Jun 2021, public health officials in Arizona collected samples from a sick person's chickens and the chicken environment for testing. WGS showed that the _Salmonella_ Hadar found on chickens, their roost, and a water source match the outbreak strain.

WGS was also used to identify any predicted antimicrobial resistance for bacteria from 382 sick people's samples, 1 animal sample, and 9 environmental samples. Of the 392 samples, 159 (41%) were predicted to be resistant to one or more of the following antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1.0%), ampicillin (1.3%), chloramphenicol (0.5%), cefoxitin (1.0%), ceftriaxone (1.0%), ciprofloxacin (0.3%), streptomycin (38.5%), sulfamethoxazole (2.3%), tetracycline (37.2%), gentamicin (1.5%), and kanamycin (0.5%). CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently conducting standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if therapy is needed, some illnesses in this outbreak may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended medication and may require a different antimicrobial choice.

[Having a flock of backyard fowl can serve a number of purposes, including home-raised meat, fresh eggs, and companionship, but care must be taken to avoid the zoonosis salmonellosis.

The following recommendations are from the CDC: What Backyard Flock Owners Should Do (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/index.html):

"Wash your hands
- Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after touching backyard poultry, their eggs, or anything in the area where they live and roam.
- Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Consider having hand sanitizer at your coop.

"Be safe around backyard flocks
- Don't kiss or snuggle backyard poultry, and don't eat or drink around them. This can spread _Salmonella_ germs to your mouth and make you sick.
- Keep your backyard flock and supplies you use to care for them (like feed containers and shoes you wear in the coop) outside of the house. You should also clean the supplies outside the house.

"Supervise kids around flocks
- Always supervise children around backyard poultry and make sure they wash their hands properly afterward.
- Don't let children younger than 5 years touch chicks, ducklings, or other backyard poultry. Young children are more likely to get sick from germs like _Salmonella_.

"Handle eggs safely
- Collect eggs often. Eggs that sit in the nest can become dirty or break.
- Throw away cracked eggs. Germs on the shell can more easily enter the egg through a cracked shell.
- Rub off dirt on eggs with fine sandpaper, a brush, or a cloth. Don't wash them because colder water can pull germs into the egg.
- Refrigerate eggs to keep them fresh and slow the growth of germs.
- Cook eggs until both the yolk and white are firm, and cook egg dishes to an internal temperature of 160 deg F to kill all germs." - Mod.LL
