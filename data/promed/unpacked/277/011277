Now that the West Nile Virus (WNV) season is coming back, I was
wondering what the governmental policies in Canada and the US were
going to be regarding surveillance of WNV in non-equine mammals. The
fact the virus was found in other mammals, from bats to rodents to
mustelids [fur-bearing carnivores including the weasels, skunks, and
badgers suggests its host spectrum is fairly wide, and perhaps
surveillance should extend to other domestic species.
As a veterinary pathologist, I saw a couple of cases of viral
encephalitis of uncertain etiology in pet dogs last summer (in
Quebec), but the Canadian authorities did not show much interest in
having them tested for WNV. What is the current US policy regarding
non-equine domestic mammals?

This foresees surveillance of horses, birds & mosquitoes, but not
other domestic animals or wildlife, but does recommend research into
the natural host range of the virus. - Mod.JW
