Since 11 Jun 2020, a total of 29 plague cases have been reported in the Ituri endemic focus of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Djugu territory.

On 17 Jun 2020, 10 cases were reported, including 4 deaths (CFR = 0.4), from 4 villages. As of 26 Jun 2020, the number of cases has risen to 29 (17 female, 12 male) with 6 deaths (CFR = 0.2), and patients are now reported from 10 villages in 5 health areas (Kpandroma 2 cases, Lokpa 23, Ngri Balo 1, Rassia 2 and Uketha 1) located within the Rethy Health zone.

The investigation team composed of the chief medical doctor of the Rethy Health zone, the nurses from the Rethy General Reference Hospital and the Center for Neglected Tropical Diseases (Rethy HGR-CRMT), sanitation officers, and community relay have been pursuing contact tracing, ensuring dignified and safe burials, and taking care of chemoprophylaxis distribution.

However, because of the presence of militia in the region, the insecurity has increased, limiting movements and preventing support response teams access to the outbreak site, consequently affecting drug provision. Added to this crisis situation, the COVID-19 pandemic's stigma and the lack of resources locally have slowed down and impaired a swift response. This situation is to be monitored as the bubonic cases emerge in several localities, and the report of multiple rat die-offs suggests that the situation may worsen and -- if not treated promptly -- may evolve into a pneumonic plague outbreak.

[ProMED thanks the contributors for this follow-up post of a new outbreak of plague in the endemic area of Congo DR.

The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may produce bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.

CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis include tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.LL
