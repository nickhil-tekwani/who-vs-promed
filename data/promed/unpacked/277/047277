A Health and Welfare Ministry research team recently reported that an
outbreak of Q fever, a rare disease contracted from animals that causes
pneumonia and hepatic disorder, is spreading in the country, a ministry
source said Thursday. This is the first time a widespread outbreak of Q
fever has been reported in the nation, and a large number of hospitals lack
sufficient knowledge of how to treat the disease, the researchers said.
The Japanese Respiratory Society said it would establish guidelines to
effectively diagnose and treat the illness as soon as possible.
The disease is caused by a pathogen called _Coxiella burnetii_, which is
found in pets and livestock and can affect both humans and animals.
A mass outbreak of the disease was reported in Australia in 1935. The
illness was named Q fever after the word "query," as scientists at the time
could not identify its cause. There has been little research on the
disease, as there has only been one case of Q fever in the country, which
was reported in 1988.
The report was submitted following the conclusion of a two-year research
project studying sputum and blood samples from 237 patients at 18 hospitals
in Miyagi Prefecture who suffered from pneumonia and bronchitis caused by
unknown factors.
The bacterium that causes the fever was discovered in 8 patients, or 3.4%
of the group. Half of the patients said they had contact with animals
before noticing the symptoms, the researchers said.
Symptoms of Q fever that resemble those of acute hepatitis have been
reported overseas. According to the researchers, 2 of the patients who
participated in the project had suffered from liver problems. Both
patients received conventional treatment and recovered, but a small number
of deaths caused by myocarditis and renal insufficiency have been recorded
overseas.
Once a person is infected, there is a less than 10% chance that the
pathogen will remain inside the body, a condition that could cause chronic
symptoms leading to serious illnesses such as endocarditis. Patients must
be treated with tetracycline-type antibiotics, as penicillin-type
antibiotics, which are used to treat pneumonia, are ineffective against the
disease.
There is concern that Q fever symptoms could be mistaken for those of
influenza, which would lead to an incorrect diagnosis and allow the disease
to advance. Early and correct diagnosis enables patients to receive
effective treatment. The Japanese Respiratory Society is therefore being
urged to include guidelines detailing diagnosis and treatment procedures
for Q fever in its manual for treating pneumonia.
"We now know that Q fever has begun to spread in Japan and not just
overseas," said Tohoku University Assistant Prof. Akira Watanabe, who leads
the ministry's research team. "The disease is difficult to cure after
prolonged periods. That is why we must inform all hospitals of the correct
testing methods and criteria to diagnose (Q fever)."
Higher levels of _Coxiella burnetii_ are found in the placentas of most
mammals, as well as in birds.
In most cases, humans are infected by breathing in the pathogen, which is
released into the air from amniotic fluid and placentas of livestock and
pets during labor. Animal excrement is also contagious, but Q fever is
rarely transmitted between humans. Symptoms may be acute and include
those similar to influenza: high fevers, headaches and pneumonia. Symptoms
disappear naturally in about two weeks.
