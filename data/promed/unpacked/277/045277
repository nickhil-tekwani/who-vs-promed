A total of 3 more captive deer in Pennsylvania have tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD], the state Department of Agriculture said on [Fri 8 Jun 2018]. One of the deer was from a breeding farm in West Cocalico Township, in Lancaster County. The deer was among a herd that was euthanized after a 2-and-a-half-year-old buck tested positive in February [2018]. It was the only positive result among 36 deer tested.

The disease also was confirmed in 2 white-tailed deer on a small hobby farm in Greenfield Township, Blair County. The Agriculture Department said the deer are the 1st CWD positives among captive deer in Blair County. The farm is now under quarantine.

A total of 49 deer have tested positive for the fatal disease since it was discovered in Pennsylvania in 2012.

Chronic wasting disease attacks the brain of infected deer, elk, and moose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no strong evidence that humans or livestock can contract the disease.
