A [Seneca, South Carolina] woman bitten by a bat is being treated for
rabies [exposure] after the animal tested positive for the disease,
according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control [DHEC]. The woman was holding the bat -- which she thought was
dead -- when it bit her.

DHEC officials suggest that because of the size of bat's teeth, people
may not know if they've been bitten. So if there is any question,
officials said to seek medical attention and have the animal tested.
This is the 3rd confirmed rabid animal in Oconee County in 2010.

Last year [2009], there were 8 animals confirmed in the county. In
2009, there were 152 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in South
Carolina. There have been 65 confirmed cases in animals in the state
this year [2010].

State officials with the Department of Health and Environmental
Control (DHEC) have alerted residents that a woman and child from the
Johnston area [Edgefield County] are undergoing medical treatment
after being exposed to a puppy that tested positive for rabies.

"The incident began 4 Aug 2010 when the puppy was attacked by an
unknown animal," said Sue Ferguson of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental
Health. "On 23 Aug 2010, the puppy began having seizure-like signs and
was taken to a veterinarian. The puppy, which had not been vaccinated,
tested positive for rabies." The animal has died.

Ferguson said once the rabies virus reaches the brain, the disease is
fatal to humans and animals. The woman and a child are undergoing the
preventive inoculations, which officials said were taken in time to
prevent death.

Ferguson said, about 400 South Carolinians must undergo preventive
treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures from being bitten
or scratched by a rabid or suspected rabid animal.

This is the 2nd confirmed rabid animal in Edgefield County in 2010.
Last year [2009], there were 2 rabid animals confirmed in the county,
including one raccoon and one skunk.

[This one is a little odd. The puppy was vaccinated but still had
rabies. The article does not tell us the age of the puppy, but likely
it was about 3-4 months old as that is most often when they get their
rabies shots. So perhaps the dog was exposed prior to the rabies shot?

Health officials issued a rabies notice Monday [23 Aug 2010] for
residents along Oxford Green Drive in the Swift Creek Township, after
a case of rabies was confirmed in a raccoon. Wake County officials
said the raccoon interacted with a rabies vaccinated dog that received
a booster after the incident.

Whenever persons are bitten or scratched by an unknown animal, they
should thoroughly clean the wound with soap and warm water and contact
their physicians immediately.

If your pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid,
contact your veterinarian immediately.

A rabies alert is in effect for people who live in a north Raleigh
[Wake County] neighborhood. Health officials are warning everyone who
lives or has recently visited the vicinity of Victory Church Road near
the Boulder Creek Subdivision.

They say a fox tested positive for rabies and the animal interacted
with 4 people including an animal control officer. All of the people
are now being tested. [That should say TREATED, as it is not possible
to test human beings. - Mod.TG]

Health officials in Okeechobee County are trying to find 3 boys who
could be infected with rabies.

Officials say the adolescents were seen playing with a bat on Thursday
[19 Aug 2010], in the parking lot of a Dollar Store. Since the bat was
positive for rabies, officials say, the boys could have been infected
without knowing it.

The health department is alerting anyone who may have come into
contact with a short-haired black kitten [in the North Austin Area]
that tested positive for rabies Wednesday [25 Aug 2010].

So far, 13 people are getting shots to prevent rabies in connection
with the 4- to 6-month-old kitten that was found 13 Aug 2010 in an
alley on North Lamar Boulevard near 41st Street, said Carole Barasch,
spokeswoman for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services
Department. The department is seeking anyone else who might have come
into contact with the kitten 11 or 12 Aug 2010.

Anyone bitten or scratched by the kitten should seek medical attention
immediately. It might take weeks or longer for people to show rabies
symptoms, such as a fever or headache, followed by confusion,
sleepiness or agitation. But once symptoms appear, rabies almost
always is fatal.

For information, contact the health department at 972-5555.

Local animal control officials are still investigating a case of
rabies discovered in Oakwood this week [week of 23 Aug 2010], and
residents are checking whether their own pets are vaccinated.

Officials are still investigating the Oakwood case, where a rabid
domestic cat came in contact with 3 people over the weekend [21-22 Aug
2010] in the Valley Court area. The cat was confirmed rabid Wednesday
[25 Aug 2010]. Before it was contained, the cat playfully scratched
and bit 3 people while it could have been infected with the virus,
Hall County Animal Control Supervisor Mike Ledford said.

Ledford asks anyone who sees an animal acting abnormally to contact
Hall County Animal Services at 770-531-6830 or Hall County Dispatch at
770-536-8812.

Pocono Township [Monroe County] police advise residents to vaccinate
pets against rabies in light of a Monday [23 Aug 2010] incident in the
Alpine Lake area of Route 715.

A woman was walking her small dog in that area when a fox attacked and
bit both her and the dog, police said. Someone else who happened to be
in the area at the time fatally shot the fox, after which it was later
tested and found rabid.

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture confirmed more than 200
cases of rabies in the state between 1 Jan and 31 Jul 2010, department
spokeswoman Nicole Bucher said.

[10] Raccoon, possible human exposure - Rhode Island

<http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/blackstone/pawtucket-second-potentially-rabid-raccoon-killed-in-city>


A 2nd rabid raccoon may have been discovered in Pawtucket [Providence
County], animal control officials said Monday [30 Aug 2010].

Police shot and killed the raccoon at the Maple Meadows mobile home
park Sunday [28 Aug 2010]. Residents said the animal had been
wandering around for days, and was visibly sick. "It was twitching and
going in circles," said Maple Meadows resident James Wood. "It was in
bad shape."

John Holmes of Pawtucket Animal Control said the signs displayed by
the raccoon were consistent with the early stages of rabies. State
officials plan to run tests on the animal Tuesday [31 Aug 2010] to
determine if it was infected.

This incident happened just days after a rabid raccoon attacked a
worker and a police officer at M&G Transportation in Pawtucket's
Fairlawn neighborhood. The officer shot and killed the raccoon.

[While the appearance of the raccoon in the news report above was
suggestive of rabies it has to be tested in order to know for certain.
There are areas of the country where the belief is that aggressive
behavior in raccoons is more likely to be distemper. More often I have
seen sluggish, but hissing and staggering raccoons to have distemper.
However, rabies can be either the furious form (which is the
aggressive form) or the dumb form (which is the lethargic form). So
while this may or may not have been the specific raccoon that bit the
officer and the worker, these individual should still receive post
exposure prophylaxis.

Perhaps the overwhelming message in this update is that if the animal
is behaving abnormally, then it may be wise to stay away or to call
animal control for assistance in capturing the animal or handling it
in a safe fashion. - Mod.TG]
