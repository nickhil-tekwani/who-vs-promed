Typhoid is the biggest killer in Papua New Guinea, killing at least 10 of
every 1,000 people each year, one of the highest incidences of typhoid
in the world.
Hospitals in the Highlands also reported that most of the admissions for
medical conditions were related to typhoid and lack of drugs, coupled with
the confusion about the symptoms of the disease with malaria, resulted in
deaths.
"Typhoid is definitely the biggest killer in Papua New Guinea ... it is
endemic, it is spreading throughout the community," Dr Alphonse Tay, the
chief executive officer of Mount Hagen General Hospital said.
Dr Megan Passey from the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research in
Goroka said the disease could only be eradicated if measures were taken to
improve hygiene and sanitation in the community. The doctor said typhoid
was most common in the highlands, Port Moresby and Lae and admissions to
hospitals in these areas had soared in the past 10 years to alarming
proportions lately.
"The IMR conducted a study into typhoid in 1994 to 1995 and found that in
every 1,000 people, there are 10 people who are exposed to typhoid ... this
is an extremely high rate," Dr Passey, who was one of the doctors who
conducted the study, said.
Typhoid is a relatively new problem in Papua New Guinea. From very few
cases in the 1960s, the incidence has gradually increased to a situation
where it was now endemic in the Highlands and some larger coastal towns.
The results from the study also indicated that prevention would be
difficult and it would require a long-term integrated approach, involving
improvements in hygiene and sanitation.
Typhoid is caused by _Salmonella typhi_ bacteria and the disease is spread
through contact with infected persons or food and water.
The doctors say in most typhoid cases, the symptoms were confused with
pneumonia and malaria and because malaria drugs were readily available,
this was the first line of treatment received by typhoid patients.

[The first paragraph indicates that 10/1,000 (I assume) residents of PNG
die of typhoid but a later paragraph says that 10 of each 1,000 are exposed
to the disease. No telling from this what all this means, except that
typhoid seems to be a rapidly emerging disease in PNG. - Mod.CHC]
