Leptospirosis is a serious disease: If not treated in time, it can lead to hospitalization or even death. In 2022, a sharp increase in the number of reports was observed in Reunion with 165 cases of leptospirosis. A total of people have died from the disease.

An upsurge is usually observed at the beginning of the austral summer [summer in the southern hemisphere from November to April in Reunion (https://travel2reunion.co.za/2018/01/02/reunion-climate-weather/)] with more favorable weather conditions and more risky activities. This disease is contracted on contact with a humid environment contaminated mainly by rat urine (mud, puddles, etc.). Cleaning activities in courtyards and gardens without sufficient protection (boots, gloves, etc.) or swimming in fresh water after heavy rains are therefore particularly at risk.

Also, ARS [Regional Health Agency] La Réunion and Santé Publique France recommend that the population increase their vigilance at the start of the austral summer and protect themselves by implementing simple actions to avoid contracting leptospirosis.

[ProMED last posted a report of leptospirosis in Reunion in April 2022 (Leptospirosis - Reunion: heavy rainfall, flooding, rats 20220425.8702821). Reunion experiences seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis related to heavy rainfall, consequent flooding, and a large population of rats (https://www.lifebiodivom.fr/en/lancement-de-la-deratisation-a-la-reunion/). A study that compared the genotypes of _Leptospira_ in human cases (66) of leptospirosis with genotypes of _Leptospira_ in 5 species of wild small mammals (n = 995) and domestic animals (n = 101) found rats to be the major reservoir of _Leptospira_ on Reunion Island, with a few human cases attributed to dogs, cattle, and mice (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004733).

Reunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800 000 located in the Indian Ocean, about 943 km (586 mi) east of Madagascar and about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Mauritius, the nearest island. A map showing the location of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean and its main cities can be accessed at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/reunion-map.htm. - Mod.ML
