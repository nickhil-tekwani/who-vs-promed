Further to your post, archive number 20061016.2976, I would like to
clarify that the lineage of virus associated with the outbreak in
game birds in the UK in 2005 was in fact lineage 5b, not pigeon
paramyxovirus lineage 4 as incorrectly stated.

[Dr. Brown's correction is gratefully acknowledged; we apologize for
any inconvenience this error might have caused.
The July 2005 outbreak in pheasants in Surrey was caused by avian
paramyxovirus, serotype 1 lineage 5B; molecular sequencing showed a
virulent sequence. A similar virus strain was identified in a
pheasant farm in Loire-Atlantique, France, regarded as the source of
infection. - Mod.AS]
