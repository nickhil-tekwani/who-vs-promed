USGS Biologists Tracking West Nile-like Virus in Birds
---------------------------------------------
Wildlife biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey [USGS, in partnership
with other federal, state and local agencies are studying the newly
discovered West Nile-like virus which has been blamed for the deaths of 3
people in New York City and the deaths of many birds in the city and
surrounding areas.
On Wednesday, USGS wildlife biologists issued a Wildlife Health Alert to
federal and state wildlife conservation agencies, parks, refuges and other
wildlife agencies east of the Mississippi River to be on the lookout for
dead crows and other birds which may indicate that this mosquito-borne virus
has appeared [in those areas.
USGS biologists, teaming with scientists and managers from the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health and environmental
departments in New York City, New York State, Connecticut and New Jersey,
are working to determine the extent of the problem in the Northeast.
Beginning next week, USGS field teams will be in New York and other areas
capturing live birds, taking blood samples and releasing them. The samples
will be sent to the National Wildlife Health Center for testing in an effort
to detect West Nile-like virus, and to the CDC laboratory in Fort Collins,
Colo., to test for antibodies. USGS biologists at the USGS National Wildlife
Health Center (NWHC) in Madison, Wis., in collaboration with CDC will be
analyzing samples from dead crows to determine if the virus is present.
Crows appear to be very sensitive to infection with this virus and thus may
be a good indicator of its presence.
"We're trying to map the distribution of this disease in birds both
spatially and temporally. And we want to try to determine if it is
expanding," said Dr. Robert McLean, a USGS wildlife biologist and NWHC
Director who is leading the study. "We're watching areas particularly south
of New York for crows which have died from diseases and then try to
determine if this virus was responsible. We would like also to determine
what other bird species are involved and if species besides crows are at
risk of dying from the disease."

Although it is certainly not any kind of official announcement, ABC news is
reporting the following:
http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/encephalitis990929.html
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Late last month, some dead crows were spotted near the Bronx Zoo.
Subsequently, 20 zoo birds died  including an American bald eagle, an owl
and five Chilean flamingos  and tested positive for the African strain,
said zoo spokeswoman Linda Corcoran.
No African bird has been imported by the zoo in 6 months, and any before
that had passed standard federal quarantine checks, she said.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Also, the above report (and all others I have seen that provide any
indication of species), identify the flamingoes that died as Chilean
flamingoes (presumably _Phoenicopterus chilensis_). This species is native
to Central and South America. Two other species the greater flamingo (_P.
ruber_) and lesser flamingo (_Phoeniconaias minor_) inhabit Africa.

[Thanks to Richard & others who wrote to us on this point, for the
correction.
So now it appears unlikely that the Bronx Zoo´s imported birds could be the
source. However, pet shops in New York City & state have undoubtedly
imported many birds from Africa more recently then that - Mod.JW
