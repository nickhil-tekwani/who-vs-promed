Influenza update - 308 (based on data up to 21 Jan 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity remained high in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere while in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere activity was at inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, influenza A accounted still for the majority of influenza detections but influenza B (mostly from the Yamagata lineage) increased in recent weeks.

Up to now, the majority of countries which are in the influenza season, reported influenza like illness reaching moderate levels in comparison with previous years, with few reaching levels exceeding those of previous years. Some countries however have reported levels of hospitalization and ICU admissions reaching or exceeding peak levels of previous influenza seasons. WHO recommends countries with current influenza activity or entering their season to adopt necessary measures for ensuring appropriate case management, compliance with infection control measures and seasonal influenza vaccination for high risk groups(see also the fact sheet given below).

- In North America, overall influenza activity remained high, with detections of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
- In Europe, influenza activity remained high in Northern and Southwestern Europe, and peaked in few countries but started to increase in Eastern Europe. Influenza B remained the virus most frequently detected and the subtype of the influenza A viruses detected varied depending on the country and the surveillance system.
- In Western Asia, increasing influenza activity was reported in some countries, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses present in the region.
- In Central Asia, influenza activity increased slightly, although it remained low across the region.
- In East Asia, high levels of illness indicators and influenza activity were reported in most of the countries. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B-Yamagata lineage viruses were predominantly detected.
- In South East Asia, low levels of influenza activity were reported.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity continued to be high in Iran and Pakistan, with detection of all seasonal influenza subtypes.
- In Northern Africa, influenza detections remained high in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco, while decreased in Tunisia. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and influenza B were predominantly detected in the region.
- In Western Africa, little to no influenza activity was reported across the region. In Middle Africa, there were no updates available for this reporting period. In Eastern Africa, increased influenza activity was reported in Madagascar.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity remained low in general.
- In the tropical countries of South America, influenza activity and respiratory illness indicators were generally low, with exception of Ecuador.
- In the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity remained overall at inter-seasonal levels.
- National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 101 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 8 Jan 2018 to 21 Jan 2018. The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 277 231 specimens during that time period. 88 612 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 53 213 (60.1 percent) were typed as influenza A and 35 399 (39.9 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 9745 (50.3 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 9642 (49.7 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 7778 (90.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 786 (9.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[The update above reports increased influenza activity as reported in the last several weeks in news and media from various countries. A more intense influenza season has been documented this year (2018) from various countries in Europe, Asia, and the US with higher hospitalization rates and deaths than in previous several years. It is important to understand that this report reflects data shared by countries through their National influenza centers in to the FluNet system of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Furthermore, It is important to have baseline influenza activity data in any country in order to define seasonal thresholds and generate appropriate alerts for health officials for public health response . - Mod.UBA]

[2] Universal vaccine

A private British company developing a vaccine that would be the 1st in the world to fight all types of flu has raised USD 27 million from investors including GV, the venture capital arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc.

Vaccitech, a spin-out founded by scientists at Oxford University's Jenner Institute, said the cash would help fund its vaccine through a 2-year clinical trial involving more than 2000 patients and expand other projects. The group is also running clinical studies on an experimental shot to prevent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

A so-called universal flu vaccine that elicits immunity against parts of the virus that do not change from year to year is a holy grail of medicine -- but so far it has proved elusive. Current flu vaccines have to be changed each year to match strains of virus circulating at the time. The hope is the new one-size-fits-all vaccine will provide better and longer-lasting protection.

Vaccitech's new vaccine works by using proteins found in the core of the virus rather than those on its surface. Surface proteins stick out like pins from the virus and change all the time, while those in the core are stable.

It also stimulates T-cells rather than antibodies - an approach that has yet to convince existing flu vaccine manufacturers like Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, and CSL's Seqirus. Still, Vaccitech Chief Executive Tom Evans is confident the big players will come around if the current mid-stage clinical trial is a success and he will not have a problem in finding a partner to take the product into final-stage phase III tests.

"If we get positive data that show we can affect rates of hospitalization and illness with influenza then there is no question in my mind that a partner would take this on," he told Reuters. "This could be a game-changer in a very competitive market."

If all goes well, Vaccitech's shot could potentially be ready for launch in 2023, although Evans said 2024 or 2025 might be more realistic. That means financial backers need to take a long view, especially as its other programs using T-cells to make vaccines against cancer, MERS, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus are also at an early stage.

[Flu viruses are classified by 2 proteins on the outer surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes, and viruses can be further broken down into different strains within those subtypes. For example, there are various strains of H1N1 influenza virus. The H protein (also called HA) enables the flu virus to enter a human cell. It is made up of a head and a stem. Seasonal flu vaccines fight infection by inducing antibodies that target the HA head. This region varies season to season, which is why influenza vaccines must be updated each year. However, scientists discovered the stem typically remains unchanged, making it an ideal target for antibodies induced by a universal flu vaccine.

"NIAID Vaccine Research Center scientists have initiated phase 1/2 studies of a universal flu vaccine strategy that includes an investigational DNA-based vaccine (called a DNA "prime") followed by a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine ("boost") to improve the potency and durability of seasonal influenza vaccines." (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/universal-influenza-vaccine-research).

A universal influenza vaccine could potentially help address unmet public needs for seasonal as well as pandemic influenza, with improved magnitude or quality of response and durability of protection extended beyond 1 year. However imperfect, current influenza vaccines remain a valuable public health tool, and it is better to encourage vaccination with the currently available vaccines than not at all. A broad range of expertise and substantial resources will be required to fill gaps in our knowledge and develop a transformative approach to influenza-vaccine design, in order to achieve the ultimate objective of a universal influenza vaccine. - Mod.UBA]
