"It's important for ... people to know that tattooing and body piercing
open people to the transmission of dangerous viruses such as hepatitis B,
hepatitis C and HIV."
********************
All James McAusland wanted was a $45 tattoo, but he ended up with a
$125,000 liver transplant.
"If I had known then what I know now, I would never have done it,"
McAusland told The American Reporter on Saturday from his bed in the
critical care unit at Integris Baptist Medical Center. "I'd like to tell
everybody that tattoos are dumb, a waste of time. And you can almost die."
McAusland , a 22-year-old grocery store stock supervisor at McAlester in
southeastern Oklahoma, said he went to a tattoo parlor in Sherman, Texas.
For his tattoo he chose a wolf standing on a rock and howling at the moon
because "it just stuck out." He had it tattooed just below the nape of his
neck on the right side of his back.
Everything went well for McAusland until about three weeks ago.
"He felt like he had the flu," said his mother, Ruth McAusland. "He was
real weak. And then he started to turn yellow."
McAusland was hospitalized in McAlester and soon lapsed into a coma.
Doctors there said his only chance to live would be to get a liver
transplant.
McAusland was rushed to the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute at Integris
Baptist. Dr. Anthony Sebastian, chief of abdominal transplants, said
McAusland was "just hours from death" when he received the new liver in a
10-hour operation July 14.
Sebastian said McAusland was the fourth young person to undergo a liver
transplant operation at the hospital in the past three weeks.
"It's probably an aberration of the usual," Sebastian said. "All the
patients are young and had no previous history of liver disease."
McAusland was the only one whose liver failure could be traced directly to
a hepatitis B infection and tattooing, Sebastian said. "It's important for
more young people to know that tattooing and body piercing open people to
the transmission of dangerous viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and
HIV."
Sebastian and Dr. Harlan Wright, the hepatologist in charge of taking care
of McAusland's new liver, urged everyone who has undergone tattooing or
body piercing to be tested for hepatitis B and C.
"A lot of them could have gotten the virus and not know it," Sebastian
said. "The virus can lie dormant for 10 to 20 years."
"If anybody's thinking of getting a tattoo, I'd say, 'Don't,'" McAusland
said. "It could change your life completely."
