Tests Ordered, Charges Filed Against Hog Farmers
[edited, but it is recommended that you read the full text - Mod.MHJ]
-----------------------------------------------
Maryland state agricultural officials face growing concerns about the spread
of trichinosis [aka trichinellosis] after 2 Carroll County pigs tested
positive for the parasitic disease. Officials from The Department of
Agriculture reported that the pigs were from a farm in New Windsor.
The farm's owner, 60, and his son, 34, were arrested last week on a 19-count
indictment that also included federal charges of operating a slaughterhouse
without a license. The arrests followed raids in March and April 2006, in
which investigators discovered piles of dead animals, and livestock feeding on
garbage. At that time, state agriculture officials said a malnourished pig
taken from the farm tested positive for trichinosis.
Now, officials confirm that 3 more pigs believed to have wandered from the
farm have tested positive.
Garbage consumption may have caused the infection to spread. "There
appears to be quite a bit of garbage feeding, particularly on
carcasses, and those carcasses may be infected with _Trichinella_,
and that's the primary [way] that it's transmitted," authorities said.

diagnosis, refer to the links at the end of this posting. - Mod.MHJ]
Health officials are concerned that the farmers' cruelty towards
animals may be causing a spread of the potentially deadly disease.
The farmer denies responsibility, telling Eyewitness News, "It could
not be a health concern from my farm, because I bought the pig in a
livestock market where there's a Maryland State Agriculture man in
every market I buy out of. They say about tainted meat and stuff --
the animals I buy -- if no one else would buy them, they would end up
in the grocery store on the meat shelf," he said. Last week,
during an exclusive interview, the farmer said he sells live animals to
mostly immigrant customers who slaughter them according to their
religious beliefs. At that time, a warrant was out for his arrest on
animal cruelty charges.
Roland Walker, the attorney for the farmer, said his client is free on bond.
He also said any diseased pigs on the farm were infected when they were
purchased. "The fact that they have trichinosis doesn't suggest they got it at
his place," Walker said. "He's only had some of the pigs for a short time." "I
do nothing wrong [with] those animals and to those animals," the farmer said.
In 1990, the farmer was found not guilty of animal cruelty charges,
stemming from an investigation into the same property. "I've been
being harassed for 16 years about this, " the farmer said. "I've been
in court. I've never lost." The farm's owner also denies that some of
the pigs that tested positive even belong to him. He is planning to
sell the farm, which has been quarantined since the 1st positive
trichinosis test. State agriculture officials said they don't think
any customers have purchased or consumed pork from the farm
since it was quarantined following the raids.
Officials say they are using a trap on a neighbor's property to catch and
bleed the animals that wander from the [infected] farm. State veterinarians
will test the remaining pigs on the 112-acre farm, which has been under a
swine quarantine since late April 2006, said Kate Wagner, a spokeswoman for
the Maryland Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture says
they have the authority to seize pigs from the farm, conduct more testing, and
find out just how widespread the deadly trichinosis may be.
The infected pigs are being sheltered at the Humane Society.
Trichinosis is extremely rare on pig farms, having been nearly
eradicated in the past 30 to 40 years, said Thomas G. Hartsock, an
animal science professor and swine specialist at the University of
Maryland, College Park.
The Centers for Disease Control say it has become rare in recent
years because of legislation banning the feeding of raw meat and
garbage to hogs, improved hygiene on hog farms, freezing of pork and
the public awareness of the danger of eating under-cooked pork. On
average, 12 cases per year are reported in the United States. There
have been no cases reported in Maryland in more than 5 years, state
agricultural officials said.

[Nice report from Mike Hellgren -- and what would we do without lawyers? This
is reminiscent of the comment on absence of reports being irrelevant to the
reality. ProMED does not have a single report on trichinellosis in the USA
[but see archived reports from Canada, below. - Mod.JW], but it is chugging
along in the background here, especially in rural backyard pigs and patently
ill-run farms such as this Maryland farm appears to be. We vets have all seen
similar establishments, unfortunately. And if your viewpoint is "So what?"
just think back to that pig farm in Yorkshire that was the starting point for
the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK.
Human trichinellosis is usually very mild, and many don't realize that they
have been exposed, but it can be very nasty, starting with nausea, fever,
vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and fatigue, going on to headaches,
fevers, chills, cough, eye swelling, aching joints and muscle pains, itchy
skin, diarrhea, and latterly, difficulty coordinating movements, heart and
breathing problems, and sometimes death. In the 1980s, when we were
investigating the disease in Louisiana following a human case in New Orleans,
we found around 3/1000 pigs in local custom slaughterhouses with parasites;
unfortunately, we could not specify the parasite. And the Maryland State
Agriculture folk may be whistling when they say that they don't think any
customers have purchased or consumed pork from the farm since it was
quarantined following the raids. What about last December (Christmas), January
and February?
This is patently a situation where the more we look, the more we will find,
and state agriculture and veterinary services would be wise to get out there
and get ahead of the curve. - Mod.MHJ]
