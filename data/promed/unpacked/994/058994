Mesa County Public Health Department says the number of whooping cough [pertussis] cases this year [2018] is one of the worst yet and continues to grow. "It's a highly contagious respiratory illness," said Katie Nelson with Mesa County Public Health. "As of [20 Jul 2018] we have had 23 cases of whooping cough," said Nelson. That's significant because it brings us to the same number of cases we saw throughout the entire year in 2017.

Mesa county has seen more cases in 2017 and 2018 than in any other year for the past 5 years. In 2013 we had 10 cases; in 2014 there were 19; in 2015 there were 9; in 2016 there were 11; and in 2017 there were 23 cases.

"Unfortunately an infant in California did die due to whooping cough," said Nelson.

It's a huge worry for local parents. [...]

Mesa County Public Health wants all residents, especially pregnant mothers and those around children, to make sure they are up to date on their immunizations. "It can be fatal for infants and young children their lungs are still developing so diseases like this are really hard for them and their little bodies," said Nelson.

[...]

So cover the cough, wash your hands, and stay home if you're sick. Mesa County Public Health [hosted] a couple back to school vaccination clinics including whooping cough immunizations [on 4 and 8 Aug 2018].

Local media reported on [Thu 2 Aug 2018] that 2 newborn babies have died of whooping cough in Bergamo near Milan. The children were born in May and June [2018], and died in a neonatal intensive care unit around a month after their birth. They had been born and received initial treatment in 2 different hospitals and were transferred to the neonatal unit at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital after being diagnosed with whooping cough.

Lombardy's Councillor for Welfare, Giulio Gallera, confirmed that the 2 cases occurred at different times and geographical locations, but said: "There is no outbreak [of the disease] in the Bergamo area. The only protection remains the vaccination of mothers."

He said that an already planned campaign would begin the [week of 6 Aug 2018] in Bergamo to raise awareness of the recommended vaccines for pregnant women, which include the whooping cough vaccine. Neither of their mothers had had difficulties during their pregnancy or childbirth, but neither had been vaccinated against the disease, l'Eco di Bergamo reported. Tests showed that the women had also suffered from whooping cough, which had not been diagnosed -- in adults, the symptoms of the disease can be similar to those of a common cold or flu virus.

The whooping cough inoculation was also among 10 made compulsory for Italian children starting at a state school in a controversial law passed last year [2017]. Parents had been set a July [2018] deadline to supply schools with doctor's notes proving the vaccination, but the new health minister said that a confirmation from parents would be sufficient.

This raised concerns from some, including Italy's National Health Institute, that it would be impossible to prove the children had received the inoculation, but Health Minister Giulia Grillo stressed that parents should not make false declarations.

An outbreak of whooping cough in Margaret River has led medical experts to remind people to update their vaccinations. 9 cases of whooping cough have hit the popular WA [Western Australia] tourist town within the past 2 months.

The illness, which can be fatal for very young babies and children, can be vaccinated against, and news of the cluster of Margaret River cases comes as it was revealed the tourist town was a "hot spot" for low vaccination rates in the under 5s.

WA Country Health public health physician Dr Clare Huppatz predicted there were likely to be more people suffering from whooping cough in the region who had not been diagnosed. "What we see in Margaret River, is what we see in most of the state, and that is from time to time we have an increase or cluster of cases," she said. "That is because it is a disease which is easily transmitted from droplets spread through coughing. So people who are not vaccinated or waning immunity are more likely to get it."

Under the WA schedule, children are due to be vaccinated between 6 and 8 weeks old, 4 months and 6 months, before they have a booster shot at 3.5 years old and in year 8. Pregnant women can get a free vaccine shot during their 3rd trimester. Dr Huppatz said although the vaccine was not "perfect" it was proven to help stop the spread among infants. "Those newborn kids, who cannot be vaccinated, can end up in hospital and with a serious disease," she said. "So everyone getting vaccinated helps protect them."

In March 2018, Health Department figures showed the number of cases of whooping cough in WA had fallen 20 per cent since the tragic death of [a] baby 3 years ago. [The baby] was only 32 days old when he died in March 2015 from whooping cough complications, prompting his parents to successfully campaign for a free vaccine for pregnant women in WA. At the time, [the baby's] mum, director of the Immunisation Foundation of Australia, said it was reassuring whooping cough in WA was declining. But she said no one could afford to be complacent because the disease still posed a real risk to babies and young children, particularly if they were not immunised.

If you've had a particularly bad cough while suffering from the flu, you could have been one of the many people badly affected by "pertussis", otherwise known as whooping cough.

The [South Africa] National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) reported that there has been an increase in confirmed cases of whooping cough among children under the age of 5 [years], across the country.

"Pertussis, commonly known as 'whooping cough' is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ and is notifiable according to the Health Act. An increase in pertussis cases has been reported from sites in kZN [KwaZulu-Natal], Western Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and North West.

Of the [37] pertussis cases identified between May and July 2018, 20 (54 percent) were aged under 3 months.

These sites form part of a pneumonia surveillance programme.

"Clinicians are advised to be on the alert for cases, to conduct diagnostic testing where appropriate, to notify cases and prescribe post-exposure prophylaxis to close and high-risk contacts of suspected or confirmed cases," said the NICD in a statement.
