LINCOLN, Neb.: The number of confirmed cases of chronic wasting disease
(CWD) in the state nearly tripled in the past week, sending wildlife
officials scrambling to contain the disease that strikes deer and elk. The
jump in cases began 10 days ago when wildlife officials discovered the
disease in a confined whitetail deer herd near Crawford in north west Nebraska.
Initially, officials said 5 animals had the illness, but further testing
showed 12 of the 25 fenced deer at a shooting preserve had contracted the
disease. In Colorado and Wyoming, a 15 per cent contamination rate is
considered high.

Commission to start Sioux County CWD testing in January
-----------------------
FORT ROBINSON, Neb.: On a fenced property adjoining a captive elk herd, 5
of 10 whitetails killed by hunters have tested positive for chronic wasting
disease (CWD), a spongiform disease that affects elk, mule deer, and
white-tailed deer. It is similar to scrapie, which affects sheep and goats,
and to bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Bruce Morrison, assistant chief of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission
(NGPC) wildlife division, has announced plans to conduct deer culling and
testing operations in Sioux County. "There is very much a sense of urgency
to determine if the disease in that area is limited to the captive herd or
if it is in the wild population and to what extent," Morrison said. "We
consider this to be a wildlife disease emergency," he said, and explained
the disease could spread from the captive herd and eventually destroy the
state's entire whitetail population. If that occurs, deer populations in
bordering states could also be destroyed. "A disease getting into the
Platte River valley and then funnelling to the eastern part of the state
could be devastating."
"Whitetails are much more susceptible than mule deer and elk, and they
spread it quicker, an amplifier of the disease. We want to find out not
only the percentage of deer having it but how far it has spread. CWD could
explode if it gets into the whitetail population. This is an emergency and
we have to take aggressive action. We are dedicated resource managers,
plus, the Legislature has charged us with that responsibility."
Morrison said "It has been shown experimentally CWD could totally devastate
the deer population in 50 years, wherever it is now." So, plans have been
made to kill deer on ranches bordering the Harrison-area ranch where CWD
has been confirmed, beginning in January. Game and Parks Commission staff
have contacted landowners and have received excellent cooperation to begin
deer culling and testing operations this winter, according to Gary
Schlichtemeier, district wildlife manager at the Commission's district
office in Alliance. "During the recent firearm deer season, the Commission
collected 805 brain stems from deer, including 125 whitetail and mule deer
taken in Sioux and parts of Dawes counties," he added. "CWD testing is
underway currently, and we should have results in about 10 weeks."
For more information on CWD, contact the Nebraska Game and Parks
Commission's offices in Lincoln, Omaha, Norfolk, Kearney, North Platte,
Bassett and Alliance, or contact the Commission's wildlife division at the
Lincoln headquarters, (402) 471-0641.

[Recently, a moose was found in Nebraska. This is an unusual occurrence in
itself, but the moose was emaciated and died. The moose has caused NGPC to
wonder why the moose was in Nebraska but, also, could it have had CWD.
Tests are being conducted. CWD has not been seen in moose. The rise in CWD
in Nebraska is concerning. - Mod.TG
