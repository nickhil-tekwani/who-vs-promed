TUBERCULOSIS, MDR, AIRPLANE EXPOSURE - MULTICOUNTRY (03)

Regarding the alleged quotation from the Hong Kong Department of
Health regarding those passengers sitting near the 2 index patients,
"They will be sent for checks and if they display symptoms, they will
be given medication" that approach clearly would have nothing to do
with control of any transmission on the plane. No one exposed on 21
July is going to have symptoms of tuberculosis acquired from that
exposure 5 to 10 days later. The epidemiologic approach would involve
either skin testing or a blood test initially to determine whether
the individual was infected with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ prior
to this exposure and, for those who are negative, repeating the test
3 months later. In places where tuberculosis infection is common,
such as most of Asia, it is generally more cost-effective to use the
chest x-ray. In addition to either skin or blood test and x-ray,
interviewing and education of the potentially exposed individuals is
also very important.
With regard to the Moderator's comments, "The durations of the 2
airplane flights in the current incident are not specified in the
news release above, but from past experience the risk seems only to
exist for flights longer than 8 hours; in addition, from past
experience, the risk for airborne transmission is limited to the
passengers in the immediate vicinity of the infectious traveler," it
is true that data demonstrate that the risk is greatest for flights
longer than 8 hours and for those sitting in the same section of the
aircraft, generally within a few rows. However I do not believe that
one can say that infection will not occur on flights shorter than 8
hours or in someone sitting farther away from the index case.
Tuberculosis transmission relates to sharing air. The longer one is
in a confined space with a patient with contagious tuberculosis, the
greater the risk of infection. The risk is not zero, however, even
for a brief exposure. In any situation, major factors include how
often the patient coughs, sneezes, or otherwise expels tubercle
bacilli into the air and how many bacilli are expelled by the
patient. One could happen to walk by the patient on the way to the
toilet just after the patient had coughed and thus be exposed, even
though sitting at some distance. Among the variables that would be
important in an airplane are the number of air exchanges within the
cabin. This has traditionally varied not only by type of airplane and
class of service (first, business, economy) but by carrier. I have
read but not confirmed that some carriers have reduced the number of
air exchanges in recent times in an effort to save fuel. This might
increase the risk of transmission of tuberculosis.
Fortunately, the risk of acquiring _M. tuberculosis_ on an airplane
appears to be small but the data are still very limited.
