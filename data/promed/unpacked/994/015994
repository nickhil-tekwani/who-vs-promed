Peru confirms 2 cases of anthrax
------------------------------------
Peru's National Agricultural Health Service on Friday [9 Feb 2007]
confirmed that 2 people were affected with skin anthrax in Huarmey, a
town in the Ancash province, 300 km northeast of the Peruvian
capital. Service official Jose Cabrera said that the patients, one
adult and one child, were infected by live goats suffering anthrax,
rejecting reports that they had eaten contaminated mutton.
Cabrera said that the patients had received medical care, while the
Service has begun to look for sick goats in order to slaughter them,
and planned to vaccinate healthy goats in the area.

[Infected by live goats? Virtually all human cutaneous cases follow
from exposure to sick animals after they have been slaughtered and
butchered. It occurs through the bacteremic animal blood getting into
cuts in the skin of the human handlers, e.g., from handling
contaminated meat, when the lesions are most commonly on the hands
and forearms. Goats are browsers, though they can graze if they want
to. Browse gets contaminated by blow flies landing on nearby bushes
after feeding on a carcass where they vomit up their meal before
eating it again; fly vomiting in some way aids digestion. In this
way, the leaves get contaminated with spores. So a probable scenario
is that there was an affected but dead animal about 4-7 days earlier,
probably a cow, which the adult and the child helped butcher.
Simultaneously, with their developing skin lesions some days later
and getting help, cases had begun to appear in goats. The latter were
referred to when questioned, leaving out the embarrassing fact that
they had participated in the butchering of an anthrax case and the
sale of its meat.

Mauina and colleagues (2005) published a review of the epidemiology
of cutaneous anthrax in Peru (see PubMed summary below). A copy of
the complete paper is available at

Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo. 2005 Jan-Feb;47(1):25-30. Cutaneous
anthrax in Lima, Peru: retrospective analysis of 71 cases, including
4 with a meningoencephalic complication. Maguina C, Flores Del Pozo

Anthrax is a zoonosis produced by _Bacillus anthracis_, and as an
human infection, is endemic in several areas in the world, including
Peru. More than 95 percent of the reported naturally acquired
infections are cutaneous, and approximately 5 percent of them can
progress to meningoencephalitis. In this study, we review the
clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients with
diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax evaluated between 1969 and 2002 at the
Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia (HNCH) and the Instituto de
Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt in Lima, Peru.
71 patients were included [49/71 (69 percent) of them men], with a
mean age of 37 years. The diagnoses were classified as definitive (44
percent) or probable (56 percent). The most common occupation of the
patients was agriculture (39 percent). The source of infection was
found in 63 (88.7 percent) patients. All the patients had ulcerative
lesions with a central necrosis. Most of the patients (65 percent)
had several lesions, mainly located in the upper limbs (80 percent).
Four patients (5.6 percent) developed meningoencephalitis, and 3 of
them eventually died. In conclusion, considering its clinical and
epidemiological characteristics, cutaneous anthrax must be included
in the differential diagnosis of skin ulcers. A patient with clinical
suspicion of the disease should receive effective treatment soon in
order to avoid neurological complications, which carry a high fatality rate.

[This paper is mainly concerned with human cases in the Province of
Lima. "The origin of the infection was found in 66/71 (93.0 percent)
of the cases: 34 (47.9 percent) described direct contact with meat
and viscera during the sacrifice of a suspect animal, and in 26 (36.6
percent) patients there was an antecedent of direct contact with
meat. The disease was associated with a direct animal contact: beef
cattle (56/71, 78.9 percent), goats (10/71, 14.1 percent) and swine
(5/71, 7.0 percent)." But as ever from exposures resulting from
butchering infected animals, as we must presume for the 2 human cases
in Ancash, meningoencephalitis is not uncommon in human cases, and
every clinician should be on the lookout for it.
Though presently absent from OIE reports, this disease has been
reported annually in Peruvian cattle up to 2004; reports on other
species are absent in spite of medical reports like the one above.
The disease has long been a problem, mainly in the coastal provinces
such as Callao, Lambayeque, Moquegua, Tumbes, La Libertad, Ancash,
Lima, Ica, and Cajamarca, Huanuco, Cerro de Pasco. - Mod.MHJ]
