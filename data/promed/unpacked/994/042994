153 soldiers are put on quarantine in Kiev
------------------------------------------
15 servicemen from the special presidential regiment of Ukraine
complained of digestive symptoms, which resulted in the placing of 153
soldiers under quarantine. As the Ministry of Defense reported to
Interfax Ukraine, the onset of symptoms was on 15 Sep 2009; 15
patients and 138 contacts are currently under medical observation and
quarantine. The source of poisoning is yet unknown and there is no
confirmation that it was foodborne. Some preventive measures are being
taken and an outbreak investigation is under way.

[The article is a little vague because it does not describe any
symptoms or why it may not be food related. If only 15 complained of
GI symptoms (upset?) then unless it is airborne in the housing unit,
or foodborne, why are 153 under quarantine? Is it communicable?
Poisons are not generally communicable. A poison may be consumed at
roughly the same time, or be inhaled by crowds, but cannot be passed
between persons. Also, what type of treatment is being provided to
those affected? - Mod.TG]

[GI poisoning symptoms can be due to consumption of methanol (in
adulterated liquor) or ethylene glycol (in adulterated cooking oil),
histamine, clenbuterol (in treated pork), sodium nitrate or nitrite
(mistaken for salt), heavy metals (leaching from cooking utensils),
aniline or aliphatic hydrocarbons in cooking oil (see ProMED ref. for
2008 below), seafood, mushrooms (see ProMED refs. below), _Bacillus
cereus_ toxin, and others including various Scheduled Agents such as
ricin, botulinum, anthrax, and enterotoxins. But the quarantining of
contacts suggests that an infectious agent is suspected. Could it have
been the dreaded norovirus? - Mod.JW]
