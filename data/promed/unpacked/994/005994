According to the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Health Department, 25 people who ate meals on the UT [University of Tennessee] Chattanooga campus have reported foodborne illness. A spokesperson said the health department has been investigating the case since 26 Aug 2013. They say the victims have reported illness and developed symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

The University is fully cooperating with the Health Department's procedures. Inspections of the University's food establishments and a review of their food handling practices and cooking procedures are being conducted, along with interviews and testing of those who reported illness. The unannounced inspections of the University food services revealed no specific problems or mishandling of food and scores of 95 and 99 were received on these inspections.

The health department reports that so far there are lab-confirmed cases of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. They say those results are "highly suggestive" that the problem was associated with a chicken product but added that "it is uncertain at this time. A specific source of the illness caused by these bacteria has not been identified, but the investigation is ongoing." They say there is no evidence of continuing illness.

[This small outbreak appears to be caused by both _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_. Both can easily be spread by eating undercooked fowl or from post-cooking contamination in the kitchen. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding whether all 25 ate in a particular campus cafeteria and a food diary. - Mod.LL
