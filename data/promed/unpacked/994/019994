Imported cases of chikungunya in metropolitan France, April 2005 -
February 2006
Introduction
--------
By 9 Apr 2006, 241 000 cases of chikungunya had been reported on the
island of Reunion, and 5339 cases on the island of Mayotte. The
islands of Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, and Comoros are also
affected. Imported cases have been reported from a number of European
countries [1].
Each year, about 300 000 people travel to Reunion from metropolitan
France (mainland France and Corsica), and therefore the risk of an
outbreak in metropolitan France must be considered, especially since
the vector, the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, has been detected in
metropolitan France and in northwest Italy, near the borders with
France, Spain and Switzerland. Its role in transmission of the virus
depends on vectorial competence (intrinsic to the mosquito) and
vectorial capacity (dependent on the environment).
In addition to mosquito surveillance, the number of imported human
cases must be reported as accurately as possible, in order to assess
the risk of transmission within mainland Europe.
Methods
-----
Recent infection is likely if chikungunya IgM antibodies are detected
in the 5 days after symptom onset, but the presence of antibodies
does not necessarily mean that the patient is viraemic. In
metropolitan France, serology is carried out by 2 private
laboratories and the 2 national reference laboratories, which also
perform PCR and viral culture. Data from laboratories from April 2005
to the end of February 2006 have now been analysed. Variables used
were patient and laboratory postcodes, patient age, patient sex, and
date of the blood sample. Data on the patients' dates of travel and
illness onset were not available from the laboratory database.
An imported case was defined as:
- detection of IgM antibodies against chikungunya virus and/or
positive PCR, and/or positive viral culture,
- sampled in metropolitan France, whether or not the patient lives in
metropolitan France.
Results
----
From 1 Apr 2005 to 28 Feb 2006, 307 imported cases of chikungunya
were identified in France. The mean patient age was 47 years (range:
7-81 years), and the male-female sex ratio was 0.8:1.
Between April and July 2005, an average of 20 imported cases was
observed each month. These cases correspond to the outbreak in
Comoros (over 5000 cases), and to the first peak of the Reunion
outbreak (during week 19 of 2005). Incidence then decreased between
August and November. The number of cases greatly increased in
December 2005, particularly in the final week of that month, and 131
imported cases were identified in February 2006. This trend is
similar to the epidemic curve of the Reunion outbreak where weekly
incidence greatly increased at the end of December 2005 (Figures 1
and 2, [see URL link above]).
Most of the cases imported to France have been in patients living in
southeast France and the Paris region (Figure 3, [see URL link above]).

An autochthonous case was reported in metropolitan France in March
2006. A nurse developed chikungunya fever (laboratory confirmed) 3
days after caring for a patient with an imported infection. The nurse
had never travelled to the Indian Ocean, and investigation of this
case has concluded that there was a probable blood exposure incident.
Previous incidents involving transmission of chikungunya virus during
laboratory procedures have been described [2,3,4].
Discussion
-----
Most of the imported cases are in patients living in the
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region in southeast France, which is home
to a large Comorian community, particularly in the city of Marseille.
Members of the community frequently travel to Comoros.
The imported cases reported here have been collated from laboratory
data. Because chikungunya infections may be asymptomatic or have only
mild clinical symptoms, it is likely that many or most of the people
who have been ill with chikungunya in metropolitan France have not
visited a doctor, and have not had their infections laboratory
confirmed. Information on date of illness onset in relation to date
of return to France would be a better indication of whether any of
these patients had been viraemic when in metropolitan France, and
thus present a risk for autochthonous transmission.
While none of the imported cases have been reported to be serious,
some residents of Reunion who have become seriously ill with
chikungunya on the island have been transferred to hospitals in
metropolitan France for care. These patients include, for example,
those who needed liver transplants to treat fulminant hepatitis
(acute liver failure)

[This is indeed a very comprehensive epidemiological review of
migration of chikungunya, i.e. exportation from the Indian Ocean
Islands to metropolitan France (a typical example) during a 10-month
period. Besides France, several other European countries had similar
experience, though to a lesser extent. Map of France:
