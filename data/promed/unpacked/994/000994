State health officials say a woman in Lake County has been diagnosed
with bubonic plague. It is the 1st diagnosis of plague in Oregon in
15 years. The disease terrorized Europe's population more than 600
years ago, but the plague is treatable when caught early.

Dr. Emilio DeBess is the public health veterinarian and an
epidemiologist with the Oregon Department of Human Services. He says
the disease, once known as the Black Death, got somewhat of a bad rap
after killing off 1/3rd of Europe's population in the 1300s.

But he says that thanks to scientific advances, "it's a very
treatable condition with antibiotics, and so that's usually not a
concern; back then, they didn't have antibiotics. We do have very
good antibiotics that treat the infection."

Health officials have not released the name of the Lake County woman
who fell ill at the end of August 2010. DeBess says authorities are
now trying to determine the source of the infection.

As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/diagnosis.htm>: The
typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and
very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is
called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person
develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme
exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected
rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic
plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the
bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they
spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal
condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes
the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The
infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and
breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients
are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress
rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (one in 7) of all plague cases in
the United States are fatal."

Most cases of _Y. pestis_ infections in the USA occur in the area of
the "Four Corner" states: Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah,
although California and to a lesser extent Oregon also may have
cases. - Mod.LL]
