Arkansas
--------
A family's pet dog, living in the community of Imboden in Lawrence County,
has been confirmed rabid by the Arkansas Department of Health this week
[week of 22 Feb 2010]. The dog became ill around 25 Jan 2010, and
progressively declined until it was euthanized and submitted for rabies
testing. Several people who were exposed to the dog will be undergoing a
series of rabies vaccinations to prevent the development of the disease.
The dog was an inside/outside dog and stayed in a fenced yard when outside,
but had not been vaccinated against rabies. The dog had been sprayed by a
skunk a month or 2 ago, but the disease cannot be transmitted in skunk
spray. Undoubtedly he had been bitten as well, although no skunk was seen
or found in the yard.

New Jersey
----------
A raccoon recently captured here has tested positive for rabies after
getting into a fight with a dog, according to the Ocean County Health
Department. The owner of the dog, a local resident, was exposed to the
rabies virus through the saliva of the raccoon while caring for his pet
after the fight, said Jennifer Crawford, supervisor of communicable disease
for the health department. The man, whom authorities did not identify, is
receiving rabies post-exposure vaccinations. The dog was vaccinated against
rabies and has been given a booster shot since the incident. Dr Ella Boyd,
county public health coordinator, said rabies is a year-round concern in
Ocean County. "Rabies is a virus that is present mainly in the saliva of
rabid animals. In Ocean County, it is most prevalent in raccoons, skunks,
foxes, and bats, although rabies has also been detected in feral cats,"
Boyd said in a prepared release.

[Rabies is a year around concern anywhere, as rabies is not given to any
particular season. While we may see more of it in the spring and summer, it
is possible to occur any time.

The protocol for how a vaccinated dog exposed to rabies is treated is
slightly different between states. It is advisable to check with your
veterinarian regarding the rules in your particular state. However, if the
animal is not vaccinated before exposure it will be euthanized. It is
critical to vaccinate your pets. - Mod.TG
