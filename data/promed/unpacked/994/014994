A councillor in Entebbe, [Uganda, Ssewali Kalule, [told the Municipal
Council that Wakiso district needs 2 tonnes of mosaic-free cassava in order
to fight the virus that has hit Entebbe. Kalule told "The Monitor" on 9
April that mosaic-free cassava [is needed to provide families with enough
food to improve their nutrition. She said Entebbe had been hit by the
virus and [that the crop, which is eaten by most families, has been
devastated by the disease.
Kalule said that Entebbe families depend on imported cassava chips from
Tanzania, Islands and other areas in the country.
"My office, this weekend (8 Apr 2001) distributed 3 sacks of cassava
cuttings, 60 kg of hybrid maize seeds, and Phia 17 type of bananas that can
multiply in a short period," she said.

[The delay in posting this report was because it took time to confirm the
identity of the virus causing the disease. The disease is probably caused
by the 'Ugandan variant' (UgV), a begomovirus with properties of African
cassava mosaic virus and East African cassava mosaic virus. Cassava is a
major staple in the diet of Ugandans and severe losses in the crop can have
grave consequences for the population. - Mod.DH

Cassava mosaic virus disease (CMD) in [Uganda was first reported in the
1920s. The causal pathogen was recognized as African cassava mosaic
begomovirus (ACMV), which is transmitted by the whitefly, _Bemisia tabaci_.
There have been various reports of serious damage by the disease in the
country in the 1920s and 1940s. These were contained by introduction of
resistant varieties.
CMD [occurs wherever cassava [_Manihot esculenta_ is grown in Uganda, but
[the disease remained endemic for decades until the late 1980s, when [an
epidemic was noted about 100 km north of Kampala. Unusually severe CMD
symptoms and very high whitefly populations were [associated with the
epidemic. [CMD was associated with a new virus strain, commonly referred
to as the 'Uganda Variant' (UgV), [which has properties of both ACMV and
East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV), another virus [found mainly on
the East African coast and Madagascar.
[Cassava infected with both ACMV and UgV exhibits more severe symptoms.
The epidemic [moved southwards at a rate of about 20-30 km per year,
[reaching Kampala by 1997 and most of the areas on the shores of Lake
Victoria by 1998. [By 1999, except for isolated pockets of the country,
most parts of Uganda [and neighboring countries had been [affected by the
epidemic. [Cassava production virtually ceased [because most of the
varieties grown by the farmers proved very susceptible to the disease. It
is estimated that over 500 local genotypes were lost to the disease, with a
net result of food shortages and famine.
[Attempts are being made to restore cassava production in [Uganda, mainly
through developing, multiplying, and distributing CMD-resistant cassava
varieties. NARO has developed and released 12 CMD-resistant varieties, but
the task of making these and others available to farmers who need them
remains enormous. In Uganda today, the increased importance of cassava both
as a food security strategy and source of cash income for the rural poor
[cannot be over-emphasised. The National Cassava Program (NCP) has the
national mandate for research and development of the crop, with a goal of
contributing to the well-being of the people of [Uganda.

[EACMV is present in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and
possibly in Zambia and Mozambique; ACMV is found primarily in Angola,
Kenya, Nigeria, and the Seychelles. Molecular studies show that UgV is a
recombinant virus containing a large part of the ACMV coat protein gene,
which has been inserted into the DNA-A of an EACMV-like sequence. Famine in
1994 caused by UgV infection of cassava was associated with the deaths of
3000 people. Before the epidemic, annual cassava production in Uganda was
about 3.5 million metric tonnes (mt), but it dropped to about 0.5 million
mt after the outbreak of UgV infection.

[The following is derived from the above source, in an article by JP Legg
and colleagues, entitled: Spread into Rwanda of the severe cassava mosaic
virus disease pandemic and associated Uganda variant of East African
cassava mosaic virus (EACMV-Ug).

Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) is a major food staple in the Great Lakes
zone of East and Central Africa. During the 1990s a devastating pandemic
caused by the emerging Ugandan variant of East African cassava mosaic
begomovirus (EACMV-Ug) spread through Uganda and into neighboring Kenya and
Tanzania. A survey was initiated in July 2000 to determine the presence or
absence of severe cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and EACMV-Ug. 26 farmers'
cassava fields were assessed in the major cassava-producing areas of the
country. At each site, assessments were made of CMD incidence, severity
(2-5), and infection type (whitefly- or cutting-borne), and leaf samples
were collected from 2 symptomatic plants for virus diagnosis. A standard
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic procedure was employed in which
specific primer pairs for African cassava mosaic begomovirus (ACMV) and
EACMV-Ug were used for detection.
The incidence of CMD was low (about 27%) and no clear differences were
observed between administrative regions. However, disease severity was
highest (score 3.6) in the Umatara administrative region, compared with 2.4
in other regions. In Umatara, most infection was whitefly-borne (83%) while
in other regions it was mainly due to cutting-borne infection (81%).
EACMV-Ug was detected in 26 samples, all from Umatara. One plant was
infected with EACMV-Ug and ACMV. Mean severity scores from virus-tested
plants were: ACMV (2.9), EACMV-Ug (4.O), ACMV + EACMV-Ug (5.0).
These data provide evidence for the recent spread into Rwanda of the
EACMV-Ug-associated pandemic of severe CMD, probably mediated through
migration of viruliferous whiteflies from Uganda and/or Tanzania.
Consequently, there is an urgent need for CMD control through deployment of
resistant cultivars, as has been done in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.

[According to Zhou and colleqgues (J Gen Virol 1997; 78: 2101-11,
EACMV-UgvV appears to have arisen by interspecific recombination of EACMV
and ACMV. There is no question that infection by the UgV strain and other
viruses is compromising food security in Rwanda and, indeed, other
countries in the Great Lakes zone. Though development of pest-resistant
cultivars by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture is a
positive step, deployment of these cultivars is critical to curb losses in
cassava and other food crops in the region. Unfortunately, the human
tragedy is invisible to the world at large. According to a posting by
on 18 May 2001, operations of the World Food Program (WFP)
in Rwanda have been hampered by a serious shortage of food commodities
during April. Some nutrition centers have been forced to provide smaller
portions of food for therapeutic- and supplementary-feeding programs.
During April WFP-Rwanda distributed 1094 metric tonnes of food to 86 634
people. The complete WFP story can be obtained from the following web site:

The history of cassava mosaic virus disease (CMD) in [Uganda goes back to
the 1920s when the disease was first reported in the country. The causal
pathogen was recognised as African cassava mosaic [begomovirus (ACMV). [In
the 1920s and 1940s there were reports of serious [crop losses that were
contained by introduction of resistant varieties.
Since then, CMD [occurred wherever cassava [was grown in Uganda but
remained endemic for decades until the late 1980s when a resurgence of the
epidemic was noted about 100 km north of Kampala. Unusually severe CMD
symptoms, very high whitefly populations, and a new virus strain, now
commonly referred to as the 'Uganda Variant' (UgV), [were associated with
the epidemic. UgV has properties of both ACMV and East African cassava
mosaic virus EACMV), another strain of the virus whose distribution [is
mainly on the East African coast and Madagascar.
Other studies have shown that more severe symptoms arise from dual
infections of ACMV and UgV. The epidemic [expanded southwards in a
front-like formation at a rate of about 20-30 km per year. It reached
Kampala by 1997 and most of the areas on the shores of lake Victoria (where
Entebbe lies) by 1998. [By 1999, except for isolated pockets of the
country, most parts of Uganda had [were affected by the epidemic and
similar conditions [were reported in neighbouring countries. [The
pandemic brought cassava production in the country to a near halt,
[because most varieties grown by farmers [were very susceptible to the
disease. It is estimated that over 500 local genotypes were lost to the
disease, [causing food shortages and famine.
It should be noted that [CMD is not an entirely new or
very-recently-re-emerged problem, except [in those areas [that were
affected by the epidemic later than others. [Efforts are being made to
further to understand the [disease and to restore cassava production in
the country. This has mainly been through developing, multiplying and
distributing CMD-resistant cassava varieties. As a response to the
pandemic, NARO has developed and released 12 CMD-resistant varieties, but
the task of [providing these and others to farmers who need them remains
enormous.
In Uganda today, the increased importance of cassava both as [an element
the strategy for food security and source of cash income for the rural
poor [cannot be overemphasised. The NCP has the national mandate for
research and development of the crop with a goal of making contributions to
the well-being of the people of [Uganda.
