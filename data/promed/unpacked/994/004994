Tests positive for ricin in home, assault victim
------------------------------------------------
Traces of the deadly toxin ricin were found in samples taken from a
south Everett [Washington] man's home and in his wife's urine, court
documents released Monday [8 Jun 2009] said.

The 48-year-old man, alleged perpetrator, was jailed Saturday [6 Jun
2009] for investigation of 1st-degree assault and unlawful
imprisonment. On Monday [8 Jun 2009], he was ordered held in lieu of
USD 1 million bail.

FBI agents have joined Everett police in the investigation that began
with a domestic violence call on [1 Jun 2009].

Evidence now is being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta to confirm the ricin findings, court papers said.

For the past year, the wife has suffered from an undiagnosed illness,
she told police. She thought her husband was trying to poison her,
Everett police detective Tim O'Hara wrote in the 8-page affidavit
filed Monday [8 Jun 2009] in Everett District Court.

The wife recently learned her husband was trying to hide dire
financial problems facing the couple, O'Hara wrote.

The case has been slowed by the possible presence of ricin in the
couple's home, Everett police Sgt Robert Goetz said. Detectives
"still have a lot of investigating to do," he said. The man allegedly
told investigators he bought the deadly toxin to eradicate moles from
the family's yard.

The man's wife told police she had stayed home from work on 8 Jun
2009 so the couple could meet with bankers to discuss their money
issues, court documents said. Around 11:30 am, he allegedly grabbed
her and started beating her with a 2-pound dumbbell.

Two days after the alleged assault, the man's wife and her sister
returned to the home and found items they suspected he had used as
poison, the court documents said. They called police and described 4
white trash bags full of about 100 empty bottles of Visine, ant
killer, powdered lye, a mortar and pestle, and a small plastic baggy
with about 20 beans of some variety in it.

Ricin is a derivative of castor beans.

When questioned by police, the man said he had tried to have castor
beans shipped to his home. His wife showed officers a letter from the
Department of Health in Miami. The letter said officials had
intercepted 300 castor beans because they hadn't been inspected for
insects, court documents said.

It's against federal law to possess or manufacture ricin, FBI
spokeswoman Robbie Burroughs said.

The man admitted to looking up a recipe to make ricin on the Internet
and knew the toxin was deadly, court documents said. He told police
he once found his wife using his mortar and pestle, which concerned
him. The wife told police she had an electric pepper grinder and no
need to use the mortar and pestle, documents said.

On Saturday [6 Jun 2009], a court commissioner ordered the supposed
perpetrator held on USD 100 000 bail. Additional evidence, including
the ricin threat, was presented to a judge pro tem Monday [8 Jun
2009]. The man's bail was increased to USD 1 million.

Police confirm ricin traces in Washington State woman
-----------------------------------------------------
Urine samples taken from a woman in Everett, Washington, tested
positive for the biological toxin ricin, traces of which were also
found in the house she shared with the husband charged with beating
her, the Everett Herald reported yesterday [9 Jun 2009].

The woman told police she had been sick for the last year and
suspected that her husband was poisoning her. Last week [6 Jun 2009],
[the man] was charged with 1st-degree assault and unlawful
imprisonment after allegedly beating his wife with a dumbbell and
keeping [her] from leaving their home.

After returning home from the hospital, the woman found a bag
containing 20 unidentified beans, along with ant killer, powdered
lye, and other materials she believed had been used as poison,
according to court records.

Castor beans are used to produce ricin, a highly lethal substance
that cannot be legally produced or possessed in the United States.

The suspect told police he had ordered castor beans in the mail. He
had also used the Internet to find a ricin recipe, according to police.

The Miami Health Department halted a shipment of 300 castor beans
after finding it had not been inspected for bugs, according to a
letter shown to police by the suspect's wife.

The minute amounts of ricin reportedly found in the couple's home
have hindered the speed of the investigation by city police and the
FBI. Authorities "still have a lot of investigating to do," said
Everett police Sgt Robert Goetz.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to
conduct follow-up tests on the samples to verify the ricin findings.

[Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans
are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin
can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor
beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor
plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production
of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous
phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5-10 percent ricin.
Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and
preventing the cells from making the proteins they need, hence, it is
often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die.
Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Castor oil does not contain ricin.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can
be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under
normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 deg C [176 deg F].

Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells.

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled,
ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend
on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs
may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning
by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following
ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of
ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty
breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy
sweating may follow as well as fluid is building up in the lungs
(pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and
the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be
diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope.
Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur,
leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having
respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin
should seek medical care.

Ingestion: if someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or
she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody.
Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure.
Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and
blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen,
and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. A chronic
low level could explain the woman's condition and made it difficult
to get an accurate diagnosis.

Skin and eye exposure: ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through
normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness
and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of
exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion,
or injection) and the dose received.

If in suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated,
preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement
authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into
the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially
be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm that a
person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is
avoiding ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be
avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or
out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive
medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of
supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the
route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was
by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could
include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them
intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a
vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures
and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated
charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing
out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.
