At least 2 Coloradans returned home recently from Asia and East Africa with
chikungunya, an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes.
According to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
website, the disease can cause fever, headache, nausea, joint pain and other
symptoms. No deaths related to the infection have been documented [True in
the USA; mortality has been reported in the Indian Ocean and India
epidemics. - Mod.TY]
Chikungunya is among several types of mosquitoborne diseases that people can
contract when they travel abroad, said John Pape, an epidemiologist with the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. "Each year, we get
reports of dengue, malaria, and other diseases from travelers," Pape said.
"There is no outbreak of these diseases locally, and it's not mosquito
season. So there's really no danger to the general public."
But Eileen Farnon, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC, said the disease
is nonetheless a concern because mosquitoes may still be prevalent in other
parts of the country. She said at least 28 cases have been confirmed
nationwide [USA] in 2006.
In India and islands of the Indian Ocean, an outbreak of chikungunya has
afflicted more than 1.4 million people since March 2005.

[This report cites some additional cases imported into the USA that were
reported by the CDC. The risk of introduction of chikungunya virus into the
western hemisphere, including the USA, is real. Both vectors, _Aedes
aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_, are present and even abundant in some areas.
In the USA, _Ae. albopictus_ is distributed in the southern to central tier
of states and Hawaii, and _Ae. aegypti_ is present from the south eastern
states southward through the neotropics. [From answers.com, a definition of
'neotropics': The biogeographic region of the New World that stretches
southward from the Tropic of Cancer and includes southern Mexico, Central
and South America, and the West Indies. - CopyEd.PG]
Health providers need to be aware of febrile patients' recent travel
histories - Mod.TY]
