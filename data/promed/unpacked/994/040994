Stranded whales, dolphins die in Hamelin Bay
--------------------------------------------
About 55 whales and dolphins have died at Hamelin Bay, 10 km (6.2 mi)
north of Augusta. Community volunteers are working alongside staff
from the Department of Environment and Conservation to re-group the 17
remaining surviving whales found early this morning [23 Mar 2009] in a
mass stranding.

The Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) said the mass
stranding involved about 80 mammals, but only 25 had been found
alive. Since then a further 8 whales have perished.

The whales have been identified as long-finned pilot whales
[_Globicephala melas_] by DEC marine mammal specialist Doug Coughran
this afternoon [23 Mar 2009].

Incident controller Greg Mair said the whales were spread over a long
expanse of WA's South-West coast heading north from the Hamelin Bay
Caravan Park.

Veterinary assistance had been organised to assess the health and
wellbeing of the alive whales, and equipment provided by Sea Search
and Rescue was being rushed to the scene to help return the whales to
deeper water.

"Our main priority is to ensure the welfare of the remaining alive
whales before we herd them back out to sea," Mr Mair said. "When we
will be assisting them back to sea depends on ocean conditions and
the strength of the animals. At present, ocean conditions are quite
dangerous, with rough seas and large waves."

"We are trying to re-group the animals, which are spread over 5 to 6
km (3-4 mi) of beach, into one pod and hold them overnight in Hamelin
Bay until day break when they will be transported by truck to
Flinders Bay for release," he said.

"This method has been chosen to ensure the whales' greatest chance of
survival. Flinders Bay provides sheltered waters and is far enough
away from the stranding site to reduce the risk of the whales
re-stranding."

Mr Mair said DEC was working with the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River
to identify possible burial sites for the dead whales. Earlier in the
day Mr Mair said some whales were still free swimming offshore
Hamelin Bay and there were concerns for those animals to beach
themselves as well.

Hamelin Bay caravan park manager Melissa Lay, who lived in the area
for 5 years, said she has never seen an incident like that happen
before. Mrs Lay said lots of people in wetsuits had come down to the
beach to help the remaining live whales, which were spread from the
caravan park further north towards Boranup.

Incident controller Greg Mair said DEC staff had been swamped with
volunteers wanting to help the stranded whales. He said currently 100
community volunteers, Sea Search and Rescue officer and West Whales
volunteers assist DEC staff in the rescue efforts. Anyone wanting to
help should contact the DEC Busselton office on 9752 5555.

Long-finned pilot whales gained their name from their habit of
piloting fishermen towards fish. The whales are brownish-grey to
black. They have a distinct dorsal find and sickle-shaped flippers up
to one-fifth of their body length.

The animals grow to 6.5 metres (21 ft) while calves are less than 2
metres (6.5 ft) long at birth.

The species can dive to hundreds of metres to obtain food, mainly
squid and their lifespan is between 30 and 50 years.

Long-finned pilot whales tend to strand both individually as well as in pods.

19 pilot whales stranded in Busselton in 2005. Of those, 13 were
successfully returned to the ocean.

Since 1984 there have been 21 mass strandings of whales and dolphins
along the WA coast.

[This is a very sad occurrence. The reason these animals tend to beach
themselves en masse remains a bit of a mystery, and there may be more
than one reason depending upon the circumstances.

Speculations have ranged from sonar from navy vessels, to starvation,
storms confusing them, and even starvation with corresponding
metabolic changes speculated to result in confusion; and some have
suggested toxins such as those produced by red tides.

The precise answer is certainly not revealed in this article. If
there is more information from someone of authority, we would
appreciate your sharing. - Mod.TG

There were 2 other mass strandings of this species in Tasmania,
Australia, in November 2008, one of them 150 whales -- see report and

If you go to Google Images and enter "long-finned pilot whale" you
will find dozens of photos of this species, including many more of
them stranded on Australian coasts.

There are no reports of necropsy specimens being taken from any of
these whales -- probably because rescuers don't carry knives strong
enough to get under the thick skin and layers of blubber -- so no
tests for infectious disease have been done or specimens taken for
pathology. But dolphins and other sea mammals have died of cetacean
morbillivirus infection that blocke their airways -- see ProMED
