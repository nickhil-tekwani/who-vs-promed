Rabies victim hospitalised in Kostanay
--------------------------------------
The Ministry of Emergencies of Kazakhstan has reported a suspected
human case of rabies in Kostanay (the administrative centre of
Kostanay Oblast [region], North Kazakhstan). The victim is a
31-year-old woman who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)
of the Oblast hospital on Friday [3 Dec 2010]. The Ministry has
stated that there are no other known contacts.

[Kostanay oblast is located in the North of Kazakhstan, which is an
unusual location for rabies exposure. Cases of rabies have been more
frequent in South Kazakhstan. In 2009, 10 of 14 cases of rabies
recorded in Kazakhstan occurred in the south of the country. - Corr.BA]

[Unfortunately the Interfax Agency report provides no detail
concerning the source of the exposure of the victim. The absence of
other known human contacts suggests that the victim contracted the
infection (if confirmed) from a wild rabid animal rather than a
domestic animal. The victim's admission to an ICU suggests medical
intervention was delayed.

Further information regarding the circumstances of the victim's
exposure and in due course the outcome would be relevant.
