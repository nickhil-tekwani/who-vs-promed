As a Strafford County woman continues to recover from
gastrointestinal anthrax, the building in which she was exposed to
spores of the disease will soon undergo extensive cleaning.

During a conference call with the media on Wednesday [27 Jan 2010],
Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom said the woman is
doing much better and is now able to answer the questions of state
health officials. Dionne-Odom wouldn't comment on the specifics of
the state's discussions with the woman but did say the discussion
further solidifies their hypothesis she swallowed anthrax spores from
an African drum during a 4 Dec 2009 drum circle event at Waysmeet
Center, the United Campus Ministry for UNH.

Officials are now prepping for the decontamination of the Mill Road building.

The decontamination plan will include using bleach to scrub down the
5 common areas that tested positive for low-levels of anthrax. The
cleaning will also include vacuuming each room, according to
Dionne-Odom. Dionne-Odom said the Environmental Protection Agency has
recommended a list of companies experienced with this type of
cleaning, and it will be up to ministry officials to get prices and
have the cleaning done.

The ministry will be responsible for paying the cleaning bill, but
Dionne-Odom didn't have any estimates about how much it will cost.
Dionne-Odom said this type of cleaning was done with similar anthrax
cases in Connecticut and New York. "This is an effective method of
decontamination that both the EPA and CDC recommended," she said.

Once a cleaning company is hired, it will still take some time to
clean the building, according to Dionne-Odom. "It will be a period of
a few weeks because several rooms need to be cleaned from top to
bottom," she said.

Once the building is cleaned, the quarantine will be lifted.

Dionne-Odom also announced that 10 samples taken from the building
that were previously inconclusive and sent to the Center for Disease
Control for more specialized testing all came back negative. This
means that of the 75 samples taken from the building, only 6 came
back positive for low-levels on anthrax, 2 from African drums stored
in the building's basement and 4 low-level amounts found in some of
the building's common rooms.

There will be no more testing inside the building, and all the
African drums turned in for testing have been returned to their
owners, according to Dionne-Odom.

Since the Waysmeet Center was quarantined last month [December 2009],
the Rev. Larry Brickner-Wood has run the ministry from his home. The
Cornucopia Food Pantry, which was housed in the Waysmeet Center, was
relocated to the St. Thomas More Food Pantry at 6 Madbury Road. Eight
students who were living in the building have been temporarily
relocated to on-campus housing. Dionne-Odom said the rooms the
students stayed in were clean and didn't test positive for anthrax.

A woman who contracted a rare form of anthrax nearly 2 months ago
remains hospitalized but is now able to answer questions from state
health officials, the deputy state epidemiologist said Wednesday [27 Jan 2010].

Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom wouldn't give details, but said the patient's
responses back up the theory that she swallowed anthrax spores
propelled into the air by drumming at the United Campus Ministry
building in Durham. The woman became ill shortly after the 4 Dec 2009
event and had been in critical condition with gastrointestinal anthrax.

Anthrax spores later were found on 2 animal skin-covered drums and 4
other locations in the ministry building, which houses 8 University
of New Hampshire students and a food pantry and is used as a meeting
place for numerous community groups. The ministry center's offices,
food pantry and students have been relocated since the anthrax
investigation began, but Dionne-Odom said they will be allowed to
return once the building is decontaminated.

The state has given the building's owners a detailed cleanup plan,
which includes hiring contractors to spend several weeks bleaching
and scrubbing 5 rooms in the building, and using special vacuum
cleaners, she said. "This is not cleaning anyone can do," she said.

Environmental Protection Agency investigators took more than 70
samples from the building earlier this month [January 2010].
Authorities had said previously that 4 came back with low levels of
anthrax and more than 10 were inconclusive. Those 10 have now been
determined to be negative, Dionne-Odom said.

Two recent U.S. anthrax cases also were traced to drums covered with
animal hides, but those involved spores that were either inhaled into
the lungs or entered through the skin of people who were exposed
while making drums. The gastrointestinal form usually occurs after
eating raw or undercooked meat.

[There is also a report in the Concord Monitor:
<http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100128/NEWS01/128
0332/1001/NEWS01>, but it gives nothing not in either of the above reports.

From enquiries, one of the 2 positive drums was probably the source,
and, interestingly, it had been in use for some 10 years without any
problems. The present environmental contamination is minimal.
Somehow, spores got into this young lady's mouth and were swallowed.
It may be that a key factor is that she had a hookworm infection, and
the mucosal damage from this parasite feeding allowed spore entry
into the intestinal tissues. She was singularly unlucky. Fortunately,
when she presented herself with abdominal symptoms at the local
emergency clinic, they took a blood sample. Like many I expect, I
look forward to the full report when it is published. - Mod.MHJ]
