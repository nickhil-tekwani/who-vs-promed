Simian Foamy Virus Infection of 2 Animal Handlers
---------------------------------------------------
At least 2 workers have been infected with a virus from Macaque
monkeys at the federal Health Department's Tunney's Pasture labs in
Ottawa. Bred for research, the monkeys are part of an 800 to
900-member captive-bred colony.
On Wed 27 Jun 2001, 81 employees from the Sir Frederick Grant Banting
Research Centre in Tunney's Pasture were called to an emergency
meeting, during which they were told that 2 workers, and possibly a
third, had tested positive for Simian foamy virus (SFV) during a study
last month of 46 blood samples. Employees at the Centre were also
warned not to donate blood, tissue or organs until further tests
pinpoint exactly which workers are infected with SFV and how many more
might have been exposed.
A spokesman from Canadian Blood Services said last night that Health
Canada informed the agency about the SFV infections on Wednesday and
suggested that potential blood donors who work with lab animals may
have to be subject to special screening in the future. Health Canada
has also offered to test the spouses and family members of any
infected individuals.
The Ministry discovered the virus in 80 per cent of its macaque monkey
colony following tests completed in April 2000. Last month, the
Department conducted a blind study with 46 of the 81 employees who
volunteered. The 2 positive samples were discovered on 11 and 12 Jun
2001 while a third sample is being re-evaluated.
Karen Dodds, Director General of Health Canada's Food Directorate,
said that: "The purpose of the original (blood tests) was to determine
whether there was any risk of SFV infection in animal handlers and to
determine what impact, if any, it might have on Canada's blood supply.
"We are recommending that any staff who have had contact at the
present time or in the past -- either with the animals themselves or
with their blood, organs or tissues -- that they enroll in the link
study." At the emergency meeting 2 days ago, employees were given
information packages explaining the study, providing information on
SFV, listing interim recommendations and outlining the Ministry's next
steps.
SFV has been referred to as the "virus in search of a disease" because
it has the capacity to incorporate itself into DNA and because it is
transmitted routinely between non-human primates. Dr. Jonathan Allan,
a virologist at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in
San Antonio, Texas, says that "SFV has been called the virus in search
of disease because it's a retrovirus -- so you think, in the right
circumstances, it might do something. If it ever got into the
population, since it's a retrovirus, it's something you would prefer
not to have happen."SFV has been around [i.e., first detected since
the 1950s and is present without symptoms in almost all non-human
primates, said Dr. Allan.
It is transmitted orally between monkeys, baboons, and other primates.
"Retroviruses integrate their genetic material into your chromosome,
so they essentially become part of you," he added.
But there have been less than 20 documented cases of human infection
worldwide, and none of the people infected has shown symptoms of any
disease. The Health Canada results also represent the first
transmission between macaque monkeys and humans. The Ministry does not
yet know exactly how many employees could have had contact with the
animals or their organs and fluids. Some employees have since moved to
a research facility in Winnipeg, while others have retired or taken
other jobs. "The information that we have so far is that SFV causes no
adverse health effects, either in the animals or in the humans known
to be infected," Ms. Dodds said. "But we know that retroviruses, when
they do cause adverse health effects, have a long latency period, so
we will continue to monitor those individuals who we know to be
positive." In 2 previous studies of foamy virus infection by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, no transmission between
human spouses was found in a pool of 5 subjects.
There are 3 groups of retroviruses known to infect humans. Foamy
viruses are not linked to any human or animal disease but others, like
Human T Cell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV) are known to cause cancer in a
small percentage of people while others are linked [related to HIV,
the retrovirus causing AIDS.
Previous positive tests have come from individuals with high levels of
exposure to primates -- typically 20 years, according to Dr. Allan. He
added that laboratory precautions over the last 20 years have also
been designed to prevent transmission of primate viruses to humans,
meaning that those employees with longer tenures in the research
centre would be more at risk.
The Health Canada colony of roughly 275 macaque monkeys is located in
the animal wing of the Research Centre. It was being [used for
breeding from 1982 until 1997, when a report by the Royal Society of
Canada recommended that the practice be stopped. The animals are
available to scientists who meet Ministry criteria for research
purposes. At the moment, the animals are not being used.
The following are excerpts of a memo distributed to Health Canada
employees at the Sir Frederick Banting Research Centre at Tunney's
Pasture:
- Foamy viruses are a family of viruses commonly found in non-human
primates, cows, cats and other [animals. Infected animals do not
display symptoms or become ill due to the infection.
- Simian Foamy Virus (SFV) is a retrovirus endemic in non-human
primates.
- The U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC) established SFV infection
in up to 3% of workers exposed to non-human primates -- first detected
in 1997, published in 1998, 1999.
- No illness has yet been identified by CDC but numbers of infected
individuals are very low. A long-term follow-up is under way.
- About 80% of the animals in the Health Canada (HC) macaque colony
are infected.
- A blind study to look for SFV infection in HC animal workers was
undertaken as a result of the CDC studies; 2 previous CDC studies in
1998 and 2000, failed to show any human infection from macaques.
- Blood samples were taken from 46 HC workers, individuals who handle
primates or come into contact with blood or tissues from the primates,
between May 14 and 17, 2001.
- Two (2) samples were found to be positive for SFV infection by
serological tests on June 11 and 12, 2001. Results of one sample
require molecular tests for confirmation. All others are negative.
- Retroviruses are a specific class of viruses that cause lifelong
infection.
- They cause infection by integrating into the host's genome.
- There are three groups of retroviruses known to infect humans: Foamy
virus has not been linked to human or animal disease to date.
- To date, foamy virus infection in humans has only been found in
persons occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates or the body fluids
or tissues from nonhuman primates (less than 10 individuals in
published papers, 6 in unpublished studies.)
- Most retroviruses, if they cause disease, have a long latency
period. We recommend that you:
- Provide a blood sample in order to receive individual results.
- Talk to counsellors -- it will be important to understand the
potential implications before further testing.
- Talk to your partner, your doctor.
- Please, do not donate blood, organs or tissues until a negative
result is received.
Health Canada follow-up:
- Perform linked study as soon as possible.
- Provide counselling as requested -- both immediately and after
linked study.
- Follow-up with other Health Canada staff who may have had exposure.
- Follow-up with families, as appropriate.
- Consider any required changes to handling practices.
- Consider long-term health monitoring for infected employees.
- Consider implications for blood supply.
- Discuss implications with others outside Health Canada who may be
affected; e.g. zookeepers.

[Foamy viruses, so-called because of their characteristic
cytopathology, are classified as retroviruses belonging to the genus
_Spumavirus_ of the family _Retroviridae_. Spumaviruses differ from
other retroviruses in several respects; for example, the viral
polymerase gene is expressed from a spliced sub-genomic RNA.
Furthermore, the extracellular particle contains large amounts of
reverse-transcribed DNA; to such an extent that some virologists have
suggested recently that spumaviruses should be considered DNA viruses
rather than RNA viruses.
Spumaviruses have a wide distribution, and exogenous viruses are found
in many mammals. No natural human infections are known, other than
rare zoonotic transmissions from non-human primates such as described
above. There is some evidence, however, for the existence of a
distantly related endogenous spumavirus.
No disease has been associated with any spumavirus in its natural
host, and no oncogene-containing member of the genus _Spumavirus_ has
been found. For example, feline foamy virus is isolated from domestic
cats at higher frequency than the pathogenic retrovirus feline
leukaemia virus, but it has not been associated with any disease. The
potential for induction of disease in an unnatural host remains,
however, but there are no grounds for immediate concern in the present
case. - Mod.CP.
