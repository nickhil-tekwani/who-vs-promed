Russia: Number of Cases of Hepatitis A in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Continues
to Rise
-----------------------------------------------
The number of hepatitis A cases in the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast as a whole
[as of Fri 21 Oct 2005] has risen to 2197, of whom 485 are children,
suggesting that the increase has been predominantly in Nizhniy Novgorod
city [see data above].
It was considered initially that contamination of the cold water supply was
responsible for the spread of hepatitis A virus infection. However, more
detailed analysis of the situation has led epidemiologists to suspect that
infection was transmitted through the hot water [i.e. district heating]
system. It is now believed that transmission is mainly by contact.

[The hepatitis A outbreak in Nizhniy Novgorod city (Lat 56o 19' 60N; Long
44o 0' 0E) shows no sign of leveling off. A total of 637 suspected cases of
hepatitis A are in hospital, compared with 591 on 19 Oct 2005. The totals
for the Nizhniy Oblast are slightly higher. In the 5 days since the
previous report on Wed 19 Oct 2005, the number of hepatitis A cases
admitted to Nizhniy Novgorod city hospitals has increased by 178, 30 of
whom are children. The total of vaccinees has increased by only 1251
persons. This remains a serious outbreak, and doubt remains over the
initial source of the outbreak, although it now believed that the infection
is spreading by contact. Hepatitis A virus is moderately resistant to
thermal inactivation, but perhaps not sufficiently to survive exposure in
hot water for any appreciable length of time. Further information is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
