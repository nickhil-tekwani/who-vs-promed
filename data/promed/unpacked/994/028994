An apparent epidemic of stomach flu [viral gastroenteritis] has knocked 273
inmates off their feet and put Deuel Vocational Institution on lockdown, a
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman said on
Wednesday [17 May 2006]. Four inmates became so ill from dehydration caused
by vomiting and diarrhea that they were sent to hospitals, said corrections
spokeswoman Terry Thornton.
The illness appeared to be viral gastroenteritis, but prison officials have
not ruled out food poisoning [non-viral gastroenteritis], because inmates
are served from the same prison kitchen. Inmates housed in all parts of the
prison are falling ill, she said. No significant number of prison staffers
have called in sick complaining of flu-like symptoms, Deuel spokesman Capt
Ron Rackley said. Except for Deuel, none of the state's other prisons are
experiencing the same epidemic, Thornton said.
Rackley said that until the epidemic subsides, all of the prison's 3800
inmates are locked in their cells. No inmates are allowed to attend
scheduled court appearances in Stockton or elsewhere, he said. New inmates
who would come to Deuel are being sent to other prisons, Rackley said.
The first inmate became ill on Friday [12 May 2006], and the number of ill
inmates continued to climb on Wednesday. Prison officials asked San Joaquin
County Public Health Services to help manage the epidemic.

Prison officials said on Thursday [18 May 2006] that they now believe the
so-called cruise ship virus may have anchored at Tracy's Deuel Vocational
Institution, causing a growing number of inmates and a handful of staffers
to double over in agony.
Norovirus infection, [which causes a suddden-onset viral gastroenteritis,
also known as winter vomiting disease - Mod.CP] leaves its victims with
symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for a day or 2, has spread to at
least 4 other prisons, said Terry Thornton, a California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman.
Deuel first noticed a sizable group of inmates complaining of illness Tue
16 May 2006. By Thursday afternoon, 361 inmates and 8 prison employees had
become ill. Five inmates had symptoms so severe they were sent to hospitals
for treatment, Thornton said. "It's very puzzling, actually," she said.
"The number of inmates coming to sick call has decreased but not stopped."
Four other prisons on Thursday reported cases of the apparent flu: 44
inmates at Ione's Mule Creek State Prison were sick, 2 having to go to
outside hospitals; 4 inmates transferred from Deuel to the California
Rehabilitation Center in Southern California grew ill, and so did an
officer; 11 inmates at Wasco State Prison in Kern County came down with the
symptoms; and 10 inmates at Folsom State Prison near Sacramento complained
of symptoms.
Deuel officials asked San Joaquin County Public Health Services to help
them manage the epidemic. Dale Bishop, a public health physician, said they
were able to rule out food poisoning, but they haven't received back the
results of stool tests confirming norovirus. The symptoms sounded like
norovirus, and that's how officials are treating it, Bishop said. A number
of sources throughout the state have reported the virus recently. It is
spread through water [and/or food] and touching contaminated surfaces.
"Hopefully, we've peaked," said Mike Quagliar, a Deuel spokesman.

[Although the identity of the etiologic agent has not yet been confirmed by
laboratory analysis, this outbreak in closed institutions has all the
hallmarks of norovirus infection. Norovirus spreads rapidly from person to
person or through contact with contaminated surfaces, and the source of
such outbreaks is frequently associated with a specific contaminated food
product or a single infected individual employed in a kitchen serving a
closed community. The spread of infection to other prisons may indicate a
common contaminated food source, or a failure to maintain adequate
isolation. - Mod.CP]
