MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
=================================================
Date: Mon, 03 Mar 1997 22:20:25 -0500
From: Robert A. LaBudde <lcfltd@pobox.com>
My daughter is a freshman at Virginia Polytechnic and State University
("Virginia Tech") in Blacksburg, Virginia. On coming home from spring break
this weekend (March 1), she told me a student in a dormitory at Virginia Tech
had died last week from meningococcal meningitis and that the university was
warning all close contacts (roommates, sexual partners, etc.) to report for
screening.
Has anyone anything official to contribute about this episode?

[ProMED-mail receives many such messages regarding isolated cases or small-
cluster outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in various locations. It
appears that cases of meningococcal meningitis occur on an irregular basis on
college campuses as elsewhere. Certainly these occurrences should be taken
seriously but one would assume that such outbreaks are reported to local and
state public health authorities and that they are investigated and treated
(the episode as well as the individuals). When you hear of such occurrences
or even rumors of such occurrences, rather than contact ProMED-mail, contact
your state or local health department, university health center, or other
appropriate organizations. MMWR annual summaries provide data regarding
distribution and prevalence of meningococcal meningitis. -- Mod CHC]
