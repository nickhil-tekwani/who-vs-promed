Around 600 animals from the Mlada Gvardia Village will be administered an attenuated vaccine against anthrax, said Damyan Iliev, Director of the Food Safety Agency on Mon [20 Jul 2015].

A man died in a Varna (on the Black Sea) hospital a few days ago from an anthrax infection, the director of the National Center of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases confirmed on Sat [18 Jul 2015]. The man was infected while processing the meat of an infected cow or eating it undercooked. According to the Health Inspectorate, the cow was slaughtered on 7 Jul 2015 in the village of Mlada Gvardiya after it got sick. An anthrax focus was reported in the village.

Iliev said further that sheep, goats, cattle and donkeys are subject to vaccination. The attenuated vaccine will create immunity within a week. The vaccination will begin late afternoon on Mon [20 Jul 2015] and is expected to be completed Tuesday morning.

Mostly, the disease has been caused by the heavy rainfalls in June 2015, said Iliev. The torrential rain has washed away the upper layer of the soil, unearthing strains of anthrax which can survive in subsoil conditions for up to 70 years [Well, he is more certain than I am. - Mod.MHJ].

In the next days, the animals in the village will remain indoors. The Civil Protection service will deliver water to the farmers who do not have any. The owners must dispose of the animals' milk until the quarantine is lifted. Iliev could not say whether the veterinarian undertook adequate actions in this situation. In his view, both he and the owner of the cow had made mistakes.

Iliev confirmed the death of a 2nd cow in Mlada Gvardia, but the cause of death has not been established yet.

In Varna, Iliev took part in a meeting of the crisis centre called by Regional Governor, Stoyan Passev. Prior to the meeting, Deputy Health Minister Vanyo Sharkov said that the people who ate the meat of the infected cow are in good health.

An epidemic plan will be put into action in 4 Bulgaria municipalities over an anthrax outbreak. Stoyan Pasev, Governor of coastal Varna District, made comments on the matter on Mon [20 Jul 2015], speaking before journalists and announcing some pieces of news, Radio FOCUS -- Varna announced. Pasev stated the epidemic plan would be put into action in 4 municipalities in Varna District over the anthrax outbreak. He added that this was done so that institutions could have readiness as a preventive measure.

The plan would be in force on the territory of 4 municipalities where the meat of the slaughtered animal is thought to have been taken. The municipalities in question are Varna, Provadiya, Vetrino, and Devnya.

Stoyan Pasev said that if it was proven that the 2nd dead animal had died of anthrax, then urgent measures would be taken to provide land to bury the corpse, as transporting it could be dangerous. The vaccination of some 600 animals in the area is expected to start on Mon [20 Jul 2015].

Deputy Minister of Health Vanyo Sharkov, who is also in Varna, when speaking with journalists said that all individuals who had had contact with the infected cow meat, or who had participated in the production of food from it, or who had eaten it had been established. Sharkov attended a sitting of the crisis headquarters in Varna convened over the anthrax case.

[Actually, it is perfectly safe to drink milk from cows recently vaccinated with a Sterne-type vaccine. Vaccinated animals should be let out to graze, as housing in summer adds to their stress. Just check them twice a day by hand in case any are showing a temperature. And if an animal should go down with acute anthrax in a cow barn, the chances of other cows exposing themselves to any extravasating contaminated blood is high.

Though not specifically stated, it would be logical to assume that the epidemic implies that the livestock in the Varna, Provadiya, Vetrino, and Devnya municipalities will also be vaccinated.

This northeast region of Bulgaria is regularly afflicted with livestock anthrax outbreaks year after year.
