Nigeria baby poison deaths rise
-------------------------------
The death toll from a contaminated baby medicine sold in Nigeria has
risen from 34 -- recorded in early December 2008 -- to 84, the health
ministry has said. There have been 111 reported cases of children who
have fallen ill after being given teething syrup "My Pikin."

The poisonous syrup was discovered last November when babies began
dying of organ failure across the country. Authorities have called on
private pharmacies to turn over stocks of the paracetamol-based syrup
to regulators. The Nigerian-made mixture was found to contain engine coolant.

The National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control
(Nafdac) shut down the Lagos-based manufacturer and the main supplier
of the medicine last year [2008]. Nafdac has also appealed to parents
to not treat their children with any type of teething syrup until it
can find all the remaining stocks.

The dead children are aged between 2 and 7, Health Minister Babatunde
Osotimehin said. "Government will leave no stone unturned to find
answers to the many questions being asked by Nigerians and also
ensure that such unfortunate incidents do not occur again," he said.

The name My Pikin means my baby in Nigerian pidgin.

[Engine coolant is another name for antifreeze. Regardless of the
name it is a cryoprotectant used by the internal combustion engine
and other heat transfer mechanisms. It protects against freezing as
well as overheating of the engine. The most common coolant is ethylene glycol.

Ethylene glycol as an engine coolant is often a yellow-green syrup
appearing fluid. It seems to have a sweet taste and is part of the
reason animals may consume it. Being in a medication for teething,
the sweet taste would have been pleasant to the suffering child and
not noticed by the parent.

The article specifies organ failure. Ethylene glycol can cause kidney failure.

Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to form
glycoaldehyde, which is eventually metabolized to glycolic acid. This
causes acidosis. Glycolate is transformed to into glyoxylic acid
which may be come oxalate crystals. These crystals accumulate in the
kidney. The precipitation of calcium oxalate in the renal cortex
results in decreased glomerular filtration and renal insufficiency.
Consequently, the kidneys often fail. While this is a much simplified
explanation of the actual toxic pathway, it nevertheless allows for a
brief glance at the pathway from ingestion to renal failure. - Mod.TG]

[This incident is very reminiscent of the diethylene glycol
contamination of expectorant in Panama in 2006, resulting in over 100
deaths due to multiorgan failure (see prior ProMED-mail postings
below and a New York Times article
<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/world/americas/06poison.html> on
the event.) In that event, the Social Security system pharmacy
regularly prepared the elixir from imported propylene glycol used as
an additive. Investigations revealed that diethylene glycol had been
in the vats that supposed contained the proplylene glycol. One can't
help but wonder if a similar event occurred, where the pharmaceutical
company imported "propylene glycol" for use in the preparation of the
teething syrup, but the actual imported product was the engine
coolant/ethylene glycol. - Mod.MPP]
