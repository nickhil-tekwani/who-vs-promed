The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the presence of koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) in cultured koi carp (_Cyprinus carpio koi_) in British Columbia (BC). This is the 1st detection of KHVD in BC by the CFIA, but the disease has been previously detected in Manitoba and Ontario.

The disease detection was associated with an import of koi from Israel by a wholesaler who distributed fish to greenhouses, pet stores and garden centres within BC for sale to private individuals. As a result of this detection, the import of all susceptible species of aquatic animals from Israel for the following end uses will be suspended until further notice:

- aquarium - commercial;
- aquarium - private;
- outdoor holding unit - commercial; and
- outdoor holding unit - private.

The CFIA is committed to working with Israel to ensure that Canada's aquatic animal health import requirements are met and the suspended zoosanitary export certificate, which applies to all exports from Israel for the aforementioned end uses, can be renegotiated as quickly as possible in order to minimize any impact on trade.

KHVD poses no risk to human health or food safety; however, this virus can infect other susceptible species and is reportable under Canada's Reportable Diseases Regulations. Individuals or businesses that are concerned that their fish may have koi herpesvirus disease should contact their local CFIA area and district office immediately. Sick or dead fish should not be disposed of in natural waterways.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As other herpesvirus, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_koi_herpesvirus.htm. - Mod.PMB
