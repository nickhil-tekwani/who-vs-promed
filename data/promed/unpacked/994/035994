[Clearly the outbreak in Riyadh is continuing and possibly escalating. One can't help but wonder if there is a superspreader (or superspreaders) that have been identified. Repeating (and updating) yesterday's moderator comment "since 21 Jul 2015 there have been [26] newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by the MOH of which [23] were from Riyadh [88.5 percent]. Of the 23 cases from Riyadh reported since 21 Jul 2015, [19 (82.6 percent]) either had a definite history of contact with another known case of MERS-CoV infection or had a possible history of contact with another known case that was under review. These contacts included family members as well as within hospitals where other MERS-CoV-infected individuals were being treated. We are now 3 years into MERS-CoV transmission in Saudi Arabia and nosocomial outbreaks continue to recur."

Notable is that there have been 16 cases reported from Riyadh since the beginning of August 2015; are these cases related to a superspreader, or are the majority related to household spread with the occasional in-hospital spread? Note that among the newly reported cases today is a healthcare worker, making her the 3rd healthcare worker reported in Riyadh since the beginning of August 2015.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate clarification of the routes of transmission ongoing in this Riyadh-based outbreak.

A map showing the locations of the cases can be found at the source URL. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3567654,131.

Information on the situation in South Korea as of 9 Aug 2015 has not been posted on the South Korean MOH website as yet. - Mod.MPP]
