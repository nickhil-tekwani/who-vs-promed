Abstract:
The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (_Manis javanica_) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families - _Coronaviridae_, _Filoviridae_, _Flaviviridae_, _Orthomyxoviridae_ and _Paramyxoviridae_. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our 'upstream' market chain samples suggests that these detections in 'downstream' animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.

In light of recent publications that indicate a link between pangolin and bat coronaviruses related to SARS‐CoV‐2, we believe that recent observations of pangolins and bats sharing burrows in Lopé, Central Gabon, is of general interest. Our observations were made during an ecological and spatial movement study of the giant pangolin, _Smutsia gigantea_.

We observed at least 3 different species of Microchiroptera bats roosting inside 9 of the investigated burrows [also used by _S. gigantea_]. The fact that both giant and white‐bellied pangolins in Lopé, Central Gabon, use burrows that are inhabited by several species of bats illustrates that there is frequent opportunity for pangolins to be exposed to bat‐borne viruses. Pangolins are also commonly found in game meat markets in Gabon and are sometimes sold alive demonstrating risk of viral infection to humans. Until the links between bat, pangolin and human coronaviruses are better understood we suggest that Gabon takes steps to stop people capturing, handling or eating wild bats or wild pangolins. In this respect, wildlife researchers should conduct a detailed serological survey of the giant pangolin burrow's ecosystem.

[Pangolins are peculiar mammals of the order _Pholidota_, with only one extant taxonomic family, Manidae. There are 8 living species grouped in 3 Genera. _Manis_comprises the 4 species found in Asia, while _Phataginus_ and _Smutsia_ each include 2 species living in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Pangolins entered in the COVID-19 discussion when they were suggested as the possible source of infection for humans, acting as a bridge species which hypothetically exposed humans to a coronavirus that naturally circulates in bats of the Genus _Rhinolophus_. This contention was based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 from humans (99% similar), and also on the affinity of SARS-like CoV for pangolin's receptors.

Malayan pangolins (_Manis javanica_) confiscated from smugglers in China (collected in August 2017-January 2018) tested positive to coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. In the above referenced study they tested a sample of 334 Malayan pangolins obtained during anti-smuggling operations in Malaysia from 2009 to 2019, not finding evidence of infection with coronaviruses or other zoonotic pathogens.

The 2nd study found African pangolins sharing burrows with bats, proving that at least those African species of pangolins and bats interact and therefore there is opportunity for pathogen exchange. Some _Rhinolophus_ species are known to use underground burrows, just like pangolins. During winter, _R. hipposideros_ can be found hibernating mainly in underground sites including cellars, small caves, and burrows. - Mod.PMB]
