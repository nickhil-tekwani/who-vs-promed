An unknown illness has reportedly claimed the lives of 4 persons in the rural community of Oye-Obi in Obi local government area of Benue state. The president-elect, Igede National Youths Council, Andyson Iji Egbodo, who raised the alarm on Wednesday night [29 Jan 2020] on behalf of the villagers, told our correspondent by telephone that 15 more people with the same symptoms are already hospitalised in the affected community.

"The sickness has so far killed 4 persons in 2 weeks. The 4 victims developed the same symptoms -- headache, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomachache, weakness of the body, and swollen stomach -- and died alike," he said. Egbodo added that about 6 more persons who as at Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] were developing the same symptoms have been moved to the General Hospital in Oju, while the remaining 9 that made up the total of 15 on admission are kept at a private dispensary.

The youth leader who suspected the illness to be Lassa fever has appealed as a matter of urgency to the state government as well as relevant health authorities to come to the aid of the boundary settlement people before the illness causes further harm.

When contacted, the state's epidemiologist, Dr. Sam Ngishe, confirmed the death of the 4 people, adding that the health authorities were alerted to the situation a few hours ago.

Ngishe said an emergency response team from the state's Ministry of Health had been immediately sent to the area to contain the situation, while 3 of the patients are expected to be moved to Makurdi on Thursday [30 Jan 2020] for further investigation. The epidemiologist added that until investigation on the matter is completed, he cannot immediately confirm the nature of the illness, as there were already 2 sides to the rumour of possible causes of the deaths. He explained that there were reports that the community's source of drinking water was poisoned with Gamalin, and those affected may have consumed fish taken from the pond, while another side of the story suggested that the people who died presented symptoms of fever. "We can't base our findings yet on these rumours. We'll have to investigate it, and by tomorrow [Thu 30 Jan 2020], we will able to tell the press what exactly the challenge might be," Ngishe said.

[It is difficult to speculate on the etiology of the illnesses that these individuals were suffering. Although no hemorrhaging was reported, the other reported symptoms are compatible with Lassa fever, and this is the season when Lassa fever virus transmission is highest (see <Lassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20200129.6930926>). The epidemiological investigations may provide additional information. Laboratory testing of samples from the affected individuals should provide information that may indicate the etiology involved. - Mod.TY]

[This article mentions "..community's source of drinking water was poisoned with Gamalin and those affected may have consumed fish taken from the pond.."

Gamalin, more often spelled Gammallin is also known as Lindane, which is a gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, also called gammaxene. It is an organochlorine chemical and has been used as an insecticide and as a treatment for lice and scabies.

Lindane, a neurotoxin, interfering with nervous system, and can also affect the function of the liver and/or kidneys. It may be a carcinogen but has not specifically been designated as such. It has been classified as moderately hazardous by the World health Organization.

Being exposed to large amounts of lindane may be harmful to the neurological system. Clinical signs may include headache, dizziness, and seizures/convulsions, but rarely does it cause death.

Many of the organochlorines are banned in many areas because of the neurological effects, with the exception of the specific use of treating scabies.

Although the article specifically mentions lindane (organochlorine) the clinical signs mentioned in the article (headache, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach ache, weakness of the body and swollen stomach and death) do not mention the overwhelming clinical sign of most organochlorines, which is over-stimulation of the CNS, with seizures beginning approximately 1 hour post ingestion.

We look with interest to the outcome of the investigation and learning what affected these individuals. - Mod.TG
