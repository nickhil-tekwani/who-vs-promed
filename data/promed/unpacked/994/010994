Three cases of hepatitis A have been diagnosed at a catholic college
in the Molignee valley, in Namur province. Hepatitis A is transmitted
predominantly through consumption of water or food-stuff contaminated
by faecal material containing hepatitis A virus. Transmission of
hepatitis A virus infection is associated with poor standards of
personal hygiene and insanitary environmental conditions. The risk of
contracting hepatitis A virus infection is high in certain regions; in
particular Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. Regular
hand-washing and consumption of water of established purity are
necessary requirements for avoidance of infection.

The 3 cases of hepatitis A virus infection were diagnosed at the Saint
Benoit de Maredsous college and the Namur Health Authorities
immediately implemented measures to contain this outbreak and to
distribute protective vaccine. Fortunately hepatitis A is the least
serious form of viral hepatitis.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission. The WHO estimates
about 1.4 million cases occur annually. Improved sanitation and
vaccination are the most effective ways to combat the disease.

The report above does not reveal the precise source of the outbreak,
nor the condition of the cases. Further information would be
appreciated.

Saint Benoit de Maredsous college is located in the city of Denee, in
the province of Namur. A map showing the location of Namur province
