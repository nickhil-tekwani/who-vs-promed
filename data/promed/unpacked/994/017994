Mexican beauty cream linked to 6 El Paso mercury poisoning cases
----------------------------------------------------------------
A Mexican beauty cream that promises to rid users of wrinkles and skin
discoloration may actually be deadly, local health officials warned
Monday [26 Sep 2011]. Officials issued the warning on the heels of 6
mercury poisoning cases reported in El Paso by people using "Crema
Antiedad y Desmanchadora", an anti-aging cream nearly identical to
another cream, "Crema Aguamary", which may be responsible for 44 cases
of mercury poisoning in Texas and is not approved for use in the
United States.

Officials with the El Paso Department of Public Health said the Food
and Drug Administration limits mercury content in such products to one
part per million, but the creams imported from Mexico have been shown
to have up to 130 000 parts per million.

Mercury works similar to an expensive chemical peel at a cheaper
price, but the mercury can case severe health problems such as memory
loss, severe pains or cramps, renal failure, and possibly death,
Saldivar said.

"The mercury burns the skin and forces the skin to regenerate," said
Armando Saldivar, spokesman for the El Paso Department of Public
Health.

Health officials in El Paso said the popular creams, which range in
color from gray to off-white, can be obtained in Mexico or over the
Internet. Saldivar said although El Paso's proximity to Mexico may be
a contributing factor to the cream's popularity, it's not the only
factor given its manufacturers' presence on the Internet and social
networking sites like Facebook. Several cases have been reported in
East Texas as well.

"Our proximity to Mexico would be a factor in us having 6 cases, but I
hesitate to say it's completely because we're on the border," Saldivar
said. "The fact that it's so accessible is probably a bigger factor."
Crema Aguamary is produced in Culiacan, Sinaloa and costs MXN 900
pesos, or about USD 65, for a 3-month supply. A website for the
cream's manufacturer was down Monday [26 Sep 2011].

One woman, who declined to be identified, said she paid USD 100 for a
3-month supply of Crema Aguamary. She said she will have to throw away
about USD 50 worth of the product, which she has been using for almost
2 months to treat her melasma, or dark skin discoloration.

"I have to say that it does work, but I'd rather have the melasma than
poison my system," the woman said.

People who have jars of the cream are being asked to wrap them in
plastic and throw them with the household garbage, or take them to a
hazardous waste facility, Saldivar said.

Those who have used the cream are also asked to discontinue use
immediately and be tested for blood and/or urine mercury.

Information on treatment recommendations may be obtained by calling
the Texas Poison Control Network at 800-222-1222.

[Mercury comes in many forms. This article does not tell us what form
of mercury is in the cream. However without regard to the form,
mercury is toxic to the body.

Mercury and mercurial compounds can be absorbed into the body by
ingestion, contact, and by inhalation of the vapors. The damaging
effects of mercury are cumulative but very subtle.

Following absorption, mercury has been found in urine, blood, urine,
milk, bile, sweat, saliva, and even in pus from ulcers on the surface
of the skin. Mercury can be found brain, bones, and other cellular
tissues. It has been found in serous membranes, joints, the lungs, and
the liver.

The symptoms of mercury poisoning include emotional disturbances,
unsteadiness, inflammation of the mouth and gums, general fatigue,
memory loss, forgetfulness, and headaches. It may also lead to kidney
damage. Excess mercury in the system has been known to cause kidney
problems (membranous nephropathy).

Mercury can be extremely effective in lightening dark spots and
stubborn pigmentation but has a high spontaneous remission rate (in a
number of people, the original pigmentation returns once the treatment
is stopped).

Skin contact with mercury compounds can lead to irritation, including
patches of inflammation and the appearance of tiny bumps close
together. These bumps may burst and discharge matter, which later
crusts over leading to soreness and discomfort.

Mercury for such uses has been banned for some time. However it is
gradually creeping back into products as people are unaware of the
harm it can do, and the harm may be permanent. The danger is so great
that the US Food and Drug administration has issued alerts and
warnings, with one of the latest being in 2009
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_137.html).
California has issued alerts as recent as in 2010 (updated 22 Feb
2011;
http://www.ehib.org/papers/CDPH_Mecury_Health_Alert_Skin_Cream.pdf).

Most skin lightening creams containing mercury are either white or
yellow in color.

Unscrupulous manufacturers can also easily change their product names
and packaging to evade the authorities. The packaging for skin
whitening creams containing mercury would also usually not list
mercury as one of its ingredients, although sometimes calomel is
listed. Calomel is mercurous chloride, a type of mercury.

Unlabeled or homemade products for sale are also suspect. In one case,
skin lightening creams sold in white plastic jars with no labels were
found to contain 5.6 percent or 56 000 ppm of mercury
(http://www.ehib.org/papers/CDPH_Mecury_Health_Alert_Skin_Cream.pdf).
