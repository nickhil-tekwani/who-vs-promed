Although CDC declared that there is no risk for malaria to American travelers in Costa Rica as of 2014, 6 of 11 cases reported by the latter in 2017 were classified as "autochthonous" [1].

For much of the past 50 years, Costa Rica has reported the lowest rates of malaria in Central America, and rates for the entire region have decreased dramatically since 2000 [2,3]. [I've compared data for these countries at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/05/14/malaria-rates-in-central-america/. - Steve Berger]

Regarding Costa Rica:
- No autochthonous cases were reported during 2012 to 2015.
- Most cases of _P. falciparum_ infection are imported (_P. falciparum_ accounted for 0% to 2% of cases reported during 1990 to 2012).

[ProMED thanks Steve Berger for providing this background data.

The countries in central America in general do not distinguish between locally acquired malaria and imported cases; thus, the malaria rates presented in the graph from Gideon.com most probably are a mixture of local and imported cases. - Mod.EP
