For Immediate Release -- 22 Nov 2002
Shipping Cattle to Montana?
Be Aware of New Cattle Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Rules!
Montana livestock health officials have enacted new cattle tuberculosis
(TB) testing regulations for specific breeds of cattle imported into the
"Big Sky" state. The Montana regulation extends to all U.S. states and
impacts cattle breeds and crossbreeds prized for their horn development,
including Texas Longhorns, Corriente, Ankole, Ankole-Watusi, Chinampo, and
Argentine Criollo. Only steers and spayed heifers of these breeds will be
exempt from the new rules, provided they are shipped and confined to a
pre-approved Montana feedlot.
"These cattle breeds are not more susceptible to cattle TB," explained Dr.
Max Coats, deputy director for animal health programs at the Texas Animal
Health Commission (TAHC). "However, these breeds are frequently used at
rodeos, ropings or other competitive events, where they may be commingled
with cattle that may be of higher risk status. By requiring additional
cattle TB surveillance prior to or after entry, Montana animal health
officials are taking steps to reduce the risk of introducing cattle TB into
their state."
Cattle from breeds covered by the regulation must have a negative TB test
within 60 days prior to being shipped to Montana, unless the animals
originate from a TB-accredited herd. Test information or the herd's TB
accreditation status must be recorded on the certificate of veterinary
inspection, or "health papers," issued by an accredited
veterinarian.(Ranchers can earn TB-accreditation for their herd by having
all cattle tested for TB annually and by following state-prescribed
management and record keeping practices.)
Furthermore, if the animals are of Mexican origin or have been in contact
or exposed to Mexican-origin cattle, the cattle will be quarantined upon
arrival in Montana and must be retested for cattle TB 30 to 120 days after
importation. At least 60 days must lapse between TB skin tests on cattle.
"According to regulatory information we have received, Montana animal
health officials may permit the quarantined cattle to be used for specific
rodeo, training, or resale purposes during the quarantine period, as long
as the animals will not be commingled with other cattle," said Dr. Coats.
"Prior to making shipments, I urge ranchers and veterinarians to call
Montana's Animal Health Division to ensure full compliance with
regulations." Montana's Animal Health Division may be contacted at
406-444-2976.

[If Montana is changing its regulations, this points to active
surveillance/control in that state. It may mean that Montana is proactively
protecting its cattle industry or that there is an increase in TB in that
state or some other state that Montanta is protecting itself from.
Bovine tuberculosis is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by
_Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). In bovines, it is usually characterized
by formation of nodular granulomas known as tubercles. Although commonly
defined as a chronic debilitating disease, bovine tuberculosis can
occasionally assume an acute, rapidly progressive course. Any body tissue
can be affected, but lesions are most frequently observed in the lymph
nodes, lungs, intestines, liver, spleen, pleura, and peritoneum.
_M. bovis_ has been identified in humans in most countries where isolates
of mycobacteria from human patients have been fully typed. The incidence of
pulmonary tuberculosis caused by _M. bovis_ is higher in farm and
slaughterhouse workers than in urban inhabitants. One of the results of
bovine tuberculosis eradication programs has been a reduction in disease
and death from tuberculosis among the human population. Pasteurization of
milk and improved sanitation have also been of great importance.
Although cattle are considered to be the true hosts of _M. bovis_, the
disease has been reported in several other species of both domestic and
non-domestic animals. Isolations have been made from buffalo, bison, sheep,
goats, equines, camels, pigs, deer, antelopes, dogs, cats, foxes, mink,
badgers, ferrets, rats, primates, llamas, kudus, elands, tapirs, elks,
elephants, sitatungas [wild bovines], oryxes, addaxes [these last 2 are
antelopes], rhinoceroses, possums, ground squirrels, otters, seals, hares,
moles, raccoons, coyotes, and several predatory felines including lions,
tigers, leopards, and lynx.
The rigorous application of tuberculin testing and culling of reactor
cattle has eliminated _M. bovis_ infection from farmed bovine populations
of some countries, but this strategy has not been universally successful.
Extensive investigations of sporadic _M. bovis_ recurrence have shown that
wildlife reservoirs exist in some countries. - Mod.TG]
