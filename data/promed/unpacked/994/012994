[Such delay in reporting an internationally notifiable disease to WHO is
really unacceptable. Not surprisingly, a neighbor country is complaining --
see below -- although it is also behind in its notifications Â– Mod.JW

Staff of the National Health Foundation (Funasa) of Brazil fear that the
Bolivian authorities are omitting (sic) information about yellow fever (YF).
"They don't respond when we ask them for numbers of cases," says Ailton
Rodrigues, Funasa coordinator of operations against Aedes aegypti, a vector
of yellow fever & dengue.
Up to the end of December 1999, Bolivia had officially registered 70 cases
of sylvan [forest origin YF. But the number of cases could be higher,
according to Funasa, because the Bolivian notification system is precarious.
The Health Secretariat of Acre State & Funasa are requiring YF vaccination
certificates from Bolivians entering Brazil. Two YF vaccination posts have
been set up, one in Brasileia on the border with Cobija on the Bolivian
side, and one in Placido de Castro across from the village of Montevideo.
Acre State has donated 10 000 doses of YF vaccine to the Department of
Pando, the Bolivian province (sic) of which the capital is Cobija, & Funasa
has carried out 2 mosquito control operations in that town, where the number
of mosquito breeding foci is 37 per 100 houses. In Brasileia the rate is 2
foci per 100 houses.
