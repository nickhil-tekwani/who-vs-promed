Yellow leaf disease drastically reduces yield in sugarcane
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yellow leaf disease (YLD) is a recently identified disease in
sugarcane, which significantly reduces the crop yield. The disease is
prevalent in Erode, Coimbatore, Namakkal, Karur, Pudukkottai,
Villupuram, Vellore and Kancheepuram districts of Tamil Nadu, which
are major sugarcane growing areas. Since the loss caused by the
disease is phenomenal in the fields, efforts should be made to reduce
the disease severity and sustain sugarcane productivity, according to
Dr. R.Viswanathan, Senior Scientist (Plant Pathology), Sugarcane
Breeding Institute (SBI), Coimbatore.
Affected sugarcane crops exhibit a characteristic yellowing of
leaves. Usually the disease is noticed as yellowish midrib on 3 to 5
leaves from the top. Such symptoms are clearly visible when the crop
is 5 to 6 months of age. When YLD becomes severe, cane thickness and
stalk height are significantly reduced. When the infestation is mild,
the crop records normal growth. The symptoms may either be confined
to a few clumps or spread over up to 100 percent of the field
depending upon the severity of the disease.
Large patches of crops drying due to this disease in different
regions was noticed during the last 2 seasons in Tamil Nadu as well
as in other states, according to Dr.Viswanathan. The drying is more
prevalent in over-matured crops. Overall, the disease results in loss
of vigour to the sugarcane crops and and the crop dies prematurely.
Poor maintenance of the crop combined with drought conditions
aggaravate the severity of the disease.
Almost all the cultivated varieties recorded varying intensities of
YLD. When a severely affected plant crop is used for ratooning, the
ratoon establishment will also be poor, explained Dr. Viswanathan.
"The disease also spreads to new crops through infected cane stalks
which are used for planting. In the field, plant to plant spread of
the disease occurs through some insects such as sugarcane aphids," he
said. Since the disease spreads through infected planting material,
planting of disease-free material is a must to prevent disease spread
in the field. Farmers are advised to go for disease-free, clean cane
for planting. Nurseries for raising disease-free sugarcane are to be
established by obtaining healthy nucleus planting material available
at research institutes. The nursery plots should be monitored
periodically for the disease at regular intervals, according to Dr.
Viswanathan. Alternatively, going for tissue culture seedlings
ensures virus free planting materials. Failing to take such
management practices would result in serious decline in crop growth,
he cautioned. Proper planting of disease-free plants would ensure
increased productivity and enhanced sugar recovery in the mills,
acccording to him.

[Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV) has been associated with YLD of
sugarcane in India. The virus was placed in the family of
_Luteoviridae_ but has not yet been assigned to a genus. It is
transmitted by aphids in a persistent manner. Symptoms as described
above are more prominent on mature sugarcane plants under stress
conditions. A yield loss of up to 95 percent has been recorded for
some cultivars.
The virus is not eliminated by thermal treatments (prolonged exposure
to temperatures higher than normal for the host; conditions need to
be optimised for each host/pathogen system) used to eliminate the
bacterial sugarcane pathogens of ratoon stunt (pathogen _Clavibacter
xyli_ subsp _xyli_) and leaf scald (pathogen _Xanthomonas
albilineans_). SCYLV can be eliminated by using a meristem tip tissue
culture technique, and at present this is the best option for disease
management. However, over a 3-year crop cycle, 20 to 30 percent of
newly established virus-free plants will become infected. Resistant
cultivars are being developed.
YLD symptoms were 1st reported from East Africa in 1968 and have
since been recorded from the Americas, Hawaii, Australia and parts of
Africa. SCYLV appears to be associated with the disease in many
cases, however YLD symptoms in the absence of SCYLV have been
reported in South Africa in association with a phytoplasma
(intracellular bacterial plant parasite). It is possible that other
agents may also cause similar symptoms.
Meristem tip tissue culture is a method that may be used to obtain
plant cells free of intracellular pathogens such as viruses and
viroids. These pathogens spread from cell to cell, and it takes a
little while before newly formed cells in the meristem will be
invaded. If these not yet infected cells can be isolated and
regenerated into whole plants, pathogen-free lines of the host can be
established. Since it is technically difficult to separate
pathogen-free cells from already infected neighbours, it is vital
that these lines be tested for the pathogen and certified to be
pathogen-free before use by growers. A case where an apparent lapse
in this procedure resulted in large scale dissemination of _Potato
spindle tuber viroid_ has been described in post number 20070423.1323.
