[1] USA (NY): positive wastewater for cVDPV2

A new batch of wastewater samples have turned up positive for polio in Orange County. The finding comes after 6 weeks of negative results for the virus in wastewater testing throughout downstate New York.

Two wastewater samples were positive, according to the New York State Department of Health. One sample was collected from the Harriman Sewage Treatment Plant and one sample was collected from the Middletown Sewage Treatment Plant.

The strains in the 2 positive samples are genetically linked to a Rockland County case of paralytic polio discovered in July 2022.

The new positive results came from wastewater sampled on 16 Dec 2022. The last positive wastewater sample had been found on 4 Nov 2022 in Orange County. Weekly tests in downstate counties had not shown a positive result for polio between those periods. The state Department of Health updated the information 6 Jan 2023.

Wastewater samples indicate where the virus may be but do not gauge the level of virus that may be present. State health officials had recently urged caution when weighing the significance of recent testing showing the absence of the virus.

The only detected human case of polio was reported in a Rockland man. The 20-year-old became ill in July 2022 and suffered leg paralysis, which health officials have said is permanent. The Rockland resident had never been vaccinated against polio.

Federal, state and local health officials have focused on boosting vaccination rates, especially in Rockland and Orange counties, which had among the lowest rates of polio vaccination in the state for children ages 2 and under.

Counties have focused on increasing polio and other childhood vaccinations. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has embedded a special team in Rockland County to focus on boosting vaccinations.

From 21 Jul 2022 to 5 Jan 2023, some 58 149 polio vaccine doses were administered to children 18 years and younger in Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Nassau counties, based on data submitted to the New York State Immunization Information System.

Still, as of 1 Nov 2022, some 21 753 children in Rockland and Orange counties were not up to date with their polio vaccinations, said Samantha Fuld, spokesperson for the state Department of Health.

Health officials had also expressed concern that international travel could reimport the virus here. The polio strain detected in Rockland and most New York wastewater samples has been linked to samples found in Israel and London wastewater.

The strain found in Rockland and internationally was derived from an old-fashioned oral polio vaccine that hasn't been given in the United States for decades. In rare cases, the live vaccine can mutate and be shed. Such shedding doesn't happen in modern inactive vaccines, which also stop the vaccinated person from developing paralytic polio. That, health officials say, is why a high community vaccination rate is so important.

"Orange County has seen some improvement in vaccine rates following these efforts," Orange County Health Commissioner Dr. Alicia Pointer said Friday [6 Jan 2023]. "However, the recent results are a reminder that poliovirus is still in our communities. Vaccination is the best way to prevent paralysis from polio infections."

Pointer said the county continues to build and deepen community collaborations and increase outreach and education efforts. "This work won't just help keep our community safe from polio; it will also protect children from a variety of vaccine-preventable diseases."

Health officials on the national, state and local level have been on high alert because polio is stealthy and deadly: Some 99% of people who contract polio never know they had it; others can be paralyzed or die from the virus.

The state Department of Health chart for polio detection shows red if the virus was detected in wastewater and blue if polio was not found. Counties where polio had been detected in wastewater included Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, Nassau and parts of New York City [see excellent chart showing these patterns at the source URL - Mod.MPP].

According to the CDC, for a country to be removed from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative's list of countries with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus detections, the minimum is 12 months without a detection. Because this kind of tracking hadn't been used in the United States in this way, state health officials said there's still a lot unknown about interpreting the wastewater data.

"Polio was eradicated for 40 years. Now we have this technology on board to tell us some information," said Dr. Eli Rosenberg, deputy director of science for the New York State Department of Health's Office of Public Health. "We're still learning."

In New York, wastewater testing for polio is ongoing in Rockland, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester counties and New York City. Wastewater testing for polio has also been done in parts of New Jersey.

On 30 Nov 2022, the CDC announced it would start testing wastewater for polio in Michigan and parts of Pennsylvania, places with vaccination rates that leave the population at risk.

[The finding of positive wastewater after 6 weeks of negative results is a reminder the virus is still present and circulating in New York State, either a new introduction from a traveller (domestic or international) or very low viral levels in the 6 weeks with negative results.

At present there is no further information available on the wastewater samples positive for VDPV2 in Canada (see Poliomyelitis update (01): (Canada) VDPV2, wastewater, RFI 20230102.8707576).

A map of New York State showing counties can be found at https://geology.com/county-map/new-york.shtml. Note that the counties with positive wastewater for cVDPV2 are all located in the southeastern extension of the state, with Ulster County being the most northerly county. - Mod.MPP

[2] Pakistan: violence comment

Re: ProMED post Poliomyelitis update (02): WPV1 ES, cVDPV1 AFP & ES, cVDPV2 AFP & ES, violence 20230106.8707649

From the moderator's commentary in the above cited posting:
"The violence against polio vaccination workers including police officers protecting the actual vaccination teams is hard to fathom. In addition to the injured and killed individuals, in the long run the children suffer as seen by the increase in AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection during 2022."

Prof. John's comment in response:
The EPI schedule in Pakistan is 3 doses of pentavalent [5 antigen] vaccine (DPT, Hib and Hep B) and OPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks (Imran H et al. Routine immunization in Pakistan: comparison of multiple data sources and identification of factors associated with vaccination. Int Health. 2018; 10: 84-91; https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihx067). The bone of contention between the militants and WHO is OPV by campaign. Both parties seem to be adamant -- a simple solution will be to replace pentavalent with hexavalent [6 antigen] vaccine (pentavalent plus IPV). Since IPV is exquisitely efficacious, OPV campaigns can be discontinued.

[As always, we thank Prof. T Jacob John for his astute and provocative comments. The use of OPV has been the target of rumors and misinformation campaigns in both Pakistan and Afghanistan (and Nigeria as well). IPV so far has been "innocent." Hence, an additional "pro" in the OPV vs IPV debate. But as to whether IPV would remain free from rumors and misinformation campaigns, only time will tell. - Mod.MPP]
