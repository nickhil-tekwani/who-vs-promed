[Following a two-month epidemic last spring [involving 150 northern Idaho
cases of pertussis, 3 new cases have been diagnosed in the Panhandle Health
District. According to Panhandle Health District nurse Marie Rau, a 7
month and a 4 year old and their mother from Rathdrum were diagnosed last
month by a Post Falls doctor, who did not notify the health district as
required by law.
So far, the health district has contacted 22 friends and relatives of the
family who may have come into contact with the disease. All are being
placed on antibiotics. About 10 had apparent symptoms of pertussis and
were being tested.
Early symptoms are mild cough, runny nose, sneezing and a low fever, the
article states. As the illness progresses, the cough turns violent.
Exhaustion and shortness of breath is common.
[During the recent Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Toronto, Dr. D. Guris of the CDC, Atlanta, reported
that from 1990-1996 the number of reported cases of pertussis has risen
more than the number of all other vaccine-preventable illnesses combined.
All of the observed increase could be accounted for in persons of >10 years
of age. Dr. Guris pointed out that these results could be explained in
part by some combination of decreased vaccine coverage, decreased vaccine
efficacy, or increased reporting. Low efficacy has been reported for some
commercial whole cell vaccines in recent years. It appears that this Idaho
outbreak also involves some persons >10 years of age. -MOD, ES
