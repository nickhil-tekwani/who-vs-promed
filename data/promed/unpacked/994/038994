Based on the clinical signs, sheep pox was detected by the
specialists of the Veterinary Service of the Chernigovskiy Rayon at
one of the private backyards in the territory of the village Iskra,
Dmitrievskiy district, Chernogovskiy Rayon, Primorskiy Krai. The
diagnosis was confirmed on 4 Oct 2010 by the FGI ARRIAH, the
Vladimirskaya Oblast [Russia's Federal Centre for Animal Health,
Vladimir, 190 km eastern to Moscow. - Mod.AS] after examination of
the pathological material taken from infected sheep.

Pursuant to Decision No. 39 of the Head of the Administration of the
Dmitrievskiy settlement of 5 Oct 2010, the village Iskra has been
quarantined, and the zone at risk (comprising 14 rayons of the
Primorskiy Krai) has been set up.

206 sheep were kept at the private backyard. 32 sheep were infected;
4 sheep died. Sheep were kept only at one backyard in this settlement.

The population of sheep and goats in the Chernigovskiy Rayon is 777 animals.

The source of the infection and the routes of introduction of the pox
virus into private backyards are being investigated.

The last case of sheep pox in the Primorskiy Krai was registered in
September 2002.

Specialists of the State Veterinary Service of the Chernigovskiy
Rayon are carrying out necessary measures in the affected area and
the zone at risk in accordance with the current instruction on
measures aimed at sheep pox prevention and eradication.

Specialists of the Veterinary Authority of the Primorskiy Kray and
the Territorial Administration of the Rosselkhoznadzor for the
Primorskiy Krai have been delegated for rendering assistance in
organization of anti-epidemic measures in the Chernigovskiy Rayon.

[An official immediate notification on the above outbreak was
submitted by Russia to the OIE on Fri 15 Oct 2010; see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9833>.

Russia's previous outbreak of "sheep pox and goat pox" (the official
OIE terminology of this disease) occurred in October 2008 in the
Khabarvskiy Kray (far east) (see OIE report at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7630Y>).
However, that event involved goats. Earlier outbreaks affected sheep:
in October 2003, in the Jewish Autonomous Region (Yevreyskaya
avtonomnaya oblast), in the south-eastern part of the country (see at
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/infos_san_archives/eng/2003/en_031212v16n50.pdf>);
and in September 2002 in 2 regions, Primorskiy kray (territory) and
the Jewish Autonomous Region (previously known as Birobidzhan); see
at
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/infos_san_archives/eng/2003/en_030110v16n02.pdf>.

Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats
characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles
(rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death.
Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which
can infect sheep and goats. Although most of the strains examined
cause clinical disease in either sheep or goats, some strains have
been isolated that will cause a clinical disease in both species
(e.g. in Kenya).

Capripox is endemic in Africa north of the equator, the Middle East,
Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, parts of the
People's Republic of China and Bangladesh. The most recent outbreaks
occurred in Mongolia in 2008 and 2009, an isolated outbreak in Greece
in 2008, and in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan in 2009. Goat pox has been
established in Viet Nam since 2005. The 1st goat pox outbreak in
Chinese Taipei occurred in 2008, and in 2010 the disease reoccurred
and was declared endemic.
