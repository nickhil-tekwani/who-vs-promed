Prevalence of IgG Antibody to SARS-Associated Coronavirus in Animal Traders
-- Guangdong Province, China, 2003
---------------------------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified in 2003 as an
infectious disease caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a
member of the coronavirus family not observed previously in humans (1,2).
Because its sequence data differ from those of known human coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV is suspected to have crossed the species barrier between an animal
host and humans.
The SARS outbreak began in China's Guangdong Province, where approximately
1500 probable cases were identified during November 2002--June 2003 (3).
Detection of SARS-like coronavirus has been reported previously in masked
palm civets (sometimes called civet cats) and a raccoon dog for sale in a
live animal market in Shenzhen municipality (4).
This report summarizes results of an investigation conducted by public
health authorities in Guangdong Province, which compared the seroprevalence
of SARS-CoV IgG antibody in animal traders (i.e., workers in live animal
markets) with that of persons in control groups. The results indicated that
13 percent of the animal traders, none of whom had SARS diagnosed, had IgG
antibody to SARS-CoV, compared with 1-3 percent of persons in 3 control
groups. Although the results provide indirect support for the hypothesis of
an animal origin for SARS, they also underscore the need for detailed
patient histories and more focused animal studies to confirm an animal
origin for SARS.
The seroprevalence study was conducted by the Guangdong Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in conjunction with the Guangzhou CDC, Baiyun
District CDC, and Shijing Township Hospital. Traders in 3 animal markets in
Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, were offered participation in the study, and
samples were collected on 4 May 2003 from those who gave consent. The
trader test results were compared with those for persons in 3 control
groups: 1) health-care workers involved with SARS control in 2 city
hospitals, 2) public health workers in the Guangdong CDC facility, and 3)
healthy adults visiting a clinic for routine physical examinations.
Compared with the overall control population, the animal traders were more
likely to be male and older; the majority of persons in both the trader and
control groups were aged 20-39 years. A sample of blood (5 mL) was drawn
from each subject, and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was tested by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by using the test kit (batch no. 20030501)
manufactured by Beijing Huada GBI Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing.
Of 792 persons tested, IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was detected in 72 (9.1
percent). Positive rates were highest in the trader group (13.0 percent),
compared with the 3 control groups (range: 1.2-2.9 percent) (Table 1
below). The prevalence of IgG antibody in the trader group was
statistically significantly higher than that of the overall control
population (chi square = 26.1; p<0.01). In contrast, no statistically
significant difference was determined in the prevalence of antibody
detected among the 3 control groups (chi square = 0.89; p = 0.64).
Among animal traders, the highest prevalence of antibody was found among
those who traded primarily masked palm civets (72.7 percent), wild boars
(57.1 percent), muntjac deer (56.3 percent), hares (46.2 percent), and
pheasant (33.3 percent) (Table 2). The prevalence of traders with IgG
antibody to SARS-CoV varied by market (6 percent, 11 percent, and 20
percent, respectively; p<0.001); no correlation was found between SARS-CoV
antibody and sex, age, or number of years worked in a live animal market.
None of the subjects had SARS or atypical pneumonia diagnosed during the
Guangdong Province outbreak.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This study found serologic evidence suggesting that asymptomatic infection
with SARS-CoV or an antigenically related virus occurred in Guangdong
Province. Seroprevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV was substantially
higher among traders of live animals than among persons in control groups,
consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV crossed the species barrier
from animals to humans. The results are consistent with preliminary
determinations of a joint research team from China's Ministry of
Agriculture and Guangdong Province, which found that sequences of
coronavirus detected by polymerase chain reaction in bats, monkeys, masked
palm civets, and snakes were identical to or similar to those of human
SARS-CoV isolates. In addition, a joint study by Shenzhen CDC and Hong Kong
University determined that the sequence of coronavirus isolated from masked
palm civets is 99 percent identical to human SARS-CoV (4). These
determinations appear consistent with the hypothesis that an animal
reservoir exists for SARS-CoV or an antigenically related virus; however,
the findings are not sufficient to identify either the natural reservoir
for SARS-CoV or the animal(s) responsible for crossover to humans.
Primary modes of SARS transmission probably are direct contact or droplet
spread from a patient symptomatic with SARS; however, other routes of
transmission might exist (5). Approximately 63 percent of Guangdong
Province patients with clinically defined SARS had no known history of
exposure to other SARS patients, and the percentage increased after April
2003 (6). This trend of unknown exposure also was observed in other areas
(7). Therefore, the possibility of unrecognized sources of infection or
infection from asymptomatic carriers of the virus cannot be excluded,
although some patients might also have pneumonia caused by etiologies other
than SARS-CoV.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. 1st,
although subjects were categorized as primarily traders of the animals they
were selling at the time of the survey, a substantial portion traded or
handled more than one type of animal. 2nd, the small number of subjects
with reported exposure to certain types of animals limits the ability to
differentiate risk among specific groups of animal traders. 3rd, although
the animal traders worked at 3 markets in Guangzhou, risk might differ
among traders in other parts of Guangdong Province or elsewhere in China.
Finally, as with other urgently developed tests, validation of the ELISA
kit employed has not been completed, and the IgG antibody cannot
distinguish recent from remote infection.
This report provides indirect support for the hypothesis that SARS-CoV
might have originated from an animal source and identifies multiple animals
for further study. However, none of the traders in this study had SARS, and
only 2 SARS patients in Guangdong Province were identified as animal
traders (i.e., a snake seller and a pigeon seller) (6). In contrast,
comparative analysis of early Guangdong cases, unlinked to other SARS
cases, indicated an overrepresentation of food handlers (6). Whether the
antibody detected in the animal traders in this report might represent
infection with a related coronavirus that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV, or
whether that antibody provides protection from SARS, is not known. Efforts
to identify a possible animal reservoir for SARS might benefit from prompt
attention to collecting detailed histories from any future SARS patients
regarding animal and other environmental exposures and initiating
tracebacks to animal supply sources (e.g., markets, farms, and wildlife areas).

[These data are interesting and tantalizing although not definitive. In
addition to the questions posed in the discussion above, there is the
question of asymptomatic infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), and its relevance to possible transmission. Anecdotal
information (hearsay) gathered by this moderator is that some individuals
with positive IgG for the SARS-CoV (presumed to be indicative of prior
infection with the virus) when interviewed were noted to have had a history
of respiratory illness, but in the absence of hospitalization, were not
considered to have had "the disease".
It would be interesting to know whether the definition used in the above
study for diagnosis of "SARS or atypical pneumonia" in the study group was
based on a systematic interview of study participants to determine whether
there had been a history of a significant respiratory illness on the part
of those animal traders with IgG evidence of infection with the SARS-CoV,
or whether illness was defined as having been hospitalized with a diagnosis
of SARS. - Mod.MPP]
