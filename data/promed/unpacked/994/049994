[1] UK and Europe: poultry and wild birds, spread, epidemiology
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022

"The Scientist" spoke with UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss about the current avian flu outbreak, the health and economic effects of the disease, and efforts to combat it.

The Scientist (TS): What does a typical avian flu season look like?
Christine Middlemiss (CM): I would caution against when we say "typical" avian flu season because what we find is, every season is different and indeed, every [confirmed case] is a bit different. But generally, over the last 15 years or so, what we've seen with bird flu is we [the UK] get infection coming back in migrating wild birds, as do our European neighbors. The birds go to the north of Russia for the summer, and they mix with birds...and they all exchange the viruses and then head back to Europe in the winter and can then potentially directly infect our poultry, our kept birds, or can infect our wild birds.

What generally we've been seeing is, every 2 to 3 years, a higher level of virus in the migratory wild birds. And we know that's there because we test them. We have a surveillance program that gives us an early warning of what's happening. That then translates into infection in kept poultry -- whether it's backyard poultry, animal sanctuaries, and sometimes commercial farms.... Last winter season [2020-2021], we had 26 infected premises in the UK, which was our biggest one ever. This year to date [7 Jan 2022], we're at 77. Back in 2003, the Netherlands had over 200 confirmed cases. So it does fluctuate.

But in general, this year...we are seeing the highest number of confirmations we've ever had. Italy is at nearly 300 confirmations...Hungary is getting towards 100. It's doubled very recently, the numbers in France and the Netherlands. So what we're seeing across Western Europe really, [is] an increase [in] the number of cases, all being from this subtype H5N1.

TS: Are there any ideas about why this year is different?
CM: There's lots of theories, but there's no concrete evidence yet. And it is something we will be looking at.... Is it something to do with immunity within the wild birds? Is it something to do with the way they're mixing? And what's driving that? People have suggested it could be climate change, flight pathways...we don't know. So, lots of possibilities and it absolutely is something we will need to internationally look at further.

TS: What does infection look like in birds?
CM: The highly pathogenic H5N1, what that does is in kept birds -- particularly specific species [in] the Galliformes [order, such as] chickens and turkeys -- it can cause a variety of clinical signs...respiratory signs or neurological signs. They can have twisted necks. They can have discolored combs, and...kind of runny eyes and so on, and maybe diarrhea, and then often rapid death. You get a rapidly increasing mortality, generally, where you keep a large number of birds together. And you may note before that some reduction in food intake or water intake.... And that gives us a heads up. The owner, they report to us that they suspect they have a notifiable avian disease outbreak happening in the premises and we can investigate.

TS: Do infections have any impacts on wild populations?
CM: It does kill some species of wild birds depending on their infection level. We in the UK asked people to report in found dead wild birds and then we triage them. And some of them we will sample looking to check what has killed them. Is it avian flu? What subtype is it? What species are they? Are they a migratory species? Are they one of our own national wild birds? That helps us understand a bit more about where the infection is across the UK, and then the risk to our poultry.

We started off in the autumn [2021], and we could see infection in Eastern Europe raising our risk level of incursion. We went through medium to high and now we're at a very high level of risk of incursion of infected wild birds into the UK. When we got to that level, we put in an avian influenza prevention zone requiring certain biosecurity actions of all bird keepers.... That means that there is a very high infection pressure out there. What we did next was to ask all bird keepers to house their birds, again to try and minimize any contact between them and that infected wild population. That risk level stress is across the whole of Great Britain. We've had infected wild birds detected in the north of the Isle of Skye in Scotland down to the south coast of England.

TS: What are some economic effects of the outbreaks?
CM: For individual keepers and companies, they're very serious. For people who keep backyard flocks...those infected birds may die. When we confirm infection, we will come in and cull the remaining birds because we need to protect other birds in a facility from getting infection. The same applies for commercial companies keeping birds.

We do cull out all the birds on confirmed infected premises and go through a process of cleansing and disinfection. We will also trace all potential spread from that premises -- so, egg trucks, for example, hatcheries, [and] all these sorts of associated premises -- and put them under restriction and have additional requirements around biosecurity if we think there's any chance of disease spread.... If you're in the vicinity of an infected premise, you will be put under restriction and it makes going about daily business harder, because of the biosecurity requirements we put in place. [For example] licensing requirements [are] that you can't move things unless you get a license, and the license says you must do these following biosecurity steps to make it safe, and so on. It has very significant impacts for companies and individuals who keep birds.

TS: Are there any efforts right now to develop vaccines or therapeutics for the animals?
CM: There is a vaccine available for avian influenza, but like vaccines for human influenza in people, they're not 100% effective. In fact, in birds it's really not terribly effective, and it doesn't cover all the strains that might be out there. The strains change quite often when the birds mix over [the] north of Russia. We are worried about vaccinating birds with a vaccine that's not hugely effective.

We do enable its use in some zoo animals under license in the UK, but it's not widely used. And because it's not hugely effective, it does have trade impacts because of the concern that it might mask infection, and the virus could still be there. Therefore, often trade partners wouldn't want to trade with you if you're using a vaccine. It's another area of potential science and research to look at more effective vaccines, but recognizing [that] the influenza virus, as we know from the human world, is a very difficult virus to produce a really effective vaccine for.

TS: Are people at risk in general?
CM: In terms of their own health, no. Our UK health authorities...have assessed the risk to the general public as very low. But we do advise that people should put in place routine hygiene precautions when they're handling their birds for their own safety.

TS: Should the average person be concerned about this increase in outbreaks?
CM: The general concern is that we've got this virus that is infecting birds and killing them. It has an economic impact that in itself has a wellbeing impact on those bird keepers. People should be concerned, particularly, if you're a bird keeper especially.

The message to everybody is -- general public: don't worry, very low risk. Routine hygiene precautions. If you're a bird keeper, you need to be really, really scrupulously clean all the time.

[2] Israel (Hula Valley): cranes, epidemiology and control, scientists' views
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022 05:54 IST
Source: Haaretz [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, edited]
http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/article-print-page/.premium-MAGAZINE-1.10520867


Prof. Ran Nathan, from the "movement ecology laboratory" at the Hebrew University, felt that something was wrong with the cranes as early as mid-December [2021]. For a decade he has been following them through transmitters that indicate their movements and location. When the avian flu epidemic broke out, 4 of the 10 cranes he was following ceased movement, and the remaining 6 showed alarming signs of a decline in activity levels, a phenomenon he had never seen before. "At that time only 40 deaths among the cranes were observed," he says. "I raised a shout that it was a huge event, and I hope this shout became helpful."

The outbreak -- which killed [in Israel] about 8000 cranes, other birds and more than a million poultry [including culled animals - Mod.AS] -- is unusual by any criteria. Avian influenza has been known for many years, and cases of mass infection and death are known to researchers, but these occur among flocks of chickens and other domestic birds, or in mixed communities of domestic and wild birds. In a flock composed exclusively of wild birds, such an event is very rare. "There has never been such an outbreak, surely not among cranes," says Nathan.

The question is how the virus will behave from now on. Are we back to the beginning of 2020, once again confronting a pandemic? Experts in Israel fear that spring migration will become the main engine for the spread of the virus in the coming months: hundreds of millions of birds returning from Africa to Europe will once again pass through the Hula Valley, catch the virus from other birds, from contaminated ground surface and water, potentially spread it throughout Eurasia. Dr. Ron Elazari-Volcani, a veterinarian at the zoological garden of the Tel Aviv University, warns: "There is a mega-veterinary event here, not only at the national level but also internationally."

The main question at stake today is whether to continue feeding the cranes in the Hula Valley, as has been done for years to keep them limited to this location -- or to stop feeding to reduce the viral load in the Hula Valley ahead of spring, while probably risking a spread of the disease across the country with moving cranes. Nathan says: "We must reach a situation where in mid-February [2022] we are prepared to take care of the infection centers. We have an international responsibility for what happens."

Eleazar-Volcani calls for drastic measures to reduce the risk of a global epidemic, even if these harm the flock of cranes in the Hula. "The health of the migratory flyway passing through the Hula should be prioritized over interests of local chicken coops. This will need securing compensations to the farmers in case affected, while favouring freedom from infection among the huge number of birds that will move northwards from Africa in another 2 months. Feeding them should be stopped in order to decrease their density in the Hula Valley and preventing the breeding of infection. Clearing the area from the virus before spring migration arrives is essential. The disinfection of the contaminated feeding area should be considered. To deter the birds from landing and prevent them from grazing in the area during the spring, the installation of propane cannons or nylon coverage deserve being considered."

The Nature and Parks Authority, on the other hand, believes that there is no justification for stopping the feeding of the cranes, and fears that the infected birds will spread to other parts of the country in search of food. Regarding the consequences of spring migration, Uri Nave from the PA's science division says: "During the spring there will be temperatures where the flu is less aggressive and there is a decrease in morbidity and mortality. It is also a migration with a different pattern -- the birds rush to the nesting sites in Europe and spend less time in Israel."

One of the factors that has influenced the outbreak of the plague is the global change in the migratory pattern of birds in recent decades. The birds' natural habitats disappeared, and humans provided them with new food sources. This is joined by climate change, which has made winters in Europe and the Middle East relatively warm and allowed the flocks to avoid or shorten their journey south.

In the Hula, the change took place following the re-flooding of the reedbed in the 1990s and the shift of farmers in the area from growing cotton to grains such as corn, peanuts and chickpeas, which became food for cranes. With the increased crane population and because many preferred to winter in the country instead of continuing to Africa, the damage caused to farmers also worsened. This is when their feeding venture started.

Experts admit that it is difficult to assess the consequences of the current outbreak, and that the lack of a formula for a perfect balance between bird protection and agricultural protection will make it difficult to prevent similar outbreaks. What remains is to learn how to deal more effectively with their consequences, for example, by systematically collecting carcasses at the center of the disease's outbreak.

"We need one responsible agency who can make decisions," says Dr. Moti Charter of the University of Haifa, who yesterday [6 Jan 2022] documented the carcasses of birds of prey, including owls, falcons and buzzards in the Agamon Hula area. The main concern is the damage to rare birds such as white-tailed eagles, only 2 of which live in the Hula, white-headed ducks, or ferruginous ducks.

The decision regarding the feeding of the cranes will have to be made in the coming months. "I do not know if it is possible to return the genie into the bottle", says Elazari-Vulcani, "it remains only to try to reduce damage."

[The continuing HPAI H5N1 panzootic, which started in the fall of 2021, has reportedly caused at least 3 other mass mortality events in wild birds:

- Cormorants in Dyer Island, South Africa (https://mg.co.za/environment/2021-10-20-bird-flu-outbreak-on-dyer-island-causing-mass-deaths/);
- Demoiselle cranes in Rajasthan, India (https://www.wti.org.in/news/wti-team-on-ground-as-avian-flu-hits-demoiselle-cranes-in-rajasthan/);
- Barnacle geese in Solway Firth, Scotland (https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/bird-flu-fears-around-4000-deaths-in-biggest-outbreak-for-years-3501424; see 20220106.8700696).

The HPAI H5N1 panzootic and its impact upon agriculture, public health and wildlife conservation prescribe the need for a One Health approach. - Mod.AS
