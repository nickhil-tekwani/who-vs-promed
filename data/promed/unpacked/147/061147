Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been detected in samples of wild crustaceans from 2 sites within the WSSV movement restriction area (MRA) in south east Queensland. The detections of WSSV were made during routine 6-monthly surveillance. Samples collected from these 2 sites had last tested positive for WSSV in March 2018. Samples of prawns from 2 prawn farms located adjacent to the Logan River and also within the MRA have returned positive test results for WSSV. These farms were at the end of their production cycle and both farms are now destocked. Enhanced biosecurity measures are in place and planning for decontamination of the ponds is underway. This is the 1st detection of WSSV in prawn farms within the MRA since production resumed in 2018 following a WSSV outbreak in 2016. Restrictions on movement of crustaceans, fishing restrictions, biosecurity controls, and surveillance have been in place for the MRA since [16 Mar 2017] following the 1st detections of WSSV in the area in wild crustaceans. WSSV has not been detected in any area of Australia outside of the MRA despite a national surveillance program that has been ongoing for more than 2 years. Basic biosecurity conditions for infection with WSSV were reviewed following the 2016 outbreak in south east Queensland and have been in place continuously.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone; surveillance within infected and/or protection zone; traceability; screening; quarantine; emergency harvest; control of wildlife reservoirs; killing for commercial use or own use; zoning; disinfection; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

["White spot disease is a highly contagious viral infection that affects crustaceans such as prawns, yabbies and crabs. When found in high intensity production areas, such as prawn farms, white spot disease results in the rapid mortality of prawns.

"The virus that causes white spot disease does not pose a risk to food safety or human health, so prawns are safe to eat.

"Prawns may have loose shells, show numerous white spots (0.5-2.0mm in diameter) on the inside surface of the shell, be discolored pink-to-red, have unusual mortality, come to the edge or water surface, demonstrate unusual swimming patterns.

"Other crustaceans (e.g. crabs): can be carriers, may not display any visible signs.

"The white spot disease detected in South East Queensland is not the same disease that can infect ornamental/aquarium fish. White spot in aquarium fish is a parasitic skin infection and not related to white spot disease.

"Distribution,
- widespread throughout prawn farming regions in Asia,
- established in prawns farmed in the Americas where it has caused severe losses on prawn farms,
- Australia has previously remained free of white spot disease.

"The disease was confirmed in 2016 in 7 prawn farms located on the Logan River. This was the 1st confirmed case of white spot disease in Australian prawn farms.

"The virus that causes white spot disease has been found in a number of wild-caught prawns and crabs taken from the Logan River region and Redcliffe Peninsula in Moreton Bay.

"White spot disease has the potential to cause significant financial impact to the farmed prawn industry.

"The farmed prawn industry in Queensland is worth approximately AUD 80 million annually, with strong growth predicted in the coming years. The gross value of prawn production in Australia in 2016-17 was worth AUD 396 million.

"The disease is primarily spread through the movement of infected animals or contaminated water. Birds that feed on and move infected animals can spread the disease. Marine worms have been implicated as potential carriers of the disease overseas, although negative results from extensive testing of worms in Moreton Bay indicates that the risk is extremely low.

"Fin fish are not affected by the disease and are not a carrier of the disease".
