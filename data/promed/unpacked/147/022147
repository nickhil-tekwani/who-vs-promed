Two horses have been euthanased in the Southern Downs after testing positive to Australian bat lyssavirus [ABLV] in what is believed to be a world 1st. APN [Asia-Pacific network] understands that the virus is most likely to have come from microbats in the area. Biosecurity Queensland is putting the property in quarantine. One horse was believed to be euthanized on 11 May 2013 after falling ill, and a 2nd horse was also put down after showing similar symptoms 5 days earlier. There is believed to be 20 other horses on the property who are potentially infected with the deadly virus. The site will remain under quarantine while further testing is conducted on the remaining horses.

Staff from the Darling Downs Hospital and Health Service Public Health Unit will visit this property to assess the situation and identify any human potentially exposed to this horse. The public health staff will interview all people identified as having been in contact with the horse to determine whether any post-exposure treatment is required.

Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said it is important to remember that human cases of ABLV are incredibly rare. "There have only been 3 recorded cases in Australia, all in Queensland, and sadly, all 3 people passed away," Dr Young said. "All 3 cases were the result of direct exposure to bats [harbouring] ABLV. There are no documented cases of transmission of ABLV or rabies from horses to humans. However, the theoretical possibility does exist. We do, however, have a preventative treatment that is effective in any person not displaying symptoms of the virus. Warwick and Toowoomba Hospitals will provide a free course of this preventative treatment [i.e. post rabies prophylaxis] to anyone who public health staff determine was in close contact with this dead horse resulting in a risk of exposure to the virus. Simply patting a horse would not constitute exposure."

People who have had a potential exposure to ABLV require an injection of rabies immunoglobulin and a series of 4 rabies vaccine injections [i.e. standard post rabies exposure prophylaxis]. Any Darling Downs local who believes they have been in direct contact with or in close proximity to this horse can also contact 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) for advice. Staff at 13 HEALTH will help determine whether any further action, including testing or treatment, is required.

ABLV is carried by bats and flying foxes. The horse had 1st been tested for Hendra virus infection, Biosecurity Queensland chief biosecurity officer Dr Jim Thompson said. The horse had tested negative for Hendra virus infection, but further testing returned a positive result for ABLV. "Another horse showing similar symptoms was euthanized at the same property 5 days earlier. There are 20 other horses on the property. The vet involved in both cases received post-exposure prophylaxis and took appropriate precautions. The site will remain under quarantine while further testing is conducted on the remaining horses. ABLV is carried by bats and flying foxes, he said."

In 1996, a new virus was discovered in Australian bats -- identified as a lyssavirus; the new virus is a close relative to the common rabies virus found overseas. In May 1996, a black flying fox showing nervous signs was found near Ballina, NSW. Samples were sent to Yeerongpilly Veterinary Laboratory in Queensland as part of a surveillance program for the Hendra virus. A fixed-tissue brain sample was also sent to CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong. The Hendra virus tests were negative, but the sample tested positive for rabies. Isolation and gene sequencing showed that it was a lyssavirus and is closely related to common rabies. In November 1996, a Queensland woman who had recently become a bat handler became ill. She initially suffered numbness and weakness in her arm which progressed to coma and death. Samples sent to AAHL during this woman's illness confirmed that she had been infected with lyssavirus. In December 1998, a woman from Mackay in North Queensland was also diagnosed with the disease and later died. She had been bitten by a bat more than 2 years earlier, before the infection was 1st identified in humans and before information about vaccination and bat handling precautions were circulated.

ABLV has been isolated, or infection demonstrated, in both insectivorous and fruit bats (flying foxes) from New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. Nonetheless, Australia's rabies-free status has not changed as a result of the Australian bat lyssavirus discovery.

Australian health authorities suggest lyssavirus poses a low public health risk. However, they strongly recommend that anyone scratched or bitten by a bat should immediately wash the affected area with soap and water and contact their local doctor. Research at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the vaccine for classical [canine] rabies can protect against ABLV. A pre-exposure course of rabies vaccine should be taken by high-risk category people such as: bat carers, veterinarians and wildlife officers. There is also a post-exposure treatment course for people bitten or scratched by a bat which is suspected of being infected.

The Commonwealth Department of Health advises that the risk of infection for pets bitten or exposed to a bat is very low. The Department of Health and Ageing also advises that the risk of transmission of ABLV from a dog or cat to a person is very low, although there is theoretical risk of transmission. If your pet has contact with a bat, obtain advice from your state agriculture or health department, or read the information on bat lyssavirus at the links shown to the right under Related Areas.

[This is the 1st report infection of horses by ABLV, presumably as result of exposure to ABLV-infected bats. No information is available regarding the extent of exposure of these horses to bats or the mode of transmission of the virus to horses. It is clear that in Australia, efforts must be increased to reduce the exposure of equines to bats, which in Eastern Australia harbour the highly lethal ABLV and Hendra virus. It is not clear why microbats have been have been picked out as the vectors of the infection in this incident.

The virus _Australian bat lyssavirus_, 1st isolated in 1996, is a rhabdovirus, which is classified now as a species of the genus _Lyssavirus_. It is closely related to rabies virus (the type species of the genus) and has been responsible for fatal rabies-like disease in at least 2 people who had contact with large Australian bats of the flying fox type. ABLV has now been associated with the deaths of 2 horses, but the identity of the bats responsible and the route of infection have yet to be determined. ABLV appears to be distributed along the east coast of Australia and has been isolated directly from 3 of the 4 species of flying foxes. Post-exposure treatment with standard rabies virus vaccine and rabies immune globulin is believed to be protective and should be obligatory following any close contact with any type of Australian bat exhibiting abnormal behaviour. - Mod.CP
