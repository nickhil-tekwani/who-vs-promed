Two barns were placed under quarantine at Los Alamitos Race Course
following the death of 2 horses from equine herpesvirus (EHV-1).
Golden Gate Fields has instituted biosecurity measures for the test barn
and starting gate after a fetus aborted by a mare stabled at the track
tested positive for the disease.
One racehorse and one stable pony died at Los Alamitos from EHV-1, which
can lead to abortions in pregnant mares and horses showing signs of
respiratory problems and high fevers. Laboratory results are pending on
several suspect cases.
Biosecurity procedures are in place for all communal areas at the track,
including the receiving barn, post parade, and starting gate.
The mare at Golden Gate was removed from the track after testing negative
for EHV-1. Five other horses that may have been exposed also tested negative.
The mare was stabled in a relatively isolated area of a barn [whose horses
are] not showing any additional signs of sickness or fever. Temperatures
are being monitored twice daily at the barn, which has not been placed
under quarantine.

Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral disease
(EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe respiratory
infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease, or abortion in
pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The immunity conferred by the
disease or the vaccine are relatively short. Horses on the show or racing
circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months. - Mod.TG]
