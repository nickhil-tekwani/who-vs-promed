The outbreak strain of _Escherichia coli_ O157 that sent 8 children
to hospital suffering from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) earlier in
June 2011 has been found in a sample of "Steak Country chez Lidl"
frozen hamburger patties. The contaminated hamburger carried a "best
if used by" date of 11 May 2012, one of the 3 production dates
recalled by La societe SEB, the manufacturer.

The contaminated sample was retrieved from a patient's house during
the course of the epidemiological investigation into the outbreak,
according to information released by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Nutrition and Fisheries.

Investigators are working to determine the origin of the
contamination, to trace the distribution of the recalled meat, and to
monitor the effectiveness of the recall. Italy's Ministry of Health
reported this morning that no _E. coli_ was found in 8 samples of
Steak Country products seized from a Lidl distribution center in
Arcole (Verona Province).

Of the 8 children who were hospitalized at the CHU de Lille due to
HUS, 6 are still in hospital, one in a coma.

[The VTEC is confirmed to be the most typical O157:H7 strain and a
"smoking" hamburger is reported.

Since most outbreaks of _E. coli_ O157:H7 disease cause no more than
10 per cent of cases to develop HUS, more non-HUS cases should be
present. - Mod.LL
