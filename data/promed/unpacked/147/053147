[Over 10 000 cases in 7 outbreaks makes this the worst avian influenza OIE
outbreak report since September 2004 and leaves me with the impression that
the outbreak will get worse before it gets better. Hopefully, controllable
epidemiological factors can be identified which will allow the eradication
program to gain the upper hand in an outbreak of a potentially zoonotic
animal disease that waxes and wanes, but persists. - Mod.PC]
