[The company] Little Mermaid Smoke House is recalling its Smoked Herring and Pickled Herring because the viscera of the fish were not removed and the products now pose a risk of contamination by _Clostridium botulinum_, according to the FDA.

Botulism bacteria can cause life-threatening illness and consumers are warned not to eat the products even if they don't look or smell spoiled.

The recalled products are manufactured by Little Mermaid Smoke House and were distributed in California. The products are sold as whole fish, packaged in vacuum-sealed packaging, and labeled "Little Mermaid Smoke House." There are no codes listed on the products. The recall includes products sold before 3 Apr 2013.

Botulism causes the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double vision, and trouble speaking or swallowing. Infected individuals may also experience difficulty breathing, abdominal distension, and constipation, according to the FDA. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

No illnesses had been reported.

The sale of uneviscerated fish is prohibited because _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other part of the fish.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

A photo of the recalled products can be seen at the source URL above.

It should be noted that the FDA has just approved the 1st heptavalent equine derived botulinum antiserum for the treatment of botulism disease (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345128.htm). - Mod.LL
