[1. Anthrax]
------------
As background to earlier recording of anthrax in the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Highlands, this is a summary I wrote back in 2003, in:
Hide, R. 2003. Pig Husbandry in New Guinea: A literature review and bibliography. ACIAR Monograph no. 108. Canberra, Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, xvi + 291 p. https://www.aciar.gov.au/node/8381

pp. 141-2
"11.2.2 Anthrax
Following earlier reports of anthrax in New Guinea (Gee 1938; Australian Mobile Veterinary Survey Unit 1946), it was described in 1964 as widespread in the highlands, with a further enzootic area of about 100 square miles [about 260 sq km] in the Lumi area of West Sepik province, and unconfirmed reports from the Ramu River mouth in Madang province (Egerton and Rothwell 1964; Egerton 1965a). Egerton described anthrax as probably the most important bacterial disease of animals in New Guinea. He noted that in enzootic areas there can be either an epizootic form, in which large numbers of pigs die, or individual cases. The epizootic form recurs at 3-5 year intervals, due to the development of herd immunity in a geographical area which lasts for approximately the life of a pig (that is, 3-5 years). Egerton reported that highlanders usually ate pigs which died of anthrax, but that throughout the area, "the infective nature of the disease is recognized and the affected head region is discarded." Skin infection in humans has been diagnosed once in New Guinea, in a laboratory worker. This was presumably Egerton himself (Egerton 2003).

"In 1962-63, 4 cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported in native people in New Guinea" (Egerton 1965b:143), but not confirmed bacteriologically. See also Watt et al. (1975:68) and Nelson (1982a).

During the 1960s there was a campaign to vaccinate pigs (in the highlands at least) against anthrax. In 1963-64 some 1531 pigs were vaccinated; in 1964-65 this rose to over 27 000, and in 1966 the target was 50 000 (Harvey 1966:67).

Outbreaks or epidemics of anthrax and their effects on local pig herds have been widely reported by anthropologists and others in PNG:
- in the Enga province in 1943-44 (Meggitt 1958a:288; 1974b:19);
- in the Southern Highlands around Tari in the early 1940s (Frankel 1986:26);
- later both on the Nembi Plateau in 1980 (Crittenden 1982:275) and in the Lake Kutubu area (Weiner 1988:32-4);
- in the Karimui area of south Simbu province in 1982 (Hide et al. 1984:226);
- elsewhere in Simbu at various times (Hide 1981:163, 483; Schaefer 1991:120);
- at Oksapmin in West Sepik province between 1974 and 1979 (Cape 1981);
- at Bundi in the Madang province in 1988 (Caven and Gitai 1990a:22);
- in the Eastern Highlands province, in the Arona Valley in 1948 (Du Toit 1975:97), around Lufa between 1948 and 1960 (Glick 1963:14), and in the Fore area in 1962 (Lindenbaum 1979:130).

The only account from the lowlands is that from the Lumi area in West Sepik province in 1968 (Lewis 1975:81-82).

In Irian Jaya [currently, Indonesia's West Papua province] there were several outbreaks of suspected anthrax after 1956 in local pig populations but, despite the pigs displaying the clinical signs of anthrax, there was no confirmatory laboratory data. The disease reappeared between April 1983 and mid-1984 in the Paniai area, and 3484 pigs, as well as 49 people who had consumed the affected animals, died (Ronohardjo et al. 1984:238). Laboratory studies showed that anthrax was responsible. However, it has also been suggested that the human mortality may have been due to _Clostridium perfringens_ (Moekti et al. 1985)."

[We are grateful to Dr Hide for the above historical data on anthrax in PNG and for the Nipah virus references. His comprehensive literature review and bibliography "Pig husbandry in New Guinea" (freely available at https://www.aciar.gov.au/node/8381) includes the chapters "11. Pig diseases" (p. 139-148), and "12. The part played by pigs in human disease" (p. 149-157).

Dr Hide also correctly remarked that the name of the event's location, Nipa, PNG, has nothing to do with the Nipah virus, named after a village in Malaysia. ProMED regrets any confusion, in case caused by the implied resemblance between the 2.

ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr David Thomson, long and closely acquainted with the animal health situation in PNG, for sharing, in response to our RFI, his comments about the reported undiagnosed mass mortality of pigs in the Southern Highlands, as follows:

"Whilst the jury is still very much out regarding the cause of the reported pig mortalities, the following background may be of interest.

"Areas within the Southern Highlands of PNG (and elsewhere) have historically been reported to be affected by sporadic cases and episodic outbreaks of what is believed to be anthrax during the colonial era (pre mid 1970's) and since. _Streptococcus suis_ may also occur, but there is a dearth of definitive diagnostic evidence for or against occurrence in sporadic or outbreak form.

"The limitations of available in-country laboratory systems, difficulties caring for specimens during transportation from the field to labs (in PNG and regional reference labs), and frequently delayed reporting of outbreaks have, however, usually meant definitive diagnoses of the causes of respective reported events have been lacking.

"The PNG version of 'anthrax' appears to be interesting and warrants further focused study. Australian colonial administration personnel in the 1960's diagnosed 'anthrax' (from memory Australian Army Medical Corp with some involvement of CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation], based upon then bacteriological characterization parameters). The strain, however, was uncharacteristically dubbed 'unique' and 'pig adapted' because there was (and has since been) no reports of cases or outbreaks amongst herbivorous ruminants and few, if any, credible reports (based on definitive diagnoses) of either cutaneous or gastrointestinal anthrax in people. Pigs are generally more resistant to classical anthrax than ruminants.

"If the PNG anthrax was of classical type, however, sporadic human cases could be anticipated, because informal killing and human consumption of ill animals to salvage them does occur at remote community level.

"We are reliably informed that an animal health team has been dispatched this weekend [20-21 Apr 2019] to investigate the reported mass mortality event."

Dr Thomson's invaluable observations and insight are much appreciated. - Mod.AS
