Dr Mike Kock <kock@info.bw> - one of my colleagues who specialises in the
epidemiology of conditions affecting wildlife - has asked me to submit the
following message.
MORTALITY IN GIRAFFE IN MAKOLODI NATURE RESERVE NEAR GABORONE, BOTSWANA
Information on Reserve: 5500ha nature reserve established early 1990, 15km
south east of Gaborone, capital of Botswana. Reserve is composed of mixed
savannah woodland typical of hardveld with Acacia, Tambuti, Combretum and
Terminalia. Central valley bounded by mountains/hills on either side. Water
in 2 dams with river course (dry unless it rains) in valley. Other species
present include white rhino, eland, impala, blue wildebeest, red
hartebeest, gemsbok, leopard, brown hyaena , jackal etc. Reserve functions
as a wildlife park and education centre.
History of giraffe mortalities: giraffe introduced to reserve early 1990's.
Mixed group of 6 with population at 13 in 1997. First mortality recorded in
an adult female in October. Carcass only discovered after decomposition.
Second death in an adult female in November, again carcass old but foetus
present in birth canal. Third death in an adult male in December but bull
found alive in lateral recumbency. Evidence of struggling with ground
flattened and disturbed. This has been a feature of all the giraffe deaths.
Bull was treated by veterinarian who noted that animal could move tongue,
was licking a lot. Treatment not successful and animal died. Thorough post
mortem performed, grossly nothing found. Blood collected. Apart from
evidence of anaemia all diagnostic tests have so far proved negative
including histopathology. Fourth death occurred in December, sub-adult
female, too autolysed to be able to determine cause of death. Wildebeest
carcass found nearby?
Group of female giraffe were observed close up in December (prior to 4th
death) and all appeared in good health and were alert. Tick burden appeared
minimal. Initial recommendations to manager of reserve have been: collect
any concentrations of bones, check any waterholes/dams for dead animals,
continue monitoring.
Possible Differential Diagnoses of Cause of Deaths: 1. Possible trauma (?)-
poached, slipped, fighting, lightening strike; 2. Disease agents -
botulism, anthrax (negative on PM), other (?); 3. Toxin of plant origin:
susceptibility of giraffe to plant chemical defences (?), other poisonous
plants.
Anyone out there with similar experiences? Ideas? Recommendations? Please
send information directly to: kock@info.bw
