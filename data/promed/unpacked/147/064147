The Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] is investigating a letter addressed to President Obama that may contain the poisonous substance ricin.

A spokeswoman in the FBI's Washington Field Office said that the Secret Service intercepted a "suspicious letter" at a White House mail facility on Thursday morning (30 May 2013). The FBI is investigating the letter and does not yet know whether the letter tested positive or negative for ricin.

The Secret Service confirms that the letter appears similar to a ricin-laced letter addressed to New York mayor Michael R Bloomberg (I). It's not yet clear whether the incidents are related.

"US Secret Service can confirm that the White House mail screening facility intercepted a letter addressed to the White House that [was] similar to letters previously addressed to Mayor Bloomberg in New York," the Secret Service said in a statement. "This letter has been turned over to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force for testing and investigation."

On [Wed 29 May 2013], authorities intercepted ricin-laced letters sent to both Bloomberg and a gun-control group he founded called Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has been prominent in the recent push for stricter gun laws.

The news comes 6 weeks after ricin-laced letters were sent to Obama, senator Roger Wicker (Republican-Mississippi) and a Mississippi judge in the days after the Boston Marathon bombings. Police arrested a man who was later released, then arrested James Everett Dutschke of Mississippi.

Police in Washington state last week [week of 20 May 2013] also arrested a man in connection with a death threat to a judge and 2 ricin-laced letters sent earlier this month (May 2013).

A letter that was addressed to New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has tested positive for ricin.

The Wall Street Journal has confirmed the news with the NYPD. Bloomberg never personally received the poison letter.

Another letter that also tested positive for the substance was reportedly sent to a Washington, DC building that houses Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg helps run.

The contents of the letter reportedly threatened Bloomberg and referenced the debate on gun laws, according to a local ABC news station.

The letters apparently came from Shreveport, Louisiana, according to a statement on the American Postal Workers Union website.

Authorities are now "in the process of searching to determine if there may be additional letters," according to the statement.

The FBI is investigating the threats.

Last month [April 2013], letters sent to president Barack Obama and an office of Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) tested positive for ricin.

The man accused of sending letters with the poison ricin to a Spokane [Washington state] post office was in federal court Tuesday [28 May 2013] for a bail hearing. The lawyer for 37 year old Matthew Buquet of Spokane said he waived that right and will remain in custody without bail while the case continues.

KXLY reports (http://is.gd/OVxedc) Buquet was joking with his lawyer in the courtroom. He told the judge he understood the proceeding. Buquet is charged with mailing threatening communication. Officials say it was a crude form of the poison and no one was hurt [14 May 2103] when postal workers intercepted 2 letters sent to the downtown post office and federal courthouse in Spokane.

It appears that ricin is the bio-weapon flavor of the month. This seems to be a rash of copy-cat style mailings.
