Between early May [2014] and [1 Jun 2014], 3 members of the same family, residents of El Bolson, died from a respiratory insufficiency syndrome and other symptoms compatible with [a] hantavirus [infection], and at least in 2 cases the initial diagnosis was confirmed.

The Director of the Bariloche Area Hospital, Diego Comay, confirmed to "De Bariloche" that a 72-year-old man, sent to the El Bolson hospital with presumptive symptoms of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome, HPS], died this Sunday [1 Jun 2014].

The physician explained that this was a case of "presumptive diagnosis, co-exposed" while living with his brother who presented with the same symptoms and went to "Ramon Carrillo" [Hospital] where he died on 15 May [2014] from the virus [infection]; the diagnosis [HPS] was confirmed by the Malbran Institute.

The 2 men lived in the same rural house, outside of El Bolson. Comay stated that the epidemiological follow up is being done with the family and the group at risk, although up until now blood samples have not been taken because they are in the "window [incubation?] period", in which studies do not provide reliable diagnoses.

A 3rd member of the family, a 35-year-old man, died on 3 May [2014] also from HPS confirmed by the Malbran Institute. He worked in a rural area in Cholila, in a cattle ranch in Paraje El Blanco and never indicated where he contracted the disease.

Physicians have not discarded possible person-to-person contagion, despite the fact that WHO states that human [source] hantavirus infections are rare.

[A cluster of 3 cases of HPS, 2 of them fatal, is unusual. Although the specific hantavirus involved in these cases of HPS in this Andean foothill region is not specified, it most likely is Andes virus. Andes virus is the only hantavirus shown thus far to be transmitted directly from person to person, but only rarely, and among individuals in very close contact, as may have been the situation with the 2 brothers above. Most infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_ can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio/oligoryzomys_longicaudatus.jpg.
