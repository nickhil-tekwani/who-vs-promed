Two cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever confirmed
------------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail has heard from a usually reliable source that an on-going
surveillance operation of an outbreak of an acute hemorrhagic fever
syndrome by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and a European Institute of Tropical Medicine has identified 2 suspect and
2 retrospective cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever from the Watsa area.
Laboratory testing at the National Institute of Virology in South Africa
has confirmed one acute and one convalescent case. No other epidemiological
information is available at this time.

[The identification of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in the Watsa region again
increases the likelihood that Marburg virus caused the hemorrhagic illness
that killed a returning Zimbabwe soldier [see ProMED-mail 19 Mar 2002:
Viral hemorrhagic fever, susp - Zimbabwe ex Congo DR (20020319.3772). More
information about the Watsa outbreak, and results of the tests that
followed the hemorrhagic fever death of the Zimbabwe soldier would be very
much appreciated. - Mod.MPP
