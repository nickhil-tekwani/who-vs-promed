More than 300 army recruits have been treated for gastric flu at training
centres in Surrey and Hampshire. The Army Training regiments sites at Sir
John Moore Barracks in Winchester and Pirbright, near Woking, have seen 303
cases of the bug since last week.
Ninety recruits at Pirbright and 20 at Winchester have a severe form of
gastroenteritis and are in medical blocks with vomiting and diarrhoea. The
rest have a mild form of the virus, a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said.
A handful needed hospital treatment but have now been released.
Officials from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) went to the barracks last
week to take swabs. "We still do not know what it is. It is a flu-like
virus," the spokeswoman said. "We thought we would have the results last
Friday [26 Jan 2007] but they have not come as yet." She said that nearly
all those affected are basic training recruits, with a few instructors also
taken ill.
The infection was first discovered in Pirbright and spread to Winchester
after recruits from both camps exercised together last week. The virus
appears to have a 10-day incubation period. Many blocks of accommodation at
both camps are now in quarantine and are undergoing a deep clean.
An HPA spokeswoman said the Army had the outbreak under control. Currently
871 recruits are undergoing basic training at Pirbright and 395 at Winchester.

[The predominant symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) and the circumstances
(congregation in restricted accommodation of individuals from diverse
backgrounds) would be consistent with an outbreak of norovirus infection.
However, the failure to establish a firm diagnosis is strange and may
indicate that more than a single agent is responsible for the outbreak.
Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
