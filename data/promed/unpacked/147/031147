The Minister of health, Professor Dorothee Kinde Gazard, officially announced the end of the Lassa fever outbreak in Benin during a press conference held on 8 Jan 2015.

After cases of Lassa fever were reported in the health center of Tanguieta-Materi-Cobly in the north of Benin [Atakora Department], the Government, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF), Plan Benin and the partners of development immediately started a response against the outbreak. "Between 15 Oct-24 Nov 2014, 16 cases were recorded including 9 deaths. Of these 9 deaths, Lassa fever was confirmed in 2 of the 4 fatal cases among healthcare givers," the Minister of Health said in her official statement.

The representative of Benin, Dr. Youssouf Gamatie, said that "the presence in Benin of a multidisciplinary mission composed of competent experts to review the response plan of Benin to fight the virus helped to get rid of the outbreak fairly quickly."

The response was articulated around support for the sick, the active search for new cases in the community, the search for persons having been in contact with patients and the prevention among the population. After suspected cases were reported, samples were taken and sent to reference laboratories. "These tests carried out in laboratories in Lagos and Hamburg confirmed the virus in 2 patients who died and confirmed the diagnosis of a recent virus infection of Lassa fever in 2 survivors at the CDC in Atlanta," said Professor Dorothee Kinde Gazard.

The representative of UNICEF in Benin, Dr. Anne Vincent, welcomed the effective coordination for the control of the outbreak and asked that preventive measures such as washing hands and seeking a physician right away in case of fever should be continued.

The national team supported by the development partners has put in place a comprehensive response to fight the outbreak including:

- National and local coordination for research and monitoring of contact cases and identification of suspected cases;
- Implementation of a centre for treatment and a unit of isolation at the hospital in Tanguieta;
- Supply of drugs (Ribavirin) to the treatment centres;
- Supply health centres with personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care staff, thermometers, medical and laboratory supplies and products of decontamination;
- Training of health care personnel at the Tanguieta hospital and health care workers in Cobly on the treatment and prevention of disease;
- Awareness of Lassa fever through the local media, canvassing by community leaders and volunteers in Tanguieta, Cobly and Materi.

"The arrival of Lassa fever in Benin showed once again that during an outbreak crisis, joint and rapid action by the Ministry of health and partners of development is a necessity. It is also important to note that despite the end of the outbreak we should not let our guard down. The population and health care workers should continue to observe basic hygiene measures," urged Rheal Drisdelle, the Resident Representative of Plan Benin.

The Minister of health, Professor Dorothee Kinde Gazard, said that 230 people who had been in contact with registered patients were monitored for 21 days. "None of them have developed symptoms meeting the definition of suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever. Moreover, monitoring was continued in accordance with the recommendations of WHO for 42 days after the last case recorded on 24 Nov 2014. No new cases of Lassa fever have been recorded," concluded the Minister of health.

The end of the outbreak was officially notified in accordance with the international health regulations, which recommends the observance of a period of twice 21 days without the registration of new cases.

[This is now the 3rd report of Lassa fever that ProMED-mail has posted for Benin for the current outbreak. The number of reported cases has increased from 2 confirmed fatal cases on 21 Nov 2014 to 15 cases (9 of which were fatal) reported on 26 Nov 2014. Fortunately, there has been just one additional case since then. The occurrence of Lassa fever virus infection in Benin is not surprising. Benin adjoins Nigeria in West Africa and Lassa fever virus is endemic in that country where it is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states there. It is safe to assume that Lassa fever virus is also endemic in Benin. The above report provides a good example of timely diagnosis followed by a surveillance response to reduce risk of exposure to the virus. However, because the virus is doubtless endemic in the local rodent populations in Benin, continued surveillance and public education will be essential to detect cases quickly and prevent additional ones.

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Because elimination of these rodents is not possible currently, reduction of risk of human infections can be accomplished, but eradication of the virus in these endemic areas cannot.
