YELLOW MOTTLE AND BLAST DISEASES, RICE - UGANDA

Dr Dennis Kyetere, the head of the Ugandan National Agricultural
Research Organisation (NARO), was speaking at the inaugural meeting
of the Rice Breeders Network in Kampala recently. Researchers and
seed companies from over 10 African countries attended. The meeting
highlighted efforts to develop and release improved disease-resistant
rice varieties and overcome the barriers that prevent new varieties
from reaching farmers to improve food security.

The meeting also addressed efforts to tackle diseases such as rice
yellow mottle and rice blast that are devastating farmers in several
regions. In Kenya recently, rice farmers lost up to half of this
season's crop.

Meanwhile, Tanzania breeder Dr Nkonki Kibanda reported that the
country's Department of Agricultural Services had identified local
varieties resistant to rice yellow mottle virus, which can decimate
90 percent of the rice yield. Kibanda expects new disease-resistant
versions of farmers' favourite variety, Supa, to be available by 2009.

[Yellow mottle
--------------
This disease is caused by _Rice yellow mottle virus_ (RYMV, genus
_Sobemovirus_, not yet assigned to family or order) and was
originally confined to one district of Kenya. However, large-scale
rice irrigation projects lead to build up and wide dissemination of
the virus and its vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. It is now the most
serious pathogen of irrigated and lowland rainfed rice in West and
Central Africa, and losses of up to 100 percent have been reported.
In Uganda, RYMV-like symptoms were first observed in 2000 and
presence of the virus was confirmed in 2006. From the report above,
it appears to be spreading in this country.

Besides rice, the virus also affects a number of other grass species.
Symptoms include stunting, reduced tillering, mottling and yellowish
streaking of the leaves, delayed flowering or incomplete emergence of
the panicles and, in extreme cases, death of plants. RYMV is spread
by a number of insect vectors, mainly by several species of beetles
(for example _Chaetocnema pulla_). It does not appear to be seed
transmitted in rice, but it can be spread by mechanical means, which
is thought to account for much of its spread in the field. For
example, a severe increase of RYMV incidence was noted in areas that
switched rice cultivation methods from direct seeding to
transplanting of seedlings. The virus survives in crop residues, and
volunteer rice and grassy weeds serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease
management includes cultural practices as well as control of vectors
and reservoir hosts.

RYMV is highly variable, and different strains may have different
levels of virulence. Isolates originating in closely related
agro-ecological zones show variability in the coat protein.
Consequently, specific resistance breeding programmes need to be
carried out in different areas for local virus strains and local rice
varieties. Therefore the resistant varieties reported above to be
available for Tanzania may not be suitable for Uganda.

Blast disease
-------------
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_. It is one of
the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide with reported losses
of more than 50 percent in infected fields. Symptoms include lesions
on all parts of the shoot, stem rot, and panicle blight. When nodes
are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield
losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering
stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of
grasses and sedges can be affected by different strains of the
fungus, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited
number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris,
mechanical means, water, and wind. Disease management may include
fungicides and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant
varieties. The fungus is highly variable, however, and new strains
are emerging, breaking down host resistance.

The report above refers to the serious outbreak of rice blast, which
is currently being reported from Kenya (see previous ProMED-mail
posts 20080402.1211 and 20080421.1413). A loss of 10 to 20 percent of
the annual national rice crop is estimated as a result of this
outbreak, which has been attributed largely to heavy rains, poor
cultural practices, and infected rice seed.
