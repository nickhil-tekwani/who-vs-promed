Indiana: Task Force of Veterinarians Trying to Uncover Problem
--------------------------------------------------------------
A task force of veterinarians was in Daviess County today, at the request of
Gov. Frank O'Bannon, to figure out why such a large number of horses have
contracted West Nile virus. To date, all 6 Daviess County horses tested at
animal health laboratories have been positive for the virus. So far, all of
the horses have been in the Amish community in the
Odon-Montgomery-Cannellburg area. Brent Marsh, Indiana state veterinarian,
recommended everyone taking the recommended precautions: vaccinate your
horses, eliminate all standing water, wear protective clothing and use
mosquito repellent with DEET.
Odon veterinarian John Royal told The Daily Citizen this morning that
between 35 and 50 horses "have either died or been euthanized, but we don't
know about all of them, some of the owners put them down themselves." Royal
estimates that about 250, minimum, are infected with West Nile virus, all in
the Amish community. Royal believes the virus, which is spread by
mosquitoes, is so widespread in that area because "Amish typically do not
vaccinate (against diseases) ... and a lot of them didn't know about West
Nile virus infection." Royal has given about 3000 vaccinations against West
Nile virus in the last month. The vaccine must be given in muscle, and must
be followed up by a second shot between 3 and 6 weeks after the first. The
horse is not fully protected from the virus until it has had the second
shot. The disease is striking colts as young as 3 months, Royal noted, but
is harder, sometimes fatal, to older horses. Not all horses that contract
West Nile virus die.

Indiana: Task Force Seeks Answers to West Nile Virus Cluster in Daviess
County
------------------------------------------------------
On Thu 22 Aug 2002, Dr. Bret Marsh with the Indiana State Department of
Health, said local veterinarians are now seeing the illness in horses
outside the Amish community. Indiana has a horse population estimated at 160
000, and Daviess County is ranked fifth in equine population with an
estimated population of around 5000.
Lab results have confirmed that West Nile virus has killed about 50 horses
locally last
month. Dr. Marsh said about 200 horses have been reported ill in Daviess
County and
a fourth of them have died. "Our tests are new and the results are slow,"
Dr. Marsh said of labs being swamped with samples of tissue and blood. Dr.
Duane Murphy, who works at the Dubois County diagnostic lab, said some of
the lesions being seen in horse autopsies indicate all the dead horses may
not have died from the West Nile virus. Confirmation must come from labs in
Iowa and New York.

Indiana: West Nile spreads in Amish area
----------------------------------------
State health officials confirmed this week that 2 of the dead horses had
West Nile virus infections. That brings the statewide total to 8, said
Denise Derrer, spokeswoman for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. The
other 6 are in Daviess County, a heavily Amish area in southwestern Indiana.
Millersburg and its surrounding area have a large Amish population, which
generally shuns motorized vehicles. Losing horses could be a big problem.
The animals pull plows on Amish farms and buggies on local roads, although
Amish people also ride bicycles or are passengers in cars.
A team of state veterinarians will travel today to Daviess County, which has
had 225 horses show signs of the illness.

Indiana: BOAH Update of Equine Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
As of 26 Aug 2002, 12 more horses have tested positive for the West Nile
virus in Daviess County, Indiana. This brings the statewide total of
confirmed cases in equine to 20. The distribution of cases to date is as
follows: 18 positive equine in Daviess County; 2 positive equine in Elkhart
County.
Other cases from throughout the state are still pending; exactly how many is
not known. Veterinary practitioners may choose to send test samples to a
number of laboratories nationwide. They are not obligated to report sample
submissions to the Indiana State Board of Animal Health. Therefore, until a
test result is known and reported by the lab, state animal health officials
cannot maintain a current count of pending tests. Updates to the number of
confirmed positives will be reported as appropriate.
Horses with confirmed exposure to the West Nile virus do not always die;
many recover. As dead-end hosts, recovered horses pose no threat of exposing
humans or other animals. West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes, which pick
up the disease-causing organisms from infected birds.

West Nile Virus Infection Affecting Birds of Prey
-------------------------------------------------------
Wildlife officials say they cannot conclusively blame the virus for the wave
of mortality, but of the 8 birds of prey that Ohio state health officials
tested last week, 7 were positive for the virus. Ohio is the only state to
report such a cluster of dead birds, although Michigan & Indiana late last
week also reported small numbers of stricken raptors, said Kathryn Converse,
wildlife disease specialist with the U.S. Geological Survey. "We can't say
what's happening to owls will happen to eagles," Converse said. "There may
be different levels of susceptibility in different bird species." What has
wildlife officials so worried is that the virus has been established in New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and other eastern states for more than 2
years without killing raptors in such numbers, raising the question of
whether the virus is mutating.
The Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.,
examined 2 great horned owls from Ohio on Friday. Results are not due until
next week. Federal officials have also gotten reports of a dead bald eagle
from North Dakota and 2 dead golden eagles in Missouri. All 3 were in
captivity. At the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village, bird
handlers on 15 Aug 2002 checked all 22 captive birds on display there, and
every one was healthy and hardy. The next day, a great horned owl started
getting sick. By 17 Aug 2002, it was convulsing and refusing to eat. On
Thursday, the center had it euthanized. On Friday, the center put down a
red-tailed hawk. The center also treats wild birds stricken by illness or
injury, and over the last few weeks it has been getting birds daily,
including about a half-dozen great horned owls last week, Newkirk said.
The inundation of sick or starved-looking birds of prey is extraordinary,
she said Friday, because prey is so plentiful in the summer that she usually
gets no calls about emaciated birds. But on 10 Aug 2002, she took in 2 great
horned owls; within 2 days, the birds were showing severe neurological
problems. "In the last 10 days, I've gotten more than a dozen calls -- great
horned owls and red-tailed hawks -- and you usually get only one injured owl
a month," MacGillis said. 2 of her own birds -- an arctic snowy owl and a
merlin falcon -- have keeled over since 16 Aug 2002, she said.
As raptors die, Newkirk, too, fears what is in store for eagles and ospreys,
and the peregrine falcons that have virtually become the adopted children of
Cleveland, Akron and other cities where the birds nest in high-rises.

Statement from Back To the Wild Rehab Center
-------------------------------------------
This is an update on a wildlife crisis in Ohio hitting rehabilitation
centers and zoos hard. It is statewide. In just 2 weeks, almost every center
in Ohio has experienced unheard of admissions of Great Horned Owls daily
from the wild; plus Red-tails, Coopers and other raptor species. Most are
Great Horned Owls and most all have head tremors and some with paralysis of
the legs. Many are dying quickly, within 48 hours, though a few seem to be
recovering. Most are found standing or laying on the ground, unaware of
their surroundings and allow you to just pick them up. A few are recovering.
Most centers have lost Education Birds that have been at our centers for 10
or more years. They die overnight, without warning. Rehabbers are
devastated. I have lost 4 caged birds here, and fear for the Bald Eagles and
other raptors at our center.
Another rehab program lost their Snowy Owl and Merlin and most centers have
lost Barreds, Great Horneds, Red-tails and Kestrels. Several Falconers have
lost Gyrfalcons. One center sent in 2 Great Horned Owls and 1 Red-tail and
all 3 tested positive for West Nile [virus].
The advice from Federal and State agencies is to put mosquito netting over
all our cages! Absolutely impossible! Some of the cages are over 60 to 100
feet long and 16 feet high. How can you mosquito proof that?!

<http://ohiodnr.com/news/aug02/0823sickbirds.htm>

Between 100 and 150 sick and dying raptors, mostly owls and hawks, have been
reported statewide within the past several days. Initial testing has been
completed on several of the birds and some have tested positive for West
Nile virus. The National Wildlife Center in Madison, Wisconsin is currently
testing some of the birds to determine the actual cause of death. Many
species of birds can carry West Nile virus without showing any symptoms, and
West Nile virus is not necessarily fatal to all birds.
According to the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), people cannot contract
West Nile virus from birds. The disease can only be transmitted to humans
through the bite of an infected mosquito. "But, at this point, we don't know
what is killing the birds, and
that's another reason for people to not handle them," said ODH.
Anyone finding a sick or dead raptor can report the discovery to a local
raptor rehabilitation center or through the ODNR web site at .
[But] the ODNR Division of Wildlife indicated there is no need for
additional collection of dead or dying hawks and owls, enough of the birds
have been collected to allow for accurate testing. The agency will
distribute further information when testing has been completed. Test results
from Wisconsin are expected within the next several days. ODH recommends
that dead birds should only be handled with rubber gloves.

New Hampshire: 26 Birds Reported West Nile Virus-positive
------------------------------------------------------------------
State health officials announce that West Nile virus has been found in 2
towns that have not previously submitted birds infected with the disease. A
Cooper's Hawk from the town of Northwood -- in the area of Jenness pond --
and a blue-jay from the town of Surry in the southwestern area of the state
were both collected on Fri 23 Aug 2002 and submitted to the Public Health
Laboratories for testing. "We have found evidence of the virus in 24 birds
so far this season," says Dr. Jose Montero, chief of the Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control. "What is notable, however, is that the
blue-jay from Surry is the westernmost confirmation of West Nile Virus in
our state."
In New Hampshire, birds testing positive for the disease have been received
from the communities of Bow, Concord, Goffstown, Hudson, Kingston, Laconia,
Manchester, Milford, and Nashua. A total of 261 birds have been submitted
and tested at the Public Health Laboratories since 28 May 2002. Of those, 24
have tested positive for West Nile Virus. The virus has not yet been
detected in humans or in other animals in New Hampshire.

West Nile virus Latest News - As of Tue 27 Aug 2002
---------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has passed the 108th meridian on its trek west, now detected
as far west as Shepherd in Yellowstone County, Montana. Thus far in 2002,
West Nile virus has been detected in birds, mosquitoes, humans, horses
and/or other mammals in at least 41 states
and Washington DC in the US; as well as in Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and
Saskatchewan provinces in Canada; and in people and mosquitoes in Israel. It
has been most recently reported for the first time from New Mexico and
Montana (22 Aug 2002), Colorado & Wyoming (16 Aug 2002), South Carolina (13
Aug 2002), and from Vermont, for the first time since 2000 (6 Aug 2002).
Its range has expanded in each of the 4 years since the initial North
American outbreak in 1999, and has expanded considerably in 2002; now
detected in 13 states where it had not previously been seen (Colorado,
Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming). In the
Continental US only the 7 westernmost states have not reported the presence
of West Nile virus.

(1) West Nile Virus Activity; United States, Wed 21 to Tue 27 Aug 2002
------------------------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET and by states and other jurisdictions as of 7:30 a.m.
Mountain Daylight Time, Wed 28 Aug 2002, and highlights WNV activity in
Illinois.
During the reporting period of 21 to 28 Aug 2002, WNV infections were
reported in 674 dead crows, 305 other dead birds, 581 horses, and 386
mosquito pools. During this period, WNV activity was reported for the first
time ever in Montana and New Mexico.
In addition, during 2002, 2590 dead crows and 1872 other dead birds with WNV
infection were reported from 41 states, New York City, and the District of
Columbia; 837 WNV infections in mammals (all but one in horses) have been
reported from 25 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia,
Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming).
During 2002, WNV seroconversions have been reported in 96 sentinel chicken
flocks from Florida, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and New York City; 1491
WNV-positive mosquito pools have been reported from 18 states (Alabama,
Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Virginia), New York City, and the
District of Columbia.
[It is interesting that sentinel chickens, that seem to have mainly failed
to detect WNV in previous years, are apparently being more effective this
time around. I wonder what has changed? - Mod.JW]

(2) Illinois: 1 Jan to Tue 27 Aug 2002
----------------------------------
In 2002, of the 102 counties of Illinois, 92 (90 %) have reported WNV
activity (positive animal, mosquito, or human cases). Of the 709 crows and
blue jays tested, 439 (62%) have tested positive for WNV by the
immunohistochemistry test; the first bird tested positive on 15 May 2002. 62
horses have tested laboratory positive. These horses had
specimens collected during the period 19 Jul - 23 Aug 2002 from 18 counties.
Mosquito pools began testing positive on 11 Jul 2002, and 236 mosquito pools
have been reported to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) as
positive through 16 Aug 2002.
Additional information about WNV activity is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and
