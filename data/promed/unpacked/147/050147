Jaundice has broken out in epidemic form in Khanpur town of Rajasthan's
Jhalawar district with at least 285 people taken ill, it was officially
stated today. The state government has deputed an action team, comprising
experts from the medical and health department and personnel of the public
health and engineering department, (Phed) to the town to ensure remedial
measures, an official release said, reports PTI.
The first case of jaundice was reported on 6 Mar 1999 and the figure swelled
to 285 by 25 Mar 1999, Jhalawar district collector Ravi Shankar was quoted
in
the release as having said. "The reason of this disease spread is
attributed to mainly stagnation of water, open drainage and accumulation of
filth during the annual month-long Bengalibaba fair which commenced in the
town from January 14," he said. An unusual four inches of rainfall in
February further aggravated the hazards in the town, the release said.
