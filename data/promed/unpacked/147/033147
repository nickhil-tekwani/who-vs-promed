SARS-CoV-2 in animals, Hong Kong
--------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 17 Jan 2022
Date of confirmation of the event: 18 Jan 2022
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2
Morbidity: 0.86%
Mortality: -
Zoonotic potential: yes
Zoonotic potential description: based on the current epidemiological findings, there is suspicion of animal-to-human transmission.
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location 1: Causeway Bay, Wan Chai
Started: 17 Jan 2022
Ended: 18 Jan 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cricetidae (unidentified) (Cricetidae (incognita)): Cricetidae-Rodentia / 69 / 7 / 0 / 69 / 0 / 0

Affected population description: A staff member of this pet shop was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 17 Jan 2022. Subsequently, samples from 50 hamsters were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing and the virus was detected in oral and faecal samples from 7 hamsters with no observable clinical signs in this pet shop; other small mammals in the pet shop including rabbits and chinchillas were tested to be negative. To minimize the potential risks of COVID-19 infection and safeguard public safety, all 97 animals in the shop were humanely dispatched on 18 Jan 2022.

Outbreak location 2: Tai po, Tai po
Started: 17 Jan 2022
Ended: 19 Jan 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cricetidae (unidentified) (Cricetidae (incognita)): Cricetidae-Rodentia / 863 / 1 / - / 863 / 0 / 0

Affected population description: This warehouse stores small mammals and supplies to 35 pet shops selling hamsters in Hong Kong including the pet shop in Causeway Bay where a staff member had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples from 79 hamsters were collected and oral sample from one hamster in the warehouse was tested SARS-CoV-2 positive; samples from other small mammals including mice, rabbits and guinea pigs were tested negative. Among the 863 hamsters in the warehouse, 4 were found dead and 2 were found to be weak; others had no observable clinical signs. It is uncertain whether this has any relation to the virus. To minimize the potential risks of COVID-19 infection and safeguard public safety, all 1116 animals in the warehouse were humanely dispatched.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple hamsters and/or environmental swabs from a pet shop and its warehouse. The samples were collected because a staff member at the pet shop (who had not been to the warehouse) was tested positive for COVID-19 and was found to be infected with a delta strain of virus that has never been detected in Hong Kong. All animals (small mammals -- hamsters, mice, guinea pigs, chinchillas, rabbits) in the pet shop and warehouse were humanely dispatched to minimize the potential risks of COVID-19 infection and safeguard public safety. Hamsters from all pet shops in Hong Kong will also be taken for testing and humane dispatch, and the other animals of these pet shops will also undergo testing. Business is suspended until there is satisfactory results. Import of small mammals has also been suspended. As the hamsters from the index pet shop were imported from Europe with the last 2 consignments arriving on 22 Dec 2021 and 7 Jan 2022, members of the public are also urged to surrender their hamsters purchased from local pet shops after 22 Dec 2021 to the government for testing and humane dispatch. Further testing and epidemiological investigation are continuing. Members of public and the veterinary community will be kept abreast of the development via government announcements.

Control measures at event level
Wild control measures applied: official destruction of animal products, movement control inside the country, screening, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, traceability, disinfection, stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test result date / Result
School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong (local laboratory) / Cricetidae (unidentified) / 2 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 18-20 Jan 2022 / positive
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (national laboratory) / Cricetidae (unidentified) / 2 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 19-20 Jan 2022 / positive

[According to the information provided in the current OIE report, the zoonotic potential is described thus: "Based on the current epidemiological findings, there is suspicion of animal-to-human transmission." The epidemiological comment says: "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple hamsters and/or environmental swabs from a pet shop and its warehouse. The samples were collected because a staff member at the pet shop (who had not been to the warehouse) was tested positive for COVID-19 and was found to be infected with a delta strain of virus that has never been detected in Hong Kong."

As mentioned before, "the current COVID-19 pandemic is being sustained through human-to-human transmission. Several animal species have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with infection being introduced to a population as a result of close contact with humans or animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 or in experimental infection studies performed in laboratory settings. The list of animal species for which information on natural or experimental infection is available is presented in Table 1" (of the OIE Technical Factsheet Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Animals; link available below).

In laboratory experiments, Syrian hamsters (_Mesocricetus auratus_) have been shown to be highly susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, though, depending on age, show either no or only mild clinical signs. Such experiments have also shown hamsters-to-hamster transmission.

"Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by SARS-CoV-2. It is important to monitor infections in animals to better understand their epidemiological significance for animal health, biodiversity, and human health. Evidence from risk assessments, epidemiological investigations, and experimental studies indicate that animals do not play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which is sustained by human-to-human transmission" (https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/11/en-factsheet-sars-cov-2-20211025.pdf; last update 25 Oct 2021).

From a One Health perspective, it will be important to follow the epidemiology of this event. - Mod.CRD
