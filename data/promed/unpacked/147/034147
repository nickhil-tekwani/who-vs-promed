Idaho: Fist West Nile Virus Infection Probably Contracted Elsewhere
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A 47-year-old Ada county man has been diagnosed with West Nile virus
infection, although health officials believe he contracted the disease
while traveling on a recent trip to the East Coast. This is the first
suspected case of the disease in Idaho. The man is recovering well from the
infection and poses no health threat to other Idaho residents. West Nile
virus is not spread from one person to another, only by mosquitoes infected
with the virus.
Health officials from the Central District Health Department and the Idaho
Department of Health and Welfare believe the man contracted the disease
while on a trip to the East Coast. He developed a headache, muscle pain,
weakness, and dizziness. He was not hospitalized. Blood samples were tested
by Health and Welfare's Bureau of Laboratories and sent to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The presumptive tests from both labs
indicate the man had contracted West Nile virus. Final testing by the CDC
will take approximately one week to complete.
"We advise all Idahoans, including those traveling outside the state, to
protect themselves from being bitten by mosquitoes," says Dr. Christine
Hahn, Idaho State Epidemiologist. "These precautions are especially
important for people over the age of 50 or people with underlying medical
conditions. Travelers should be aware that West Nile virus has spread to
all states east of the Rockies." West Nile virus has been found in 41
states. Even though Idaho has not yet found the virus in mosquito or bird
populations, Hahn advises homeowners to begin insect-proofing their homes
now. "It is only a matter of time before West Nile virus arrives in Idaho,"
she says.
Although there is no vaccine for people, an equine vaccine has been
developed. Hahn recommends horse owners contact their veterinarians now
about vaccinating their animals. "Many horse owners in other states waited
until West Nile virus was in their areas before calling about vaccination,"
she says. "But it takes 5 weeks for the vaccine to be effective from the
time of the initial vaccination, so not everyone's animal was protected."
