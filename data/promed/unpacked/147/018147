Mysterious Lethal Disease Spreading in North Western Bengal
-----------------------------------------------------------
KOLKATA: Health experts in West Bengal fear that a mysterious disease that
has killed 19 people in the last month in Siliguri town in northern West
Bengal could be taking the form of an epidemic. Some doctors believe an
encephalitis virus could be the cause of the disease, but the state
government has denied this. Panic is fast spreading in Siliguri where 6
more people died on Wed 21 Feb 2001, taking the toll to 9 in the past 48
hours. In total, 22 people have been admitted in various hospitals and the
condition of all is said to be critical. Unofficial estimates say that the
disease has killed 34 people in one and one half months. The rising toll is
making doctors fear that the disease is contagious.
The epidemic theory is gaining ground. Of the 34 deaths thus far, 10 of the
victims were staff members (including a doctor and nurses) in one nursing
home where patients with the disease were being treated, who died between
18 and 20 Feb 2001. Doctors suspect that mosquitoes could be carriers of the
disease. State Health Minister Partha De, [while denying that the disease
was Japanese encephalitis, said investigations to determine the nature of
the disease were [in progress. Official sources said that the state
government had sought the help of the National Institute of Virology (NIV)
in Delhi to [identify the cause of the mysterious deaths. Health
department sources [indicated that the state government was contemplating
seeking the help of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in diagnosing the
disease. The experts from NIV are expected to arrive in Siliguri on Friday.
Headache and drowsiness are the symptoms of the disease. The patient then
develops high fever. In the initial cases, some neurosurgeons in Siliguri
had certified the reason for the deaths as encephalitis. [On the other
hand some doctors from Kolkata, who were rushed by the government to
Siliguri, say the disease seemed to be a variant of cerebral malaria.
Doctors note that the disease has affected people from all sections of
society and all age groups. Panic-stricken residents of Siliguri allege
that the government had been negligent in identifying the mystery disease.

[Martha Cosgriff and Dr. Patricia Doyle also forwarded this Times of
India report. Dr. Patricia Doyle added the query: "Could this outbreak be
related to the mystery Rhesus monkey deaths across the border in Nepal,
which was reported in the ProMED-mail post entitled "Rhesus monkey deaths -
Nepal (Kathmandu): RFI 20010209.0256?" It is perhaps too early to hazard
guesses. The local authorities seem to favour a viral etiology, but have
ruled out involvement of Japanese encephalitis virus. The status of the
cerebral malaria diagnosis is unclear. The deaths of 10 health care
workers in one nursing home (half the official total death roll?) is
alarming. The fate of the patients is not disclosed in this report. - Mod.CP
