Macau dengue outbreak triggers alert in Hong Kong
-------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Safety workers fanned out across Hong Kong and Macau on Thu 30
Aug 2001, spraying pesticides after the Macau health authorities reported
an outbreak of dengue fever, a potentially deadly mosquito-borne viral disease.
Macau's Health Services Bureau reported late on Wed 29 Aug 2001 14
confirmed and 33 suspected cases of dengue fever. Some victims were
believed to have contracted the disease locally, while others became
infected while travelling elsewhere in South East Asia. All the patients
have since been discharged from hospital. The fever causes severe headaches
and muscle pains, and in its hemorrhagic form can lead to bleeding from the
eyes, nose, and internal organs, and in some cases is fatal.
The authorities in Hong Kong began moving into high risk areas on Thu 30
Aug 2001 spraying insecticides. Hong Kong has recorded 7 cases of dengue
fever this year, all of which were contracted overseas. All 7 patients
recovered.

Hong Kong and Macau join list of countries hit by dengue outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Hong Kong and Macau have become the latest territories to be hit
by a wave of dengue fever infections that is causing rising concern among
health professionals across the Asia Pacific region. A total of 21 cases of
the potentially fatal disease have been reported in the 2 autonomous
Chinese territories, government officials said on Thu 30 Aug 2001.
A spokesman for Hong Kong's health department said there had been 7
non-fatal cases in Hong Kong but stressed that these were all people who
had recently travelled to South East Asia. Cambodia, Thailand, the
Philippines, and Vietnam have all seen a sharp increase in the incidence of
dengue fever this year, and more than 300 people have died from the disease
in the 4 countries.
In Macau, government spokeswoman Amy Leong said 14 people had been treated
for the fever in the past month. "According to the patients, only one had
travelled to Thailand while the others had either been to Hong Kong or
Zhuhai, in southern China," she said.
