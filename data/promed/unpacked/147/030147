Anthrax, human, [Ioba province], Burkina Faso
--------------------------------------------
Per unofficial/media reports*, 2 people have died of anthrax and another was hospitalized in southwestern Burkina Faso, the Burkinabe government announced Thursday [25 Feb 2021].

"An outbreak of bacterial anthrax has been reported in the province of [Ioba], precisely in Dano, in the commune of Gueguere," indicated the minister in charge of animal resources, Modeste Yerbanga, specifying that the deaths followed the recent death of 4 oxen, one of which has been eaten by locals.

"The town of Gueguere was placed under surveillance after the anthrax infection of herds of oxen, which appeared on 22 Jan [2021]. To limit the spread of the disease, 4000 doses of anthrax vaccine were made available for free vaccination, according to the government, which has also launched a campaign to raise awareness among breeders on anthrax and the risks associated with the consumption of meat obtained from animal carcasses."

[Anthrax is sporadic but widespread in Burkina Faso and was not unknown in Ioba province in the past It is unfortunate that as this disease becomes less frequent, the villagers forget the risks involved in butchering and eating the meat from dead cattle. Thus, these human fatal cases, and the importance of maintaining public awareness of the risk.

When new outbreaks occur, one must revert to the policy of regularly vaccinating the cattle in and around affected villages and rural communities. The outbreaks concurring from owner stupidity is a good gauge of continuing risk.

Gueguere is a department, or commune, of Ioba province, Sud-Ouest region, in southwest Burkina Faso (see Wikipedia:
