Dozens of people have been infected by leishmania in Saida Shah area of Charmang tehsil in Bajaur tribal district.

According to officials of the Health Department, the affected people include women and children. The local people said leishmania have affected the entire area, and the disease is spreading rapidly. They said about 140 people have been affected by the disease so far, and the number of patients is increasing.

People of the area have called upon the Health Department to send medical teams. They fear that the disease may get out of control if timely measures are not taken.

District Health Officer Dr Adnan said teams of Health Department workers have been sent to the affected area. He said the teams would immediately start treatment of affected persons. The health officer said all the affected persons are registered with the Health Department and that the situation would be brought under control soon.

The local people said leishmania are on the rise in the area due to lack of fumigation by the local administration. They said the Health Department must carry out fumigation and distribution of mosquito nets on an emergency basis in Bajaur to control the situation.

Experts warn that the monsoon season will bring about a rise in leishmaniasis as well as malaria and dengue. According to media reports, more than 30 000 leishmania cases were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Due to the looming threat of the disease, there is a need to improve awareness among the public. Last year [2020], a shortage of leishmania injections had created problems. Experts say that this year [2021], the availability of injections must be ensured to avoid the recurrence of a similar situation.
