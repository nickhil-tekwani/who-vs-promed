AEDES ALBOPICTUS, DIROFILARIA VECTOR (02)

Here are some facts on the topic:
1. There have only been four (published) records of field collected _Ae.
albopictus_ infected with Dirofilaria species in the U.S. Three of these
contained immature larvae in the Malpighian tubules, one had 10 infective
stage larvae in the head. All were collected in the New Orleans area between
May and July, 1994 during a field survey I did on albopictus as a potential
heartworm vector. Of many hundreds of females dissected, no others were
positive for immatures or infective stage filaria.
2. In laboratory experiments I used females reared under optimum food
conditions and then fed them on heartworm positive blood using a membrane
feeder. 16% (13/81) of females had infective stage larvae in the head or
thorax, numbers ranged from 1 to 16 infective larvae/female (mean = 3.7).
I have not done any transmission studies so can't comment on that part of
your question.
Considering the lab results correspond to development under optimum
humidity, temperature and shelter conditions and the absence of predators,
its probable that post-blood meal mortality under field conditions would
reduce the 16% to a lower figure.
To summarise, if you consider albos are usually present at high population
densities, this might produce enough infective females in a given area to
allow efficient transmission. However, here in Louisiana where heartworm is
endemic and we have a healthy _Ae. albopictus_ population during most of the
year there is still no conclusive evidence that this species is a major
vector. I'd be interested in knowing what filaria you've worked on and why
you feel 5 to 7 larvae is low for a 'really good vector'. How do you
quantify a really good vector in terms of infective larvae?
