Cholera claims 22 in Marsabit
Nairobi - A cholera outbreak has claimed 22 lives in El-Molo, Marsabit
District.
El-Molo is the smallest ethnic group in Kenya, with a population of 3,600
(1989 census).
More than 45 people have been admitted to the local dispensary with similar
symptoms. Health officials said that following the outbreak, all eating
places, tourist lodges and two schools had been closed.
According to the acting district public health officer, Mr. Denge Molle,
appropriate measures will be taken to contain the spread of the disease.
"We have brought with us drugs and intravenous fluids for patients admitted
to the dispensary for now."
The Medecins sans Frontieres team from Samburu have joined another team
from Marsabit in a bid to combat the outbreak.
MP Robert Kochale has appealed to the Ministry of Health to urgently supply
enough drugs.
The residents feared the closure of El-Molo and Loyangalani primary schools
would make pupils more vulnerable to the disease. With the already
dwindling population of the community, they said, the outbreak could signal
the extinction of the entire community.
Meanwhile, residents of Marsabit Town have appealed to the minister for
health to urgently post a doctor to the district. They urged him to
personally ensure a doctor was posted there because several appeals had
received no response.
