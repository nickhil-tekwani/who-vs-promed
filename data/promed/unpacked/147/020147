The carcass of a 50-foot-long [15.25 m] female humpback whale washed
ashore last Tuesday [31 Mar 2009] on the northern Virginia portion of
Assateague Island, and another large humpback whale stranded farther
north in the Maryland portion the same day.

It was the 1st humpback whale stranding on Assateague since the late
1980s, Amanda Daisey, wildlife biologist with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service said Wednesday.

Smaller species of whale strand on Assateague's Virginia portion from
time to time, she said, including the 1st recorded stranding of a
melonhead whale there last year [2008].

Scientists with the stranding team at the Virginia Aquarium in
Virginia Beach took samples and performed a limited necropsy on the
dead whale last week.

Gwen Lockhart, the stranding technician with the aquarium who took
the samples, said Wednesday [1 Apr 2009] the whale was too decomposed
when it washed ashore to do a complete necropsy.

The whale, which Lockhart described as "significantly larger than a
school bus," and which likely weighed at least 40 tons, was missing
more than 90 percent of its skin when found, making positive
identification difficult -- although Lockhart said reports of a dead
whale floating in the ocean off Maryland had been received for the
last several weeks.

Why the whale died at sea has not been determined. Because of the
size and remote location of the stranded whale, it was not possible
to do a complete skeletal study to determine, for example, if it had
any broken bones, which could have indicated collision with a ship.
Ship strikes are one of the leading causes of whale mortality,
Lockhart said.

Stranded whales give scientists a unique opportunity to study the
animals and assess how different species are faring, she said.

Scientists will study this whale's eye and blubber samples and even
study barnacles attached to the skin to help determine where the
whale traveled during its lifetime, Lockhart said.

All marine mammals are protected under the federal Marine Mammal
Protection Act and the humpback also is an endangered species. It is
illegal to approach or touch a dead whale, Lockhart said, adding it
also could be dangerous due to the possibility of contracting a
disease.

Dead whale calf washes up on Sunset Beach
-----------------------------------------
A dead gray whale calf washed up today [5 Apr 2009] in shallow waters
just off Sunset Beach in Orange County.

The calf, roughly 21 feet long (6.4 m), was discovered in the surf
near 19th Street and Pacific Coast Highway, said Alisa
Schulman-Janiger, a marine biologist who directs an annual census of
the cetaceans as they pass the Palos Verdes Peninsula on their
northern and southern migrations.

Other marine biologists, in initial observations, judged the male
calf to be about 3 months old and believed that he had been dead for
about 10 days, Schulman-Janiger said. The calf apparently was struck
by a ship's propeller, leaving 3 deep, parallel lacerations in his
side, but further medical tests were needed to determine if the
injuries occurred before or after the whale died, she said.

Gray whales migrate down the California coast each year in the winter
months to the lagoons off the Baja Peninsula, where mother whales
nurse their calves. The whales head north again in the spring, with
mothers and calves lagging several weeks behind grown males.

Census takers had seen the 1st of the calves and mothers in recent
days. Around 5 to 8 of the whales wash up on the California coast
each year.

Gray whales are recovering from a few years of serious hardship that
occurred about a decade ago, when food became scarce and nearly one of
every 3 members of the species died. Marine biologists estimate the
current population as 21 000. [Gray whales eat a variety of small
shrimp, krill, squid, and octopus, along with plankton and mollusks. -

[Two whale strandings on opposite coasts within a few days of each
other is very unusual. Part of it may be due to whale migration as
one article indicates, but largely the reasons are as yet a mystery.

Stranding is a term usually applied to whales that come ashore alive
and die on the beach, not weeks-old carcases. We report the former,
as well as these deaths, in case an infection or toxin is involved,
but we rarely hear the final diagnosis. The 1st report does not give
any details of the 2nd whale, which in fact may have been a stranding.
