Farmers report cases of gray leaf spot infestation in some Illinois corn crops
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gray leaf spot (GLS) of corn is being reported in several areas
across the state. The fungus _Cercospora zeae-maydis_ causes this
common leaf blight. Gray leaf spot has easily identifiable symptoms
in a susceptible variety. The lesions are rectangular, which is
unusual for fungal leaf blight, and not very large ranging from about
3 mm [0.12 inches] by 1-6 cm [0.39 - 2.36 inches] and a light tan
color. Lesions can turn a slight grayish color as they mature and the
tissue becomes fully necrotic but this is really a fairly vague
difference in color. The disease probably would have been a lot more
aptly named as tan rectangle blight.
The most severe gray leaf spot epidemics usually occur in continuous
corn production fields where there is also a substantial amount of
corn debris that was infected in the previous season and remains on
the soil surface. Not to suggest the spores of the fungus are not
blown by the wind into fields that don't have this type of
production, but earlier and more severe infections are much more
likely under the situation of high infested residue and continuous
corn. Something to think about with the recent penchant for continuous corn.
Spore production from previously infested residue starts usually in
mid to late June depending on environmental conditions. Spores
landing on leaves require relative humidity of 95 percent for
successful infection. This disease does not have a rapid turn-around
from spore to lesion to new spore production like common rust that
has been our biggest foliar problem to date this year [2007]. For
gray leaf spot you will be looking at about an 18-day turn around.
This is good in the sense that during the most critical time for leaf
blights to cause yield loss -- 2 weeks before tasseling to 2 weeks
after tasseling -- what you see is what you get. But the long
turnaround time can be very problematic if the lesions all appear
right about the time that it's too late to do anything to reduce yield loss.
Progress has certainly been made in the past several years in
developing hybrids with some level of resistance to the disease. As
with all resistant hybrids, keep in mind that resistance does not
mean the hybrid will not be infected by the disease. Resistance in a
resistant hybrid can be expressed in a number of ways. Commonly the
effect of resistance will be expressed something along the lines of
smaller lesions produced, fewer spores subsequently produced from
those lesions, longer time for lesions to develop or fewer overall
lesions produced. The resistant hybrids will have lesions develop but
the lesions will not 'look' the same as a characteristic lesion on a
susceptible hybrid.
Fungicides are useful when conditions favor diseases, especially if
you are producing hybrid seed. Apply during the 14-day period before
and after tasseling if disease is present at about 15 percent whole
plant infection in field corn. Multiple applications may be necessary
when disease pressures are high for seed production fields. However,
during periods of high temperatures or dry conditions, disease
pressure will be low and additional applications may not be necessary.

[_C. zeae-maydis_ is now recognised as one of the most significant
yield-limiting diseases of maize worldwide. It is a threat to
commercial maize production, but it also reduces yields of
small-scale farmers in developing countries affecting food security.
It causes brownish gray lesions on leaves which may coalesce
resulting in blighting of the whole leaf and the whole plant may die
before the crop reaches maturity. Blighting seriously reduces the
photosynthetic ability required by the host for grain production.
Under these conditions, the maize plant may also be pre-disposed to
stalk-rotting fungal attacks adding to the yield losses. Infection is
favoured by extended warm, wet, humid weather. The fungus survives on
plant material between cropping seasons. Spores are spread by wind
and splashing rain.
Disease management includes fungicides and cultural practices such as
removal of inoculum, moderate plant density, crop rotation and timing
of irrigation if applicable. Hybrid resistance is considered the most
cost-effective strategy of managing GLS. Resistance is due to several
genes which are additive in effect. The level of resistance required
needs to be balanced against other characteristics such as yield
potential and length of growing season when developing new cultivars.
A slight degree of tolerance in a genotype can already contribute to
a substantial increase in yield.
