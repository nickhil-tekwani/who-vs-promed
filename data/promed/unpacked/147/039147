An unprecedented epidemic decimates 547 pigs
--------------------------------------------
The 1st case of transmissible gastroenteritis [TGE] in pigs in Tahiti
was recorded on 10 Aug 2011. Measures were immediately taken to
protect the farms. Within 3 weeks, 547 pigs have died in 2 farms; 265
on one and 282 on another farm. The disease primarily affects
piglets.

TGE is included in the diseases list of the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE). South Pacific has remained, until now, free of
this disease; not any more. "This disease exists in America and other
countries worldwide. We do not know exactly what is the cause. We know
it's coming from the outside but how? We do not know," said Eric
Coppenrath, president of the union of pig farmers.

Indeed, a veterinary report that LNT could see, says that the source
of the outbreak(s) of infection is unknown or uncertain. No live pigs
have been imported into French Polynesia during 2011, it said. Several
theories circulate: "It may involve raw meat or frozen or chilled (the
virus is resistant to cold) but apparently the affected farmers would
not feed it to pigs. Contamination can also occur in animal feces
(droppings), but it is not clear how the feces may have arrived in
Tahiti, a veterinary analysis of UNCDF [United Nations Capital
Development Fund] said. In the report on the infection it is noted
that "the contamination could come from an itinerant butcher feeding
restaurant waste to pigs before their illegal slaughter."

Today, Polynesia has been added to the list of regions where the
disease is present, which may restrict trade and pose medical problems
at the borders. "Fortunately" pork was not really part of Tahitian
exports so it does not have impact on farmers in this respect. But the
problem is economic: the herds were decimated. According to estimates
from a breeder, 2 months' revenue were lost by each of the affected
farmers, CFP 1.3 million (about USD 15 000) for one farm and CFP 1.4
million (about USD 16 200) for the other.

The risk of spread from animal to animal is also strong. Contamination
can be spread on foot or by vehicles. Various measures have been
undertaken [see in commentary].

The disease does not affect humans. Dr Valerie Roy, head of Food
Quality and Veterinary Action of the Rural Development Department,
said "2 inspectors are present every day to control animals
slaughtered and their carcasses" and "it is forbidden to kill a sick
animal."

[Transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs (TGE, transmissible gastro
enteritis) is caused by a coronavirus, affecting all ages but
significant deaths are seen particularly in suckling pigs. Almost all
susceptible piglets under 10 days of age die within 7 days of exposure
to the virus, and about half of pigs 10-21 days of age die. TGE is
included in OIE's list of Suidae diseases. Additional information is
available at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.11_TRANSMISSIBLE_GASTRO.pdf
and
http://www.thepigsite.com/diseaseinfo/123/transmissible-gastro-enteritis-tge.

The outbreak was officially reported to the OIE by French Polynesia on
4 Oct 2011; the report, including an interactive map, is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11107.
It includes the following epidemiological comments: "The source of
infection is uncertain. No live pigs have been imported in French
Polynesia in 2011. Nevertheless, contamination could come from an
itinerant butcher who fed pigs with waste from restaurants before
illegal slaughter. A positive serology was obtained on 3 Oct 2011 by
differential ELISA TGE/PRCV (transmissible gastroenteritis/porcine
respiratory coronavirus). Routine biosecurity measures have been
reinforced in all pig farms in Tahiti. Vaccination has never been
applied (subject to the import of vaccines), but is not prohibited."

Since vaccination was not prohibited previous to the outbreak, it
would be interesting to note if (non-certified, illegally imported)
vaccines might have been used and if they were modified live or
inactivated vaccines. - Mod.AS
