SIPHONOPHORA, FISH KILL, ATLANTIC SALMON - NORWAY: REQUEST FOR INFO

On the west coast of Norway fish farmers have during the last week
experienced a problem with an unknown jellyfish. It causes skin burns and
paralysis of the exposed fish (Atlantic salmon).
The species identity of the jellyfish is not known, nor their toxins or
mechanisms of action. The jellyfish is pelagic, and looks like chains of
spherical organisms which split up when hitting the fish-net.
We appreciate any comments and suggestions helping identifying the organism
and toxins involved.
