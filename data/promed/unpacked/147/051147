Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has taken a heavy toll in the state [of
Uttar Pradesh], with 125 deaths reportedly caused by the disease in the
last one month alone. In 2009, by October, the total cases of AES in the
state were reported to be 2300 with 357 deaths. However, this year [2010],
the cases have already risen to 2538, with 369 deaths. In the last one
month, more than 950 patients of AES have tested positive across 14
districts of the state [tested positive for what? - Mod.TY]

The largest number of deaths -- 105 -- have occurred in Gorakhpur district,
while the toll in Kushinagar is 96. Deoriya has reported 57 deaths and
Maharajganj around 40. Of the 2538 cases, more than 2400 patients were
admitted in BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur alone. "These are not exact
figures as we don't track patients going to private practitioners," said Dr
KP Kushwaha of BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur.

[The numbers of cases continue to increase, and the reports of this
outbreak continue to be confusing. The last report (28 Sep 2010,
ProMED-mail archive no. 20101001.3568) attributed the cases to Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) infections. However, reports before that indicated
that less than half the "acute encephalitis syndrome" cases were shown to
be caused by JEV infection. One earlier report associated the cases with
water, suggesting enterovirus infections. The report above simply
classifies them as "acute encephalitis syndrome" with no indication of what
etiological agent(s) might be involved, nor if samples have been sent to a
reference laboratory for testing, although the report states that they
"tested positive".
