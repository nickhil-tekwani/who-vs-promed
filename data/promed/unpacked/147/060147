More than 30 people were hospitalized in Khavast district of Uzbekistan's Syrdarya region with a diagnosis of anthrax. After 15 days of treatment, 7 people were discharged. The people were infected on 23 Jun 2014 in Khusnobod village after they had sold or bought meat of infected cattle.

A doctor at the hospital confirmed that the patients were diagnosed with anthrax. "In total, 31 people with this diagnosis were hospitalized. Typical anthrax wounds appeared on their bodies. The patients were received on 24-25 Jun 2014. Seven of them have been already discharged, and 24 more are continuing the treatment," he said.

An employee of a sanitary-epidemiological station reported that no other cases of infection were registered in the area.

In Uzbekistan, cases of infection from [infected] cattle blood and meat are rather common. In particular, 8 Vagashti villagers (Samarkand region) were hospitalized from 26 Jun 2014 after killing sheep. In June 2012, 4 people were hospitalized in Kamashi district of Kashkadarya region with anthrax after they also contacted sick cattle.

Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal [if not treated promptly], and it affects both humans and animals. Effective vaccines against anthrax are now available, and some forms of the disease respond well to antibiotic treatment.

Anthrax commonly infects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals that ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Ingestion is thought to be the most common route by which herbivores contract anthrax. Carnivores living in the same environment may become infected by consuming infected animals. Diseased animals can spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact (e.g., inoculation of infected blood to broken skin) or by consumption of a diseased animal's flesh.

[ProMED thanks Sabine Zentis for this posting.

This report is a bit of a milestone, as Uzbekistan has been consistent over many years in not reporting this disease, whether in livestock or humans, though we know from reliable sources within the country that the disease is enzootic in eastern Uzbekistan. The most common reports have been indirect through overflow into western Kyrgyzstan and the oblasts that surround the Farg'ona valley. This report contains a limited amount of information on outbreaks in Samakand and Kashkadarya regions. We can optimistically look forward in the future to reports in Uzbek livestock independent of any human cases.
