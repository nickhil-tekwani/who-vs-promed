Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Jasper County, Jasper, Missouri
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Feb 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 20 000 / - / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: commercial meat turkey flock

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / ** / 0 / ** / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: As part of routine, pre-slaughter testing and surveillance for H5/H7 Avian Influenza, H7N1 presumptive low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was detected in a healthy commercial meat turkey flock based upon H7 PCR and antibody to H7 and N1; further characterization is pending virus recovery. There have been no clinical signs of illness or increased mortality on the premises. This is the 1st detection of H7 LPAI in commercial poultry in the United States for 2018. The turkeys will be depopulated through controlled marketing. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Missouri Department of Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding. A total of 2 additional commercial poultry premises located within the 10km [approx. 6.2 mi] zone were tested negative for influenza virus.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone stamping out; quarantine; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Missouri Department of Agriculture Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (local laboratory / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 2 Mar 2018 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds/ haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) / 5 Mar 2018 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / neuraminidase inhibition assay / 5 Mar 2018/ Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 3 Mar 2018 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / - / Pending

Future reporting

[This detection was a result of the routine AI surveillance of commercial poultry flocks under the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) conducted in the United States. As the report indicates, the flock was healthy and there was no indication of any clinical illness. Such surveillance provides an early warning system to detect circulating virus and thereby quickly apply appropriate response and control measures. - Mod.CRD
