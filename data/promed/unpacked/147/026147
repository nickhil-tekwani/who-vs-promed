Hamilton Public Health is confirming an _E. coli_ outbreak at Valens Lake Conservation Area. The city's public health unit says there are 7 confirmed cases at the Puslinch-area conservation area, with one of the cases involving a Hamilton resident. Public health says most of the confirmed cases involve children under the age of 12.

_E. coli_ is transmitted most commonly through consumption of contaminated food or water. Common symptoms of the bacteria can include diarrhea, fever, vomiting and abdominal cramps, but _E. coli_ can also lead to life-threatening disease, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially in young children and the elderly.

Residents who have visited Valens Lake Conservation Area since 12 Aug 2020 and are concerned about possible illness, are asked to contact their primary care physician or the Public Health Infectious Disease Program at 905-546-2063. The beach at Valens Lake Conservation Area is closed as of Friday [18 Sep 2020] to mitigate any further exposure to the bacteria. Public health says visitors to Valens should not swim in the water and residents looking to engage in secondary recreation activities, such as kayaking or canoeing, can do so at their own risk.

[It is not stated but likely that the organism in this outbreak is one of the enterohemorrhagic strains of _E. coli_, zoonotic organisms that are acquired from contaminated food or water. Valens Lake Conservation Area is a large recreational area in Ontario for camping, fishing and other outdoor activities. It is not clear as yet what epidemiological factors link those affected, as there could be a common food or food source or the recreational water could be the source.

EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock or wild animals or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.
