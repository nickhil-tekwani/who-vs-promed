Notes:
As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may
change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be
discarded after further investigation and follow-up.

accessed at: <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/areas/2003_06_11/en/> and
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/travel/travel2003_06_11/en/> and is unchanged
since the last update.
[C] Update 78 Â­ Situation in Toronto 11 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_11/en/>
WHO is deeply concerned by the resurgence of SARS cases in Toronto,
reported to WHO on 22 May 2003, and is following the situation closely.
Toronto, which had been removed from the list of areas with recent local
transmission on 14 May 2003, was again added to the list on 26 May 2003
following evidence that more than one generation of new cases had occurred.
Since the disease first resurfaced in Toronto, over 90 new probable cases
have been reported.
Health authorities in Toronto are again on high alert, and are treating all
hospital-associated clusters of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms
as possible SARS cases until proven otherwise. Possible cases are
immediately isolated. All contacts are being traced and, when warranted,
placed in home quarantine. Infection control measures are being followed in
all affected facilities. WHO welcomes these precautionary measures.
Canadian authorities have most recently reported a possible cluster of SARS
patients in a hospital east of Toronto. Although no clear epidemiological
link has been established that could explain this new cluster, officials
have adopted a cautious approach. Over the last 3 days, 15 dialysis
patients at the Lakeridge Health Centre in Whitby exhibited respiratory and
febrile illnesses. After clinical review and laboratory investigations to
detect other causative agents, around half of these patients have now been
excluded from consideration as possible SARS cases. The remaining patients
are being closely monitored.
There are other investigations ongoing, and many questions remain to be
answered before firm conclusions can be reached.
WHO is also awaiting further information on cases in other countries that
may have been exported from Toronto. WHO is not yet convinced that such
cases have been conclusively documented.
One of the most dangerous stages in the evolution of any outbreak, and most
especially one caused by a new and poorly understood disease, occurs when
cases begin to decline and previous levels of high alert and precautionary
measures likewise begin to level off. Much about the clinical behaviour of
SARS and its mode of transmission requires further research. Until
knowledge improves, precautionary measures such as those being followed in
Toronto are the best approach from a public health perspective.

Hospital Authority:
There is one new confirmed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
today (11 Jun 2003). This is the 27th consecutive day on which the number
of cases has fallen below 5 since 16 May 2003.
Today's case involved a 33-year-old man who was admitted to United
Christian Hospital on 3 Jun 2003 and transferred to Alice Ho Miu Ling
Nethersole Hospital on 4 Jun 2003. He is now in stable condition. His
family members are asymptomatic. The number of patients recovered and
discharged from hospital is 1374. Of them, 6 were discharged today.
The number of SARS patients in intensive care units is 17. These cases are
part of the 60 cases under treatment in hospitals. 30 are recovering
patients in convalescence and in preparation for discharge.
One patient with underlying disease died, bringing the total of deaths
attributable to SARS to 291.
All household contacts of confirmed or suspected SARS patients are required
to undergo home confinement for monitoring and treatment up to a maximum of
10 days. So far, a total of 1262 persons (from 493 households) had been

[A] USA ex Canada from Reuters
<http://asia.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=scienceNews&storyID=2915787>
The man from North Carolina developed severe acute respiratory syndrome
more than a week after he left Toronto in mid-May 2003. He had visited a
family member in a geriatric hospital in the city, where another patient in
the same hospital room he visited was later diagnosed with SARS. Doctors
now know that a second visitor to the room, who was just starting to show
symptoms, spread the virus to both the U.S. man and the patient.
[In another newswire, there was mention that the case in North Carolina had
positive serology for the SARS-associated coronavirus. - Mod.MPP]

[As of 11 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8435 probable
cases with 789 deaths reported from 29 countries. In the past 24 hours
there have been 7 new probable cases reported, of which 4 were reported
from the United States and 1 each were reported from Taiwan, China, and
Hong Kong. Information on the 4 newly reported cases in the USA was not
readily available.
Further word on the status of the Ontario outbreak is pending. As
mentioned in the WHO update [1][C] and in newswire coverage, 7 of the 15
cases of acute respiratory illness at the dialysis center in Ontario were
found not to have SARS. Information on the remaining 8 cases is still
pending.
The identification of the route of transmission in the imported U.S. case
mentioned in the newswire above is important, as earlier newswires suggested
that there might have been spread from asymptomatic carriers. - Mod.MPP]
