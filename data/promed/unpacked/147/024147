As of the beginning of [August] more than 7,500 cases of dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF) had been reported in Cambodia and at least 144 children had
died. The death figure includes only children who died in hospitals and
officials said they feared total fatalities might be much higher given the
poor access to health facilities in Cambodia.
The International Red Cross warned that Cambodia is facing the worst
epidemic of dengue fever in its history [>10,000 cases in 1995], with more
than 16,000 cases possible by the end of the year.
