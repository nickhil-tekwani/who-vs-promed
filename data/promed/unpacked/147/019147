Mandarin crop decimated
-----------------------
This winter [2011/12], farmers of Khothakpa, Pemagatshel, did not have any mandarin to sell. Their citrus trees are either dead or dying, the leaves are yellow. They say dust from the Druk Satair's gypsum mine is to blame. Druk Satair said trees dying was also because of a citrus disease that has been killing orange orchards in the south.

Agriculture officer Kiran Suberi said the 'citrus greening' disease [see comment below] has spread in Pemagatshel. "When we tested in Khothakpa, the result was negative, and we've sent another sample for testing to NPPC [National Plant Protection Centre]."

He also said that parts of other places [in Pemagatshel] like Denchi, Khar, Nangong, Chokorling, and Norbugang are also affected and are following the ministry's policy where affected trees are chopped off to re-plant. "We can't exactly tell the figure, but the number of fruit bearing [citrus] trees in Khothakpa have reduced significantly over the years." Citrus [greening] disease was suspected in Khothakpa after they found presence of the psyllid vector [see ProMED-mail post 20100211.0477].

[Huanglongbing (HLB, citrus greening), is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In Asia, it is caused by the phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus, which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). For more information on HLB see links below.

HLB has been reported for the 1st time from Bhutan in 2003 (ProMED-mail post 20030404.0823). By 2009 it was reported to be spreading, destroying much of the orange crop in the country, and the presence of the vector in Pemagatshel was also reported (ProMED-mail post 20090415.1436). However, at the same time, PCR diagnosis did not show the presence of the pathogen, but regular PCR tests for HLB monitoring were recommended at the time by the NPPC.

The report above again states negative test results. Therefore, despite its presence elsewhere in the country, it appears that until now HLB has not been shown to be the cause of the citrus problems in Pemagatshel. It remains to be seen if future tests will detect the presence of HLB, and whether other pathogens, in addition to the environmental stress, may be contributing to the poor state of these trees.
