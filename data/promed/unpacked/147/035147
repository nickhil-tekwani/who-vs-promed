Following upon extensive ditch clearing and cleaning of springs (their
outflows were blocked) anthrax has broken out on a ranch in Washoe county.
The first cattle death was noted on 5 Aug 2000; by 10 Aug, there were 14
dead; and by 16 Aug there was a total of 30 dead animals -- 25 cows and
five calves (5-6 months old). The stock and horses were vaccinated on 12
Aug 2000. The animals have been moved from the original 1300 acre field to
a nearby 400 acre field. The original numbers at risk were 206 cows in good
condition and their 116 calves. Because of the fire risk the carcasses have
and are being buried.

The ranch suffered a severe die-off some 30 years ago from an unknown cause
-- in retrospect probably anthrax. For a number of years the ranch and
stock were not optimally maintained. But the present owner's stock have
been described as being in good to excellent condition, if not fat. It is
possible that the excavations dug up one or more old anthrax carcasses and
the water in the irrigation canals became contaminated with the disturbed
spores.

Tissues were sent to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Reno for
diagnosis; clostridial infection has been ruled out. Secondary confirmation
of anthrax is awaited by an independent laboratory.

While some deaths have continued after vaccination these should cease soon
-- normally deaths are not seen after 8 days past vaccination.
