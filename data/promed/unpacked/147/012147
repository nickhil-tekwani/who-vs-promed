Animal Health Alert: Possible Aflatoxin Contaminated Dog Food
1st Deputy Commissioner Ruth A. Moore today alerted dog owners to a
statement issued by Diamond Pet Food reporting that it has discovered
aflatoxin in pet food products manufactured at its facility in Gaston,
South Carolina. Diamond's statement, along with up-to-date information and
a list of product names, can be found on its website at
<http://www.diamondpetfood.com>.
Aflatoxin in certain concentrations is a highly toxic, cancer-causing
metabolite produced by fungi that grow on a variety of grains including
corn. Sensitivity to aflatoxins depends on a dog's individual
susceptibility, age, pregnancy status, and nutritional status. Signs in an
affected dog may include bloody vomiting or diarrhea, general lethargy and
loss of appetite, increased water consumption and urination as well as
jaundice or yellowing of the whites of the eyes or gums. In severe cases,
aflatoxin can cause death.
Diamond Pet Food has notified its distributors and has recommended that
they hold the sale of all Diamond Pet Food products formulated with corn
that were produced in its Gaston, South Carolina facility because the
product may contain aflatoxin.
The Department's Division of Food Safety and Inspection is conducting a
follow-up investigation and sampling at retail outlets and distributors in
New York State. The New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the
New York State Food Laboratory are also testing Diamond products for
aflatoxin contamination.
Dog owners should have their pets examined immediately by a veterinarian if
their dog has consumed a Diamond Pet Food product and becomes ill.
Diamond Pet Food can be reached at 573-229-4203 for more information
concerning its products and its statement.

[Although aflatoxin has been associated with cancer in people, it does NOT
cause cancer in dogs. Dogs do not live long enough to develop any kind of
cancer that may be associated with aflatoxin.
Dogs are sensitive to low-level long-term intake. Although the clinical
signs listed in the article are correct, it is important to realize that
there are other causes of the same clinical signs. It is important to have
your pet evaluated by a veterinarian if there are clinical signs.
There are only a few lots of affected food. Therefore, even if an owner has
purchased food produced by that company, there is a very good chance that
it is not from the very few affected lots.
Diamond Pet Food is working to insure that proper information is available
and that they be able to assist affected customers. They will be
establishing a call in hot-line' but it will not be available until the
week after Christmas.- Mod.TG]
