The source of the current outbreak of neurologic illness in Wellington,
Florida, has been traced back to a shipment of 15 horses imported from
Europe the last week of November 2006.
The horses were housed together at a quarantine facility in New York. One
of the 15 died after being shipped to California and was diagnosed with
equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Five horses were shipped to Florida, and 2 of
these now have neurologic signs. The whereabouts of the other 9 horses are
unknown at this time, but they are being tracked down by federal officials.
Three other horses in Florida have died in association with the outbreak.
Starting from the announcement that a high-performance horse show in
Wellington was cancelled and one of its stars euthanatized from what
appeared to be a contagious virus, the local equestrian community has
scrambled to impose voluntary quarantines and deal with mandatory
stop-movement orders. Veterinarians also are vaccinating or boostering many
horses against equine herpesvirus.
Scott Swerdlin, DVM, MRCVS, a veterinarian with the Palm Beach Equine
Clinic in Wellington, said today that most horse owners are vaccinating
their horses and keeping equine movement to a minimum. Swerdlin estimates
that 4000 horses have been vaccinated in the past 48 hours.
The 3 horses were confirmed dead due to a viral disease strongly suspected
to be neurologic EHV-1. Test results to confirm the disease on the dead
animals, as well as those exhibiting neurologic signs, are expected either
tonight or tomorrow. Researchers with the University of Kentucky are
currently performing both PCR and virus isolation tests on whole blood and
nasal swab samples, according to Mike Short, DVM, equine programs manager
for Florida's Division of Animal Industry. "We've not seen any clinical
signs outside of 2 areas here in Wellington, and we're managing both of
those, working with the practices and veterinarians," Short said. "We've
certainly got our fingers crossed that we've got it under control, but time
will tell." (EHV typically has an incubation period of 2-10 days.)
"We're requesting that all horsemen in the Wellington take temperatures of
their horses twice a day, and if horses are displaying a temperature of
over 102, to contact their veterinarians," Swerdlin said. "State of Florida
Department of Agriculture is being very aggressive and is staying on top of
everything," he added. "All the vets are being very aggressive, and the
horse owners have been very cooperative and very understanding."
The possibility of an outbreak came to many horse owners' attention when it
was announced that Cosequin's CEO, a Grand Prix show jumper ridden by
Debbie Stephens, had died on Sunday (10 Dec 2006) due to an unknown,
apparently contagious illness.
According to Swerdlin, the 5 horses that originated in Europe and ended up
in Florida are in isolation and being evaluated. Two have shown neurologic
signs and are currently being treated [paragraph 2 refers to 3 other horses
in Florida that have died in association with the outbreak. Were these the
other 3 imported horses? - Mod.SH]. One of these horses (the suspected
index case -- the case from which all other Florida cases trace back) was
stabled next to Stephens' horse on 7 Dec 2006.
Short will be addressing area veterinarians this evening, and a USDA
veterinarian will be hosting a forum on EHV at the Palm Beach Polo
Equestrian Club this Saturday (16 Dec 2006) for area equestrians,
veterinarians, and members of the general public.
Because EHV-1 can spread through direct contact or through the air, the
disease is a concern where groups of horses congregate. The clinical signs
of EHV-1 include fever and nasal discharge, and more rarely, neurologic
signs (including an inability to control the hind limbs and tail) and
abortions. Scientists definitively diagnose EHV-1 infections on virus
culture from blood or nasal secretions, PCR (polymerase chain reaction
test, a DNA test of blood or nasal secretions), or serology (blood antibody
titers).

[This case would seem to illustrate the need for a reliable test that could
indicate if the virus were incubating in a horse prior to shipment. It
would also illustrate the need for stricter separation and quarantine of
horses. - Mod.TG]
