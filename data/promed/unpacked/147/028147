With the arrival of the rains, a favorable period for contracting leptospirosis, ARS Indian Ocean [1] wants to raise awareness about this disease carried by rats. In fact, each year more than 50 cases are reported in [Reunion island], requiring hospitalization for the majority or admission to intensive care unit [for those affected]. Leptospirosis is a serious disease that can even be fatal. 3 [residents of] Reunion died this year [2014] and 59 people were infected. The summer in the southern hemisphere is conducive to an increase in infections caused by this bacterium [_Leptospira_ that is carried by] rats. "The disease is contracted through contact with a damp environment contaminated with the urine of [chronically infected] rats (such as, mud, puddles, and water standing on the edge of ravines)."

The bacterium enters the body through even small cuts in skin or wounds, says ARS. After several days of incubation, the disease occurs with fever (over 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]), muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain, and headaches. The disease may worsen after few days and if it is not treated early with antibiotics, it can be fatal. Upon appearance of these signs, it is necessary to consult and inform a doctor about activities [that placed the person at risk of acquiring the disease] and/or the presence of rats. 70 to 80 percent of exposures identified over the last few years [such as gardening or farming] have occurred around the homes of patients, with most often, a known presence of rats in the neighborhood, noted ARS Indian Ocean. Other activities that place people at risk are freshwater activities: fishing, swimming in the river or ponds, and white water sports.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Reunion experiences seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis probably related to the rainfall.

Reunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800 000 located in the Indian Ocean, about 943 km (586 mi) east of Madagascar and about 200 km (120 mi) south west of Mauritius, the nearest island.
