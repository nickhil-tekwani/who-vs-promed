2000/129 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests and pests included on the
EPPO Alert List. The pest status in the areas concerned is indicated in
bold and according to the terms of the ISPM No. 8.

· New geographical records
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest), race 1 biovar 4 was
isolated from wilted tomato plants in Saudi Arabia (Al-Qassim region). The
EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the situation of this bacterium
in Saudi Arabia.
Present: no details. Review of Plant Pathology, 79(5), p 501 (3741).
· Detailed records
_Plasmopara halstedii_ (EU Annexes) was reported for the first time in
Punjab in 1999, India.
Present: no details. Review of Plant Pathology, 79(5), p 508 (3797).
In 1991-1993, a survey on tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (EPPO A2
quarantine pest) was carried out in glasshouse crops in the provinces of
Poznan, Katowice and Krakow, western part of Poland. Tomato spotted wilt
tospovirus was found in a few horticultural farms (4 out of 16). It was
detected on 8 percent of the tested plant samples, mainly on tomato, and
sporadically on capsicum, chrysanthemum, _Alstroemeria_, and _Asparagus
sprengeri_. In cases of early infection, yield reduction was observed on
tomato and capsicum crops (Fiedorow, 1999).
Present: only in some areas.
In Pakistan, surveys were done in 1993-1997 to evaluate the incidence of
_Tilletia indica_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) in wheat seed lots. A total of
730 wheat samples were tested. High infection rates were found in central
Punjab (up to 37.5 percent infected seed samples) and north-western parts.
The fungus was not detected in samples from the southern part (Sindh).
Compared to previous years, the incidence of the disease is diminishing
(Bhutta et al., 1999).
Present: only in some areas.
· New host plants
The weeds, _Mercurialis ambigua_ and _Solanum luteum_, are reported as
natural host plants of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2
quarantine pest) (Sanchez-Campos et al., 2000).
