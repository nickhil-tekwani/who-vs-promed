Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was confirmed in 2 under-treatment patients in Civil Hospital Karachi [Sindh province], it was learnt on Wednesday [14 Jan 2015].

An official of Civil Hospital Karachi confirmed that 2 patients with high-grade fever were brought in the general ward of hospital for treatment about a week ago and their blood samples were sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad.

He said the NIH report confirmed that both the patients, 60-year-old men, were suffering from Congo fever [CCHF]. He said one of them was isolated from the other patient, while the 2nd person was discharged from the hospital even before confirmation report was received to the hospital administration as his condition had improved.

He said Congo [CCHF] is a deadly viral disease spread through a tick-bite found on animals. He said people who deal with dairy farming and livestock were most likely to catch the disease. He said symptoms of [Crimean-] Congo virus [infections] were high-fever, dizziness, neck pain, backache, muscle aches, sore eyes, nausea, and vomiting and stomach pain. He said these symptoms of disease generally appear 3-4 days after exposure to ticks.

He said panic was spreading among admitted patients, doctors, nurses and paramedical staff after hearing the news that 2 Congo [CCHF] patients remained with them in the general ward. He said patients with dengue, [Crimean-] Congo and other hemorrhagic fevers must be kept in the isolation ward as these viral diseases can transform [sic; transmit] into other patients if strict protective step are not taken.

Medical Superintendent, Prof Saeed Qureshi, when contacted, said [Crimean-] Congo fever was confirmed in 2 male admitted patients on [13 Jan 2015] evening and a patient isolated from other patients. He, however, said that the hospital administration contacted with a patient who was discharged from healthcare, but he refused to return back and said: "he is better now".

[Sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) occurred in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014). Last year, 17 cases of CCHF were reported in the country, with 9 of them in Sindh province. Circumstances under which the 2 patients acquired their CCHF virus infections is not stated in the above report. They probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can occur also. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
