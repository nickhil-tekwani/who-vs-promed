Over 1000 suspected chikungunya cases have been reported at various
places in the city [Madurai] in the last one week, Health department
officials said on Monday [14 Sep 2009]. Private hospitals in
Chinthamani, Melamadai, Vilachery, Karimedu, and Ponnagaram had
reported cases of suspected chikungunya. Patients complained of fever,
headache, and severe joint pain, they said. Officials of government
Rajaji hospital said they were getting 25 suspected cases daily for
the past 2 weeks and most of them were from Madurai.

Directorate of Public Health officials said since people showed
symptoms of chikungunya with swollen feet, they had collected blood
samples of 2635 persons and sent for testing. They would know about
the extent to which the mosquito that induced fever [transmitted the
virus] had spread only after receiving the results, another official
said.

Preventive measures had been taken, they added, including sprinkling
bleaching powder, fogging pesticides, and removal of stagnant water in
these areas.

[A report from Tamil Nadu state on 4 Aug 2009 indicated that
chikungunya virus was circulating there (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20090805.2763). This 14 Sep 2009 report, if confirmed, indicates that
virus transmission there is continuing and perhaps accelerating.
