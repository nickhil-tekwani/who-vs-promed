So far in 2011, 13 cases of tularemia have been reported in people
living in 5 municipalities in More og Romsdal and Sor-Trondelag [in
central Norway]. In 2010. a total of 21 cases of the disease across
the country were reported. Tularemia, sometimes called hare plague,
is a bacterial disease that every few years causes local outbreaks
among rabbits and rodents, particularly in lemmings. Humans can
become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick, dead,
or disease-carrying animals.

Tularemia can also be transmitted through contaminated drinking water
when animal tissue has contaminated the water source. The disease can
also spread through the bite of such animals and by inhalation of
dust with infected feces or urine.

[The form of tularemia that occurred in these cases (that is,
ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, typhoidal, or pneumonic) is not
stated. Although classically transmitted to man via infected animals
such as rabbits or a tick vector, infection with _Francisella
tularensis_ may be acquired from contact with soil or water harboring
the bacterium. Although tularemia pneumonia is the form of the
disease associated with biological terrorism, it may also occur
naturally, as is exemplified by rare sporadic cases in New York City
and outbreaks among gardeners on Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts).

Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49
cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),
and an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to
contamination of a water supply (3).

At present, no licensed tularemia vaccine is available in the USA.
However, the LVS (live vaccine strain) vaccine is available to
military personnel under an investigational new drug protocol held by
the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (4). It
is administered via scarification using multiple punctures of a
bifurcated needle. LVS is derived from strain 15 developed in the
former USSR and was obtained by the US military in 1956 (5). It is
not well standardized and contains 2 phenotypes of _F. tularensis_,
only one of which seems immunogenic (6). However, in studies
published in 1977, the vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the
incidence of typhoidal tularemia in US government lab workers from
5.7 to 0.27 cases per at-risk employee years (7). It did not reduce
the incidence of the ulceroglandular form, but the disease in
vaccinees was reported to be milder.
