Database clean-up in progress: revision of the database of those who have recovered. We will start sharing the number of recoveries as soon as the revision is complete.

News of the response
Katwa ETC burned
----------------
- The Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Katwa, one of Butembo's health zones [North Kivu], was ransacked and set on fire on the night of [Sun 24 Feb to Mon 25 Feb 2019]. This fire resulted in the death of a nurse who was trying to escape (Read the communiqué of the Ministry of Health at http://tinyurl.com/yykruunu [in French]).
- These uncivil acts, perpetrated by unidentified individuals, began around 10 pm [Sun 24 Feb 2019]. For this purpose, the mayor of Butembo town, Sylvain Mbusa Kanyamanda, who condemned these acts, explained that this attack started with the generators which resulted in the interruption of the electric current that occurred before the fire of some cells, including the center's logistics cell.
- The deceased nurse would have fallen into a creek as he tried to flee. The 10 patients who were hospitalized in this ETC were not affected and were transferred to other health facilities. Of these patients, 4 are confirmed carriers of the Ebola virus and have been transferred to the Butembo ETC. The 6 suspected patients were transferred to the Alima transit center in Katwa.
- Butembo's mayor is urging the people of the country to work with Ebola response teams to stop the spread of the disease in the city. He also denounced those whose intention is the destabilization of health experts. The specialized services continue the investigations, according to the mayor, to identify the perpetrators of this attack.

CENI president raises awareness about Ebola virus disease
---------------------------------------------------------
- The president of the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), Corneille Naanga, on [Sun 24 Feb 2019], visiting the Butembo Ebola Subcommittee on Ebola response, appealed to all Congolese, especially those in areas affected by the Ebola virus disease, to respect the different councils of health professionals to fight against this disease.
- The objective of his mission in Beni and Butembo was to evaluate the preparations for the elections of national and provincial deputies to be held on 31 Mar 2019.
- He took advantage of his visit to not only raise awareness about the Ebola virus disease, but especially to encourage the teams of the response for their work, which he qualifies as commendable. "Ebola has not only started in North Kivu. This is the 10th epidemic that the DRC is experiencing. It is a very dangerous disease," he said, adding that he will deploy a large team for the elections. "We have just received instructions that once the teams are in the field, they will be vaccinated and we will also follow all the advice of health professionals. These elections will involve all neighborhoods, even the neighborhoods where the Ebola outbreak continues," said Corneille Naanga.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 83 517 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

[The attack on the Ebola treatment center in Katwa is a deplorable act where the life of a nurse caring for infected individuals was lost totally unnecessarily. Our hearts go out to this healthcare worker's family and friends. This is a loss not only for the DRC, but for all humanity. - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 23 Feb 2019
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 869, of which 804 are confirmed and 65 are probable.
In total, there have been 546 deaths (481 confirmed and 65 probable).
- Data for suspected cases not available;
- 5 new confirmed cases, 2 in Katwa and 3 in Butembo;
- 6 new deaths of confirmed cases: 5 community deaths, 2 in Katwa and 3 in Butembo; 1 death at Butembo ETC
- 1 new recovery released from the Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Location in Katwa
-----------------
- Katwa remains the main focus of the epidemic. In the last 21 days, 86 new confirmed cases were reported, 49 of them (57%) in Katwa.
- Katwa surpassed Beni in terms of number of cases and deaths. To date, Beni has reported 235 cases (226 confirmed and 9 probable) and 127 deaths while Katwa is 239 cases (228 confirmed and 11 probable) and 182 deaths.
- The mortality rate is also higher in Katwa. The mortality rate in Beni is 54% while it is 76% in Katwa. This high mortality rate in Katwa can be explained by the fact that contacts of confirmed cases who refused vaccination and follow-up of contacts are not found until after their death in the community. Thus, the percentage of community deaths in Katwa is much higher than in other health zones. The high number of community deaths remains a concern as they are an important source of spread of the epidemic. This situation demonstrates the importance of increasing community engagement and active case finding in the community and health facilities in Katwa.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 83 118 people have been vaccinated.

Week 8: 18-24 Feb 2019
Data as reported 24 Feb
-----------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. The Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Katwa was set on fire by unknown assailants during a security incident that occurred on the night of 24 Feb 2019. The ETC, manned by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF; Doctors without Borders) and the Ministry of Health, has been rendered non-functional and the patients have been evacuated to Butembo ETC. While no casualties have been reported [1 nurse unfortunately died in the attack. - Mod.LK], this incident will negatively impact on the overall response operations.

Since the last report on 17 Feb 2019 (weekly bulletin 7; https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/310904/OEW07-1117022019.pdf), 31 new confirmed EVD cases have been reported, with an additional 12 deaths. As of 23 Feb 2019, a total of 869 EVD cases, including 804 confirmed and 65 probable cases have been reported. To date, confirmed cases have been reported from 19 health zones: Beni (226), Biena (5), Butembo (76), Kalunguta (44), Katwa (228), Kayna (5), Kyondo (15), Mabalako (90), Mangurujipa (5), Masereka (8), Musienene (6), Mutwanga (4), Oicha (30), and Vuhovi (13) in North Kivu province; Komanda (28), Mandima (17), Nyankunde (1), Rwampara (1), and Tchomia (2) in Ituri province. 8 of the 19 affected health zones reported at least one new confirmed case in the previous 21 days (3-23 Feb 2019), depicting ongoing active local transmission.

The Katwa Health Zone remains the main hot spot, reporting 55% (42/76) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days, followed by Butembo at 25% (19/76). A total of 546 deaths were recorded, including 481 among confirmed cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio among confirmed cases of 60% (481/804). One healthcare worker was among the newly confirmed cases in the last week, bringing the number of healthcare workers infected to 69, with 21 deaths.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-man-concern-congo-ebola-4505721-Feb2019/

Dublin man leading Concern team as they tackle major Ebola outbreak in DR Congo
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As [Ebola] virus continues to spread in North Kivu in the north east of the country, Euro 100 000 [about USD 114 000] in emergency response funding from Irish Aid, the government's international aid programme, has helped Concern [Irish aid and humanitarian agency] escalate its response to the crisis. Concern has 180 staff in DRC, where the NGO has worked since 1994.

Their Ebola response to this outbreak, which began last August [2018], is being led by area coordinator Mark Johnson (age 33) from Goatstown, Dublin. "Our current Irish Aid programme aims to prevent the outbreak from spreading southwards towards the big city of Goma and also across the border to Rwanda by supporting health centres and sensitizing communities to the disease," Johnson said.

His team are using the Irish Aid funding to train over 350 health workers in how to control the outbreaks as it nears Goma, which has a population of over one million. They are also equipping local health centres with infection prevention and control kits that contain items like masks, gloves, disinfection equipment, and non-touch thermometers. The team are distributing the kits in coordination with the DRC Ministry of Health and WHO, which is leading the overall response to the outbreak. In recent weeks, Concern also repaired 15 water points in Beni city, close to the outbreak's epicentre, to ensure people have access to safe drinking water, which is essential for disease control.

The DRC, which is 27 times the size of Ireland with a population of over 85.2 million, is also currently experiencing other epidemics such as cholera and malaria.

- Mon 25 Feb 2019. Sex in exchange for medical treatment
[NewsRep, abridged, edited]
https://thenewsrep.com/114474/sex-in-exchange-for-medical-treatment-horror-stories-of-the-current-ebola-outbreak/
[byline: Joseph LaFave]

While medical personnel and international aid agencies are working tirelessly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to fight the ongoing outbreak of the Ebola virus, a select few medical workers may be engaging in a "sex for treatment" scam. According to a report published last week [week of 18 Feb 2019] in The Guardian, researchers with several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) discovered that some women in the DRC may have been asked to perform sex acts on healthcare personnel in exchange for potentially life-saving treatment, such as the Ebola vaccine. This sexual predation only adds to the cultural mistrust many Congolese already harbor against government aid workers. This culture of mistrust is further dampening relief efforts and contributing to the spread of the virus.

"This region of DRC has a long history of sexual violence and exploitation of women and girls. Though shocking, this is an issue that could have been anticipated," said Trina Helderman, who serves as Medair's global emergency response team's senior health and nutrition adviser. "Humanitarian actors should have been more prepared to put safety measures in place to prevent this from happening."

The ongoing exploitation of women and girls in the DRC was brought to light during a DRC Ministry of Health meeting earlier this month [February 2019]. Focus groups conducted by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) revealed that women and girls are feeling increasingly stigmatized as the outbreak continues. The DRC Ministry of Health has refuted the reports, saying that although some women in affected areas feared exploitation and attacks by healthcare workers and the local population, the ministry isn't aware of any reported occurrences.

"More importantly, no women reported individual cases of sexual exploitation to the IRC during the focus groups," the DRC Ministry of Health said in a statement, according to the Guardian. "These women and girls expressed their fears and concerns about the Ebola response considering the social and security context they live in."

[byline: Fiston Mahamba, Giulia Paravicini]

Attackers set fire to an Ebola treatment center run by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo late on [Sun 24 Feb 2019], forcing staff to evacuate patients, the charity said. There were no immediate details on the identity or motive of the people who torched the center in the district of Katwa, at the heart of the country's worst outbreak of the deadly disease. But WHO has said aid workers face mistrust in some areas, fueled by false rumors about treatments and preference for traditional medicine.

"As a result of the burning of the building, it is no longer possible to care for patients there," MSF said on Twitter on [Mon 25 Feb 2019]. None of the patients or staff were harmed [Sadly, a nurse did die in the attack. - see MoH report above].

https://www.irinnews.org/opinion/2019/02/20/first-person-stop-ebola-ask-rebels-help
[byline: Jean-Christophe Shako, Ebola response coordinator in Butembo]

I've worked on 4 Ebola outbreaks across Africa and have often found myself in tricky situations with local people who view outsiders with suspicion. During the 2014 outbreak in Guinea, for example, my team and I were threatened by villagers who ran after us with machetes. It only took a few days in Butembo, responding to the current outbreak in eastern Congo, before I was surrounded by an angry mob chanting "kill him", after they refused to allow our surveillance team to investigate a death in their neighbourhood. Such experiences have taught me that keeping your calm and speaking respectfully are the best ways to de-escalate tense and violent situations.

But I still wasn't prepared for my 1st experience of going face-to-face with Mai-Mai rebel leaders to negotiate access in Congo so our health teams could reach affected communities. They had never heard about Ebola nor the vaccination. So I spent more than 30 minutes explaining the virus to them, how it spreads, what the preventative measures are, and how the vaccination works.

Without saying a word, the village chief went outside and gathered the villagers. He said a few words in their local dialect while making big gestures. Then he allowed the titulaire [the nurse overseeing that health zone] to list all those who had been in contact with the baby boy so we could follow the chain of transmission. In total, 75 people came forward. Before leaving, we agreed to meet the next day in a neutral zone where vaccination teams and police agents would be allowed to come. At 8 am, everyone arrived and our teams began vaccinating.

- Fri 22 Feb 2019. Ebola vaccine developed by University of Hawai'i can withstand high heat
[University of Hawai'i News, edited]
https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2019/02/22/uh-ebola-vaccine-withstands-high-heat/
[byline: Tina Shelton]

There is more positive news to report about the Ebola subunit vaccine candidate developed by University of Hawai'i at Manoa scientist Axel Lehrer. The potential vaccine remains viable in extreme heat conditions for several months, which is especially important where the disease outbreaks so far have begun in rural, spread-out areas of hot, dry West Africa.

In his scientific article, "Thermostable Ebola virus vaccine formulations lyophilized in the presence of aluminum hydroxide", Lehrer demonstrates his vaccine can sustain immunogenicity, the ability to provoke an immune response in the body, after being stored at 104 deg F [40 deg C] for up to 12 weeks. "None of the other Ebola vaccines under development have the ability to withstand high temperatures, which is an ongoing concern in areas of the world where Filoviruses are endemic," said Lehrer, an assistant professor in the Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology and Pharmacology at UH Manoa's John A Burns School of Medicine. "The ability to stabilize our vaccine candidate to retain immunogenicity may not only have an impact on logistics, but also has the potential to reach more persons in need with fewer vaccine doses. This would be a tremendous advantage, especially in endemic areas, increasing the number of people receiving sufficient doses of the vaccine to protect them from disease."

Lehrer said he and his team are very encouraged by these preliminary results and look forward to their continuing collaborations with Soligenix, a late-stage biopharmaceutical company based in New Jersey and Lehrer's Hawai'i-based Ebola subunit vaccine collaborator Hawaii Biotech Inc. to further develop vaccines for Ebola and the filovirus.

The paper was published in the European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics [Chisholm CF, Kang TJ, Dong M, et al. Thermostable Ebola virus vaccine formulations lyophilized in the presence of aluminum hydroxide. Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 2019; 136: 213-20; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2019.01.019].

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Ebola virus (EBOV) can persist in immunologically protected body sites in survivors of Ebola virus disease, creating the potential to initiate new chains of transmission. From the outbreak in West Africa during 2014-2016, we identified 13 possible events of viral persistence-derived transmission of EBOV (VPDTe) and applied predefined criteria to classify transmission events based on the strength of evidence for VPDTe and source and route of transmission. For 8 events, a recipient case was identified; possible source cases were identified for 5 of these 8. For 5 events, a recipient case or chain of transmission could not be confidently determined. 5 events met our criteria for sexual transmission (male-to-female). One VPDTe event led to at least 4 generations of cases; transmission was limited after the other events. VPDTe has increased the importance of Ebola survivor services and sustained surveillance and response capacity in regions with previously widespread transmission.

[Infectious virus has been isolated from semen of Ebola survivors 82 days after symptom onset, and EBOV RNA has been detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) in semen 531 days after symptom onset. This is relevant for response planning, especially related to surveillance and response capacity, and for the development of policies and guidelines regarding survivor counseling, care, and management. - Mod.LK]
