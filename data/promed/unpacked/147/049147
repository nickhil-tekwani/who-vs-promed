The information we received from ProMED about possible introduction of West
Nile (-like? whatever that means) in the USA is a most impressive one. It
is once again a clear demonstration that we should all be aware about the
insidious invasion of microbes.
Many species (mammals, birds, insects) are susceptible to West Nile virus.
It has progressed out of Africa to more temperate regions, using presumably
mostly birds. Australia obviously was invaded by WN virus sometime ago and
I believe that Kunjin virus is the result of additive selections by local
vectors and hosts. South American yellow fever virus is an other example of
introduction of a flavivirus from Africa some centuries ago. Are we
experiencing today a repetition of these ancestral events? It appears from
genetic analyses that two subtypes of West Nile viruses cocirculate in
Africa. However, it seems that only one of these subtypes is related to
epidemics in humans and in horses in Africa and in Europe. It would be very
interesting and valuable to sequence the strains recently isolated New York
strains and to compare them with those responsible for recent outbreaks or
epidemics in Russia, Romania, and the Czech Republic. From such
comparisons we might be able to understand better evolution of the virus
and to establish links with epidemics that have occurred in the Old World.
I have some sequences of gene fragments of recent strains of West Nile
virus isolates which have not been published yet and would be happy to
share them with any investigators in New York or Fort Collins.
Another comment: Symptoms of West Nile encephalitis (which occur generally
in aged people), like in Japanese encephalitis, occur after the viremia has
decreased. Therefore, virus isolation is unlikely from serum samples of
patients with neurological syndromes. Virus isolates are usually from
mosquito pools or from the brain and spinal cord of fatal case (humans and
horses).
