------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 30 May 2007, the Ministry of Health in China has reported a
new case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
case was confirmed by the national laboratory on 23 May 2007.
The 19-year-old male soldier, serving in Fujian province, developed
fever and pneumonia-like symptoms on 9 May [2007] and was
hospitalized on 14 May [2007].
There is no initial indication to suggest he had contact with sick
birds prior to becoming unwell. Close contacts have been placed under
medical observation and all remain well.
Of the 25 cases confirmed to date in China, 15 have been fatal.
