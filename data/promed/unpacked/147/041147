The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said it confirmed the 1st case of infant botulism, investigating the routes of the infection. Infant botulism is a disease of the neuromuscular system that occurs in infants aged one year or under. The illness occurs when an infant ingests spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria, which proliferate in the intestines and produce toxins in the body.

The KCDC said the USA has about 100 cases of infant botulism a year. The _C. botulinum_ bacterium is not contagious, and human-to-human transmission does not occur.

The center said its investigation was on a 4-month-old infant in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, who was diagnosed with infant botulism after showing symptoms of poor feeding and drooping eyelids in early June 2019. The baby was hospitalized on 4 Jun 2019, and physicians requested a test by the KCDC to confirm the diagnosis. The test results found _C. botulinum_ bacteria in the patient's excrement.

The child is receiving stable treatment in a general ward, and the KCDC provided botulinum antitoxin to the hospital to treat the patient.

The KCDC said the center and North Jeolla Province dispatched epidemiologists to identify the infection routes and plan to secure additional samples from foods and residential environments for a precise analysis.

[Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, but most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breast-fed infants can develop this entity.

The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City [ProMED-mail: Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144]:

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [This form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12-months-old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG-IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below. - Mod.LL
