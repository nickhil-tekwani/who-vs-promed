[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Bayelsa State)
Date: Sat 14 Mar 2015

Following an outbreak of cholera at the school, 11 students of the Federal Government Girls College (FGGC), Imiringi in Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State are now lying critically ill at the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa. The situation at the school was said to be so critical that the authorities closed it Friday morning, 13 Mar 2015. The outbreak was said to have triggered pandemonium as parents rushed to the school to collect their wards and some people living in the area temporarily moved out. Imiringi is a neighboring community of the presidential homestead, Otuoke.

Cholera has been on the rise in Bayelsa State in recent months following an outbreak early in 2015 in Southern Ijaw and Sagbama local government areas. The actual casualty figure is yet to be ascertained even as the state Ministry of Health came under attack for alleged refusal to collaborate with the Federal Ministry of Health to tackle the menace.

The United Nations Children's Education Fund (UNICEF) had been carrying out some medical outreach programmes in Southern Ijaw and Sagbama local government areas to tackle the cholera outbreak.

When contacted about the condition of the 11 students, a source at the state Ministry of Health said the ministry had sent medical personnel to FMC, Yenagoa to ascertain the situation. The reaction read: "Ministry of Health has sent medical personnel to FMC to ascertain suspected cases of gastro-enteritis" but did not say what steps the ministry is taking to forestall further spread of the disease.

However, there is fear as most of the water for domestic use is from untreated sources especially in the rural areas where residents get water from rivers and streams led to the outbreak.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (southwest counties)
Date: Sat 14 Mar 2015

Cholera is still a threat in Nyanza and neighboring regions. The disease, which broke out in Migori, Homa Bay and Kisii counties in January 2015, has so far claimed 30 lives and affected 1500 people. But even as county governments put on brave faces and report that the disease has been contained, The Standard on Saturday, 14 Mar 2015, has established that there are new cases reported in Migori. The revelation is causing fear among residents in the region who depend on cross-border trade as they mingle and eat in restaurants in the area. There are concerns that school children are prone to the disease given that some learn in crowded conditions.

New cases of cholera have been reported in Migori County where 11 people were diagnosed in Nyatike and 6 in Rongo within the last 3 days. This brings to light the fact that the number of people who have died from the disease could even be bigger than what has been reported. Though campaigns against cholera are now being intensified in schools, it has emerged that most victims who have been treated in local hospitals and health centres were children under the age of 15.

According to statistics seen by The Standard on Saturday 14 Mar 2015, 6 school-going children died from the epidemic while 200 were infected over the last 10 weeks.

Cholera 1st broke out in Rongo, Migori County in February 2015, when 723 people were diagnosed in the public health facilities and 6 succumbed. Speaking to The Standard on Saturday, the county health director Joel Gondi said efforts to attain zero cholera infections in the county have been thwarted by lack of clean water supplies to households. "A larger percentage of Migori residents have got no access to clean water and this has been the root cause of faster spread of cholera in the county," said Dr Gondi.

He said a big section of the population depends on water from River Migori for domestic use, yet it is polluted. The director appealed to the public to treat the water before use to stem cholera.

[3] Cholera - Malawi (Nsanje District)
Dates: Thu 12 Mar 2015

http://allafrica.com/stories/201503120184.html


The country has registered 88 cases of cholera, and 2 people in Nsanje have succumbed to the outbreak. The Ministry of Health announced the development through its facebook page on Monday, 9 Mar 2015. "The affected districts are Nsanje with 78 cases and 2 deaths. Dedza has 1 case, Lilongwe has 1 case and Mwanza has reported 8 cases. These are the only districts that have reported cholera. Initially Chikhwawa was thought to have the cases but lab results turned out to be negative.

Minister of Health Dr. Jean Kalilani last Friday [6 Mar 2015] visited camps currently occupied by flood victims in Chikhwawa and Nsanje Districts to appreciate the extent of the need for health services. The camps visited were Bangula, Sorgin, Konzere and Sekeni 1. The health ministry has since urged people to always practice hygiene and use sanitary facilities to prevent further outbreak of cholera and other waterborne diseases.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (northeastern provinces)
Date: Tue 10 Mar 2015
Source: Newsday [edited]
https://www.newsday.co.zw/2015/03/10/cholera-cases-rise-to-12/


Confirmed cholera cases have risen to 12 while 3 more suspected cases at Birchenough Bridge were still to be verified, Health and Child Care minister David Parirenyatwa has said.

Addressing journalists in Harare yesterday, 9 Mar 2015, Parirenyatwa expressed concern that the government could fail to control the outbreak in congested cities such as Harare where there were chronic water and sewer challenges.

"Zimbabwe shares a long border with Mozambique (41 people have died of cholera in that country) in the eastern part and the 4 border provinces, Masvingo, Mashonaland East, Central and Manicaland, have been put on high alert," Parirenyatwa said. "Prevention of cholera depends on access to clean water and good hygienic standards, but currently Harare is battling a major water problem."

The disease can be transmitted through water and fresh foods especially fruits, fish and meat and pre-cooked food sold in the open. Zimbabwe experienced its worst cholera outbreak between August 2008 and July 2009 when almost 100 000 cases and 5000 deaths were reported in 55 of the country's 63 districts.

Following the confirmation of cholera cases in Mudzi, Chipinge and Beitbridge, surveillance and response activities have been activated including pre-positioning of cholera supplies. Government has in the meantime set up 3 treatment clinics and rolled out massive awareness campaigns against the disease in Mashonaland East Province.

Provincial medical director Simukai Zizhou yesterday told NewsDay that no fresh cases had been recorded while cholera patients detained in hospital last week had been treated and discharged.

The recent recurrence of cholera in the country especially in Mudzi has been attributed to the current outbreak of the disease in neighbouring Mozambique.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR (Katanga Province)
Date: Wed 4 Mar 2015

http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-03-dr-congo-cholera-cases-dead.html


A cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has infected 1500 people and caused 35 deaths in less than 2 months, the United Nations said on Wed 4 Mar 2015. The majority of the cases have been registered in the southern province of Katanga.

As Sylvestre Ntumba, spokesman for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told a press conference, "15 health zones have reported more than 1520 cases, including 35 deaths, during the first 7 weeks of 2015." If the trend continues, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that 2015 could see outbreak levels approach those of 2013 when 843 people died of cholera in Katanga, Ntumba said. The number of cases climbed from 7000 in 2012 to more than 9000 in 2014, peaking in 2013 with 14 000 cases, he said, adding that Katanga province alone had recorded half of all country-wide cases.

According to Ntumba, DR Congo has had a tough time tackling the epidemic because of limited access to safe water and sanitation facilities, poor hygiene, and a weak health system with poorly trained caregivers. In Katanga, less than 35 percent of households have access to safe drinking water and only 5 percent use proper toilets, he said.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that it was found that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in refugees from war-torn Bangladesh, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally based on glucose or rice powder, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
