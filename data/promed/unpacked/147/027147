I'll throw this out for what it's worth, my wife and her family raised
greyhounds in north Florida and had the same thing happen on their farm.
They lost 50 greyhounds to what ever this disease was, about ten or fifteen
years ago. The dogs had no outside contact with any other dogs and there
was no pattern to which dogs were affected. The illness would come on
sudden with symptoms similar to viral pneumonia with fluid coming from the
nose and bloody stool. The dogs who were affected die within 24 hours. The
University of Florida sent people to investigate, but they never found a
cause or what the disease was. If anyone on the list is a vet from the
University of Florida and is working with the current outbreak and would
like to check back the name of the farm was the Stubbs Farm in Madison,
Florida.

I am not a veterinarian, but I am aware that Ehrlichiosis causes a
hemorrhagic illness that is often fatal in dogs. It is endemic south of me
in the Sonoran desert area, is transmitted by ticks, and is a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs in this area. Two forms of
_Ehrlichia_ are now known to be pathogens in humans, including the same
organism causing disease in dogs. [From what little is known about the
clinical signs associated with the hemorrhagic disease in the racetrack
dogs in Florida, this would not be the cause. Although Erlichiosis can
cause hemorrhagic disorders the clinical presentation is very different and
not nearly so sudden as this. Thanks for the thoughts though.- Mod.TG

Sometime ago, you may remember a posting which I did, asking for
information regarding the exact same thing that is passing through the
Florida racetrack at this time. I, myself, experienced this phenomenon and
lost puppies. I am a dog breeder/exhibitor. Therefore, I hope that you
will be able to use what information we can provide you.
Symptoms were varied from lethargy to bleeding from every orifice. WBC's
were almost totally "eaten" in a matter of hours. Death usually occurred
within 6-24 hours from onset of signs. Some did not bleed at all. Some had
bloody stools. Some just laid down and died. There were a few survivors
and they appeared to be recovering when they were found dead, in a pool of
blood, 3-4 weeks into their recovery period. Parvo[virus testing while
the animals were alive was all negative. Necropsies varied with some
having no significant lesions, to others having enlarged organs. On my own
puppy, we sent out two separate samples to different locations. We tried to
isolate and grow whatever was the cause of the problem. One report came
back that nothing could be found and the culture did not work. The other
report came back as [positive for parvovirus. In one of the bodies that
was sent to Cornell, dead [parvovirus-infected cells were found in the
intestines. Remember, there were NO positive parvo[virus tests while the
animal was alive, only after death. And obviously, the clinical
presentation was NOTHING like we had ever seen with the classical
parvo[virus infections. [Parvovirus has been known to mutate and thus
present with different clinical signs. -Mod.TG My own veterinarian, was
truly astounded, when he was told the pups had [parvovirus infections. He
could not believe it and argued with both labs that the normal presentation
and clinical signs were not there. He developed a 'recipe', inserted
catheters in my pups for me, and I took them home and administered his
recipe every two hours ....drips would not work on such a small dog....of
the ones that we saved, I still have them today and have not had any
relapses.
The symptoms you have listed are like a bad memory to me. I have seen all
of this. Long Island was hit VERY hard not too long ago. I believe there
were over 200 deaths posted. The Midwest also lost great numbers. I know of
one particular kennel in Indiana, where all of this started, 2-3 years ago.

I have received requests for help as far away as the Netherlands, and some
vets have written me asking for information regarding this "mystery" for
books they were writing, but how can I comply? I only know what I have
seen, witnessed, been through myself and the data I have had access to
which I received from others with the same problem. [We have had no reports
of mysterious hemorrhagic diseases in Europe.- Mod.TG

[The posting about the hemorrhagic disease in dogs has generated many
questions that do not have answers. There seems to be a suggestion that
this "mystery" disease has appeared before. This may be a good epidemiology
project for someone. And until further clinical signs are available or a
diagnosis is released from the Florida veterinarians involved, this string
is cut. Mod.-TG
