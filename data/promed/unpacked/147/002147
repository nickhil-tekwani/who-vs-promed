In ProMED-mail post "Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (02): (WA) 20110807.2387," there was an error in the naming of the outbreak
location, which was incorrectly said to be Washington State. The case
of eastern equine encephalitis is in New York state, not in Washington
State.

This moderator apologizes for the error in location.

With rare exception, usually in birds, we never see eastern equine
encephalitis on the west coast of the US.
