A baffling disease causing elephants to lose control of their trunks,
making it hard for them to eat and communicate, is probably caused by a
toxic plant, a Swiss researcher said on Saturday.
He said a team of researchers was trying to home in on the source of
"floppy trunk disease," [formerly called flaccid trunk syndrome which has
affected dozens of elephants, mostly males, in Zimbabwe and South Africa.
Biologists have feared pollution is to blame, but have been unable to find
a direct cause. Kurt Hostettmann of Lausanne University in Switzerland said
his group -- which usually searches for natural sources of new drugs --
believes a poisonous plant could be responsible and he has narrowed the
list of potential culprits down to 2 or 3.
Floppy trunk disease, first reported in 1989 around Lake Kariba in
Zimbabwe, starts at the tip of the trunk and moves up, eventually causing
total paralysis. This is disaster for an elephant, which uses its trunk to
eat, drink and communicate with other elephants.
"We have absolutely no idea how to treat them. That's why we have to find
urgently the cause," Hostettmann told a news conference at the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
They have put radio collars on several of the elephants to track their
movements. Some elephants have died, although a few have recovered, as
well. Biologists know of about 40 affected animals in Zimbabwe and South
Africa's Kruger Park.
Hostettmann said he thought a plant might be responsible when he saw some
samples of brain taken from an elephant that died of floppy trunk disease.
The damage to the nerve cells resembled that done by other neurotoxic plants.
He said the problem started as elephants began losing habitat and were
forced into smaller areas that did not contain the plant varieties they
were used to eating."They used to graze on many plants but now they graze
on stuff they don't like," he said.
The plant theory could explain both why such a small area in Zimbabwe is
affected and also why bull males seem to be the primary victims,
Hostettmann said.
"The animals come down to drink water, and then the females and the young
go back into the trees, where there is shelter," Hostettmann told
reporters. There is also a wider variety of forage in the forests.
But the biggest, strongest bull elephants stay out in the open, where
Hostettmann, an expert in the chemistry of plants, believes they are eating
less-desirable vegetation and perhaps even alien species introduced from
elsewhere.
