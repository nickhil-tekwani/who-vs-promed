A new disease has been confirmed in an elk harvested near Whitebird, Idaho last year [2018]. This is the 1st confirmed case of Treponema associated hoof disease (TAHD), a disease that "is caused by a spirochete bacterium that causes hoof abnormalities and lameness in elk," in the state, Local News 8 reports.

Previously found in elk within Washington and Oregon, the disease is not widespread yet; however, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is working on a study at Washington State University (WSU) to understand more about TAHD and its impact on elk herds. Biologists and veterinarians do not know for sure how the disease is transmitted between animals or where it actually originates.

Samples from the Idaho elk were sent to researchers involved with the project for "definitive diagnosis and testing," according to Local News 8. While TAHD is not currently affecting domestic livestock, the Idaho Fish and Game Department is also working with the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.

The 1st case of TAHD was confirmed in Washington in 2000 and, in 2014, was also discovered in Northwest Oregon, according to Local News 8. IDFG (Idaho Fish and Game) did not believe the disease was even in the state until this recent elk harvest. Because of this, IDFG plans on monitoring TAHD more closely and asks that anyone who sees an elk that has trouble walking or odd-shaped hooves to contact the agency here or by calling IDFG's Wildlife Health Laboratory at 208-939-9171.

[In cattle, sheep and goats, hoof disease is a syndrome with multifactorial causes, although it always includes a bacterial component. While in cattle, small domestic ruminants and camelids, the main bacterium implicated is _Fusobacterium necrophorum_, in elk (_Cervus elaphus_), the disease has been found strongly associated with the spirochete _Treponema_ sp., and has hence been named Treponeme-associated hoof disease (TAHD).

TAHD in elk is a debilitating and progressive condition, sharing similarities to bovine digital dermatitis and contagious ovine digital dermatitis. Initial studies showed adult elk had chronic hoof overgrowth, sole ulcers, and sloughed hoof capsules.

The disease emerged in 2008 and spread throughout the region, encompassing initially Washington and Oregon, and now reaching populations inhabiting Idaho. - Mod.PMB
