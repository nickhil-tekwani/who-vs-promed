Since the dawn of [Sun 5 Jun 2022], the medical emergency department at Abdelkader Natour Hospital in the city of Skikda has received 18 people, ranging in age from 23 to 57 years, who showed symptoms of severe poisoning with by high body temperature and vomiting accompanied by diarrhea and nausea.

According to what hospital sources revealed to Al-Chorouk, the cases received by the emergency department were sporadic and at different times, as 4 affected women were transferred from the Al-Sharaa municipality at dawn on [Sun 5 Jun 2022] to the emergency department after suffering from continuous vomiting and diarrhea, where they received the necessary treatment.

The number of people affected with food poisoning increased in the evening of the same day, reaching 14 patients, including children, all suffering from the same symptoms. A total of 4 of them were placed under medical supervision due to the seriousness of their health condition, while the others were allowed to leave after receiving treatment.

Our sources added that during the interrogation of the affected, they all confirmed to the doctors that they ate sweets (candies) and refreshments on the same day from one of the shops in the city of Al-Qul.

At the same time, the concerned authorities represented by the services of the Directorate of Trade and the services of Hygiene, together with the services of the Directorate of Health and Security, began their investigations to find out the causes of this mass poisoning. The incident came with the beginning of the summer season.

On the other hand, our sources stated that over Sunday night [5 Jun 2022] and Monday morning [6 June 2022], several cases that arrived at the hospital were registered after presenting with the same symptoms, bringing the total number to about 30 cases.

[Vomiting and diarrhea are relatively non-specific signs associated with many gastrointestinal (GI) distress.

If there is more evidence or a firm diagnosis from knowledgeable sources, ProMED would appreciate the information. - Mod.TG

In assessing possible diagnoses in potentially foodborne illnesses, one important piece of information is the incubation period which is the time between ingestion of the suspected food vehicle and the onset of symptoms. Short incubation periods (minutes to a few hours) are usually related to chemical toxins or preformed biological toxins, although heavy metal ingestion can present similarly. - Mod.LL
