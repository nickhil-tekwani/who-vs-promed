New research shows that Australia's most commonly found mosquito has
the potential to transmit yellow fever. For many decades the deadly
disease has been restricted to South America and Africa where it is
spread by the so-called yellow fever mosquito -- _Aedes aegypti_. In
Australia, _Aedes aegypti_ exists in northern Queensland where it is
responsible for dengue outbreaks. But scientists have found that a
native mosquito found throughout Australia is able to transmit yellow
fever [virus] and other nasty exotic viruses.

[Mod.DHA contacted Dr Van Den Hurk, who indicated that the mosquito
mentioned above is _Aedes notoscriptus_. A fact sheet issued by the
Department of Medical Entomology of the University of Sydney
(http://medent.usyd.edu.au/photos/aedes%20notoscriptus.htm; includes
a description and picture of the mosquito) states, "This species is
arguably the major domestic pest species in south eastern Australia;
it has been incriminated as an important vector of dog heartworm, has
been shown to be able to carry Murray Valley encephalitis, and
transmit Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses in laboratory studies.
Any role as a vector of arboviruses remains unknown. Adults readily
attack humans by day in shaded areas but also feed during evening,
night, and early morning. It is found in New South Wales, Victoria,
South Australia, Tasmania, (also Queensland, Northern Territory, and
Western Australia); domestic and also sylvan in forested areas with
tree-holes and/or rockpools."

Now, yellow fever virus can be added to the list of viruses that this
mosquito can transmit experimentally. One hopes that yellow fever
virus (YFV) will never arrive in Australia in a viremic human coming
from a YFV endemic area in South America or Africa, but it is not
beyond the realm of possibility, however remote the probability.
