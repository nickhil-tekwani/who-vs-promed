ABSTRACT
Cholera continues to be an important cause of human infections, and
outbreaks are often observed after natural disasters, such as the one
following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Once the cholera outbreak was
confirmed, rumors spread that the disease was brought to Haiti by a
battalion of Nepalese soldiers serving as United Nations peacekeepers.
This possible connection has never been confirmed.

We used whole-genome sequence typing (WGST), pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to
characterize 24 recent _Vibrio cholerae_ isolates from Nepal and
evaluate the suggested epidemiological link with the Haitian outbreak.
The isolates were obtained from 30 Jul 2010 to 1 Nov 2010 from 5
different districts in Nepal. We compared the 24 genomes to 10
previously sequenced _V. cholerae_ isolates, including 3 from the
Haitian outbreak (began July 2010). Antimicrobial susceptibility and
PFGE patterns were consistent with an epidemiological link between the
isolates from Nepal and Haiti. WGST showed that all 24 _V. cholerae_
isolates from Nepal belonged to a single monophyletic group that also
contained isolates from Bangladesh and Haiti.

The Nepalese isolates were divided into 4 closely related clusters.
One cluster contained 3 Nepalese isolates and 3 Haitian isolates that
were almost identical, with only 1- or 2-bp differences. Results in
this study are consistent with Nepal as the origin of the Haitian
outbreak. This highlights how rapidly infectious diseases might be
transmitted globally through international travel and how public
health officials need advanced molecular tools along with standard
epidemiological analyses to quickly determine the sources of
outbreaks.

The number of deaths caused by the cholera epidemic in the Dominican
Republic has reached 109, while there are 15 876 suspect cases,
according to figures revealed Friday [19 Aug 2011] by the health
authorities.

A statement by the Health Ministry reads that the intensity of the
outbreak has been decreasing since 6 weeks ago, but the region of Gran
Santo Domingo, which includes the capital city, still faces a serious
epidemic situation.

The preventive measures undertaken by the government include informing
the population, careful observation of diarrhea cases, providing
drinkable water and building new public toilets as part of efforts to
contain the outbreak, the statement added.

The latest Cholera outbreak appeared last November [2010] in the
country, a month after the 1st cases were reported in Haiti.
