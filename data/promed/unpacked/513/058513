PPR in Wild Goats (_Capra aegagrus_) and domestic goats Kurdistan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Feb 2011, samples were sent to the National Reference
Laboratory for Peste des petits ruminants (PPR),
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut. [This most probably refers to the
Institute of Diagnostic Virology, FLI, Riems, Germany. - Mod.AS]

Partial autolysis of the organ samples was recorded. The samples were
analysed for PPRV-genomes using 2 different real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
methods (Bao et al. 2008 and CiRAD-protocol), partial sequencing of
the PPRV genomes. The PPRV-vaccine was not the source of
PPRV-infection in wild goats.

Based on a BLAST search, the partial NP-sequence of PPRV field
strains showed the highest homology (98.9 percent) to the PPRV-strain
'Turkey 2000" (GenBank Accesion-No. AJ849636).

Conclusions:
In 3 of the 4 investigated wild goats, PPRV-genomes could be
detected. Based on the observed very high viral genoms load (low
Ct-values) in several samples, an acute PPRV infection can be
supposed.

The partial sequencing of the field samples in comparison to the
PPRV-vaccine used in the according area of Kurdistan (Iraq) confirms
an infection of wild goats with a PPRV field strain, closely related
to the PPRV strain "Turkey 2000."

[According to the earlier (10 Apr 2011] communication from Dr Murad,
the wild goats, clinically suspected to be affected by PPR, were
located near the Turkish border. PPR is known to be endemic in Turkey,
where mass vaccinations are applied in sheep and goats (2010
semi-annual OIE report). Iraq is similarly known to be PPR-infected,
with mass vaccinations applied (last available report, 2008).

PPR has been recorded in wild ruminants in several countries.
According to CFSPH (Iowa State University) technical factsheet
(updated 30 Aug 2008), "PPR can affect some wild ungulates, but there
is very limited information on species susceptibility and the
occurrence of disease. PPR was confirmed as the cause of 2 severe
outbreaks, one in captive Dorcas gazelles (_Gazella dorcas_) and
Thomson's gazelles (_Gazella thomsoni_) in Saudi Arabia in 2002, and
the other in buffalo in India in 1995. PPR is also thought to have
caused another outbreak that affected both gazelles and deer in Saudi
Arabia in the 1980s. White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) can
be infected experimentally. In addition, PPR has been reported in
captive Nubian ibex [which is genetically closely related to wild
goats], Laristan sheep and gemsbok. Whether wild ruminants are
important in the epidemiology of this disease is unknown."

OIE's Working Group on wildlife diseases (WGWD) was asked to
participate in and recommend persons with wildlife expertise to
participate in the OIE ad hoc group formed to draft a new Terrestrial
Code chapter on PPR. WGWD discussed the issue during its last meeting
(12-15 Oct 2010) and drafted a short list of appropriate experts from
the wildlife field around the world.

The wild goat (Bezoar Ibex, _Capra aegagrus_) is distributed from
Europe and Asia Minor to central Asia and the Middle East. It is the
ancestor of the domestic goat. For a picture, see

The exemplary transparency demonstrated by Dr Talib Murad, providing
information on an additional wild species affected by PPR, will --
hopefully -- inspire animal health authorities in the region to
improve their reporting records. - Mod.AS]
