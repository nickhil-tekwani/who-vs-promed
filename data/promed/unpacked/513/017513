Bileca Mayor Ratko Vukoje on Thu 26 Jul 2001 issued an order on
fighting the anthrax disease in animals, which has appeared in the
municipality after 30 years.
According to the order, all cattle must be vaccinated, and this can be
done in the Veterinary Station in Bileca, which has enough injections.
The order states that people must be careful with the [carcasses] of the
animals that die rapidly, because the disease is also dangerous for the
people.
"The disease is currently reported in the Local Community Divin where
12 cows have died so far," veterinary inspector Vesna Milosevic said.
