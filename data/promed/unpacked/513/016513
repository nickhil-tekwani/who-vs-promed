In a follow-up on the salmonellosis outbreak among schoolkids in Flanders, Belgium, the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) now reports 225 children suspected of becoming ill due to salmonella contamination in 38 schools in East and West Flanders.

Salmonellosis was laboratory confirmed in 129 children from 26 different schools; it is also strongly suspected in other children since they have similar symptoms. The only common denominator is the caterer.

AFSCA is closely investigating three potential routes of contamination: raw materials, infrastructure, and catering staff. Last week [week of 21 May 2018], they collected about 90 food samples and surfaces that have since been analyzed. The 1st results are expected later this week.

They also announced that caterer will not resume its activities this week as the investigation is still ongoing.

[This is a significant school-related outbreak of salmonellosis. The vehicle for transmission has not yet been elucidated. Undercooked chicken, dairy, or eggs are common transmitters of the zoonotic salmonella bacterium to man.

Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium. - Mod.LL
