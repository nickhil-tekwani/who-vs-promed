[2] Cholera - Tanzania (Rukwa Region)

At least 7 people have died from cholera outbreaks in western Tanzania's district of Sumbawanga, authorities said Tue 22 May 2018.

Halfan Haule, Sumbawanga District Commissioner, said that about 166 cases of the disease have been registered, just 10 days after the killer disease was reported to hit the area. Sumbawanga is one of the 3 districts of Rukwa Region.

Haule revealed this when speaking during the regional health committee, which met to discuss strategies to combat cholera and prevent an Ebola outbreak, which has been reported in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He said that cholera was lastly reported in the region in November 2017 and was successfully eradicated in March 2019.

According to the official, the 1st case was reported on 12 May 2018, and areas that been affected by the disease include Maenje, Milepa, Kapaenta, Mkusi, Tunko and Laela villages. The official attributed the frequent outbreak of the disease to the paddy harvesting season, saying that farmers are accustomed to drinking un-boiled water when camping at the farms to harvest. He said the district is also facing a shortage of water treatment liquids (chlorine dioxide) or water guard.

Bonifas Kasululu, Rukwa regional medical officer, said they have established special camps equipped with all necessary supplies for health attendants and patients.

Joachim Wangabo, Rukwa Regional Commissioner, also directed local government leaders to start registering all the residents with the aim of identifying newcomers. He stressed the need for stakeholders and the regional government to put in place strategies that will completely eradicate cholera. "We can eradicate cholera by educating our people on the importance of drinking boiled water and ensuring cleanliness of the environment.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Adamawa State)

Health officials have confirmed the deaths of 12 people in a cholera outbreak in Mubi North and Mubi South Local Government Areas of Adamawa state.

Incident Manager, Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and Director of Public Health in the state's Ministry of Health Dr. Bwalki Barem Dilli disclosed this to newsmen in Yola, saying that 12 died, while 134 others were receiving treatment.

According to him, officials had reported a suspected cholera outbreak last week after the General Hospital in Mubi recorded high profile cases of vomiting and diarrhea.

Following the development, he said medical personnel from the ministry in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) had mobilized to the area.

Dilli added that the health ministry and its partners so far collected 11 stool samples from patients for laboratory investigation at the Maiduguri Teaching Hospital in Borno State, while an emergency operation center was opened to collect data on people suspected to be affected.

"People need to be washing their hands after answering the call of nature and stop defecating in an open space," Dilli said.

[5] Cholera - Kenya (Turkana, Garissa counties)

Floods that have in recent weeks left over 180 people dead and more than 300 000 displaced have triggered a deadly outbreak of cholera in Kenya. The waterborne disease has claimed scores and infected hundreds of civilians in the ill-fated East African country.

Doctors Without Borders, the volunteer medical experts' organization, reported that the cholera outbreak was most severe in the Turkana and Garissa counties. At least 5 people have died in Dagahaley camp in the Dadaab refugee complex in Garissa in the last month. In Turkana, not less than 7 people have died after more than 700 patients were admitted with cholera.

Doctors Without Borders runs a 100-bed hospital and 2 health posts in Turkana and Garissa where its teams have treated more than 250 patients with cholera in their treatment center. "We are concerned that we could see more patients come in if the heavy rains and flooding continue like this," lamented Alfred Davies Jr, the field coordinator for Dagahaley.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
