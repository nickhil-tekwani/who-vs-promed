Another person has died after being infected with _Listeria_ bacteria from a Danish sausage company, bringing the death toll of the disease outbreak to 13, the State Serum Institute (SSI) said Tuesday [19 Aug 2014]. A total of 24 people have so far been confirmed with the infection, as 3 new cases were reported on Monday [18 Aug 2014], according to the SSI.

A Hedehusene-based sausage company, Joern A. Rullepoelser A/S, has proved to be the main source of infection. The company has been shut down, and all its products were withdrawn from shelves.

On Sunday [17 Aug 2014], the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration submitted a report on its handling of the listeriosis outbreak, saying it did not respond quickly enough in tracing the problem. "When it is proved there is a direct connection between the food products and deaths, the authorities should immediately launch a thorough investigation of the specific company," Minister for food, agriculture and fishery Dan Joergensen said in a press release. "That hasn't happened quickly enough, which is lamentable," said the minister.

The head of the emergency management unit of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration was removed from his post.

[The total number of cases of listeriosis linked to Danish rullepoelse has risen from 20 to 24 and deaths from 12 to 13.

The implicated food source (rullepoelse) was only recalled on Mon 11 Aug 2014. Because some product may still be in consumers' refrigerators and the long incubation period of up to 2 months, additional cases can be expected. A warning about the Danish _Listeria_-contaminated rullepoelse has also appeared directed at Norwegian consumers since Danish rullepoelse is eaten in other Scandinavian countries.

Rullepoelse, meaning "rolled sausage" in Danish, is a piece of pork belly (also can be made with beef flank or lamb) that is flattened out and spread with herbs and seasoning (salt, pepper, allspice), chopped onions and in some variants also parsley, then rolled up, placed in a brine for a number of days and then placed in a special press, cooled and sliced thinly as a cold cut for the Danish open-faced sandwich, smoerrebroed; usually garnished with a thick slice of gelatinized bouillon (Danish, sky) and rings of raw onion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiced_meat_roll). A similar "rolled sausage" is also eaten in Norway and Sweden.

The news report says that a meat product made by Joern A. Rullepoelser A/S has been proven to be the main source of infection but does not say how this was proven. Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the Danish cases with each other and with isolates from suspected foods would help to establish whether a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source.
