A comment on transportation of suspected monkeypox-infected animals
--------------------------------------------------
Aren't the orthopoxviruses known for their environmental stability? It
seems to me that the recommendation to house a suspect animal in the
"bed of a pickup truck" could engender aerosol infection of the wild
prarie dogs that often have colonies near roadways (at least here in the
West). Where is the greater risk -- possible contamination of the
environment by an infected animal shedding virus from the bed of a
truck, or extended exposure of the already-exposed human driving the
animal to the clinic?? A quick check of Field's and the CDC smallpox
vaccination recommendations did not yield any information on the
stability of orthopoxviruses in sunlight...
Maybe the recommendation should be to keep the animal in the vehicle, but
cover it with a thick blanket or towel to decrease air flow (and then
thoroughly clean the car).

I am writing with respect to the ProMED-mail post about recommendations for
dealing with animals potentially infected with monkeypox. The following
statement is made :
"During transport animals should be confined in a closed container such as a
cardboard box. If available, the animal should be confined in a separate
compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a pickup truck."
Prairie dogs and other rodents are very capable of chewing through a
cardboard box, and if that box was in the bed of a pickup truck then you
would have a potentially infected animal on the run. Perhaps a sturdier
transport container such as a small dog carrier should be suggested.

Another Comment
----------------
In the CDC recommendations for transporting animals with monkeypox, it
stated the following: "If available, the animal should be confined in a
separate compartment of the vehicle, such as the bed of a pickup truck."
Wouldn't this method of transportation increase the chances of introducing
the virus into the environment and spreading it to other animals and to
people in the immediate area, since preventing areosolization is a
consideration controlling infection? ("Soiled laundry should not be shaken
or otherwise handled in a manner that may aerosolize infectious particles").
Seems better that an owner who has already been exposed to the animal should
keep the animal in a closed vehicle while transporting to limit wider spread
of the virus.

[This recommendation should be read in the context of the preceding sentence,
which recommends using a closed container. - Mod.JW]
[I agree with all 3 correspondents with regard to the transportation of
prairie dogs. However the advice provided by the CDC may relate to the
transportation of potentially infected Gambian rats. The Gambian rat is the
animal presumed to be the source of the monkeypox outbreak. Prairie dogs are
ground squirrels, whereas the Gambian rat is a type of rodent known as a
pouched rat. Gambian rats can be rather large animals, 2 feet or more in
length and 3-5 pounds in weight. The standard housing for these animals
would be cages with 3 x 2 x 2 ft dimensions. Consequently it might not be
practical to transport these animals inside a vehicle as opposed to on the
bed of a pickup truck.
Provided adequate care is taken to contain infection, the precise mode of
transport is not an issue, since infection is predominantly transmitted by
contact rather than by aerosolization. A greater hazard would be accidental
release of an infected pet animal into the wild.
Nonetheless, perhaps the CDC should clarify their recommendations. - Mod.CP]
