Malaria reported from Bantwal, Karnataka, blamed on migrant workers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the monsoon rains not arriving in [Bantwal] taluk [administrative division], 28 cases of malaria have been detected already. This was revealed during the taluk quarterly KDP [Karnataka Development Programme] meeting held at SGSY auditorium, BC Road, on [Mon 30 Apr 2012].

Taluk health officer Dr Deepa Prabhu revealed this at the KDP meeting chaired by MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] Ramanath Rai [in Bantwal] on Mon 30 Apr 2012. "Out of the 28 cases of malaria detected in the taluk, 7 were reported from Kurnad primary health centre, and 21 from different primary health centers across the taluk," added Dr Prabhu.

"The migrant labourers from Bagalkot, Bijapur, and other districts [in Karnataka] engaged in building construction in the taluk are spreading malaria. 2 cases of leprosy have been reported in the limits of Vamadapadav primary health center. Both malaria and leprosy cases are undergoing treatment by the department," she added.

Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, malaria cases on the rise
------------------------------------------------
After a lull of a few months, the district [East Singhbhum] health department is back on alert in the wake of the rise in cases of malaria over the last week. The district, which had recorded 4000 malaria cases including about 20 deaths in 2011, has geared up its health mechanism after reports of 2 deaths from the disease in the last couple of days.

The government-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital (MGMH) [in Jamshedpur, also known as Steel City and Tata] is getting visits from about 15 malaria patients every day. "At this stage, the bed capacity is adequate to admit the malaria patients but in case the number increases we will confront problems in admitting the patients," said MGMH superintendent Dr SS Prasad.

In the last 30 hours, 2 people died of malaria fever in MGMH. Similarly, malaria patients are queuing up in several city-based private hospitals and nursing homes.

In the last 24 hours, over 50 patients with symptoms of the disease were diagnosed at various hospitals and nursing homes. Civil surgeon Vibha Sharan said multi-purpose workers (MPW) have been pressed into service in the malaria-affected areas and announced the carrying out of cleaning drives in malaria-prone areas. In his letter to all the hospitals and nursing homes, including Tata Main Hospital, Telco Hospital, and MGMH, the district health surveillance officer, Swaran Singh, has asked respective hospital managements to maintain data of such patients. "And also keep updating the daily figure with the anti-malaria cell of the district health department," was Dr Singh's request.

Apart from the several slums in the city periphery, Dhalbhumgarh, Potka, Musabani, and Patamda blocks have a number of malaria patients. As part of the anti-malaria measures, the department has announced the speedy spraying of disinfectants and larvicides at identified places.

In the wake of high number of malaria and dengue cases that came to light in 2011, a team of entomologists from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, which arrived [in Jamshedpur] on the request of the district administration, detected a large number of the dengue-spreading larvae of _Aedes aegypti_ in the city. Besides, teams from Delhi's National Communicable Disease Centre and Kolkata's School of Tropical Medicines that came [to Jamshedpur] in 2011 confirmed the presence of dengue and chikungunya [virus infections].
