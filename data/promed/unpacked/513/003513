Abstract
------
Zoonoses, diseases affecting both humans and animals, can exert tremendous pressures on human and veterinary health systems, particularly in resource-limited countries. Anthrax is 1 such zoonosis of concern and is a disease requiring greater public health attention in Nigeria. Here we describe the genetic diversity of _Bacillus anthracis_ in Nigeria and compare it to Chad, Cameroon and a broader global dataset based on the multiple locus variable number tandem repeat (MLVA-25) genetic typing system. Nigerian _B. anthracis_ isolates had identical MLVA genotypes and could only be resolved by measuring highly mutable single nucleotide repeats (SNRs). The Nigerian MLVA genotype was identical or highly genetically similar to those in the neighboring countries, confirming that the strains belong to this unique West African lineage. Interestingly, sequence data from a Nigerian isolate shares the anthrose-deficient genotypes previously described for strains in this region, which may be associated with vaccine evasion. Strains in this study were isolated over 6 decades, indicating a high level of temporal strain stability regionally. Ecological niche models were used to predict the geographic distribution of the pathogen for all 3 countries. We describe a west-east habitat corridor through northern Nigeria extending into Chad and Cameroon. Ecological niche models and genetic results show _B. anthracis_ to be ecologically established in Nigeria. These findings expand our understanding of the global _B. .anthracis_ population structure and can guide regional anthrax surveillance and control planning.

Author Summary
----------
Anthrax, caused by the soil-borne bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, is a disease with important public health and national security implications globally. Understanding the global genetic diversity of the pathogen is important for epidemiological and forensic investigations of anthrax events. Toward this, we describe _B. anthracis_ genetic diversity in Nigeria and confirm it belongs to a unique West African genetic group not yet reported beyond neighboring Cameroon and Chad and Mali. This refines the global phylogeny of _B. anthracis_, allowing the development of more accurate diagnostics. We coupled these efforts with ecological niche modeling to map the geographic distribution of this strain group across the region. Suitable habitat for the pathogen is predicted across central Nigeria from west to east into Cameroon and Chad. Understanding the geography of _B. anthracis_ plays an important role in informing public health by targeting disease control to high-risk regions. This is particularly important in resource-limited areas where intervention strategies are constrained and zoonotic disease risk is high.

[Members are encouraged to read the full paper, as critical articles on anthrax in West Africa are infrequent, and note that it appears that these strains may be vaccine evasive, which if confirmed will necessitate a reconsideration of the vaccines to be used in future livestock control programmes in this part of Africa. This paper compares Nigerian strains to those known in Chad and Cameroon, and through niche modelling indicates the presence of a possible spatial high-risk band from southern Chad across northern Nigeria. - Mod.MHJ
