The declining number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles in England observed in May and June 2013 (194 and 116, respectively) continued in July 2013 with a total of 73 cases, bringing the number reported since the start of the year to 1365 cases. The South-West region reported the most cases (33), many of which were associated with an on-going outbreak linked to the Glastonbury music festival. As reported in June 2013, the highest proportion of cases were in children aged 1-4 years (17/73 23 percent), a shift from the 10-14 year age group most affected earlier in the year. The proportion of cases aged 10-16 years (12/73 16 percent) -- the age group targeted in the on-going MMR catch-up campaign -- was similar to that reported in June 2013.

So far this year [2013], 274 (20 percent) cases have been associated with secondary school outbreaks. Small outbreaks have also been reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low vaccine coverage such as the travelling community and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in north London. Overall, 283 (21 percent) of all cases in 2013 were admitted to hospital; 39 reported complications including pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

In England, most of the cases with an onset date in July 2013 that have been sequenced are a D8 genotype. The MVs/Taunton.GBR/27.12/ [D8] strain continues to be the main virus type, but with a cluster of cases of a different D8 strain in the South West region, and sporadic genotype B3 strains in a couple of regions.

As previously reported, the shift towards cases in secondary school age groups during 2013 is likely to be due to the fall in coverage of MMR between 1999 and 2005. To reduce the risk of larger outbreaks of measles in the next academic year, Public Health England, the Department of Health and NHS England announced an MMR catch-up programme in late April 2013. The campaign has targeted children aged between 10 and 16 years who have a record of none or incomplete MMR vaccination. Returns from the NHS Areas Teams confirm that almost 5000 practices have already signed up to participate in the programme. The service involves sending letters from general practices inviting under-vaccinated children to attend the surgery for vaccination. The primary target population was the estimated 8 percent of that age group who had received no vaccine (around 1/3rd of a million); secondary targets included a similar number of that age group who had received one dose of MMR and a similar number of children in other age groups.

Data has been extracted from just over 2000 practices (around a quarter of the total) on the MMR status of children turning 10 to 16 years of age in July 2013. Comparing this with children aged 9-15 years in 2012, it suggests that the proportion recorded as unvaccinated fell by around 1.5 percent (representing around 17 000 children in the participating practices). If this progress was replicated nationally, this suggests that around 65 000 unvaccinated children have received MMR since last year [2012]. The proportion recorded as having received 2 doses of MMR has increased by 2.2 percent. Although some of this may represent data cleaning, this scale of increase is consistent with the vaccine ordering data, which suggests that around 200 000 extra doses have been used. So far, most vaccination has been conducted in primary care, although school campaigns were conducted in response to local outbreaks in many areas during the last academic year. Plans are being developed to sustain these activities and to undertake specific programmes in some schools during the next 2 terms.

[These figures indicate that the various strategies designed to contain and reverse the measles outbreaks that afflict the UK are beginning to take effect and that the magnitude of the outbreaks will decline significantly in subsequent months. Of special interest are the data showing that most of the cases with an onset date in July 2013 are D8 genotype. The MVs/Taunton.GBR/27.12/ [D8] strain continues to be the main virus type, but with a cluster of cases of a different D8 strain in the South West region, and sporadic genotype B3 strains in a couple of regions. - Mod.CP

Kalibo in Aklan province has been placed under state emergency due to an outbreak of measles in the town. Reports said members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Kalibo recently passed a resolution after a special session on Wednesday [4 Sep 2013]. The regional office of the Department of Health also recorded 15 cases of measles in the town, most of which were in Brgy. Andagao.

In the entire Western Visayas, the health department also reported 24 cases of measles.

Since January this year [2013], the Aklan Provincial Health Office registered some 77 suspected measles cases, which the Department of Health [DOH] is still evaluating. Of these suspected cases, 2 persons reportedly had died.

The DOH has observed that the month of July 2013 has seen the largest number of measles cases in the province.

A measles outbreak in the Fraser Health region has prompted a broader warning to residents and health professionals to be on the lookout for the disease. Public health officials say 4 confirmed cases of measles have turned up in Burnaby, Surrey, Abbotsford and Chilliwack, and several more patients have symptoms consistent with measles. Fraser Health is investigating to see whether the cases are linked. So far, there's no known source of exposure to measles; most infections are normally from travel to another country. "These people haven't travelled, so we really have no idea where they picked it up," said medical health officer Dr. Michelle Murti, adding the new cases are unrelated to each other.

All the recent cases were either unimmunized, incompletely immunized, or didn't know their immunization status, she said. Anyone born after 1956 should have 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine, although many have had just one or none at all. The new cases in Burnaby and Surrey each had one vaccination, which Murti said underscores the case for getting 2 doses. Advice and vaccinations are being offered to anyone who may have been in contact with those infected, and anyone who is unsure about their measles immunization can get the vaccine for free from doctors, clinics and some pharmacies.

There were 3 cases on Bowen Island or Whistler in June 2013. And in August 2013, Fraser Health warned that a measles-infected visitor to Abbotsford Regional Hospital exposed about 60 women and newborns in a post-natal unit. The disease is most serious for infants, who die at a rate of one for every 3000 infections in developed countries. It's much worse in the 3rd world, which accounts for most of the 150 000 annual measles deaths worldwide. The risk of fatalities as well as significant complications like pneumonia and brain inflammation are why health leaders encourage vaccination.

Public health officials are concerned about a once-common childhood illness that appears to be making a comeback in the USA. Measles once killed one in every 1000 infected. In the United States alone, the childhood infection killed 500 Americans a year at its peak, according to USA Today. Measles can lead to bronchitis, encephalitis or pneumonia, according to the National Library of Medicine, and complications can lead to death. Thanks to vaccinations, however, the disease was stopped in its tracks, with officials calling it eradicated in the Western hemisphere.

However, nationwide there has been a growing trend of parents who refuse to get vaccinations for their children. And now, the nation has seen 125 cases of measles so far this year [2013]. At least 25 cases have been reported in Texas linked to a church whose senior pastor was critical of measles vaccinations. North Carolina has seen 23 cases, and New York has diagnosed at least 58, according to USA Today. Opponents of vaccinations often cite religious beliefs or a fear that the vaccinations aren't safe. For example, parents heard conflicting information about a link between the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinations and autism. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes there is no scientifically proved link.

Other opponents say that vaccinations aren't needed because the diseases have disappeared. Scientists dispute that notion, noting that the diseases still exist, but vaccinations have reduced cases of them. Supporters say that the benefits far outweigh the risks of any possible reactions, and that the potential complications from measles are reason enough to get the vaccination. Some of the diseases are still common in other parts of the world, which means that travelers could bring them back to the U.S. An unvaccinated population would be at risk of infection, the American Academy of Pediatrics notes. In our opinion, keeping a child safe and healthy is of the utmost importance, and vaccinations play a vital role in that. And with vaccinations, the benefits extend past one's individual family and to the community as a whole, preventing infections from spreading, as happened in the Texas outbreak. Parents need to make sure their children receive their vaccinations, both as infants and again as teens. It's critical to keep them and our community healthy.

The vast majority of people here in Massachusetts are immune to measles, either because they've been vaccinated or because they were exposed to it decades ago. That said, it's highly contagious and should be taken very seriously. With the start of the school year, parents everywhere know how important it is to keep their children up to date on their shots. Vaccinations are mandatory in public schools, though there are certain exemptions.

"When vaccine rates taper off because people refuse the vaccines, then more of the population is susceptible, and then measles can circulate, and, especially with young children, they can get a very serious infection," said Dr. Sarah Haessler, an Infectious Disease Specialist at Baystate Medical Centre. In the late 1990's, a now debunked study claimed vaccines were linked to autism. Many parents, fearing for the safety of their children, passed on them, believing the diseases that the shots protected against were a better alternative. "There is zero evidence that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is tied to autism at all. In fact, the initial data that linked it at all was completely discredited," said Dr. Haessler.

Part of the current measles concern from the health field is its ability to spread. The very symptoms it presents -- sneezing, runny nose, and coughing -- are the very things that make it incredibly contagious. "It's an airborne disease, so that means when they cough, breath, sneeze, the virus gets out into the air and circulates around into the air so people passing through that air space can pick up measles, unless you have immunity, and the only defense against measles is to be vaccinated so you develop immunity," explained Dr. Haessler. The other reason measles is troublesome is that many don't recall a time before vaccinations. A time when getting sick and getting the measles was deadly serious. "People remember those outbreaks, and they were terrible. They killed many children, and then we had the miraculous advent of vaccinations, which essentially dropped those diseases to nearly zero in our population," said Dr. Haessler.

For children, the CDC recommends they receive their 1st measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine at 12-15 months. Adults should have at least one dose of MMR vaccine. But interestingly, those born in the US before 1957 are considered to be immune to measles from past exposures.

As of 16 Aug 2013, there have been 11 cases of measles this year [2013] in Texas, 6 of which occurred in the past month, according to a press release from the Texas Department of State Health Services. The most recently confirmed cases come out of Tarrant County, and the others were from Dallas, Denton and Harris counties. A health alert has been issued, and officials are urging everyone to be immunized against measles.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health is alerting Oklahoma health care providers to consider measles when diagnosing patients with compatible symptoms who have traveled to the North Texas area 18 days before symptom onset. "We are worried about the current outbreak of measles in Texas because measles is very contagious, spreads like wildfire, and can be very serious," said Lori Linstead, director of the Immunization Service at the Oklahoma State Department of Health.

King County Public Health is alerting the public about a confirmed measles infection in a child who could have spread infection to people throughout King County last week. The child was determined to be incompletely vaccinated, having had only one of the recommended 2 doses of the measles vaccine, and at an age earlier than recommended, according to public health officials. The child's sibling was unvaccinated and had become infected while traveling in Europe. Though most people in King County are vaccinated and immune to the measles, King County Public Health advises people to find out whether they have been vaccinated for measles. The agency also urges people who develop an illness with fever or a strange rash between now and 20 Sep 2013 to call a health care provider.

The child who developed measles was at the Central Park Tennis Club in Kirkland in the early evenings of 28, 29 & 30 Aug 2013. The child was also at the AV Performance Tennis Club in Bellevue the morning of 30 Aug 2013, then was at the Eastside Tennis Center in Kirkland that afternoon.

Measles is highly contagious and causes fever, rash, cough and red, watery eyes. Symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. People can spread measles before they show symptoms. Those most vulnerable to the measles include unvaccinated people, pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people with weakened immune systems.

Queensland has recorded 2 more cases of the highly infectious measles virus, one of them a young mother with an unvaccinated child. Public health specialists are concerned about the potential for the serious virus to spread, with Queensland Health notified of 6 cases in the past month. Alerts have been sent to general practitioners, public and private hospitals, and pathology laboratories to be on the lookout for possible cases, given the recent cluster.

One of the 2 latest cases, a man in his 30s, had visited the Ipswich Hospital 3 times recently and had travelled on a train, potentially exposing dozens of people to the disease. A Gold Coast mum has also been diagnosed, triggering concerns for her unvaccinated child. Public health officials are trying to trace how they caught the potentially deadly infection to determine whether the cases are linked.

A 17-year-old Caboolture High schoolgirl had been to 2 Gold Coast theme parks and to see Grease, the musical at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane, without knowing she had the virus. Queensland Health's communicable diseases unit acting senior director Stephen Lambert said public health officials were trying to alert anyone who had been in contact with the latest cases.

Two doses of the vaccine are necessary to be fully protected. Dr Lambert said measles could be a serious illness with a 3rd of young adults diagnosed requiring admission to hospital. Complications can include encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Dr Lambert described measles as "probably the most transmissible virus for humans." He said the virus was so easily spread, people could catch it from someone even 2 hours after the infected person had left a room. The last big measles epidemic in Queensland was in 1994 when 2345 cases were recorded.
