A difference from the previous report is that one of the 27 people diagnosed with anthrax has died. Anthrax meningitis is not uncommon with this disease but frequently missed. Unfortunately it proved lethal. But the good news is that there have been no further livestock or human cases. The original report indicated that the source was a single dead cow, but it is now revealed that there were 3 cows and 6 goats infected, which is probably why so many people, 600, might have been affected. - Mod.MHJ
