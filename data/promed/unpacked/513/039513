8 dead whales are proving a mystery in Mexico
---------------------------------------------
Mexican authorities are investigating the mysterious deaths of 8
whales found washed ashore along the Sea of Cortez last month
[January 2006], an unusually large number that suggests some common
cause.
The whales come from several plankton-eating species and apparently
died at sea in November and December [2005], biologists said. But
they do not show any signs of having been caught in long-line fishing
nets, which sometimes suffocate the mammoth animals, nor have
biologists found any signs of a toxic spill or outbreak of disease
that would account for their deaths.
"Right now, it's a mystery," said Luis Fueyo, an assistant federal
prosecutor for environmental crimes, who is overseeing the
investigation.
The 1st sign something was wrong came on 4 Jan 2006, when the remains
of 2 humpback whales were spotted on the shore near the town of El
Dorado in Culiacan state.
Scientists determined they had died in early November 2005. Since
then, 6 more giant bodies have turned up, among them a 3rd humpback,
a minke whale, a fin whale and a baby gray whale. 3 bodies were
discovered on 18 Jan 2006 during an aerial search of the Sinaloa
coast.
The discovery of the carcasses set in motion a frantic search for
forensic evidence. Biologists tracked currents to determine whether
all the whales might have been in the same place when they died, even
though they ended up scattered over a 500-mile coastline.
The investigators also looked for signs of disease or poisons, both
natural and synthetic. It was slow going. All of the bodies were
badly decomposed. Only the baby gray whale provided enough tissue to
test for diseases or poisons.
On Friday [17 Feb 2006], environmental officials announced that those
tests had found no evidence of a toxic algae bloom, other poisons or
infections, nor have the investigations turned up signs of
mistreatment by fishermen.
The deaths occurred just as about 2000 gray whales from the Pacific
began arriving in the Sea of Cortez, where they spend every winter as
part of a centuries-old migration. Mexican officials say they usually
find about 10 dead whales a year; 9 in the space of 2 weeks have set
off alarm bells.
Environmentalists say the Sea of Cortez, one of the world's richest
fisheries and most diverse marine habitats, is poorly policed and
substantially over-fished, because the Mexican government has granted
more and more permits for trawlers to use long-line nets.
The deaths of so many whales has prompted urgent calls from some
environmental groups for quick action to find the cause.
Besides the whales, 2 dolphins and an Olive Ridley sea turtle have
also washed up dead in the same region.
"I'm worried," said Homero Aridjis, a poet and naturalist who heads
the Group of One Hundred, an environmental organization. "We are just
starting the year, and already we seem to see a dead whale every day.
Something is happening there, and it needs to be investigated."
Fueyo, however, said none of the bodies showed signs of wounds from
nets on their fins, nor signs of other trauma that might have been
caused by fishing boats.
Biologists also did not find the usual telltale massacres of fish and
sea birds that would accompany a toxic bloom of algae or another
release of poisonous materials.

[The deaths of so many whales of different species along with dolphins and a
turtle indicate that there may be a toxin in the water over a large area. [In
spite of what the environmentalists said] perhaps these animals came through a
red tide bloom in the course of their migration.

[This could just be an apparent cluster, with no significance, given that the
whales died over a 2-month period and ended up widely scattered along 500
miles of coast. - Mod.JW]
