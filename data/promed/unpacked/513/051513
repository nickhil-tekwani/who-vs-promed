Ebola Fever Ruled Out
---------------------
TORONTO: A woman lying sick in a Canadian hospital after arriving from [the
Democratic Republic of Congo does not have the deadly Ebola virus, but
could have another type of tropical viral hemorrhagic fever, government
health officials said on Wednesday. "Ebola [fever has been ruled out from
Health Canada's perspective," Dr Douglas MacPherson, a government
infectious disease specialist, told a news conference. "There are still
other viral hemorrhagic tropical fevers under consideration," he added.
The woman, who flew to Toronto from the Democratic Republic of Congo via
New York on Saturday, was admitted to a hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, on
Sunday and placed in quarantine. Doctors said on Wednesday they expect to
receive test results from a special laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Health officials said they are still being "super cautious" when dealing
with the woman, and continue to maintain close surveillance on people who
came in close contact with her, including 2 of her personal contacts and 10
hospital workers.

Mystery Virus, Canada, NOT Ebola virus
--------------------------------------
Preliminary tests show [that an ailing [32 year old Congolese woman, who
passed through New Jersey and Ethiopia on her way to Canada, [is not
harbouring the deadly Ebola virus, Canadian doctors said on Wednesday. [A
positive diagnosis had not been made, however, said Dr Mark Loeb, an
infectious disease specialist, at a news conference in Hamilton, Ontario.
The woman, who has not been identified, was admitted to Henderson General
Hospital in Hamilton on Sunday, showing symptoms of viral haemorrhagic
fever, indicating she might have one of a group of life threatening,
contagious tropical infections. Blood samples were sent to a laboratory in
Winnipeg, Manitoba and to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, officials said.
Had the illness been proven to have been caused by the Ebola virus, it
would have been the first confirmed case in humans in North America. It
would also have left her [fellow travellers wondering whether or not to
[be concerned. The woman was in [a serious condition but is showing signs
of improvement. Prior to the test results, Loeb said the woman's symptoms
were "possibly compatible" with Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers. She did
not show signs of bleeding from the ears, eyes, or mouth, hallmarks of
Ebola [haemorrhagic fever, a disease that is lethal in 50 to 90 percent of
cases and has wiped out entire villages in Africa. A recent outbreak in
Uganda killed 173 people.
[The patients transoceanic flight terminated at at Newark Airport [New
Jersey. The flight carrying the woman [to Canada, Air Canada Flight 735,
arrived [on Saturday at Toronto's Pearson International Airport from
Newark International Airport in New Jersey with 39 passengers and 5 crew
members aboard. The woman apparently came to Canada on a legitimate
visitor's visa. The flight carrying her from Ethiopia to Newark continued
on to Washington, DC, The Toronto Star reported. The woman's circle of
contacts was limited enough to keep the risk of contamination low. "Nobody
on the flight noticed anything out of the ordinary about the woman, and she
didn't indicate she was sick," Air Canada spokesperson Laura Cooke told the
Star. The Star reported that as many as 20 hospital workers and lab
technicians were being monitored for signs of the disease, along with 2
people who had close contact with the victim.
Ebola and the other haemorrhagic fevers are not transmitted through the
air. Infection occurs through direct contact with the infected person's
blood or bodily fluids such as saliva or semen, and that only after they
have exhibited symptoms such as fever and malaise. That's why it was a
relief for health officials to learn that the woman did not fall visibly
ill until after arriving in Hamilton on Saturday night. It was not until
Monday afternoon that concerns about Ebola were raised and the woman was
put into total isolation.

Preliminary Tests Rule Out Ebola Virus Infection
------------------------------------------------
HAMILTON: Health officials in Canada said on Wednesday that preliminary
tests on a woman feared to be infected with Ebola virus have been negative
for the deadly haemorrhagic fever. They said, however, [that viral
isolation tests were still being conducted and [that they had not yet been
able to rule out other viruses, such as Lassa [fever virus or yellow fever
[virus, as the cause of her illness. "We're being extremely cautious,"
said Dr Mark Loeb of Henderson Hospital, where the woman is being treated.
But he emphasized [that the general public is not at risk. "We've had some
results from the laboratory in Winnipeg, showing that the Ebola testing is
negative," explained Loeb. "The real implication [is that this greatly
reduces the likelihood that this patient has been infected with Ebola virus."
Health Canada, the nation's health department, said the woman has been
diagnosed with a very low-grade malaria, but they are awaiting blood tests
to determine if her illness is more severe. The unidentified woman from the
Democratic Republic of Congo was said to be slightly better. "She is still
seriously ill but there are some indications she is improving," one doctor
said.

[This report is slightly more informative and reassuring. The good news is
that the health of the patient may be improving. A later report from the
Calgary Herald
