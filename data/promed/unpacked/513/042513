At least 94 people -- adults and children under 5 -- fell ill during a
chikungunya virus outbreak transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.
The cases are from the Sungan Durian village, Ambawang district and
Kuala Kuala village in districts A and B in Central Java. It is
predicted that the toll will reach hundreds of people in the near
future.

Mrs Maryani in the Hamlet I Health Center explained that 24 people
were seen [with chikungunya virus infection symptoms] in the past 2
weeks. Sufferers include dozens of toddlers and adults. There were
also 2 month old infants. Some of the chikungunya cases were in
intensive care in the Health Center. Others are outpatients in their
homes. Some have recovered, but not totally. They still feel aches
[probably arthralgia] and pain, the hallmark of chikungunya [virus
infections].

[In chikungunya virus infections], red eye is usually accompanied by
flu-like signs. Febrile seizures are common in children. In older
children, fever is usually followed by pain in muscles and joints, and
enlarged lymph nodes occur as well. In adults, symptoms of sore joints
and muscles are very dominant and [severe enough] to cause temporary
paralysis [immobilization] due to pain when walking. Sometimes, there
is nausea leading to vomiting. In general, fever in children only
lasts for 3 days with no or very little bleeding and shock
encountered, unlike dengue [virus infections].

Tomorrow [7 Oct 2011], fogging and abate treatment will be done in the
2 villages [in order to eliminate adults, larvae and pupae of _Aedes
aegypti_].

[This appears to be a significant, focal outbreak of chikungunya virus
infection in Central Java province. Not surprisingly, no fatalities
are reported, as is the case in nearly all chikungunya outbreaks.
Morbidity may be significant, and incapacitating arthralgia may
persist for weeks or months in convalescent individuals. Since _Ae.
aegypti_ is likely to be ubiquitous in central Java, one wonders how
far this outbreak may spread.

There have been previous, recent reports of chikungunya virus
outbreaks in Indonesia. The Ministry of Health reported that almost 20
000 people were infected with chikungunya from January to February
[2010] in Lampung alone (See ProMED-mail archive no. 20100310.0764).
