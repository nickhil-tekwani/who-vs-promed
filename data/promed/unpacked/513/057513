A 9th case of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has been found in a sow barn in Manitoba.

On 15 Sep 2016, Manitoba's Chief Veterinary Office (CVO) confirmed positive test results for PED from a southeastern Manitoba sow barn, bringing the number of Manitoba cases to 9 since the 1st one was found in February 2014.

The CVO has consulted with the producer and the producer's private veterinarian, and Manitoba Agriculture's Emergency Operation Centre has been activated. Control measures were implemented immediately, and a plan is being developed for restricted site access, barn clean-up, and animal care. Producers within a 5-km radius of the infected site or with direct contact to the site are being alerted to monitor their herds and collect samples for testing.

Six of the 9 premises in Manitoba previously confirmed to have PED are now determined to be PED Presumptive Negative, meaning that the sites have eliminated PED from all pigs and pig contact areas, and have confirmed that the virus has been eliminated through repeated animal and environmental testing. This follows a negative status protocol developed by the CVO and Manitoba's swine veterinarians.

[Since its appearance in the United States in April 2013, PEDv has spread within the swine industry in both the US and Canada. In early 2014, an additional related virus, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), appeared in this country. Infections with these novel SECD (swine enteric coronovirus disease) viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.

Thorough cleaning and attention to biosecurity of the premises are helpful in controlling these diseases.

Manitoba has had a long break without any cases of this virus, so clearly an investigation will begin on what is common to these 3 cases that could link them and help determine whether a new outbreak is to be avoided.

This disease spreads easily, rapidly, and can be devastating to young pigs, which can have a long lasting effect on the price of pork. We hope this site can contain the disease and receive a negative test quickly.
