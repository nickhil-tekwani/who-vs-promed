South African businessman dies in Rio victim of hemorrhagic fever
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A 53-year-old South African businessman died Tuesday morning [2 Dec
2008] at Casa de saude sao Jose, in Humaita, a victim of hemorrhagic
fever. The patient was admitted to the hospital on Saturday [29 Nov
2008]. Blood specimens were sent to the laboratories of the Oswaldo
Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) for analysis. According to the hospital
press service, all isolation measures to ensure the safety of
patients and doctors were taken during the period in which the
patient was hospitalized.

It is unknown what the virus that may have caused the fever, but the
case is considered serious because the patient came from Africa. The
main [viral agent] suspected by the Ministry of Health is the
arenavirus, transmitted by direct contact with secretions from
infected rodents or patients. The diagnoses of dengue, malaria and
ebola were discarded. Other hypotheses under investigation include
leptospirosis, hepatitis and hantaviruses.

According to unofficial information, the coffin of the South African
will be sealed. The date when the patient arrived in Rio [from South
Africa] was not given, but before Saturday the patient had already
been cared for in Barra D'Or.

The Ministry of Health in Brasilia, at 7 PM this Tuesday [2 Dec 2008]
issued a statement that gives more details about the case. According
to the Ministry, there are no reports of similar symptoms among
health professionals who had contact with the patient. Also,
quarantine is not recommended as transmission occurs after the
appearance of symptoms. The incubation period is between 7 and 16
days.

The Ministry of Health reported the case to the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO), as well as information on the measures adopted.
The South African Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, was also contacted, to
make the arrangements for transfer of the body.

[Byline: Antonio Marinho and Simone Intrator]

Statement from the Ministry of Health:
"With regard to patient from South Africa who died this Tuesday (2
Dec 2008), the Ministry of Health states that:

1. The process of investigation on the cause of death has already
begun, through laboratory tests on blood samples of patients that
will be conducted in the laboratories of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation
(Fiocruz).

2. There are no reports of similar symptoms among health
professionals who had contact with the patient. These people have
been identified and will be monitored, in a preventive manner by the
health authorities.

3. Implementation of quarantine is not recommended, as transmission
occurs only after the onset of symptoms. The incubation period is
between 7 and 16 days.

4. The virus suspected of having caused the death of the patient
(arenavirus) can be transmitted by direct contact with secretions
from infected rodents or patients.

5. The Ministry of Health reported the case to the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO), as well as the measures adopted.The South
African Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, was also contacted, the
arrangements for transfer of the body.

6. Technicians from the Ministry of Health remain in Rio de Janeiro
following the investigations.

7. The diagnoses of dengue, malaria and ebola have already been
discarded. Other etiologies, such as leptospirosis, hepatitis and
hantaviruses will be investigated."

[The above press release is an early report of a fatality due to a
presumed hemorrhagic fever that occurred in a South African visitor
to Brazil. An important piece of information that is not available in
the above report is the date of arrival of the affected individual in
Brazil, and locations of travel within Brazil prior to onset of
illness. The speculation of an arenavirus as the etiology at this
point in time would be based on laboratory results or epidemiologic
information that might link the businessman to the earlier fatal case
of a novel arenavirus identified in a woman who was medically
evacuated from Lusaka, Zambia to South Africa for treatment, and the
resultant 4 additional nosocomially acquired cases associated with
that fatality (see references below).

It is also possible that the above mentioned case (South African
businessman in Brazil) was in Brazil for a time period long enough to
have potentially had exposure to yellow fever virus, as Brazil is
endemic for yellow fever, and this current year has been a year with
significant yellow fever activity in the region (see references
below). It is also possible that this individual travelled to other
areas possibly in Africa or in South America before arriving in
Brazil. In addition, the possibility of hantavirus, leptospirosis and
other causes of hemorrhagic fever should be considered in the
differential diagnosis for an individual with exposure in South
Africa and in South America.

More information from knowledgeable sources would be helpful and
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
