------------------------------------------------
In 2008 a [potato] breeding line (99m‐022‐026) growing in the UK (Scotland), displaying unusual yellow symptoms on the foliage that could have been mistaken for _Potato aucuba mosaic virus_, _Potato mop top virus_ or _Tobacco rattle virus_ (TRV), was further investigated to identify the causal agent. A new species of the genus _Potyvirus_ infecting potatoes, with the proposed name Potato yellow blotch virus (PYBV), was discovered. The infected plants show isolated yellow blotches on the leaves.

The breeding line was tested using double antibody sandwich (DAS)‐ELISA for 19 viruses, as well as by real‐time reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR for TRV and [by] conventional RT‐PCR with generic primers to detect the genera _Carlavirus_, _Potexvirus_ and _Potyvirus_. In order to confirm data and whether only one virus was present, PYBV‐infected microplants of the breeding line were analysed using high‐throughput sequencing. Sequence analysis shows that PYBV is closely related to _Potato virus A_ (PVA), with an overall 72% identity at the nucleotide level for the whole genome.

The host range of PYBV was comparable to PVA on solanaceaous and non‐solanaceous indicator plant species, with [a few] exceptions. The susceptibility of potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) cultivars to PYBV and PVA was similar. PYBV was not detected in leaf samples showing various symptoms including yellow blotches taken from commercial seed and ware potato crops and tubers representing 2591 virus cases (i.e. virus species found in a crop) and more than 95 potato cultivars, including those susceptible to PYBV. Symptoms were attributable to other virus species. In over 5 years of investigation, PYBV has not been found in commercial seed and ware potato crops in Scotland.

Further studies are required to fully understand the epidemiology of PYBV, to determine if aphid transmission occurs and whether [its] efficiency is similar to other potyviruses. It is proposed that because cultivar resistance is comparable to that for PVA, PYBV will be expected to have a lower impact on potato production. Worldwide, PYBV might have been misidentified as PVA by certification authorities.

[Members of the genus _Potyvirus_ (type species _Potato virus Y_, PVY) are found worldwide and cause significant losses in a wide range of crops. _Potyvirus_ is one of the largest plant virus genera containing about 15 percent of all named plant virus species.

_Potato virus A_ (PVA, also called potato mild mosaic virus, potato virus P), the species to which the new PYBV was found to be most closely related, is one of the most widespread potato viruses worldwide and is found in most potato growing areas. Leaf symptoms include mild mosaic, slight crinkling and a rough surface ("rugose"); tuber size may be decreased. Symptom expression depends on weather conditions, host cultivar and strain of PVA. In plants infected with certain strains of _Potato virus X_ or PVY, co-infection with PVA may lead to a synergistic (symbiotically enhanced) increase in symptom severity. Further work will be needed to investigate if a similar effect may be able to be caused by the new PYBV.

Potyviruses, including PVA, are aphid transmitted in a nonpersistent manner and can be spread in infected plant material (including potato tubers). Some potyviruses are also transmitted through true seed. For PVA, PVY and other potyviruses affecting potato, tubers are likely to be the primary overwintering reservoir. Disease management of PVA (and other aphid-transmitted potato viruses of any genus) includes the use of disease-free seed tubers and insecticides for vector control. Resistant varieties or susceptible varieties exhibiting a hypersensitive response (necrosis of virus-infected tissue resulting in pathogen elimination) under field conditions may be used.

Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato. Some of them may only have a minor effect on yield, if they are the only infecting virus species and if a crop is newly infected in the field. This is often the case for PVA and is also reported above for the new PYBV. However, if additional infections (by insects or via seed tubers) occur over a number of crop cycles, the virus population will gradually build up, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus species and in amounts of infectious units per species. This invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield. Therefore, until more is known about the epidemiology of the new PYBV and its potential for synergism, the statement above that the new virus may be expected to have a low impact on potato production does not seem justified.
