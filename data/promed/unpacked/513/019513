INTRODUCED DISEASES - SOLOMON ISLANDS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
==============================================================

(Can any in the ProMED-mail readership assist Dr. Foale?)
I am studying fishery management in the Nggela group of Solomon Islands, and
have been trying to source information on the effects (if any) of introduced
diseases on populations there subsequent to the arrival of early European
explorers and colonists. Would you happen to know any good references on the
subject or people who might have some expertise in this area?
