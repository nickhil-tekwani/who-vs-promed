YELLOW FEVER, MONKEYS - BRAZIL: (GOIAS), SUSPECTED, REQUEST FOR
INFORMATION, CORRECTIONS

Monkey name
-----------
At the end of paragraph 1 of the translation of the original post
(Yellow fever, monkeys - Brazil (Goias): susp., RFI 20071217.4052) is
written:
"They asserted that they will carry out monitoring in the localities
where the dead *macaques* were found and provide an explanation to
the local populace."
The Portuguese word for "monkeys" is "macacos," but this does not
necessarily signify that they are "macaques," which belong to the Old
World genus _Macaca_. In the case of this report, the monkeys were
said to be capuchins of the New World genus _Cebus_. This is unusual,
in that although cebus are good reservoirs of yellow fever (YF),
since they circulate high titers of YF virus to infect mosquitoes,
they do not usually die of the infection -- it is the howler monkeys
(_Alouatta_ spp.) that die in numbers when infected with YF.
ProMED-mail regrets these errors.
