The Ministry of Agriculture has warned farmers in south and east
China about the spread of fruit diseases and destructive pests, such
as banana [fungal] wilt and red fire ants.

Banana wilt, a devastating disease caused by a soil-borne fungus, has
hit 7878 mu (525.2 hectares) of banana plants in eastern Fujian
Province, according to a notice on the ministry's website. Red fire
ants have also shown up in south Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
with 1500 mu (100 ha) of cropland damaged, it said.

The ministry told local governments to allocate staff and funding to
help control the spread of banana wilt and fire ants. It also told
local governments to tighten monitoring of plant diseases and pests
and quickly report new infections to higher-level authorities.

[Banana fungal (or fusarium wilt) is commonly called Panama disease
(PD) to avoid confusion with the 2 known bacterial wilts of banana.
It is caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp.
_cubense_, which is one of more than 100 special forms of _F.
oxysporum_ that cause vascular wilts of flowering plants. These fungi
enter the roots from the soil and spread throughout the plant,
killing it by blocking the vascular tissue. Symptoms of PD are
yellowing, wilting, and dark purple or red streaking in the
pseudostem. Affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by
infected planting material, mechanical means, soil and water. It can
survive in the soil for over 30 years, making infected plantations
useless for future banana cultivation. No effective chemical or
cultural control measures are known. Disease management includes
exclusion and eradication.

There are 4 races of the Panama disease pathogen. Race 1 (found in
most banana growing areas worldwide) and race 2 (found mainly in
Southeast Asia) attack several different cultivars of eating and
cooking bananas; race 3 attacks ornamental _Heliconia_ species only;
race 4 attacks cultivars in the Cavendish subgroup as well as hosts
of races 1 and 2 and is the most destructive. Until recently, race 4
had been detected on Cavendish cultivars in subtropical production
areas only (including, for example, Taiwan and subtropical
Australia), where cold stress is presumed to predispose those
cultivars to infection. However, a distinct population of the
pathogen, called tropical race 4, has now been found causing
considerable damage in Cavendish monocultures in tropical regions
(for example Indonesia, Malaysia, tropical Australia). Cultivars for
commercial use which are resistant or tolerant to the new pathogen
strain are being developed but are not yet available. It is uncertain
which race of the fungus is involved in the outbreak reported above.

PD has been a major problem for banana cultivation worldwide for over
a century. It forced the change over from previously used highly
susceptible banana cultivars to the then resistant Cavendish variety.
However, the pathogen has adjusted, causing large-scale destruction
once again. The history of PD demonstrates the inherent dangers of
monoculture.
