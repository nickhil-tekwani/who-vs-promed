In response to the posting "Skin disorder, sheep farmers - UK: RFI
20071103.3567", I am curious as to whether they have tested the affected
sheep farmers for acquired porphyria. Exposure to chemicals has been shown
to cause acquired porphyria manifested by photosensitivity;
hexachlorobenzene and other chemicals have been implicated. This condition
appears to be unique to farmers during lambing and calving solely in the
United Kingdom. Is there a chemical used in lambing and calving practices
in the United Kingdom that is unique from other parts of the world?

[We had one anecdotal response of an Irish farmer using hexachlorobenzene
on his arms prior to assisting in calving who had a similar reaction on the
portion of his arms that entered the cow. He did not have the problem with
lambs.

But there is still the question of the ears. The article does not indicate
whether hexachlorabenzene was being used or how it got on the ears. There
is much about the epidemiology, or lack thereof, of these cases that is
still mysterious. - Mod.TG]
