Cerebral malaria spreading in Noida Ghaziabad
---------------------------------------------
NOIDA: About 20 men, women and children have died over a 2-week period of
suspected cerebral malaria, in the Dadri area of the district. The district
administration, however, admits to "12 or 13 deaths." Gautam Budh Nagar
district magistrate Deepak Kumar agrees that the local health authorities
did not take preventive measures in time to contain the situation.
According to sources, a number of deaths from suspected mosquito-borne
ailments have occurred in the Jarcha, Chhulus, Khandera, Madhaiya, Andhpur
and other areas. Medical authorities admit a "high incidence of malaria"
in the area.
Meanwhile, local medical and malaria eradication authorities blame each
other for not taking adequate preventive measures. Gautam Budh Nagar chief
medical officer Shravan Kumar said, "The responsibility rests with the
malaria unit in Ghaziabad."
Meanwhile, Dadri hospitals are packed with patients. Additional beds have
been placed in hospital verandahs and corridors. Several hundred persons are
currently suffering from symptoms resembling malaria. The district
authorities have sent over 600 blood samples for testing.
GHAZIABAD: Dengue and Malaria have spread in Ghaziabad city and villages as
well. About 6 victims of dengue have been traced in hospitals here. More
than 12 villages of Dhaulana block of Ghaziabad including Ekladi, Bidhepur,
Narena, Nandpur, Kakarana, Narainpur, Ucha Gaon, Solana, Nidhawali and
Parpa are in the grip of the outbreak. About 500 blood samples have been
sent for tests and temporary hospitals set up in affected villages.
The chief medical superintendent of the government hospital, A K Sharma,
admitted there was tremendous increase in malaria cases.

[The area with the reported suspected outbreak is located approximately 50
kilometers Southeast of New Delhi. The malaria situation in many parts of
India is unstable with local epidemics occurring at regular intervals. The
immunity in the population is therefore low, and an increase in
transmission will result in outbreaks. Cerebral malaria is seen when the
infection is not treated early in the course. It seems that there is a
confusion of whether the outbreak is due to dengue fever or malaria or
both. Malaria is easily diagnosed by microscopy, so it should not be too
difficult to distinguish the two. The outbreak emphasizes the importance of
malaria prophylaxis for travellers to India. - Mod.EP
