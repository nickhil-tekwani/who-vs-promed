Hand, foot and mouth outbreak - Edmonton (Alberta)
--------------------------------------------------
Warm weather and wading pools may be responsible for an outbreak of hand,
foot and mouth disease in kids, says the health watchdog for the Capital
Health Authority. Doctors around the region have been reporting an increase
in hand, foot and mouth cases since the end of June, said Dr. Gerry Predy,
chief Medical officer of Health. "They are seeing five or 6 people a day,"
he said. "It's definitely an outbreak." Kids are most vulnerable and most of
the cases have been children under age [?. Although the disease usually
has cyclical outbreaks every three or four years, one of the causes this
time around could be an epidemic of summer fun in backyard pools, he said.
"Wading pools - all the kids come in there and splash around," he said. "In
summertime people tend to be less careful washing their hands." Swimming
pools properly chlorinated don't pose a risk. The disease is spread through
direct contact with nose and throat discharges. People who catch it get
fever, sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters on the hands and feet.
Children will recover within 10 days. If the child also has a headache and
stiff neck there's a risk they may also have viral meningitis, he added.

Hand, foot mouth disease - Toronto (Ontario)
--------------------------------------------
Officially, there isn't an epidemic of hand, foot and mouth disease among
children in Toronto. It's a claim Dr. Allison McGeer, Director of
Infectious Diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital, can neither verify nor dispute
because public health officials don't monitor its incidence. Hand, foot and
mouth disease is a childhood illness identifiable by sores on the cheeks,
gums, tongue, hands and feet - hence the name.
However, parents and child-care providers say an outbreak is sweeping
child-care centres in Toronto. But veteran day-care worker Penny Smith
trusts her 20 years of experience. The co-director of Sprouts Daycare said
she's never seen so many children infected. "Some cases are so mild, you
don't notice it," Smith said. "But in severe cases, children have sores in
the mouth, which makes them crabby, so we tell parents to keep their
children at home."
Two viruses - Coxsackie A16 and Enterovirus 71 - usually cause the disease.
It's transmitted by sneezing and coughing and by direct contact with nose
and throat secretions or the feces of infected people. McGeer said the
disease peaks in the summer and early fall, and like measles, which is more
prevalent every six or seven years, runs in multi-year cycles. Sores in the
mouth and on the feet can make it painful to eat or walk. McGeer said a
child can be infected and not show any symptoms. In that case, she says a
child can be contagious for weeks, thus rendering precautions ineffective.
All parents and caretakers can do, McGeer said, is to be a little more
vigilant about hand-washing and cleaning items like toys that may have been
in a child's mouth.

[The virus responsible for these outbreaks in Edmonton and Toronto does not
appear to have been identified. The disease appears to be reasonably benign
in contrast to the current outbreak in Japan. Hand, foot and mouth disease
in children is something of an enigma; the same constellation of signs and
symptoms appearing in associated with infection by two quite distinct
picornaviruses. Meningitis is rare, but more commonly associated with
Enterovirus 71 infection. It is not a notifiable disease and has attracted
very little critical attention
Dr. Rick Lehtinen <lehtinenfamily@home.com> has made the following
interesting comments in response to my previous observations regarding the
epidemic in Japan. He writes "What caught my eye was the statement that the
periodicity of the outbreak in Japan seems (within the limited sample set of
three outbreaks 1990, 1995, 2000) to be five years, whereas in Europe it is
"three-four" years. The posting mentioned that severity was not apparently
associated with genotype, yet went on to state that Enterovirus-71 might be
the cause of the severity of the Asian outbreak. If we factor out genotype,
we are left with a possible association of severity and periodicity, in this
case, longer intervals with greater severity. Are there any data to support
(1) these apparent 5 and "3-4" year periods? (2)Any theories underlying this
apparent periodicity?
It would be interesting if anyone can produce hard data relevant to Dr.
Lehtinen's questions. I doubt, however, that there is a real difference in
periodicity. "Three-four" year intervals are clinician speak for "irregular
(i.e. not annual)" intervals. - Mod.CP
