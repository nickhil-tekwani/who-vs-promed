[Glanders is something to keep watch over. First of all, it is a
zoonotic disease which can kill humans if they don't get antibiotics
in a timely enough fashion. Risks are associated with contact with
skin exudates and respiratory secretions of horses, which can be
chronically and latently infected. It is considered a potential
biological weapon, and a researcher in the United States was affected
by the disease in 2000.

Glanders has been known since ancient times, but it had largely
disappeared by the middle of the 20th century. Unfortunately, glanders
is making a resurgence and has been characterized as a re-emerging
zoonosis by the OIE. Please see their recent OIE mission report to
Baharain, Syria and Kuwait entitled "Glanders poses a serious health
risk to both animals and humans in the Middle-East," at
http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/glanders-poses-a-serious-health-risk-to-both-animals-and-humans-in-the-middle-east.

Between 1998 and 2007, cases were reported from Brazil, Turkey, the
former USSR, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and
Mongolia. Since 2008, the OIE WAHID database reports occurrences in a
small but very geographically widespread group of countries, which
includes Brazil, India, Iran, Mongolia and Myanmar. It has been
suspected but not reported in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Mauritania.
Now it is reported for the 1st time in Lebanon.

and Public Health at Iowa State University Fact Sheet on Glanders at

moderator comments from the ProMED-mail posting on glanders in Bahrain
