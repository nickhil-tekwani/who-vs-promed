More than 50 chikungunya cases have been reported from Moilottu in
Kilpadi village limits, near Mulky, over the past few days,
triggering panic among residents in the region.

The Kilpadi village panchayat [elected council of village elders. -
Mod.TY] has ordered a fogging machine to be brought in from Mulky
town panchayat, and, reportedly, fogging has already been done in
some areas of Moilottu. But the villagers have voiced their concern
over how cleanliness has been neglected by the Kilpadi village
panchayat and have urged the panchayat to take the sanitation issue seriously.

Despite reports of chikungunya in the city, the disease seems to have
been largely under control so far.

[This is the latest in a series of reports of chikungunya cases in
this general area of Karnataka state, India. Fogging will be of
little long term value in controlling the _Aedes_ mosquito vector of
chikungunya virus. The villagers are correct, better sanitation for
elimination of the water catchments in and immediately around houses
and other buildings that are _Aedes_ mosquito breeding sites is
essential. Public education is needed to mobilize the villagers to
participate in the needed clean-up.
