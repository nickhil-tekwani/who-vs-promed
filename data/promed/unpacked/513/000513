The investigation into an outbreak of food poisoning that has
sickened 65 people in 3 states widened yesterday [5 Dec 2006], as 4
additional cases of _E. coli_ [O157:H7] infection were reported in
Pennsylvania as well as 2 more in New Jersey.
As the search continued for what was responsible for the largest
outbreak of this organism in the region in several years, federal and
state health investigators said they were looking into a distribution
center in Burlington Township, NJ, that delivers food to more than
1100 restaurants, including Taco Bell and other fast food outlets in
the Northeast. Investigators believe food at some of the Taco Bell
restaurants had sickened some victims.
In Pennsylvania, 3 of the additional cases were linked to Taco Bell
restaurants in Montgomery County, a suburb of Philadelphia. The
latest victims, who ranged in age from 11 to 20, became ill within
the last month [November 2006], said Troy Thompson, a spokesman for
the Pennsylvania Department of Health. He said that 2 of them had
been hospitalized but had been released.
Late yesterday, 5 Dec 2006, Taco Bell announced that it had
voluntarily closed 9 restaurants in Montgomery County, and that they
would reopen when health officials approved.
But state health officials in the region insisted that the outbreak
had been contained and that the most recent cases represented late
notifications of the illness, not new incidences. The number of cases
of infection could continue to rise as people come forward to report
their illness.
Although a number of the people who were reported ill did not eat at
Taco Bell, David Daigle, a spokesman for the CDC, said investigators
were "comfortable" identifying Taco Bell as the source of the
infected food. It was not clear, however, whether it was produce like
lettuce or cooked ingredients like ground beef that may have caused
the infections. Still, Taco Bell officials said the restaurants in
question had thrown out all the food they had in stock.
Taco Bell reopened 8 restaurants on Long Island that the company had
closed for a day after they were linked to the outbreak. The
restaurant in South Plainfield, New Jersey, where 19 persons who were
sickened ate in the weeks before and after Thanksgiving, remained
closed, as Taco Bell, working with public health authorities in
Middlesex County, worked to sanitize all the fixtures, including
utensils and cooking equipment.
As the investigations continued, an additional case -- an adult who
has been hospitalized for 2 weeks after eating at a Taco Bell in
Seaford -- was reported on Long Island yesterday, 5 Dec 2006. Of the
11 patients in Suffolk County, 9 have been released from the
hospital, officials said. And in New Jersey, where 2 children had
developed kidney damage, an 11-year-old boy was moved out of
intensive care in Newark.
Dr. Patricia Dillon, director of epidemiology and communicable
diseases for Suffolk County, said that for now, health authorities
were focusing on the central food distributor rather than improper
handling in the restaurants as the source of the contamination. "You
could not have improper handling occur at so many restaurants," Dr.
Dillon said.

Seven new possible cases of _E. coli_ [O157:H7]-related illnesses
emerged in Nassau County Tue 5 Dec 2006, as officials continued to
try to track the source of contamination that resulted in the closure
of 8 Taco Bell restaurants on Long Island. In response to the
outbreak, Taco Bell Corp. on Wednesday [7 Dec 2006] announced it has
removed green onions from its 5800 restaurants nationwide.
The Irvine, California-based company said that an independent lab
found 3 samples of green onions that appeared to have a harsh strain
of the bacteria. "In an abundance of caution, we've decided to pull
all green onions from our restaurants until we know conclusively
whether they are the cause of the _E. coli_ outbreak," Greg Creed,
Taco Bell president, said in a statement.
Taco Bell said that the tests are not conclusive, but that it
immediately notified health authorities and its restaurants while it
awaits a final analysis.
Also Tue 5 Dec 2006, a federal surveillance system reported suspected
new cases in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. While few details were
available about the situation in Connecticut, Pennsylvania health
officials said they were investigating 4 cases of _E. coli_ in
suburban Philadelphia; 3 of the 4 people who fell ill in late
November 2006 said they had eaten at a Taco Bell, a spokesman said.
All 8 Long Island Taco Bells that had closed on 4 Dec 2006 -- 4 in
Nassau and 4 in Suffolk -- reopened on 5 Dec 2006. Nassau officials
said they were inspecting 2 additional Taco Bells in Seaford and New
Hyde Park with links to the 7 newly reported cases.
The new suspected cases brought the total reported in Nassau to 10,
while another 11 cases of the infection have been confirmed in
Suffolk, health officials said.
Taco Bell officials said none of their restaurants in New York City
were affected by the outbreak of the potentially fatal infection even
though they are served by the same distribution center that delivers
food to restaurants in Nassau, Suffolk and New Jersey, where health
authorities believe at least 36 people who fell ill ate recently.
Health officials in Nassau and Suffolk said most of the victims had
eaten at one of 8 Taco Bells between 19 and 25 Nov 2006, and they
assumed the restaurant chain was the source.
They said they were allowing the re-openings because no cases have
emerged of people who ate at the restaurants after 25 Nov 2006, and
they believe the danger has passed. All the stores were shut down Mon
4 Dec 2006, completely cleaned and re-sanitized, while all existing
food was thrown out.
"We're taking all the necessary precautions to ensure our customers
that our food is safe to eat," Poetsch said. The chain has 204 stores
in New York State, 86 in New Jersey and another 200 or so in
Pennsylvania and Delaware that are served by the same distribution center.
Of the 10 total reported cases in Nassau, one is a confirmed case of
_E. coli_ O157, one is strongly suspected, and the rest are under
investigation. Nassau officials have also detected 2 other separate
cases of _E. coli_ O157 that appear not to be related to Taco Bell.
In Suffolk, County Executive Steve Levy said 9 of the 11 people
sickened there have been released from the hospital, while 2 adults,
including an elderly person, remain hospitalized in serious condition.
