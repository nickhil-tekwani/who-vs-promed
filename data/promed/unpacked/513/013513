A mystery disease has claimed lives of 3 siblings, and many others have been affected by it in [the Indian state of] Odisha. After being affected by the disease for a couple of days, which has been suspected to be typhoid, 3 children of a family died within a week at Jharigaon village in Koraput district of Odisha.

The children died early this month [July 2014] and a team of health officials, led by Koraput's chief district medical officer (CDMO), Laxmidhar Kabi, visiting the village on Monday [21 Jul 2014], said tests are being done to monitor the situation.

"[The children] are suffering from fever since 8 to 10 days. 2 children died at their home, one on [5 Jul and another on 7 Jul 2014] and another child was referred to Koraput district hospital. His blood source [specimen ?] is positive for typhoid fever [serology or culture?] and we think some sort of viral element was detected. We have collected the patient's serum, and the water of the stream, to examine what is happening," said Kabi.

The medical teams have been examining patients and treating the villagers, as many have been admitted to district hospitals.

[The father of the 3 dead children] lost his 10 year old son, and daughters aged 7 and 15 within a span of one week. "My children died within a gap of few days. They were sick for some days. However, we do not know what caused them to be sick that later resulted to their death. Out of my other 3 children who are alive, 2 are already in the hospital for treatment. There is no one for us to depend on. For us farmers, cultivation is the only way of getting our livelihood," said the father of the victims.

All the villagers are poor and earn their livelihood by cultivation for which they get water from a small stream that flows through the village. As there are no drinking water facilities, the poverty stricken villagers drink the polluted water that they use for cultivation, which results in different kinds of waterborne diseases.

Jharigaon is one of the remotest villages of the district that does not have other basic facilities like road connectivity, or a school and health centre for the betterment of the villagers. The village is completely cut off from the developmental schemes of the government, as the district is one of the common dwellings of the red rebels who carry out their activities often in this area. That is also a reason why district administrations fear to visit the village and solve the problems of the villagers.

The team under CDMO conducted blood tests of all the villagers and assured them that they will dig a tube well for drinking water and make concrete roads connecting to the village.

[The news report above does not give a clinical description of the illness, which killed 3 children in one family and sickened many others in an isolated village in the Indian state of Odisha. A blood specimen is said to be "positive for typhoid", but the news reports does not say what type of test was done. The definitive diagnosis of typhoid fever depends on the isolation of _Salmonella_ Typhi from blood, stools, urine, or other bodily fluids. In developing countries, where the isolation of the organism from cultures is not feasible, the diagnosis often relies on the Widal test, a slide or tube dilution test that measures the ability of the patient's serum to clump (agglutinate) the H (flagellar), O (somatic), and Vi antigens in a suspension of killed _Salmonella_ Typhi_ or Paratyphi A and B. The presence of agglutination is assessed visually.

However, the results of the Widal test are often nonspecific and not sufficiently sensitive (http://pmj.bmj.com/content/76/892/80.long). The antigens used are not standardized; cross-reactivity can occur with other infectious agents (malaria, dengue, miliary tuberculosis, endocarditis, chronic liver disease, brucellosis, etc.), and previous typhoid fever immunization or treatment with antibiotics may influence results. False positive results will lead to an overdiagnosis of typhoid fever.

_Salmonella_ Typhi_ is transmitted by either an intestinal carrier or someone ill with typhoid fever, or by a non-human animal reservoir in the case of paratyphi A or B, usually by means of fecal contamination of food or water. The news report says that the villagers get water from a small stream that flows through the village, which is likely contaminated with fecal organisms. However, in the absence of more information, the outbreak could be due to some other waterborne organism, a pathogen with an entirely different mode of transmission, or even a non-infectious disease. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources about this illness.

Odisha, formerly known as Orissa, is an Indian state on the subcontinent's east coast, on the Bay of Bengal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha). Koraput is a district in southern Odisha and is said to be one of the country's 250 most "backward districts" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koraput_district). The news report refers to "red rebels" that have frightened away aid workers. These "red rebels" are likely Naxal insurgents that "have frequently targeted tribal, police, and government workers in what they say is a fight for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural labourers and the poor."
