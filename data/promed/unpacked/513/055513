Cattle killed to stop Foot & Mouth Disease
-------------------------------------------
The government said on Wed 28 Jan 2003 that 3000 head of cattle
had been slaughtered in an attempt to contain the spread of foot and
mouth disease in an area along the northern border with Zimbabwe.
Marcus Chimbombi, the director of the department of Animal Health
and Production, said cattle inspections around the country indicated
the outbreak of the disease was confined to the Matsiloje area along
the border with Zimbabwe.
The outbreak was detected in early January 2003, leading to a ban
on the movement of cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. The government
also banned the movement of fresh meat, milk, hides, and bones.
The government, which has said the outbreak is under control, has
since lifted the ban on the movement and slaughter of livestock but
has established procedures to control the movement of the products.
The ban on exports to the European Union remains in force until
further notice.
