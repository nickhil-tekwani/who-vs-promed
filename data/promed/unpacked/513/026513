Alert: Soybean rust found in kudzu patch in southern Georgia
-----------------------------------------------
The Asian strain of soybean rust (ASR) was found yesterday [3 Feb
2005] on old kudzu leaves that appear to have survived cold
temperatures in southern Georgia. Grady County becomes the 1st county
in Georgia to have rust in 2006 and brings the U.S. total to a dozen
counties in 3 states this year [2006].
Layla Sconyers, with the Department of Plant pathology of the
University of Georgia, reported on Sbrusa.net [see below] that the
infected patch of kudzu was found behind a building in downtown
Cairo, Georgia, near the Georgia/Florida border. ASR was found on
what appeared to be older leaves that had survived the cold
temperatures, thanks to protection from the building.
Scrooners said that copious amounts of rust pustules and spores were
observed by light microscopy at the University of Georgia Coastal
Plain Experiment Station.
The patch was one of 7 kudzu locations scouted on 30 Jan 2006 in
Seminole, Grady and Thomas counties. Of the 7, 5 of them had a small
percentage of greening and leaf-sprouting occurring. No ASR was found
other than in the Cairo patch.
The other ASR soybean rust locations found in 2006 were in Montgomery
County in south-central Alabama on 12 Jan 2006 and in 10 Florida
counties that were found on 11-13 Jan 2006 and confirmed on 17 and 20
Jan 2006.
By contrast, no ASR was found in the United States in 2005 until 24
Feb 2005 in Pasco County, Florida, and the 2nd find didn't come until
nearly a month later -- 21 Mar 2005 in Hernando County, Florida.

[The main concern about this outbreak in Georgia is that kudzu
(_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) is a common weed
reservoir of the pathogen. This report also summarizes the initial
detections of soybean rust for 2006 in other states. The fact that
Asian soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) has been detected
earlier than in 2005 will likely mean greater yield loss in soybean
production in the coming crop season. Moreover, more applications of
fungicides will likely be required to manage the disease.
