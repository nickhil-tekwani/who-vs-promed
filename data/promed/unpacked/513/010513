Taking notice of the viral disease that has been affecting a large number of animals at various cattle farms in Karachi, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has directed Dr Nazeer Kalhoro, the provincial director general of livestock, to send special teams to the dairy farmers to vaccinate the animals against the disease.

Kalhoro has constituted a task force to control and contain the lumpy skin disease [LSD]. The task force includes Additional Director Livestock Dr Rafique Memon as chairman, while the other members are Dr Habibullah Jamali, Dr Javed Memon and Dr Rashid Pirzada.

They will collect samples of infected animals and submit them to the Central Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory, Tando Jam, and the Sindh Institute of Animal Health. The task force will submit its daily progress reports to Kalhoro and the Chief Minister Secretariat.

The field team of the livestock department started visiting cattle farms to vaccinate cattle on Friday [4 Mar 2022].

[According to the recommendations of an EU (AFSA) expert panel (ProMED post 20160812.4410864), it is necessary to implement vaccination of the entire susceptible cattle population in regions at risk for LSDV introduction or affected by LSDV. This is in order to minimise the number of outbreaks. High vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels, should be achieved. The panel also indicated that farmers and veterinarians should be trained in the clinical identification of LSD in order to reduce underreporting.

Preventive vaccination of sick cows is useless. Furthermore, in the case of an LSD-infected herd, repeated use of the injector's needles has been shown to potentially spread the virus to uninfected animals ("iatrogenic infection").

For the selection of an efficacious and safe LSD vaccine, see Ref 1.
