As many as 3 deer were reported dead of unknown causes this week, which experts say could make Harmony Township the latest place in N.J. to see epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).

Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the the state Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife, said the deer could have died as result of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, a common viral disease in deer that is contracted from the bite of a species of midge known as _Culiocoides sonorensis_.

If the deer are found with the virus, this will be just the 2nd case in the state this year. The only confirmed case was in Salem County late last month [Aug 2012].

Ragonese said that the deer are currently being tested for the disease. It will take about 2 weeks to get results, he said. Not transmittable by contact, to either people or deer, the disease is only spread by infected midges. An outbreak of infected midges usually stems from mudflats near water. If an infected midge bites a deer, [the deer] could get the disease.

"We don't know if those deer we were told about died with EHD or for other reasons," Ragonese said.

He described signs of the disease as deer that seem to be behaving strangely. They could be staggering, unsteady and drooling with eyes that are glazed or glassy. These deer might not respond the way they typically would and can sometimes lose their fear of humans. Deer found dead with no apparent wounds or found in or near a body of water may also have the virus.

There were no deer found with the virus in Warren County last year [2011], although some were found nearby in Hunterdon County. Other possible cases have been reported in Cape May, Gloucester and Camden counties this year, although these have not been confirmed by laboratory testing.

"It's something that can occur anywhere in the state if you get the right ingredients," Ragonese said.

The disease is not considered to be a public health issue. It cannot be transmitted to people, and people are not at risk by handling infected deer, being bitten by infected midges or eating infected deer meat, although the Division of Fish and Wildlife strongly advises against consuming meat from any animal that appears ill.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) has been confirmed in 2 samples in southwestern Pennsylvania in Beaver County.

The species of _Culicoides_ that is considered the primary vector of EHD is not thought to normally occur in Pennsylvania, but is occasionally brought into the state on wind currents. As a result, Pennsylvania deer do not have any immunity to the virus because outbreaks usually occur at intervals which are longer than the average deer's lifespan [4-6 years in the wild. - Mod.JW]. This lack of immunity explains the high mortality rates during EHD outbreaks in Pennsylvania.

State wildlife and animal health officials have confirmed localized outbreaks of a common white-tailed deer disease in 8 Ohio counties, including Ashtabula, Columbiana, Geauga, Holmes, Paulding, Portage, Ross and Summit, according to Bethany McCorkle, interim chief of communications for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.

An earlier report of bluetongue disease in Hudson was incorrect, she said.

Ohio Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed that of 20 samples, 13 deer had epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). State animal health officials stress EHD occurs annually in deer herds across North America.

Bluetongue, a similar hemorrhagic disease, has been known to occur throughout the USA and Canada, but should not be confused with EHD. There are no cases of bluetongue disease confirmed in Ohio, McCorkle said.

White-tailed deer contract EHD from the biting midges, which typically live near water. White-tailed deer, along with mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope are susceptible to the disease.

The disease is not spread from deer to deer or from deer to humans, according to McCorkle. Once infected, deer show symptoms within 5 to 10 days. Infected deer initially lose their appetite and fear of people, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively and become unconscious. Many deer die within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms.

Midges can also spread EHD among cattle and sheep. These outbreaks may occur at the same time deer are being impacted. However, this is not a case of the disease spreading from deer to livestock or vice versa, but is an indication that the biting midges are present in large enough numbers to spread the disease.

State wildlife officials stress hunters this fall should report deer that appear to be sick or diseased to their local wildlife officer. Although this disease does not affect humans nor impact the safety of consumed deer, any deer that appear unhealthy should never be taken for human food.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the southeast USA. For more information on this disease, see comments on ProMED-mail post 20110918.2842. - Mod.PMB]
