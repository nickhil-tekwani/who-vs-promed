Residents from Saraf Omra have revealed the emergence of new cases of a deadly disease causing vomiting and diarrhea. It was reported on Thu 20 Dec 2012 that if patients are not treated as soon as the disease is discovered, the disease could lead to death.

A witness from Saraf Omra told Radio Dabanga on Thursday [20 Dec 2012] that the number of people infected with the disease is about 500. He added that the disease causes the skin tone to turn yellow and the eyes green. The witness said that Saraf Omra hospital is overloaded with patients with malaria, yellow fever, and the new disease. Moreover, the witness stated that serious cases are being referred to Zalingei and El Geneina hospitals for treatment.

Residents of Saraf Omra have appealed to the Ministry of Health in North Darfur to urgently send a medical team to investigate the disease in Saraf Omra and neighboring villages.

[Saraf Omra is the location of a displaced persons camp. However, the camp is not mentioned as a location of these reported cases. There is no etiological agent reported for these cases. Although the current yellow fever outbreak has included North Darfur, since malaria, yellow fever, and the "new disease" were mentioned separately among hospitalized patients, yellow fever virus infections do not seem to be a diagnosis for the new disease reported above.

The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not mention diarrhea as a common symptom of yellow fever (http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/symptoms/index.html). In the absence of additional information about the details of the disease, speculation about possible etiological agents is not warranted. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about these cases as it becomes available.
