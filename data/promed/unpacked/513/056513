[1] Colorado (Aurora): ICE facility

Mumps have been confirmed at the ICE facility in Aurora. Congressman Jason Crow wants to hear from the Department of Homeland Security about the situation with mumps, reported chicken pox and facility expansion at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

ICE responded to the mumps case with this statement, "With the recent influx of migrants coming from the southern border, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has confirmed 1 new case of parotitis, mumps, at our Denver Contract Detention Facility. Medical personnel are credited with reducing the further infection of detainees by their quick reaction to quarantine everyone who may have been inadvertently exposed to stop the spread of the disease. Each detainee receives a medical examination upon arrival at the facility to check for potential signs of illness, however ICE has no way of knowing what viruses a person may have been exposed to prior to entering the facility. Mumps is highly contagious, easily contracted by nearby people and difficult to detect until symptoms appear. ICE and the medical professionals employed by GEO took the necessary steps to quickly isolate the exposed detainees, provide proper medical care and prevent further spread of the disease. Preventative steps included education, early recognition, and following the guidelines established by the CDC and Immigration Health Services Corps (IHSC). We strive to ensure people in our care are treated with compassion and we work to get them back to health as quickly as possible while mitigating the spread of this and all diseases."

A private contractor runs the facility on Oakland Street. Crow, a Democrat representing Aurora and Adams County, contends the facility has been remodeled to increase the number of detainees by several hundred.

In particular, Crow is concerned about reports of chicken pox outbreaks. "There are workers, people and family members who are coming and going from this facility into our community- every day and if there are continued outbreaks we are very concerned about that from a public health and safety perspective," said Crow during a visit to the facility on [Wed 20 Feb 2019].

RA's brother is one of those being detained in the suddenly expanding facility. He wants to see his brother who is inside. Through his brother's attorney RA said, "He is concerned about people from the border not sure how they are treating them here, if they are putting them in isolation."

As many as 432 new beds have been put in place at the old ICE facility next door. Crow says he wants to know if the staff to oversee the detainees has been increased and if the backlog in processing detainees is the reason for the increase.

"This was unannounced; the City of Aurora didn't know about the expansion of this facility. I, as the congressman who represents this district, didn't know about it."

Crow and Aurora City Councilwoman Allison Hiltz said it was important to know what is going on inside the federally supervised facility for health and safety reasons. They were turned away when they asked for a tour. ICE said that is done by appointment only.

Crow says he expects it will take several days to get a response to his letter.

CBS4 asked Sarah Jackson what she had heard. Her organization Casa de Paz has volunteers inside regularly to visit inmates. "The person that they were to visit was quarantined because someone in their pod had chicken pox," said Jackson. She says that means they can't meet lawyers or even leave the facility if they have won their cases.

RA told us through his brother's attorney, Eric Martinson, that conditions are bad. "My client said for the last 3 days had air conditioning on like penguins, shivering without enough blankets or clothes to stay warm."

ICE wrote, "ICE is committed to ensuring that everyone in our custody receives timely access to medical services and treatment. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment detainees arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay. All ICE detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care. Pursuant to our commitment to the welfare of those in the agency's custody, ICE spends more than USD 250M annually on the spectrum of healthcare services provided to detainees."

[Kudos to Congressman Jason Crow for looking into this deplorable situation. Apparently medical services do not include vaccination for highly infectious vaccine preventable diseases. Also see ProMED-mail Varicella update (02) on the varicella outbreak in the same ICE facility. - Mod.LK]

Health officials say 7 cases of the mumps have been confirmed at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Houston. The Houston Health Department said on [Sat 9 Feb 2019] that the 7 adults were detained during their infectious period. Health officials say there's no evidence the disease was transmitted outside the facility. The health department is working with the facility on infection control.

Mumps is contagious and spreads through coughing and sneezing. Common symptoms are fever, headache, and painfully swollen salivary glands that can cause puffy cheeks. Most people recover within weeks. Outbreaks are rare but have happened in Texas and the Houston region.

The mumps vaccine is part of routine childhood shots. U.S. health officials recommend that by age 6, all children get vaccinated for mumps, measles and rubella.

[This is yet another ICE facility with a vaccine-preventable disease causing health problems for the detainees as well as potentially the staff of the facility. Are the unvaccinated staff being quarantined after exposure, as are the detainees? - Mod.LK]

There has been an 84% increase in the number of cases of mumps reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in recent weeks.

Over the 1st 5 weeks of this year [2019], the number of cases has increased to 231, compared to just 36 over the same period last year [2018], an increase of 195. There were 50 cases of the highly infectious disease reported over the week ending [Sat 2 Feb 2019].

MMR uptake rates among children in Ireland remain below the target of 95% needed to prevent the spread of mumps, according to the HPSC.

Last week [4-10 Feb 2019], the HSE alerted Trinity College Dublin that there had been cases of mumps in the university and other students might have been exposed.

[The increase in cases is likely the result of growing vaccine hesitancy, similar to the situation with measles, which is part of the same MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. - Mod.LK
