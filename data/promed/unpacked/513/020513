The New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed 10 cases of plague and 19 cases of tularemia in dogs and cats - "higher than average" this year - in multiple counties.

Plague-positive pets have been reported in Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe, Taos and Torrance counties; while pet positive tests for tularemia have been reported in Bernalillo, Los Alamos, Sandoval and Santa Fe counties.

Plague and tularemia are bacterial diseases of rodents and rabbits. Human contraction of plague is generally from flea bites, while human contraction of tularemia is from deer fly bites, Department of Health veterinarian Dr. Paul Ettestad said Mon [14 Jun 2016]. These illnesses also can be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including pets.

Ettestad said the contraction rate of both plague and tularemia this year "is higher than average, but not on a record pace." In New Mexico, plague and tularemia are more prevalent in the spring and early summer.

"We are seeing recent die-offs of rabbits in several areas of New Mexico from both plague and tularemia," Ettestad said. "People can be exposed to plague when pets bring infected fleas back into the home, by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions, or by contact with rodents or fleas outdoors. Exposure to tularemia can occur from bites from deer flies or handling infected animals or pets which have been exposed," he said.

Symptoms of plague and tularemia in humans are similar and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, swollen lymph nodes and possible infection at the bite site, Ettestad said. Likewise, he noted, signs of plague and tularemia in cats and dogs are similar, and include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite and possible swelling in the lymph node under the jaw.

The only sure way to distinguish the difference between these is through laboratory testing, he said. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. According to statistics compiled by the Department of Health for 2015, 4 people in New Mexico contracted plague, with 1 fatality in Santa Fe County, and 8 cases of tularemia were confirmed, with no fatalities. There were also 63 confirmed cases of tularemia in dogs and cats in 2015, and 18 confirmed pet plague cases.

[Fleas and ticks are the guilty party in spreading these diseases to other animals, including our pets and us. Protecting our pets and ourselves from fleas and ticks is primary. Flea and tick collars around your ankles when hiking these areas can be helpful. For pets there are generally once-a-month treatments available that work very well.

Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations, with some species being particularly susceptible. Free-ranging carnivores, including feral cats, are particularly exposed to plague as they prey on its reservoir.

Tularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects, aside from people, more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released. The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram-negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp.

Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.

The commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. - Mod.TG
