As part of routine surveillance for H5/H7 avian influenza, H5 low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was detected in a commercial duck breeder flock in Monterey County, California, exposing 9746 birds, according to information the U.S. Department of Agriculture submitted to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 24 Apr 2019.

According to the OIE report, partial HA sequencing determined the H5 to be an LPAI virus of North American wild bird lineage, but further characterization is pending virus recovery. There have been no clinical signs of illness or increased mortality on the premises, the report said.

USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the California Department of Food & Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding, the OIE report said.

Two additional commercial poultry premises associated with the initial premises have been quarantined and sampled for avian influenza virus, and the results are pending.

Control measures applied in the case include movement controls, surveillance and quarantine.

LPAI viruses typically cause few or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions and spreads primarily through direct contact among healthy and infected birds, according to APHIS. LPAI can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm, APHIS said. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Avian influenza viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must 1st be cleaned from the environment.

On the other hand, highly pathogenic avian influenza is a serious disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens and turkeys, APHIS said.

[Sadly, LPAI can mutate into HPAI. We hope that will not be the case here. It is likely the lab testing must come back before there is any decision to do more than quarantine the flock.

This article does not specify which strain of avian influenza was involved. The previous cases in this area were low pathogenicity H5N2. Information regarding specifically which type of avian influenza would be appreciated.

It is nice to know something positive could come out of the horrible situation in 2015. Of course, we do not want a replay of that.

It always takes continual vigilance to prevent and minimize disease. Biosecurity of workers and everyone entering the premises, including veterinarians, is vitally important. Prevention measures regarding wild birds and rodents are critical in keeping down the chances of an infestation. Part of biosecurity is early detection of one or a few ill birds. Fortunately, this seems contained to one barn. We hope it does not spread. - Mod.TG
