Affirming that there is an "endemic outbreak" [presumably a spike in
the number of cases in an otherwise endemic area. -Mod.TY] of
hantavirus, infectious disease specialist Dr. Daniel Stamboulian
explained over Radio 10 that the best preventive measure is to
ventilate those areas that could be harboring rats. In 2006, there
were 20 cases in Buenos Aires alone. Hantavirus [infection], a
disease that can be fatal if not diagnosed correctly, increased at
the end of 2006 in Buenos Aires Province.
The Director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, Maria del
Carmen Weiss, told Telam that in all of 2006, 20 cases [of hantavirus
infection] were confirmed, but half of these occurred in the last 2
months. She attributed this to migration from the countryside to the
cities as one of the fundamental causes for this peak incidence
during this time of the year.
One of these cases acquired the [hantavirus] infection in El Boston,
Rio Negro Province, and died in Punta del Este. The same thing
happened to 3 additional Argentines.
The hantavirus is transmitted by aerosolized particles from rat
excrement. "It is a difficult virus to transmit, and there is no
spread from person-to-person [except the Andes hantavirus, for which
there is evidence of person-to-person transmission. -Mod.TY].
Transmission occurs when there are large quantities of of the virus
that have accumulated in rat excrement. It is necessary to ventilate
the room prior to going to sleep in a cabin where there have been
rats," indicated Dr. Stamboulian. He added that "the other problem is
that the cases are serious and atypical, with symptoms of anoxia,
similar to a complicated pneumonia, cardiac insufficiency and, at
times, kidney and clotting problems. Good, intensive therapy is necessary."

[These interviews do not indicate which hantavirus is involved in these cases.
ProMED would appreciate any additional information about which of
hantaviruses were the etiological agents in these cases, and which
diagnostic tests were used. An excellent summary of hantaviruses in
Argentina was provided in a previous comment (see Mod. CP comments in
ProMED archive number 20060220.0553) as follows: Hantaviruses in
South America are maintained in sigmodontine rodents. Neither the
viruses responsible nor their presumed rodents hosts have been
identified. Several hantaviruses have been associated with human
infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the
long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_),
related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host
unknown), Lechiguanas (in central Argentina in _O. flavescens_), Oran
(in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_), and Bermejo
(western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Other hantaviruses are
present in various South American countries and in Panama.
The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>).

From: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il.>

Recent reports of disease activity in Chile highlight the fact that
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is far more common in South America
than in the United States, both in terms of case numbers [see graph:
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/chile-hanta.jpg>] and cases per 100
000 population [graph: <http://exhibit.gideononline.com/chile-hantarates.jpg>].
Interestingly, as of 25 Nov 2006, PubMED lists 330 citations for the
search terms "Hantavirus and United States" and only 30 for
"Hantavirus and Chile" ; while ProMED archives contain 298 listings
for Hantavirus and USA, vs. 71 listings for Hantavirus and Chile.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for his observation that there are more
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases reported in South America than in
the United States. ProMED welcomes reports of hantavirus infections
from anywhere in the world, and especially from South America, and
encourages colleagues in Central America and Mexico to determine if
hantaviruses are present in rodent populations in their countries,
with transmission to humans, as has been done in Panama. - Mod.TY]
