The infectious diseases team in Winnipeg [Manitoba] Canada has diagnosed a cluster of 4 cases of severe _Bartonella quintana_ endocarditis since March 2020. _B. quintana_ is transmitted via the inoculation of infected body lice feces into breaks in the skin (1,2). Thus, _B. quintana_ is a disease of poverty and reflects a lack of access to affordable housing and running water.

_B. quintana_, a fastidious Gram-negative intracellular bacillus, was historically associated with "trench fever" during World War I. Urban outbreaks among individuals who experience homelessness and pediculosis have been described (3-5).

Cases 1 and 2 were diagnosed in March 2020. Cases 3 and 4 were diagnosed in July 2020. All 4 cases displayed serological titres for immunoglobulin G above 1:8192 (the titre threshold in most case definitions for _B. quintana_ endocarditis is 1:800). Cases 1 and 2 had 16s rRNA confirmation of _B. quintana_ from excised heart valves. Cases 3 and 4 had serologic positivity but no molecular confirmation. While _B. quintana_ serology cross-reacts with _B. henselae_ (the pathogen responsible for cat scratch disease), cases 3 and 4 had epidemiological connections to cases 1 and 2 and denied any cat exposure, thus indicating infection with _B. quintana_. All cases had large aortic and/or mitral vegetations. 3 of 4 cases displayed mycotic aneurysms. Case 3 and 4 had intra-cerebral mycotic aneurysms. One presented with vegetation embolization. The large vegetation size documented at the time of acute deterioration (deemed secondary to ruptured mycotic aneurysms, valvulopathy, or embolization) reaffirms previous descriptions of _B. quintana_'s prolonged bacteremia and possible indolent presentation.

Cases 1, 2, and 3 had stayed at the same inner-city shelter in the previous 12 months. Cases 3 and 4 traveled to and from the same rural remote community. All 4 patients made full recovery with antimicrobial therapy. The 1st 2 patients also received valve replacement surgery.

Collaboration with shelters, public health, community organizations, and inner-city primary care providers is ongoing in an attempt to prevent further cases.

Culturing _B. quintana_ necessitates special microbiologic techniques that are not routinely used without explicit communication with the medical microbiology lab. Culturing the organism often requires 21 days of incubation time as well as lysis centrifugation and most labs routinely hold blood cultures for only 5-7 days. The diagnostic difficulties and the fact that this disease exclusively affects marginalized populations mean that this disease is likely under-diagnosed. The 4 cases we have seen likely only reflect the most severe manifestations of a larger spectrum of undiagnosed cases.

A member of our team (Dr Carl Boodman) is in touch with the team investigating the Denver [Colorado, USA] cluster (Dr Michelle Barron), described in the [26 Jul 2020 ProMED post, 20200726.7613880].

The history of this illness is presented below, extracted from Foucault C, Brouqui P, Raoult D: _Bartonella quintana_ characteristics and clinical management. Emerg Infect Dis 2006; 12: 217-23 (the references and entire paper can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373112/:

Trench fever, the 1st clinical manifestation attributed to _Bartonella quintana_, affected over an estimated million people during World War I (1,2). The name "trench fever" was mentioned for the 1st time in 1915 (3,4). In 1916, McNee et al. described 2 types of the disease (5). The 1st was characterized by a sudden onset of headache, dizziness, pain in the shins, and elevated temperature (39-40 C [102-104 F]). Between days 3 and 7, temperature would suddenly drop to normal or subnormal. Thereafter, temperature rose sharply before falling again. The 2nd manifestation of the disease was characterized by a shorter initial period and frequent relapses. In 1919, 200 consecutive cases were recorded by Byam et al., and transmission by human body lice was demonstrated, but the nature of the trench fever agent was still unknown (4).

Trench fever was precisely described based on experimental infections in volunteer soldiers (4). The 1st experiments consisted of transmitting whole blood from typical cases to volunteers, which reproduced natural infection. Byam confirmed in 1919 the others' work, showing that "rickettsia bodies" were present in lice, their excreta, and their guts when they were collected from trench fever patients. In 1949, Kostrzewski precisely described trench fever after an accidental epidemic spread among louse-feeders in laboratories that produced typhus vaccine (6). Of 104 persons who worked with lice, 90 contracted symptomatic trench fever, and 5 were asymptomatic carriers. 3 different courses of trench fever were described by Kostrzewski: the classic relapsing form associated with shin pain, headaches, and dizziness; the typhoidal form characterized by prolonged fever, splenomegaly, and rash; and the abortive form, characterized by a brief, less intense course.

After World War I, the incidence of trench fever decreased dramatically, but during World War II, epidemics were again reported (6). More recently, reports have indicated the reemergence of _B. quintana_ infections among the homeless population in cities in both Europe and the United States (7,8). Major predisposing factors for new _B. quintana_ infections include poor living conditions and chronic alcoholism (8). Epidemics of trench fever were also recently reported in particular conditions, such as in refugee camps in Burundi in 1997, where pediculosis was prevalent (1). - Mod.LL
