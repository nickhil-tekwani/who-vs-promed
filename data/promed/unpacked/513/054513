The Director General of the Ministry of Health in West Darfur, Osman Ali Abakar, reported the death of a new-born girl (27 days) due to monkeypox in the state. One other case is in home quarantine, and 2 cases are recovering.

He told Radio Dabanga's Sudan Today programme that 7 suspected cases of monkeypox appeared in West Darfur and that samples were sent to Khartoum for laboratory examination.

He warned of the spread of infection cases in the state capital of El Geneina and the localities of Sirba, Kereinik, and Foro Baranga, and said that the health authorities had begun urgent research and investigation into the cause of the spread, stressing that they had not yet identified the source.

He called on the people to be vigilant and to report any case that resembles skin allergies among children, and to isolate the suspected case immediately.

Last week [week of 19 Sep 2022], Sudan's federal Ministry of Health announced the registration of 5 new cases of monkeypox, including 2 in West Darfur and one in Khartoum, Kassala, and North Darfur (as noted above).

The Federal Ministry of Health announced the 1st confirmed case of monkeypox in Sudan on 28 Jul 2022.

https://citinewsroom.com/2022/09/55-monkey-pox-cases-one-death-recorded-in-greater-accra/


The Greater Accra Regional Health Directorate has confirmed 55 cases of monkeypox with one death as of 15 Sep, 2022.

The Greater Accra Regional Director of Health, Dr Charity Sarpong, provided the update on the disease at the 2022 annual meeting of the Greater Accra Regional Coordinating Council.

He indicated that "33 percent of the cases were recorded in the Accra metropolis."

Monkeypox occurs mainly in remote parts of central and west African countries, near tropical rainforests. In those regions, there have been over 1200 cases of monkeypox since the start of the year [2022].

There are 2 main strains of the virus, from West Africa and Central Africa. The milder strain is from West Africa, which is now circulating in other parts of the world.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
The recent global outbreak of the human monkeypox virus (MPXV) was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is currently the only FDA-approved vaccine against MPXV that was approved for this indication based on a study in non-human primates. Since there is currently scarce evidence of the efficacy in humans, our objective was to evaluate real-life vaccine effectiveness (VE) after providing one vaccine dose to individuals at risk of MPVX infection.

Methods
The study cohort included all Clalit Health Services (CHS) members eligible for the MVA vaccine as defined by the Israeli Ministry of Health. The study commenced on 31 Jul 2022, when the MVA vaccination campaign was initiated in CHS, and participants were followed until 12 Sep 2022. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to estimate the association between vaccination and MPXV infections with adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors.

Findings
A total of 1970 subjects met the study eligibility criteria (0.04% of CHS members). Of them, 873 (44%) were vaccinated with MVA and completed at least 25 days of follow-up. 18 infections were confirmed in CHS during the study period, 3 in vaccinated and 15 in unvaccinated status (40.0 versus 6.4 per 100,000 person days). VE was estimated at 79% (95% CI: 24%-94%).

Interpretation
Our results suggest that a single dose of MVA is associated with a significantly lower risk for MPVX infection in high-risk individuals. These findings highlight that urgent MVA vaccination of high-risk individuals may contribute to the containment of the current MPXV outbreak.

[Mod. ML noted that MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara) is the same as the Jynneos vaccine and was administered in this study subcutaneously with only one dose vs 2 doses intradermally 4 weeks apart in the USA. The intradermal dose is one fifth the volume of the subcutaneous dose (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply). - Mod.TY]
