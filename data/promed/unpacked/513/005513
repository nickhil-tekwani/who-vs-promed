Students to get 2nd measles inoculation
-----------------------
Students will begin receiving their 2nd measles inoculation in middle
school and high school next academic year [2007/2008?], the Health,
Labor and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday [10 Jul 2007].
In light of May's [2007] measles outbreak among university students
[see prior ProMED-mail postings listed below], a ministry panel
tasked with discussing vaccinations has come up with the 5-year plan,
which calls for 1st-year middle schoolers and 3rd-year high-schoolers
to receive the vaccination. The measure, to take effect in April
[?2008], is aimed at strengthening the immunity to measles in young
people who have only been inoculated once.
The panel, led by Tatsuo Kato, president of the National Center for
Child Health and Development, will further discuss the introduction
of a system by which all cases of measles are reported and
vaccinations will be offered at schools. Until March last year
[2006], one-off measles vaccinations for children aged 3 months to
7-1/2 years had been encouraged in Japan [one-off presumably refers
to a single dose of vaccination - Mod.MPP].
In line with many industrially advanced countries, which administer
the measles vaccine twice, Japan introduced in April last year [2006]
the double vaccination, 1st [dose] for children 12 to 24 months old
and then again before being admitted to primary school. Children in
2nd grade or older, however, have only received one measles vaccination.
Due to the lack of exposure to the virus thanks to the increased rate
of inoculation, fewer people are developing immunity to measles.

[The change in vaccination recommendations to include 2nd dose of
vaccines for school age children is a good start in the necessary
catchup to prevent future outbreaks of measles in Japan.
The most recent update on measles available in English from the Japan
National Institute of Health is from epidemiologic week 23 (4-10 Jun 2007)
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/disease/measles_e/idwr200723.html> and is
excerpted below:
"Sentinel Surveillance:
Between [1 Jan 2007 and 10 Jun 2007], a total of 1529 measles cases
from 3000 pediatric sentinels have been reported nationwide. 204
cases were reported in 23rd epidemiological week (from 4 to 10 June).
Breakdown of new reported cases are as follows; cases reported from
30 prefectures; 114 cases from southern Kanto area (Chiba, Kanagawa,
Saitama and Tokyo), 29 cases from northern part of Japan including
Miyagi and Hokkaido. The number of reported case from Chiba is still
increasing. Characteristic age distribution continues; fewer cases
are seen among 0 to 4-year-old (N=568, 37.1 percent) compared to
average year (55 to 67 percent) and more cases are reported from 10
to 14-year-old (N=470, 30.7 percent) compared to average year (5 to
15 percent).
Regarding adult measles (cases of 15-year-old and older), between [1
Jan 2007 and 10 Jun 2007], a total of 525 cases have been reported
from 450 hospital sentinels; 183 cases from Tokyo, 71 cases from
Kanagawa, 53 cases from Miyagi and 36 cases from Saitama.
Approximately 90 percent of the cases are reported from the group
under 35-years-old. In 23rd epidemiological week, 50 new cases have
been reported from sentinels. Numbers have decreased 2 weeks in a row."
As of that time (10 Jun 2007), 48 percent of reported cases through
the sentinel surveillance units were in individuals 10 year of age or
older -- above the age at which a 2nd dose of measles containing
vaccine would have been received based on the vaccination schedule
implemented in April 2006.
