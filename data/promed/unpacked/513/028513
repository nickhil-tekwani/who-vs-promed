53 students from a public school in Rafenbuyol (Valencia) between 3 and 12 years of age were affected by a condition compatible with food-borne illness. Of the 53 children, 28 have been taken care of in local health centers, and one was admitted in the Valencia Clinical Hospital, but his condition is not severe.

Sources from the Health Council explained the current situation, and they mentioned that the Public Health Service had used the protocol for such events, starting with an epidemiological survey and analyzing samples taken in the center in order to find out the causes(s) for this occurrence.

Results will be available in a few days, and it cannot be confirmed now whether this corresponds to a gastrointestinal infection, salmonellosis or any other condition, according to Public Health sources.

The affected children, particularly the younger ones, developed fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting last Fri 9 May 2014, just as the Parent Union pointed out in its Facebook page, in which they advised parents to go to their local health center in case children develop the aforementioned symptoms.
