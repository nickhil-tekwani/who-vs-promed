Thirty-six people have died due to an unknown disease that has spread
in 4 village development committees [VDC] of midwestern Banke
district during the last 2 weeks. The number of patients who are
suffering from the disease has risen to 500.
The toll has risen to 23 in Phattehpur VDC, 10 in Gangapur VDC, 2 in
Narainapur and one in Chauferi village.
According to newspaper reports, most of those dead are children and
the aged. Over 36 people are in a critical condition.
According to locals, viral fever, body ache, shivering and sudden
unconsciousness are some of the symptoms of the "mysterious ailment".
The locals said that almost every household in these villages has at
least one member suffering from the mysterious disease.
Head of the epidemic control programme in the Banke District Public
Health Office (DPHO), Ram Bahadur Chand, confirmed that 36 people
have died due to the epidemic in the last week across the Rapti [the
administrative region, or anchal].
Even though the DPHO dispatched a team, blood tests could not be done
due to the absence of electricity. As a result, the disease could not
be identified. Blood samples have been taken from some people and
medicines given to them, The Himalayan Times Daily quoted assistant
health worker Narayan Sharma as saying.

[While searching for a map of the affected area (Banke district),
this moderator came upon a map prepared by Relief Web showing the
areas affected by flooding in the beginning of September 2006. (A
map of Nepal showing the district Banke and it's position in the
country can be found at
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Sa.nsf/luFullMap/C56204714E324A2A852571F500593C44/$File/ocha_FL_npl050906.pdf?OpenElement>.)
With the history of recent flooding, there is the likelihood of
increases in vectors such as mosquitoes. There is also the
possibility that the above-mentioned "mystery disease" is malaria or
dengue fever. Other possibilities would include influenza (although
respiratory illness is not described) and Japanese encephalitis, as
frequently the description of "viral fever" has been applied to both
diseases in lay press reports from Nepal. The wording of the newswire
(some of which we have edited out) is suggestive of wording used in
other newswires from prior "mystery illness" reports from Nepal,
indicating that this report came from a relatively remote area with
limited access to basic health infrastructure. Clearly, more
information on the etiology of this outbreak from knowledgeable
sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
