Italian citrus production affected by disease
---------------------------------------------
Italy's citrus production for the 2014-2015 season is expected to take a hit due to a lack of rain and the _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV).

Orange production is expected to be 24 per cent lower than the previous season [with] about 32 000 hectares [about 79 000 acres] of orange groves in Catania and Syracuse affected by CTV.

Tangerine production is expected to drop by 15 per cent. Clementine and mandarin productions are also expected to be lower, with drops of 19 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Lemon production, on the other hand, is expected to stay relatively stable.

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses and has destroyed millions of trees worldwide. Besides citrus species (family of _Rutacea_), it affects hosts in only few other families, and it appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in severity, and symptoms also depend on the citrus variety and the scion-rootstock combination. The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of _Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. CTV has been included on the alert lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline, stem pitting, and a mild type, and may occur singly or in combination. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas. Disease management for CTV includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum and vector control.

In Italy, the 1st report of a significant CTV outbreak in a citrus-growing area was reported from Sicilia in 2003 (ProMED-mail post 20030312.0609). Apparently, no effective control measures have been implemented in the country leading to a high CTV incidence in Sicilian citrus (see also ProMED-mail post 20130329.1610397).
