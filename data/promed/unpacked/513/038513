Oyster illness outbreak under investigation
-------------------------------------------
Several British Columbia (B.C.) health agencies, as well as the
Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA), are scrambling to contain an outbreak of illness
related to raw West Coast oysters. It's unclear how many people have
been sickened by the oysters, which were distributed in B.C., Alberta
and Ontario. It's possible the oysters were sold in other parts of
the country too, the CFIA said.

The CFIA has issued an alert for Effingham extra small raw oysters
processed at Albion Fisheries and Sea World Fisheries in Vancouver.
The oysters were sold in bags of 60. The Albion-processed oysters
have lot numbers 172688 and 172929, the Sea World oysters have the
code NY-OY-10091401. However, CFIA also warned that the affected
oysters might have been sold in smaller quantities at seafood
counters where consumers would not know where they came from or see
any identifying codes or lot numbers.

Oysters contaminated with food-borne pathogens may not look or smell
spoiled, but can cause serious illness. Symptoms include nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache, dizziness and
neck stiffness. Those particularly at risk include young children,
pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.

Vancouver-processed raw oysters recalled
------------------------------------------------------
A voluntary recall has been issued for a brand of raw West Coast
oysters after 3 groups of diners got food poisoning after eating
together in the Vancouver area. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) is warning the public not to eat Effingham extra small raw
oysters, produced by Albion Fisheries and Sea World Fisheries, after
the 16 people became ill.

"They had norovirus-like illness -- diarrhea, vomiting, stomach
cramps -- and they've now recovered," said Anna Marie D'Angelo, a
spokeswoman for Vancouver Coastal Health Authority. D'Angelo said the
unrelated groups of people became sick last Friday [17 Sep 2010],
Sunday and Monday, leading to an investigation and then the recall.
She didn't know if people in other areas of the province have become sick too.

The oysters would have been distributed in British Columbia, Alberta
and Ontario, and could also be sold in other provinces, according to
the agency. They are typically sold in packages of 60, but may also
have been available in smaller quantities at seafood counters.
Consumers unsure about whether oysters they've purchased are affected
by the recall are advised to check with the retailer.

The agency is working with the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority,
the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, the Public Health
Agency of Canada and Health Canada to investigate the reported
illnesses. Food poisoning symptoms may include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, fever and headaches.

The affected products include Albion Fisheries Ltd., lot numbers
172688 and 172929 and Sea World Fisheries Ltd., lot number NY-OY-10091401.

CFIA/Health Hazard Alert: Certain Raw Oysters May Contain Foodborne Pathogens
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is warning the public not
to consume the raw oysters described below because they may contain
foodborne pathogens.

The following Effingham XSM (extra small) raw oysters are affected by
this alert:

Processed By / Size / Code
------------------------------
Albion Fisheries Ltd., Vancouver, BD / 5 dozen oysters per
bag / Lot # 172688
Albion Fisheries Ltd., Vancouver, BC / 5 dozen oysters per
bag / Lot # 172929
Sea World Fisheries Ltd., Vancouver, BC / 5 dozen oysters per
bag / NY-OY-10091401

In addition, these raw oysters may have been sold in smaller
quantities at some retail seafood counters. Consumers who are unsure
whether they have the affected product are advised to check with
their retailer or supplier.

These raw oysters are known to be distributed in British Columbia,
Alberta and Ontario. However, they may have been distributed in other
provinces.

There have been reported illnesses associated with the consumption of
these raw oysters. The CFIA is collaborating with its partners,
Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control (BC CDC), Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and Health
Canada to investigate these illnesses. This investigation is ongoing.

Food contaminated with foodborne pathogens may not look or smell
spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with these organisms may
cause foodborne illness, sometimes called food poisoning. Symptoms
vary by organism, but can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
abdominal pain, fever, headache, dizziness and neck stiffness. Young
children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune
systems may be more at risk.

The processors of raw oysters are voluntarily recalling the affected
products from the marketplace. The CFIA is monitoring the
effectiveness of the recall.

[This outbreak of food-borne illness has been attributed to norovirus
infection on the basis of symptomology and the ubiquity of norovirus
infection of oysters and similar filter-feeding organisms (see
ProMED-mail references below). Noroviruses (genus _Norovirus_,
family _Caliciviridae_) are a group of related, single-stranded RNA,
non-enveloped viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. The
most common symptoms of acute gastroenteritis are diarrhea, vomiting,
and stomach pain.

The incubation period for norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in
humans is usually between 24 and 48 hours (median in outbreaks, 33 to
36 hours), but cases can occur within 12 hours of exposure. Norovirus
infection usually presents as acute-onset vomiting, watery non-bloody
diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. Low-grade fever also
occasionally occurs, and diarrhea is more common than vomiting in
children. Dehydration is the most common complication, especially
among the young and elderly, and may require medical attention.
Symptoms usually last 24 to 72 hours.

Recovery is usually complete and there is no evidence of any serious
long-term sequelae. Studies with volunteers given the virus have
shown that asymptomatic infection may occur in as many as 30 percent
of infections, although the role of asymptomatic infection in
norovirus transmission is not well understood. For further information see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus-factsheet.htm>.
