In reply to the posting about the motivation behind linking a school
based Hepatitis A infection with strawberries supplied from Mexico:
Don't forget the main reason why the "Mexican connection" was
important--the Michigan schools got these strawberries through a
government surplus food program which is supposed to supply only
American-grown food.
You are right that the epidemiologic evidence only _suggests_ the
cafeteria-served strawberries were the source. Anyone who makes the
leap from that study to Mexican origin of the virus is reading too
much into the news by a long shot.
But the (USDA?) program supplying surplus food to school cafeterias
requires the food be grown in the US. So the newsworthy point here
is that at least one supplier of the surplus food program seemingly
misrepresented the origin of the food they supplied. Seems it's
always news when corporations get caught circumventing the law.
Whether you agree with that stipulation in the law or not, whether
you see it as perpetuating illegal immigrant labor on California
farms, as opposed to allowing Mexican agricultural workers to work in
their own country, or as an important program to support American
farmers' survival, it is still the law.
I have to say that the tone of the news, ProMed and other articles on
the outbreak has generally _avoided_ blaming Michigan illness on
Mexican farms. It is to some extent up to the reader, whether public
health professional or lay public, to avoid making guilt-by-
association conclusions when reading the news.

Given lumpy contamination of water (or fields by workers with no bathrooms
available) and strawberries moving through a central processing point in
California, all schools receiving from that point would have an equal
probability of exposure. It would not be possible to predict which schools
would be affected, only that a certain proportion would be, and whether they
were adjacent to each other would be irrelevant.
Many of us predicted exactly this at the time NAFTA was being negotiated, and
argued that provision of good wages and toilet facilities to workers, as well
as enforcement of environmental standards, should be core to the agreement
and not "add-ons". Tragically (for the many people who will continue to pay
the price), the fantasy world of low-cost food which the business, economic
and politic leaders live in has no microbial or human life in it. That Latino
workers should be treated well and paid well was a preposterous idea which
would merely increase the cost of food.
It is this kind of thinking which is at the root of almost all the emerging
infectious disease epidemics worldwide, and taking government money to invest
in medical research and treatment in the face of this is like receiving money
from an arsonist to buy new fire engines.
I suppose running short courses in the non-linear complexity of
socio-ecological systems for business and political leaders might help, but
at a time when many of them seem to be in a pre-Leeuwenhoek mode I don't have
a great deal of hope.
