Situation report on atypical pneumonia 20 Apr 2003
As of 1 PM 20 Apr 2003, there were an additional 22 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 4 healthcare workers (2 from Prince of Wales Hospital, one
from Caritas Medical Centre, one from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole
Hospital). The remaining 18 were other patients and contacts of patients
with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 409 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 46 were discharged today.
102 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care units.
7 patients died among Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH), Kwong
Wah Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), Queen Elizabeth Hospital
(QEH), Tseung Kwan O Hospital (TKO)and Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH). This
brought to 88 the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia.
The deceased include an 88-year-old man and 2 elderly women aged 71 and 75
respectively, who have a history of chronic disease. The remaining are 3
women and one man, aged between 35 and 47.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths *
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 315/ 116/
Patients, family members & visitors: 1065/ 293/
Total: 1380/ 409/ 88
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively
late stage of infection.

SARS Situation Update 20 Apr 2003
As of 20 Apr 2003, 4 additional SARS patients have been discharged,
bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 104.
58 SARS patients remain hospitalised. There is one additional SARS case
reported today. She is a 28-year-old female visitor who was in contact with
a SARS patient in [National University Hospital] NUH Emergency Department.
The SARS patient was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, transferred to [Tan
Tock Seng Hospital] TTSH on 9 Apr 2003 and died on 12 Apr 2003.
Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market
Active contact tracing is currently underway for persons who might have
come into contact with the 3 SARS cases from the Pasir Panjang Wholesale
Market. They include their family members, and the [General Practitioner]
GP and sinsehs [Chinese traditional doctors] that the patients had visited.
They will be served home quarantine orders.
In addition, as a precaution, all the stallholders and employees at the
Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market will also be placed on home quarantine
orders for a period of 10 days. Persons who are served the Home Quarantine
Order must stay at home at all times for the duration stated in the Order.
If they breach the order, they will be liable for a fine or jail term. The
government would provide financial assistance to those served with the Home
Quarantine Orders for the period of the quarantine.
The Ministry of Health would like to strongly urge members of the public
who have been to the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market during the period from
5 to 19 Apr 2003 and who have a fever or symptoms of muscle ache, cough, or
difficulty in breathing, to call the MOH Special Ambulance Hotline at
9-178-8477 / 9-178-8478 immediately. An ambulance will be despatched to
bring them for screening at the Emergency Department, Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
It is critical that we minimise the risk of community spread of SARS. The
strong pre-emptive measures being taken are in line with this, but we also
need the full cooperation of the public; those who have visited Pasir
Panjang Wholesale Market should come forward to TTSH for assessment, as
soon as they have fever or feel unwell.
It is Safe to go to TTSH
The public can be assured that they will not catch SARS by coming to Tan
Tock Seng Hospital for SARS screening or follow-up. Tan Tock Seng Hospital
is safe because of the stringent infection controls. No TTSH staff looking
after known SARS patients have caught the infection after the enhanced
infection control precautions were put in place in TTSH. Strict infection
control measures are in place at TTSH to ensure the safety of those who go
there for SARS screening. Masks are given to all patients. All staff wear
masks, gowns, and gloves so they cannot infect patients or get infected.
Spacious waiting areas are provided. Patients with low risks of SARS are
seen by separate doctors in separate clinics. Patients admitted for
observation are provided individual rooms. They are never made to stay with
other Suspect patients or Probable SARS patients. All precautions are taken
so that patients are protected from catching the infection.
Summary of SARS cases
A summary of the SARS cases to date:
Discharged: 104
Hospitalised: 58 (including 19 in intensive care)
Deaths: 14 + 2 (pending further post mortem test results)
Total: 178
Suspected: 87 (including 7 children below 18)
Under home quarantine orders: 467

[A] China Admits a Tenfold Increase of SARS Cases in Beijing
<http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/science/AP-SARS-Virus.html>

China reported a jump in SARS deaths on Sunday and a 10-fold increase of
infected people in the capital -- an embarrassing admission that cost the
health minister and the Beijing mayor their Communist Party
posts. Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a
major week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go
traveling.
The demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng
Xuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to
announce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as
secretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.
Meng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal
Committee.
The government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people
and that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to
346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its
cases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news
conference. "With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in
Beijing, the situation is already very serious," Gao said. He added there
were 402 more suspected cases in the capital.
Gao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared
for the outbreak. The ministry "has not given out clear instructions or
effective guidance," he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were
intentionally hidden from investigators. "We have not discovered any
locality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics," he said.
In recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid
unnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to
encourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the
week-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major
shift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were
canceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to
boost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. "The purpose of
such an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible
spread of the disease," Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could
deal a big blow to China's economy. "I'm sure this measure will mean
massive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be
put above everything else," Gao said.
So far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural
areas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to
medical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, "the consequences would
be grim," he said.
[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases
<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>
With bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a
senior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of
previously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed
what he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered
hospitals. "Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in
a timely manner," he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather
than deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such
sensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on
a national television channel.
The unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings
(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to
play down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the
World Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and
by Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far
more patients than officials had acknowledged.
Today, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the
ministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several
political jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and
others, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of
today, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures
throughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao
announced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of
SARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case
reports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of
error in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several
major hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian
patients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that
more than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted
from public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and
today, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS
patients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of
them were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.
Over the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to
all of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to
verify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.
They came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World
Health Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused
consternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the
total might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to
understand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden
new surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up
to reality. "In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be
confirmed," he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.
Gao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say
whether new cases each day are now rising or falling.

[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC
<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>
China's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk
of infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the
virus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.
Although they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5
came back with a fever.
Doctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says
the Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the
possibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia
region is very real. "There has been contact with their friends and
family, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with
Inner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia
every day." In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been
banned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses. And at
night, there is an eerie calm, as bars and restaurants have been ordered
shut by 10 PM.
[B] Canada from Canada.com 20 Apr 2003
<http://www.canada.com/toronto/story.asp?id=08A84C1A-93F2-488C-B1EE-825A520429D4>
A new cluster erupted at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences
Centre in suburban Toronto, which has treated about half the region's SARS
patients over the past month. As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including
at least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in
hospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine
as potential SARS cases.
Officials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during
difficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.
Intubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate
breathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16
and 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and
control, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation
procedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's "full-droplet"
protection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. "We
were using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for
Disease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients," she
said, adding "it's possible some potentially infected staff members were
not present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're
looking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular
procedure safer for the health care workers," she said. One option is
anesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.
The hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health
Canada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC
expert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent
on objects much longer than previously thought. "....in their studies, they
found that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much
as 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to
survive in the environment."

<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>
A woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute
respiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto
last week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the
train on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger "pod"
with 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the
medical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the
illness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at
4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public
health spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at
7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever
and was "feeling unwell," but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to
Mount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].

<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>
SARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in
north China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of
7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in
Zhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast
China, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
Zhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process
and the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'
families and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in
isolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said
that they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.
Meanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,
reported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province
and there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have
recovered and been discharged from hospitals.

[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the
previous 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise
healthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has
been one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern
about potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry
of Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home
quarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and
recommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan
Tock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.
The news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an
under-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It
appears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious
about collaboration with the international community with respect to
disease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but
most quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in
general for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly
contributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible
"denial" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation
of appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,
combined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical
attention on the part of the general population, thereby having more
potential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article
at present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in
the CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,
(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one
might expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from
elsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been
introduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be
of interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,
demonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at
numbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the "outbreak" of
reporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.
The news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related
to the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in
Canada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,
accidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control
procedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,
at least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported. The
discussion surrounding possible persistence of viable virus in the
environment for 24 or more hours is another potential source of
concern. We await official information on this -- hopefully in the form of
an official scientific document for review.
The second newswire from Canada [5][C] illustrates the challenges for
implementation of disease control measures. At what point does an
individual recognize that they may have a serious illness and therefore
should be limiting public exposures? - Mod.MPP]
