Emergence of enterovirus D68 in Denmark, June 2014 - February 2015
------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Midgley SE, Christiansen CB, Poulsen MW, Hansen CH, Fischer TK]

Summary
-------
From June 2014 through February 2015, respiratory samples from 130 Danish patients were screened for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). 14 EV-D68 cases were detected, of which 12 presented with respiratory symptoms, and 8 had known underlying disease. The median age of EV-D68 cases was 3 years (interquartile range: 0-30 years). Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) was not detected although Danish EV-D68 strains showed greater than 98 percent nt identity with EV-D68-strains from AFP cases from the United States and France.

Background
----------
This study reports the burden and characteristics of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) disease in Denmark from June 2014 through February 2015. A retro- and prospective EV-D68 surveillance study was implemented at the National Danish World Health Organization (WHO) Reference Laboratory for Poliovirus at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) Copenhagen, in September 2014 as a result of the extensive outbreak of severe respiratory disease caused by EV-D68 in the United States (US) and Canadathat started in July 2014. Surveillance for EV-D68 in respiratory samples has continued in Denmark since then. A number of neurological cases associated with EV-D68 have also been reported as well as a small number of likely EV-D68 associated fatalities.

Outcome
-------
EV-D68, which is a member of the large _Picornaviridae_ family of viruses, has primarily been associated with mild to severe respiratory infections. Historically, EV-D68 was only sporadically detected worldwide during the usual EV seasonal epidemics, but since 2008 the EV-D68 has occasionally given rise to larger outbreaks globally, although no previous outbreak has seen neither the same scale nor severity as the North American EV-D68 outbreak in 2014. Shortly after the North American outbreak was announced in July [2014], EV-D68 cases were detected in Europe, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) issued a rapid risk assessment on 26 Sep 2014. Denmark joined an initiative started by the European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) to investigate the prevalence of EV-D68 in the European region in a retro- and prospective study covering June through November 2014.

In Denmark, approximately 10 percent of respiratory samples tested between June 2014 and February 2015 were positive for EV and/or human rhinovirus (HRV), and of these 11 percent were determined to be EV-D68 by a combination of 5'NTR, VP1, and VP2 PCR and sequencing. This is a comparable detection rate to that described in other countries during the same period. No EV-D68 was detected in samples that were HRV-positive only, suggesting that the EV and HRV diagnostic result for EV-D68 cases is due to cross-reaction in the HRV assay. However, only 29.6 percent of double positive EV and HRV cases were associated with EV-D68. Other respiratory EV may also cross-react in an HRV assay in the 5'NTR, and, as a consequence, diagnostic laboratory reports from SSI for samples which are EV and HRV positive now contain a comment stating that this result may be due to infection with a virus detectable using both assays, rather than a double infection. The number of samples with this result has historically been small at SSI; should it continue to increase beyond the 10% rate identified in this study, the HRV assay may need to be revised.

Not all EV-D68 samples were detected using real-time and VP1 PCR, illustrating the difficulties in detecting and genotyping EVs in general due to the high level of diversity within this family of viruses. Danish strains were genetically very closely related to strains from AFP cases in the US and France, and AFP cases have also been described in Norway. Strains from 2014 from countries other than Denmark also show a close genetic relationship to strains from AFP cases, suggesting host factors play an important role in the development of AFP as a result of EV-D68 infection. Underlying disease appears to increase the risk for severe infection, and therefore potentially also AFP. There is, however, no definite link between underlying disease and development of AFP, suggesting the involvement of other host factors. The level of viraemia may also contribute.

Following the detection of the 1st Danish EV-D68 cases during the fall of 2014, the National WHO Reference Laboratory for Poliovirus at SSI communicated these findings, alongside a description of the EV-D68 epidemic in the US, to all Danish clinicians including general practitioners and microbiologists with an appeal for vigilance regarding severe respiratory symptoms and AFP. Newsletters were posted on the National Clinical and Microbiology Societies websites and sent out using mailing lists, and an article was published in the weekly epidemiological Bulletin (EPI-NEWS) issued by the SSI. Although Danish cases with EV-D68 and underlying conditions did experience severe respiratory symptoms, no cases of AFP were reported.

[Overall, although Danish cases with EV-D68 infection and underlying conditions did experience severe respiratory symptoms, no cases of AFP were reported. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) was not detected although Danish EV-D68 strains showed more than 98 percent nt identity with EV-D68-strains from AFP cases from the United States and France. - Mod.CP
