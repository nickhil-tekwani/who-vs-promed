[1] Liberia: new case, sexual transmission suspected

A Liberian woman who last week became the country's 1st Ebola patient in more than one month has not passed on the infection to anyone else, a senior official said Wed 25 Mar 2015. The case was a setback to hopes that Liberia, once the worst Ebola-hit country, would soon be officially declared free of the deadly disease.

"The patient is in a stable condition. She is responding to treatment," said Francis Karteh, the head of Liberia's Ebola Incident Management Team. "She had contact with more than 50 people. We have been following these people, and they are all home with no sign of Ebola yet." The woman is the wife of a cured Ebola patient, a source said. [at present they are speculating the husband may have infected her through sexual intercourse after returning home, but there is no documentation of this. A very good article describing this case and some of the investigations can be found at http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/world/africa/exposure-concerns-grow-in-liberia-after-diagnosis-of-first-ebola-case-in-weeks.html?hpw&rref=health&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-regionÂ®ion=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well. - Mod.MPP]

25 Mar 2015: Liberia reports 2 new Ebola cases [in addition to the case above]
http://www.aa.com.tr/en/rss/483684--liberia-reports-2-new-ebola-cases
[Total new cases: 3. One of the 2 cases involved an 18-year-old girl who was taking care of her 44-year-old mother who recently tested positive for the virus. The 2nd new case is a young man whose girlfriend is said to be involved in cross-border trade from the New Kru Town community (town in a suburb of Liberia's capital, Monrovia). Contact tracers are still trying to convince the young man to reveal his contacts. He was discovered to have Ebola after being seen in the Clara Town area vomiting blood, following which he was taken to the Ebola treatment unit.]
[The senior official quoted above was not necessarily wrong; no connection has been traced between the 1st patient and these 2 new ones. - Mod.JW]

[2] CDC centers for W. Africa

The US government, learning from the immediate past experience of the outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa and its devastating human cost, has announced an ambitious plan to construct an annex of its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Liberia and 2 others in Guinea and Sierra Leone.

According to CDC's Deputy Director for Ebola Response to Liberia, Desmond Williams, the move is in an effort to quickly detect and control any infectious disease outbreak in the future. Speaking at the 1st National Conference on Ebola in Monrovia recently, Dr. Williams, who has a Sierra Leonean background, disclosed that the CDC is poised to establish offices in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone to counter the recurrence of the Ebola virus or the outbreak of any other infectious disease...

The most urgent need for the 3 countries is revamping their fragile health systems, with the building of health infrastructures, equipment and the training of more health practitioners. The building of the CDC annexes in the 3 countries will ensure an immediate response whenever there is an outbreak of any infectious disease in the West African sub-region.

[3] Slow response to Ebola epidemic
Date: Sun 22 Mar 2015
Source: Time [edited]
http://time.com/3753684/ebola-medecins-sans-frontiers-west-africa-world-health-organization-slow-response-cost-lives/


Medecins sans Frontiers [MSF], the leading international medical charity, released a report Monday [23 Mar 2015] coinciding with the one-year anniversary of the outbreak's start. It said warnings that the disease's spread was out of control were dismissed as alarmist and that early calls for help were ignored by local governments and the World Health Organization (WHO). "For the Ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail. And they did, with tragic and avoidable consequences," said MSF's general director Christopher Stokes in the report.

MSF 1st declared there was an Ebola outbreak at the end of March 2014 last year, but this was rejected by the WHO; 3 months later, the body officially confirmed the outbreak. The governments of Guinea and Sierra Leone also downplayed the epidemic, according to the report, and Sierra Leone withheld crucial data that prevented MSF from identifying affected villages.

"The Ministry of Health and the partners of Kenema hospital [outside the capital Freetown] refused to share data or lists of contacts with MSF, so we were working in the dark while cases kept coming in," said MSF's emergency coordinator in Sierra Leone, Anja Wolz. By the end of August 2014, medical centers were overwhelmed, and health workers were forced to turn away infected patients. "We had to make horrendous decisions about who we could let into the center," said MSF coordinator Rosa Crestani. "We could only offer very basic palliative care, and there were so many patients and so few staff that the staff had on average only one minute per patient. It was an indescribable horror."

Numbers of Ebola cases are falling, but MSF says the outbreak isn't over yet. Liberia recorded its 1st new case in more than 2 weeks on Fri [20 Mar 2015]; Sierra Leone launched a national lock down over the weekend, and cases in Guinea are rising again after a dip earlier in the year.

[4] Lessons for the next epidemic
Date: Sun 22 Mar 2015
Source: NY Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/one-year-later-ebola-outbreak-offers-lessons-for-next-epidemic.html?emc=edit_tnt_20150322&nlid=64387319&tntemail0=y&_r=0


One year has passed since the declaration of what became the largest Ebola outbreak in history, with more than 10 000 deaths. The virus escaped control as countries and global agencies failed to acknowledge and contend with the magnitude of its spread. Treatment centers were overwhelmed. Sick people died on city streets, and new cases multiplied inside health care facilities, killing a significant proportion of the already inadequate health work force of the 3 most affected countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

However, after 2 American aid workers and a traveler to Nigeria fell ill last summer [2014], setting off a panic, a huge global initiative to combat Ebola swung into place. The effort has been messy, inefficient and expensive, often lagging the epidemic's twists in tragic ways. But the effort has also established expertise that may be built upon to prevent similar tragedies in the future, and shown personal and institutional bravery...

The African Union for the 1st time sent hundreds of health personnel to confront a medical crisis even as the logistics of their arrival were rocky. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked with multinational teams led by the World Health Organization in more than a dozen unaffected African countries to help prevent the disease from spreading further. It was part of the largest international deployment in the CDC's nearly 70-year history, supported by a congressional appropriation of more than USD1 billion made available for the larger American response. Despite difficulty filling positions, WHO now reports that it has more than 700 people working at 77 field sites, the largest emergency response in its history.

Charities with no background treating Ebola patients began running hospitals specialized for Ebola care, some of which were built by militaries and others staffed by hundreds of personnel from China and Cuba who were also facing Ebola for the 1st time and trying to overcome language challenges. The affected countries established strong crisis teams and mobilized thousands of health workers, gravediggers and student outreach groups to fight Ebola. They have worked in dangerous conditions, often without pay, sometimes shunned by their families. And unlike many foreign workers, they have not been offered the option of medical evacuation to Western countries.

"The level of resourcefulness and dedication shown by Sierra Leoneans involved in the front lines is the most extraordinary civic mobilization action I've ever seen in my country," said O. B. Sisay, director of the situation room at the National Ebola Response Center in Freetown... "To some extent, that has helped cement a sense of nationhood here."

Throughout most of the crisis, experimental Ebola treatments and vaccines were offered almost exclusively to international aid workers; now scientists are testing them in Africa under accelerated research protocols that include regulatory and ethical approval in the affected countries and abroad...

Aid workers, meanwhile, are scrambling to deal with violent resistance to Ebola treatment and safe burials. Responders are questioning whether, in a rush to improve technical assistance, they gave short shrift to understanding societal dynamics.

Most important, perhaps, Ebola has laid bare the inadequacy of current global mechanisms for detecting outbreaks and quickly mobilizing a response. "We need something more robust than an ad hoc system that we set up halfway through it," said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who leads Ebola response efforts for WHO...

Both WHO and Doctors without Borders documented probable Ebola cases in Sierra Leone when the epidemic was 1st recognized in March 2014 in Guinea, but the cases were not followed up effectively. Consequently, Sierra Leone's outbreak, which might have been stopped at a few cases, instead smoldered for 2 months before bursting into public view in May 2014 and spilling into Liberia, a New York Times investigation showed... WHO, which in January [2015] prepared a corrected history of the origins of the Sierra Leone outbreak, still has not posted it online.

In its [23 Mar 2015] report, MSF assailed the USA and other governments for failing, among other things, to send specialized biohazard response units to treat patients. "We considered the only organizations in the world that might have the means to fill the gap immediately might be military units with some level of biological warfare expertise," Christopher Stokes, general director of MSF, is quoted as saying in the report. Dr. Joanne Liu, the group's international president, added, "U.S. helicopters would not even transport laboratory samples or healthy personnel returning from treating patients." Jeremy Konyndyk, director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the United States Agency for International Development, said in an interview that those criticisms reflected a misunderstanding of the American military's capabilities.
