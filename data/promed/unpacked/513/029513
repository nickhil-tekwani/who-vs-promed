[1] Genetic resistance to COVID-19

Genetic resistance to COVID-19 could present a previously untapped resource in the fight against the virus, international experts say in a new report. Genes conferring natural resistance have been identified in other infections, including HIV and norovirus, and could provide an opportunity to better understand COVID-19 and develop improved treatments and vaccines.

Published today [18 Oct 2021] in Nature Immunology (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01030-z), the perspective draws on the wealth of knowledge already out there to consider factors that could influence an individual's susceptibility to severe outcomes, as well as factors that could give rise to inborn resistance. The team present several targets for future research and provide a comprehensive strategy detailing how this research be conducted.

As has become apparent in the 22 months since the COVID-19 pandemic began, infections are incredibly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, with all the varying degrees in between. Some suffer mildly, some are hospitalized, and some continue to suffer for months after infection. Secondary attack rates -- the probability that an infection occurs among susceptible people within a specific group -- can reach up to 70% in some households, and there are numerous reports of individuals resisting infection despite the rest of their families succumbing. This is not, however, the result of a malevolent virus cherry-picking its targets -- the authors of this new study suggest that, perhaps, the clinical variability of COVID-19 could be explained by genetic factors.

"Our study pertains to the intriguing enigma of humans who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite repeated and intense exposure to the virus. We propose that these cases are 'genetic' and explain how we intend to crack this enigma by means of human genetics," study author Dr Andras N. Spaan told IFLScience.

The 1st of these "genetic" causes that the team considers relates to innate susceptibility to the virus. A deficiency of type I interferons (IFNs), for example, has been linked to around 20% of critical COVID-19 cases. Type I IFNs are proteins that play an integral role in the body's antiviral immune response, so perhaps unsurprisingly, inborn errors in their genes have been linked to severe COVID-19. Errors at 8 locations in 2 type I IFN genes were reported in 23 critically ill people by the COVID Human Genetic Effort. Subsequent studies have found that more than 10% of people with severe COVID-19 have pre-existing autoantibodies against type I IFNs, further suggesting that a lack of the proteins could increase one's susceptibility to infection.

As for innate resistance, only 3 known examples currently exist -- _Plasmodium vivax_, HIV-1, and norovirus infections. All these mechanisms are deficiencies of receptors or coreceptors, which are exploited by the pathogen to enter host cells. Following this line of research, the authors suggest that those with O-type blood groups may be slightly more resistant. ABO blood groups may play a direct role in infection by serving as coreceptors for SARS-CoV-2.

Further candidate SARS-CoV-2 resistance genes that the team suggest include those for the ACE2 receptor, which the virus uses for cell entry. A rare mutation was found to safeguard against infection, possibly by reducing ACE2 expression, while different forms of the receptor are known to bind the virus's spike protein with different affinities.

Another protein, TMEM41B, which is required for viral entry in flaviviruses -- a viral family that includes the dengue, yellow fever, and Zika viruses -- could be of interest, the authors say. Its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be established, but it has been identified as a requirement for permissive infection with the virus. In flavivirus studies, an allele common in East and South Asians has been linked with a lower capacity to support flavivirus infection.

In order to test these potential resistance targets, the authors suggest a 4-step strategy, which begins by focusing on uninfected individuals in the same household as people with symptomatic COVID-19. Next up are individuals exposed to the virus without personal protection equipment, followed by those with negative PCR and serological tests following exposure. Finally, T cell -- a type of immune cell -- response in "resistant" individuals are to be compared with those of the infected. In fact, the team are currently recruiting for a dedicated resistance study. So far, 400 individuals are enrolled.

The results of this study, the team hopes, could lead to the development of new COVID therapies; "Our study has the potential to pave the way for the development of rationally novel drugs blocking infection with SARS-CoV-2," Spaan added to IFLScience.

This report is not a completed basic or clinical research study, but rather a review of potential genetic factors in COVID disease and a proposed strategy for identifying such factors by genetically analyzing individuals who do not get infected despite high-risk exposure to other people with proven COVID-19 infection. This may prove to be an intriguing hypothesis-generating exercise that may illuminate the pathogenesis of COVID infection, even if it does not lead to novel therapeutic agents.

To be clear, a distinction should be made between genetic resistance to infection per se, versus "resistance" to getting clinically significant or severe disease. As the authors point out, true resistance to an infectious agent is typically due to an inborn deficiency or mutation of the actual host receptor for that agent. We have few examples of this mechanism in humans, but they include _Plasmodium vivax_, which binds to Duffy antigen chemokine receptor, and HIV, which binds the CCR5 chemokine receptor. This resistance mechanism is analogous to pesticide resistance in insects, for which numerous pesticide targets have been discovered using the fruit fly _Drosophila_, wherein high-level resistance is almost always due to mutations in the target receptor itself. However, developing a clinically useful therapeutic (whether a small molecule or a monoclonal antibody) that blocks infection from the outset is very challenging, no doubt in part because one is concurrently blocking an endogenous receptor for a native ligand (such as a chemokine) that has evolved to serve an important physiological role in the human host. Maraviroc, which binds to the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV, was approved in 2007 for treating HIV, but its use is limited to certain HIV patients who have failed other antiretroviral therapies.

On the other hand, using a genetic approach to identify disease-modifying factors (as opposed to blocking the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor, which has already been identified as ACE2, very early on in the pandemic) may yield new therapeutic insights and potential drugs. Examples of such factors or pathways could be those that promote acute ARDS-type lung inflammation, hypercoagulability and thromboembolism, or late-stage pulmonary fibrosis. The beauty of this approach is that it could identify drugs that are already in our pharmacopeia as candidates to ameliorate the severity of COVID disease. The utility of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID was established only by large-scale retrospective analyses of variously treated patient populations. What if an unbiased hypothesis-generating genetic approach to disease susceptibility could yield existing drugs that could then be studied in rapid smaller-scale clinical trials of COVID patients? - Mod.LXL]

[2] Pregnancy and vaccination
[A] Safety of COVID vaccines during pregnancy
Date: Tue 19 Oct 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/10/19/does-getting-the-flu-with-covid-double-your-risk-of-death


It is well established now that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) are indeed safe for pregnant women to take, and the risk of getting the virus outweighs any potential risks from the vaccines. In 827 pregnant women who had completed pregnancies and received one or 2 doses of mRNA vaccines, a recent study reports no increased rates of miscarriage and stillbirths, compared with pre-COVID rates (https://newsdaylight.com/2021/10/19/does-getting-the-flu-with-covid-double-your-risk-of-death/). There were no increases in preterm labour or negative effects on newborns, including congenital abnormalities.

Still, there remain high levels of hesitation among pregnant women and those planning to get pregnant when it comes to taking up the COVID vaccine. A large part of that is due to misinformation circulating online about the effects of the vaccines on developing babies. But we must also hold our hands up to the fact that there was a delay in approving the vaccines for pregnant women at the start of the rollout, leading to inconsistent messaging and confusion.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women are often excluded from clinical trials on ethical grounds. But the delay in getting this safety data for the COVID vaccines meant the pregnant women or those planning a pregnancy were told they could not have the vaccine. It was not until later that the safety data came in and the advice changed. There is no doubt in my mind this has contributed to vaccine hesitancy in this group, and it highlights the need to include this often high-risk group of people in trials so they too can benefit from emerging and new treatments.

The focus now must be on repeatedly reminding unvaccinated pregnant women that the vaccines are safe and effective. Although COVID restrictions are easing worldwide, this virus is still very much out there and vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, remain at high risk.

[B] No increased risk of miscarriage
Date: Wed 20 Oct 2021

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114466


Pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk for adverse outcomes, and COVID-19 vaccination is recommended during pregnancy. However, safety data on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy remain limited.

We performed a case-control study with data from Norwegian registries on 1st-trimester pregnancies, COVID-19 vaccination, background characteristics, and underlying health conditions. We identified all women who were registered between 15 Feb and 15 Aug 2021, as having had a miscarriage before 14 weeks of gestation (case patients) and those with a primary care-based confirmation of ongoing pregnancy in the 1st trimester (controls).

Among 13 956 women with ongoing pregnancies (of whom 5.5% were vaccinated) and 4521 women with miscarriages (of whom 5.1% were vaccinated), the median number of days between vaccination and miscarriage or confirmation of ongoing pregnancy was 19. Among women with miscarriages, the adjusted odds ratios for COVID-19 vaccination were 0.91 for vaccination in the previous 3 weeks and 0.81 for vaccination in the previous 5 weeks.

Our study found no evidence of an increased risk for early pregnancy loss after COVID-19 vaccination and adds to the findings from other reports supporting COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.

A recently published follow-up study by the same US CDC v-safe COVID-19 Pregnancy Registry Team showed that pregnant women who had received the mRNA vaccines had no higher risk of spontaneous abortion when compared with 2 pre-COVID era historical cohorts (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113891).

The article in section [B] is a just-published large-scale case-control study from Norway that not only included subjects who had received either of the approved mRNA vaccines but also those who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. This study provides further evidence that COVID vaccines are safe in pregnancy, without increased risk of miscarriage. Coupled with the abundant evidence that pregnant women are at increased risk for severe disease and preterm births should they become infected with SARS-CoV-2, pregnant women should be urged to get vaccinated and, if possible, to enroll in ongoing vaccine clinical trials. In the United States, people who have received COVID-19 vaccination during the periconception period or during pregnancy should be encouraged to enroll in the CDC v-safe COVID-19 Pregnancy Registry. As of 18 Oct 2021, more than 168 000 participants have enrolled (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html). - Mod.LXL]
