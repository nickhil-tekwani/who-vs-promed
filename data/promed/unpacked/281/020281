Warning system for bird flu planned
---------------------------------------
China plans to launch an early warning system to detect and prevent the
spread of bird flu in cases similar to the recent outbreak of the virus in
northwest China, authorities said yesterday [31 May 2005].
The network will be based on a wide array of information technologies,
according to an official with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the system's
developer.
The system will feature a nationwide virus database, epidemic analysis and
information sharing among foreign experts and regular information releases
to the public, according to Ma Juncai, assistant director of the academy's
Institute of Microbiology.
"The system would warn people of an epidemic and help scientists find
solutions to kill the virus as soon as possible," Ma said during the 5th
Annual Forum on City Information in the Asia Pacific Region, held in
Shanghai. Ma and his co-workers are developing the system in 8 provinces,
including Yunnan and Hunan.
"The high-tech system is under construction, but it's hard to predict when
it will be put into use," Ma said.
China announced last Friday [27 May 2005] that more than 1000 migratory
birds, mainly geese and gulls, had died from avian flu in the country's
northwest, mostly in Qinghai Province [see comment].
Bird flu virus has killed at least 37 people in Viet Nam, 12 in Thailand
and 4 in Cambodia. "Bird flu is more difficult to control compared with
SARS, because it is hard to detect. Its human symptoms are similar to a bad
cold," Ma said, "So it is urgent to establish a warning system in China."
During the forum, officials with the Shanghai Information Technology
Development Commission emphasized that the city will continue to establish
e-government and e-commerce platforms in the next 5 years.

[The development of a state-of-the-art animal-disease warning system in
China should be warmly welcomed by all concerned about the current rate of
transparency regarding avian influenza. This is underlined by the fact that
China's agriculture maintains 62 percent of the world's duck population
(661 million out of 1065 million) and 49 percent of the world's pig
population (457 million out of 940 million). (FAO statistics, 2002).
In the meantime, essential data are expected to become available by means
of the existing animal disease surveillance systems, supported by the
reputable Chinese diagnostic laboratories.
A current example: data on suspected avian influenza in migrating birds
were initially mentioned in the media on 10 May 2005 (20050510.1278). China
officially notified the incident to the OIE on 23 May 2005 (item 3 in
20050523.1423), incriminating avian influenza virus type H5N1 as the causal
agent killing 519 wild birds of 5 species (a number which seems to have
increased to 1000 according to subsequent newswires; see 20050527.1462).
An avian influenza virus which will kill such numbers of wild birds
belonging to different species and within a short time frame seemed rather
exceptional. Consequently, ProMED-mail requested clarifying information,
particularly the number of tested birds of each species, pathological
changes observed, diagnostic techniques applied and exclusion of other
potential causative agents. We would also appreciate obtaining information
on the pathogenicity of the (isolated?) virus strain in various animal
species and, if available, its genetic make-up. Such information will be
most useful to evaluate the significance of the outbreak and its potential
implications for animal and human health. - Mod.AS]
