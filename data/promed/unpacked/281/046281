At least 53 people have died of cholera since mid-November 2006 in
the Republic of Congo, according to official figures released Sun, 4
Feb 2007. Local officials said they believed the real toll was much
higher. The majority of the deaths have been in the southern
commercial hub of Pointe Noire, where WHO representative Nafo
Faoumata Traore said the contagion entered the city water system
after heavy rains.
A group organized by the government of the Central African country
and the WHO said the death toll includes a handful of cases in the
capital, Brazzaville, that appeared to involve people who had been in
Pointe Noire. More than 2800 cases of the potentially deadly
waterborne disease have been reported in Pointe Noire since 15 Nov
2006, said Henri Joseph Mpara, the head of the group.
Pointe Noire Mayor Roland Bouity Viodo said he believed many more
people had died than were reflected in the official statistics,
noting that the death toll only includes cases confirmed by medical centers.
Viodo noted that the city's main morgue has recorded a sharp increase
in deaths in recent months -- counting 650 bodies in Dec 2006 and 732
in Jan 2007 compared with a typical count of 400 to 450 bodies.
Republic of Congo, a former French colony to the west of the larger,
former Belgian colony Congo, had previously reported an outbreak of
deadly diarrhea in the region, often the 1st sign of cholera.

An outbreak of cholera in the Republic of Congo has reached the
capital Brazzaville, killing 4 people there and pushing the death
toll this year to 82, a senior medical official said on Sun, 4 Feb 2007.
Cases of the water-borne disease were first recorded in early Jan
2007 in the coastal oil-exporting city of Pointe Noire, 515 km (320
miles) from the inland capital. "Today we are at 82 dead and 2700
recorded cases, in Pointe-Noire and the surrounding area ... but
Brazzaville is also affected, with 4 dead out of 9 recorded cases
there," Damase Bozongo, director-general of the country's health
department, told Reuters.
The spread to Brazzaville in spite of the authorities' efforts to
control it has caused concern in the central African country. Last
week Health Minister Nestor Alphonse Gando appealed to people "not to
panic, to follow basic hygiene guidelines and to seek free treatment
in medical centers opened for the sick."

At least 82 people have died in the past 10 days following an
outbreak of cholera in the towns of Beletweyne, Buulo Burte and
Jalalaqsi in the Hiraan region of central Somalia, medical sources
said on Mon, 5 Feb 2007.
"At least 82 people, 50 of them children, have died of cholera in the
3 districts," said Hassan Odawa, programme manager for the
International Medical Corps (IMC) in Beletweyne, the regional capital
of Hiraan. Cholera treatment centers, he added, were set up on 3 Feb
2007 in the affected districts by agencies dealing with the outbreak,
and by the Cholera Task Force for the region, of which the IMC is the
lead agency.
The outbreak was confirmed following tests carried out by AMREF in
the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. "We have had 110 cases in the 3
districts since last week," Odawa said. "In Beletweyne, 15 cases,
with 2 deaths. In Buulo Burte we had 38 cases with one death. In
Jalalaqsi we had 57 cases with 12 fatalities."
Odawa said at least 1229 cases have been recorded, with 150 deaths
since the outbreak on 5 Jan 2007, of "what was thought at the time to
be watery diarrhea".

So far in January 2007, 792 cases of cholera, from which 22 resulted
in deaths, were registered by the provincial health department in the
9 districts of the southern Benguela province.
The fact was revealed by the health director in Benguela, Antonio

that includes the technical co-ordination of humanitarian aid and
partners of the sector, in which he expressed worry with the
spreading of the cholera epidemics in the province. The source
stressed that the situation in worrying, thereby, greater attention
should be paid to the disease, apart from other endemic illness
existing in Benguela.

Reports say that 19 people have contracted cholera in the Zimbabwean
capital, Harare, in the first outbreak of the often-deadly disease in
the city in a year. The 19 were from the impoverished eastern
townships of Mabvuku and Tafara, where residents had gone without
clean running water for days and had been using unprotected wells.
The 1st cholera case was diagnosed last Thu, 26 Jan 2006. Since then,
the number of those affected had risen steadily. Reports suggested
the cholera germ was brought by truck drivers from Malawi. Reports
said those who had contracted cholera were being treated in dedicated
wards at an infectious diseases hospital in Harare. Earlier this
week, the health minister toured an informal settlement near Mabvuku,
where some of the latest cholera cases were believed to have taken
place. It was reported that more than 330 families were staying in
tents and shelters at Caledonia Farm settlement, sharing just 69 toilets.
An outbreak of cholera in Harare's Glen View township killed 3 people
in January 2006, forcing the authorities to temporarily shut down the
capital's main food and vegetable market.

A cholera case came to light today, 5 Feb 2007, with the Deputy
Municipal Health Officer Dr N R Das saying: "The Infectious Diseases
(ID) hospital where the samples are tested has confirmed a case of
cholera today. We have still not got more details as of now," he said.
The MCD is still to prepare an action plan for cholera in 2007.
"Regular meetings have been going on to prepare the action plan which
will carry the preventive measures to keep cases of cholera at bay.
The action plan will start with effect from March..." Dr NK Yadav, MHO, said.
Earlier reports have shown that Delhi is endemic to cholera. Back in
1992, around 1100 people were found to be infected with the
bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_ 01 biotype E1 Tor. During that year, the
outbreak continued from March till December 1992.
