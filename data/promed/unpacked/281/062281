600 Mongolian gazelles confirmed to have died of anthrax on
Chinese-Mongolian border
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to local news reports, the number of Mongolian gazelles
that have died near Nuoluobushan (transliteration) in Erdenetsagaan
Sum of Sukhbaatar Province is now over 600. As a result of testing,
Mongolian authorities have confirmed that the Mongolian gazelles died
of bloodborne anthrax.

34 years ago, bloodborne anthrax occurred in Erdenetsagaan Sum of
Sukhbaatar Province, killing approximately 11 000 Mongolian gazelles.

[This is an extraordinary death rate. Such death rates are usually
seen when the wildlife target species is densely grazing, as in some
deer ranches in Texas in 2001, where incidence was seen to be closely
related to density. Again, thanks to Dan for finding and translating
this report. - Mod.MHJ]
