WHAT ARE EMERGING DISEASES?
===========================
Date: Sun, 9 Mar 1997 05:14:22 -0800 (PST)
From: Jonathan Mayer <jmayer@u.washington.edu>

I am starting to become confused about emerging diseases and their
definitions. Sometimes, it seems that that any epidemic is becoming an
"emerging disease." The definitions which seemed so clear two years ago
are becoming foggy. I am wondering how others perceive this issue now.

[It probably does not help that ProMED-mail reports outbreaks of some
diseases that are not actually emerging. As the volume of our
contributions grows, we are going to have to become much more selective in
what we cover, if we are to stick to our mission of reporting outbreaks of
emerging and re-emerging diseases - Mod.JW]
