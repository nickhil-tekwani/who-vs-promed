What Thailand is doing by giving free of charge canine rabies vaccines is a
great thing and should be an example for many other countries, yet
vaccination is not enough in fighting [canine] rabies. According to what
was posted in "Rabies, canine, human - Thailand 20100222.0598", the
authorities plan to catch stray dogs, to vaccinate them, and to release
them. This is inadvisable, since rabies incubation in dogs may extend to a
year, although it is mostly between 2-3 months. Catching an animal which
might already be incubating an infection and then vaccinating it will not
only not protect the animal but put at risk the lives of people led to
believe that the animal is safe.

In an endemic country where there are many stray dogs and many cases of
rabies in animals and humans, as in Thailand, the solution of [the problem]
of stray dogs is to reduce their number and carry out mass vaccination to
all owned dogs, cats, and ferrets. If a country decides to avoid the
elimination of stray dogs, it will be necessary to catch them, to vaccinate
them, and to [quarantine] them for 6 months at a minimum, and only
subsequently, together with birth control measures
(castration/sterilization), release them for adoption, after registration
in a database for further control.
