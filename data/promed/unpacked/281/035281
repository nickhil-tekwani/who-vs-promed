[1] Indonesia (Bali): canine, human exposure

The media have reported that 2 local children in Bali, Indonesia are undergoing rabies post-exposure treatment following bites from 2 dogs that tested positive for rabies virus.

Both children are male and resident of Tabanan, West Bali province. The oldest who is 13 years-of-age was bitten on the thigh and is receiving post-exposure rabies vaccine only. The younger child who is 5 years of age was bitten on the head by a neighbour's dog, is receiving full rabies treatment; rabies vaccine plus rabies immunoglobulin.

In Bali, rabies immunoglobulin is dispensed selectively due to its scarcity and is reserved for higher risk wounds such as those on the head, face and hands.

Advice for travellers
---------------------
Bali is a popular destination for UK travellers. The rabies situation is not yet under control in Bali and continues to pose a risk for travellers. Travellers should be made aware of the risk and avoid animal contact and report any bites promptly. Pre-exposure vaccination should be considered for those at risk.

[2] Algeria (Naama province): canine, human exposure, RFI

At the end of last week [week of 1 Feb 2016], 3 children aged between 5 and 10 years old were bitten by a dog coming from the western side of Ain Sefra city [province of Naama]. The dog bit the hand of a 5-year-old child while the latter was leaving school at Al-Hammar district then ran away towards Assalam Malih district and bit the 2nd child's head and shoulder, which required transporting him swiftly to Mohamed Boudiaf Hospital in Ain Sefra. The dog continued his roaming toward Toukount village and bit another child on his way without being caught by the authorities.

A new trend in which some teenagers wander along streets accompanied by dogs of all kinds is becoming widespread. They rarely respect the conditions stipulated by the Ministry of Health, including their submission to rabies vaccination and their muzzling, especially since these dogs move into educational institutions and neighborhoods away from security officers. This poses a danger to children playing in front of their homes.

[Dog rabies is enzootic throughout Algeria.

An apparently rabid dog bit 3 young children occasioning very severe lesions on their head, hand, and shoulder. Hopefully, the roaming dog was caught and the laboratory confirmation of rabies (or otherwise) was performed.

No information is provided on the extent of the problem of stray dogs in Naama province or whether any rabies prevention and control measures are taken as routine.

It will be appreciated if further information is disclosed on the post-exposure treatment provided to the injured children and on the action taken to stop the propagation of the disease in the region. - Mod.AB

[It seems that a rabies outbreak is evolving in the governorate of Asyut, at least near El Ghanayem city (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/iRLqbriPxgm) and a roaming dog attacked people and made 10 victims who were severely bitten.

No information is provided on the extent of the problem of stray dogs in the governorate and whether any rabies prevention and control measure is taken as a routine. Also, it is not clear that the laboratory diagnosis of rabies was performed on the biting dog.

It will be appreciated if further information is disclosed on the post-exposure treatment provided to the injured and on the action taken to stop the propagation of the disease in the region. - Mod.AB

The Ministry of Health has received reports of a horse that has been diagnosed with rabies. The horse was used for herding cattle by [Ha-Gomme] Junction.

The herders have received treatment to prevent them from coming down with the disease.

The Ministry is asking anyone who has had contact, or whose animals have been in contact with infected animals to contact the health offices in Tsfat. The same applies to anyone whose animals wandered around the area during the past 2 weeks.

Earlier this morning [Wed 10 Feb 2016], a rabid dog was found wandering around in the same area.

The affected horse, used by the cattlemen of a grazing cattle herd, was unvaccinated in spite of the recommendation to vaccinate grazing livestock (cattle and horses) in northern Israel bordering Syria and Lebanon. A map showing the region defined as "rabies high risk" (as updated in July 2015) is available at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/00AA0CC1-AF95-419A-A50B-F9797CC9CAE8/0/kalevet_2015.pdf (in Hebrew).

The horse case is the 7th rabies case in animals in Israel since the beginning of 2016; the other (lab confirmed) cases were dogs (3), cattle (2), and a jackal. During the same period last year (2015), 4 cases were reported, within the same region.

Case no 6, reported rabid on 9 Feb 2016 in Qiryat Shemona, near case no 7, has been the most worrying one from public health perspective, exposing several persons, including veterinary personnel, to potential infection. According to the information provided by the Head of Israel's Field veterinary Services, the 6-month-old Pit-bull male dog was castrated (as required by law in regard to dogs listed as dangerous breeds) and compulsorily vaccinated against rabies on 25 Jan 2016. The dog had been acquired by the owner at the age of approximately 3 months. According to the owner, and as confirmed by the attending veterinary practitioner, the dog could not be vaccinated at the officially prescribed age of 3 months due to observed parvovirus infection. On 3 Feb 2016, the dog was brought to a veterinary clinic in view of "general fatigue" and was released the same day without specific findings. The next day the dog was brought back to the clinic suffering from diarrhea and vomiting. Abdominal x-raying next day disclosed foreign body which required immediate surgery during which a plastic cylinder was withdrawn. The dog seemed to be recovering but 2 days started to show neural signs, hypersensitivity, and aggressive behavior. The municipality veterinary officer was invited to the clinic for consultation, the dog was euthanized and the head submitted to the national rabies lab at Beit Dagan, where rabies was confirmed.

Rabies in puppies and young dogs is sometimes atypical. The case history above or its variations might be familiar to veterinary clinicians in rabies-stricken locations.

It may be assumed that both animals, dog and horse, have been exposed to an undetected rabid wild animal or a stray dog. Exposed people are being preventively treated by the public health authorities. - Mod.AS
