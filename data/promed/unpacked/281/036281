The baboon liver transplant referred to in the [previous post was
performed in 1992 by Dr. Starzl's group before infectious disease
risks were discussed; the baboon donor had several pathogens.
The data referred to has come from one of the original patients.
No further nonhuman primate transplants are being allowed by the
Food & Drug Administration (Federal Register, 1999).
The present data has not been peer reviewed but from the
abstract, baboon CMV was isolated from the peripheral blood of
the patient. We know from our work that baboon cells were
circulating in the peripheral blood of the patient as baboon
mitochondrial DNA was detected (1). In addition, we found
evidence of simian foamy virus and baboon endogenous virus in
several tissues including lymph node and kidney, suggesting that
microchimerism had occurred [fusion of baboon cells with human
cells - Mod.JW.
Simian cells most likely harbored the baboon CMV so it is difficult
to know if the isolated virus was from cells of baboon or human
origin. Thus one cannot conclude from this data that baboon CMV
replicated in human cells and that the patient was "infected".
Having said that, I wouldn't be surprised if baboon CMV and simian
foamy virus both eventually might have established an active
infection in the recipient. Heneine and coworkers showed that 4
animal workers became infected with simian foamy virus and two of
those had an active infection (antibody to SFV and virus isolation)
(2). We just don't have enough data to make that conclusion.

[The crucial question, of course, is whether viruses in a
xenotransplant could multiply in the human recipient and then infect
other humans -- whether the original virus or a mutant. This
fascinating data does not answer that question. As we mentioned
before, a serosurvey of the transplant recipient's contacts might
show whether transmission had occurred.
In the 7 years between the 1992 transplant & the 1999 ban we
suppose a lot more xenotransplants have been done & a lot more
relevant data accrued - Mod.JW
