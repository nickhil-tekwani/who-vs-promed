Pigs from three more farms in Johor [peninsular Malaysia's southern-most
state, across the bridge from Singapore have been found to have been
infected with the deadly Nipah virus, according to the latest sample analysis.
[The three farms join the ranks of eight other Johor pig farms, bringing the
number of affected farms to 11. There are 82 pig farms in Johor state.
In the first sample analysis, four farms were found to be infected, and
15 900 pigs were killed. In the second round, another four farms were found
to be infected, which puts another 17 000 pigs in line to be killed.
The latest three infected farms, which surfaced in the third round of
sample analysis, bring the number of pigs killed or to be killed to nearly
44 000 [in the state.
The outbreak of the [Nipah virus, which has killed more than 100 people
across the country, started in Perak in October 1998. It spread to
Negri Sembilan two months later and Kelantan last month. Almost a million
pigs have been killed countrywide in the operations against the spread of
the virus.
