West Nile Virus-infected Horse Dies in Thomas County; Vaccine Request
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATLANTA: Georgia's first confirmed case of a horse infected with West Nile
virus has prompted Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irvin to seek
an earlier shipment of the vaccine recently approved by the United States
Department of Agriculture. "We have contacted the manufacturer to see if we
can be moved up in line," said Commissioner Irvin. "The vaccine was not
expected to be widely available until after the first of the year." Tests
confirmed yesterday that a 30-year-old mare that died in Thomas County
earlier this month was infected with West Nile virus.
West Nile virus infection is one of several mosquito-borne diseases that
horses can acquire. The most common is Eastern equine encephalitis. It is
more serious than West Nile virus infection but there is a proven, effective
vaccine for it that has been available for years.
Horses affected with West Nile Virus do not need to be quarantined because
they cannot spread the disease to other horses or people. "Although this
horse died, many recover, and it is likely that many horses recover from
infection without even showing clinical signs of the illness. We continue to
recommend that horse owners and boarding facilities take efforts to control
mosquitoes around their stables," said Irvin.
