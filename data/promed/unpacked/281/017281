[The case numbers are rising as expected since the initial patient in whom the disease was identified had not been immediately diagnosed, thereby exposing others to the virus. With recognition of Ebola as the etiologic agent, better precautions against virus transmission will be taken and along with contact tracing, virus spread may be curtailed. - Mod.LK]

Update on Ebola Outbreak In Mubende District (Uganda)
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health would like to update the public on the current status of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) Outbreak in Mubende District.

In the last 24 hours, 4 cases of Ebola were confirmed, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed cases to 11. Three new deaths were recorded, bringing the total number of cumulative deaths to 11 (including confirmed and probable deaths). Of these, 8 deaths were from the community whereas 3 are facility based. Currently, there are 25 cases on admission at the health facility, out of which 6 are confirmed while 19 are suspected for EVD. [See updated numbers above. I included these numbers to follow the trajectory. - Mod.LK]

The Ministry of Health Rapid Response Teams remain on ground to list and follow up contacts to the confirmed cases. Cumulatively, a total of 58 contacts have been listed.

The Minister of Health, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero will hold the National Health Task Force in Mubende Council Hall, tomorrow [24 Sep 2022]. The Ministry of Health wishes to advise the general public to install hand washing facilities at all public facilities.

Note to editor:
Probable case: Any person who died from 'suspected' EVD and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case but was not tested and did not have laboratory confirmation of the disease

Confirmed case: A suspected case with a positive laboratory result for either virus antigen or to viral RNA detected by RT-PCR for Ebola.

[3] Community feedback

Community feedback in Ebola outbreaks
-------------------------------------
How can community feedback be included in decision-making processes during outbreak response?

Community feedback is an essential form of evidence in outbreaks
----------------------------------------------------------------
Community voices and concerns can help to inform and improve humanitarian response. Listening to community feedback also underpins humanitarian principles. However, decision makers in outbreaks are besieged by huge amounts of data and many competing priorities, making use of this evidence challenging.

This research aimed to understand how a new qualitative community feedback system was used during the North Kivu Ebola outbreak by decisionmakers to shape response policy, as part of a larger project which also examined Safe and Dignified Burial practices.

The study team found that even though community feedback brought important insights, decisionmakers struggled to understand and apply evidence to adapt the response. Learning from this study has helped improve use of the community feedback mechanism by humanitarian partners.

Background
----------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) experienced its 10th outbreak of Ebola from 2018-2020 in the conflict-affected regions of North-Kivu & Ituri, resulting in 2287 deaths from the virus. The DRC Red Cross and the International Federation of the Red Cross developed a community feedback mechanism to gather community perspectives on the Ebola outbreak and response. This feedback data was analysed and used to inform policy and programming collectively at all levels of the response -- both to improve the response and to engage communities in the fight against the virus. This study aimed to assess how decision-makers used this new data stream, to inform and improve use of feedback data for future responses.

Key findings
------------
• The Red Cross' community feedback data was a new qualitative data stream in the DRC Ebola response and was in competition with many other forms of (largely quantitative) evidence.
• Decision makers were largely quantitatively trained. Qualitative feedback data had to be presented in a way that was more palatable to this audience.
• "Evidentiary inertia" was a feature of the response. This meant even when there was a need to change practice, the size and scale of the response made it difficult to change course within a reasonable time frame.
• Decision makers were more willing to adapt response policy and practice when they understood that responding to community feedback could build community acceptance and enable responders to complete their work. Involving the decision makers in developing recommendations from the feedback helped facilitate this understanding.

Implications for humanitarian practitioners and policymakers
------------------------------------------------------------
Since listening to views of communities affected by crisis is a core humanitarian principle, and can facilitate improved outbreak response, future outbreak responses should include community feedback systems like that of the Red Cross. However, the scale of those systems should be commensurate with the severity of the outbreak and resources available. Policy makers in outbreak response should consider how to integrate community feedback into the response from the onset of the crisis.

Recommendations should be tracked, from that feedback, through to policy implementation. Where multiple organisations have community feedback systems, these should be complementary. Data should be triangulated and cross-analysed to create coherent recommendations, considering challenges faced by policymakers to absorb evidence during outbreak response, particularly qualitative evidence.

Trialing different approaches to the presentation of community feedback data for various audiences (including those qualitatively trained) can help develop templates which can be used in future outbreaks. Outbreak leadership could also be trained in qualitative (as well as quantitative) sources of evidence, so that they can capitalize on all data streams.

Recommendations for future research
-----------------------------------
Future research should consider the best mechanisms for collecting and using community feedback data.

More evidence is needed on the barriers to and facilitators of implementing policy change at all levels of outbreak response.

"Abstract
--------
"Introduction: The 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) took place in the highly complex protracted crisis regions of North Kivu and Ituri. The Red Cross developed a community feedback (CF) data collection process through the work of hundreds of Red Cross personnel, who gathered unprompted feedback in order to inform the response coordination mechanism and decision-making.

"AIM: To understand how a new CF system was used to make operational and strategic decisions by Ebola response leadership.

"Methods: Qualitative data collection in November 2019 in Goma and Beni (DRC), including document review, observation of meetings and CF activities, key informant interviews and focus group discussions.

"Findings: The credibility and use of different evidence types was affected by the experiential and academic backgrounds of the consumers of that evidence. Ebola response decision-makers were often medics or epidemiologists who tended to view quantitative evidence as having more rigour than qualitative evidence. The process of taking in and using evidence in the Ebola response was affected by decision-makers' bandwidth to parse large volumes of data coming from a range of different sources. The operationalisation of those data into decisions was hampered by the size of the response and an associated reduction in agility to new evidence.

"Conclusion: CF data collection has both instrumental and intrinsic value for outbreak response and should be normalised as a critical data stream; however, a failure to act on those data can further frustrate communities."

It has been learned from past Ebola outbreaks that community involvement is critical to a successful response. This study is important as it will inform "how decision-makers used this new data stream, to inform and improve use of feedback data for future responses." - Mod.LK
