Mysterious deadly outbreak claims lives of 10
---------------------------------------------
MORO, May 21 (PNS): Ten have died, including 4 children from the same
family, and 25 others have been admitted to hospital as a result of a
widespread mysterious life threatening epidemic in a village near the river
Indus.
Doctors have been unable to diagnose or stop the spread of this disease.
The inhabitants of village Malik situated 10 km from Moro near Indus River
have been suffering from this deadly disease for the last week.
The first sign of this deadly disease is that the patient's hands and feet
become black. The face then swells up. This is followed by a severe fever,
which may be followed by death of the patient.
The inhabitants have said that they were using water from a tap installed
in their village.
A 10 member team headed by ADO Noshehra Feroz has reached the village and
taken a water sample, which has been sent to Karachi for further laboratory
tests.
