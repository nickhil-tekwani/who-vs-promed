TUTA ABSOLUTA PEST, VEGETABLE CROPS - UNITED KINGDOM: UPDATE

Favourites such as baked beans, ketchup and tomato soup could soon
cost a lot more because of the pest _Tuta absoluta_.

_Tuta absoluta_ is described as the greatest threat ever faced by
tomato growers, and it has been found in the UK this year [2009] for
the 1st time.

The bug has the potential to wipe out the supplies of any grower who
discovers it, affecting any product relying on tomatoes as an ingredient.

Also known as the South American tomato moth, it is already
devastating crops in Spain, the main producer of the fruit, but has
spread to every other European country.

The Government has confirmed 9 cases so far in UK nurseries, where
tomatoes are grown from seeds, plus 14 at packing stations for fruit
imported from Spain and Italy.

Packaging is to blame for the pest arriving in Britain, according to
the Government's Food and Environment Research Agency.

It believes growers bought specialised packaging from Europe for
their own fruit that had previously been used for infected tomatoes.

The 10 mm caterpillar of the moth burrows into the tomato plants and
lays its eggs, damaging the plant's ability to convert sunlight to energy.

Gerry Hayman of the British Tomato Growers' Association said: "We
need to do something about it now."

[_Tuta absoluta_ (Povolny, 1994) is a nocturnal moth of the family
_Gelechiidae_. The insect, which is also known as a leaf miner
because its caterpillars make tunnels in the tomato fruits, leaves
and stems, is wide spread in South America (Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela) but does not appear above 1000 meters, as it is presumably
sensitive to the cooler climate. The adult moth is of a greyish
colour with black spots on the forewing. It has a 10 mm wing span.
The insect has a high reproductive potential with a biological cycle
of 29-38 days, and larvae do not enter the diapause as long as food
is available. The caterpillar at hatching is 0.6 and 0.8 mms and of a
light rose in colour.

The insect was found in Morocco in 2008 and in Malta and Almeria, in
southern Spain, in 2009, and it has spread to the heated greenhouses
in the United Kingdom. It is also found in the south of France. The
main plant host is the tomato, but the potato has also been reported
as a host together with other solanaceous species, both domesticated
and wild. There is a old record (1972) of tobacco being attacked in
the Argentine. It can be trapped using the _Pherodis_ pheromone trap,
but is resistant to many of the chemical insecticides. - Corr.SB]

[While ProMED-Plant does not normally include reports on insect
pests, this update on an extremely damaging insect was considered
sufficiently important to make an exception. Thank you to Susan
