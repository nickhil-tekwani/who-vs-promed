The Florida Department of Health is investigating 3 cases of bacterial meningitis in Leon County [Tallahassee], including one in a Florida State University [FSU] student, and conducting contact tracing to alert others with potential exposure to the disease.

Health officials first announced the cluster of cases late Friday [1 Apr 2022], noting this is a "serious disease". All cases are in young people, from 18 to 22 years old. Florida State University confirmed on Monday [28 Mar 2022] that one of its current students has been diagnosed. "Health department officials are investigating this case and coordinating with the university. All close contacts have been notified and advised of next steps," the university said in an email. If students have concerns about their health, they are advised to seek medical attention at University Health Services, FSU said.

Florida A&M University [FAMU] said Monday [28 Mar 2022] there are no cases among its students. But university administrators are informing the campus community about precautions they can take to prevent transmission of the bacteria. "We strongly encourage incoming students to be vaccinated for meningitis," Tanya Tatum with FAMU Health Services said. "There aren't a lot of cases that occur but when they do occur, they can be very, very serious and life threatening."

The Department of Health (DoH) says the disease, caused by the bacteria _Neisseria meningitidis_, is not easily transmissible. It requires close contact over a period of time, or direct contact such as kissing or sharing drinks, according to officials. The disease is also preventable and treatable.

"We see it in these little clusters," Daniel Van Durme with FSU College of Medicine said. "As these 3 or 4 friends who hang out together a lot, share saliva, share a drink, sharing whatever, that it will come in in a cluster. We only had 3 cases, but 3 is enough to call it a cluster."
"Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against meningococcal disease," DoH says. Florida State says all students are advised to get the meningitis A [quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY vaccine - please see https://uhs.fsu.edu/health-care/clinical-services/immunizations-vaccines. - Mod.ML] and B vaccines upon enrollment or thereafter.

Early symptoms of meningococcal disease include sudden headache, fever, vomiting, stiff neck, and a rash.

"We are working to investigate these cases and to ensure that people who have come into close contact with the patients receive antibiotics as a precautionary measure against infection," said Sandon Speedling, interim health officer with DoH Leon. DoH Leon offers meningococcal disease vaccines [https://leon.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/clinical-and-nutrition-services/immunizations/index.html].

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), infects only humans: there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_, which colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat, is spread from person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (for example, coughing or kissing). Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

People at increased risk of IMD include household members and roommates of a patient with IMD, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease.

Meningococcal meningitis occurs most frequently in the elderly, infants, and teenagers and young adults, especially if living in group settings, such as dormitories, boarding schools, and military bases. Certain rare medical conditions and medications increase the risk for IMD, including complement component deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV/AIDS, and complement inhibitor medications -- for example, eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris).

A discussion of antibiotics used for treatment and prevention of IMD can be found in my moderator comments in a prior ProMED post (see N. meningitidis: USA, antimicrobial resistance, 2012-2016 20220401.8702352), and relevant portions of the US CDC guidance on management of a meningococcal outbreak can be found in my moderator comments in another previous ProMED post (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (MI) college student, frat party 20220129.8701149).

The news report above confirms my suspicion that at least 1 of the 3 cases of meningococcal meningitis in this cluster, 18 to 22 years of age, is a university student, but we are not told how the other 2 cases are linked to this university student. For example, were they friends, attended the same social events, shared accommodation, etc? Tallahassee is home to 2 of Florida's major public universities, Florida State University and Florida A&M University, as well as Tallahassee Community College, with a combined enrolment of more than 70 000 students annually.

Also, did meningococcal isolates from the 3 patients belong to the same serogroup, usually A, B, C, W, or Y? If the serogroups differ, the cases are not related to one another. We are also not told the timeline over which the cases occurred, or the vaccine status of the 3 cases. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Leon County (pop. 275 487 in 2010) is in the Panhandle of the US state of Florida; its county seat and the capital of the state is the city of Tallahassee (pop. 196 169 in 2020) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_County,_Florida and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida). - Mod.ML
