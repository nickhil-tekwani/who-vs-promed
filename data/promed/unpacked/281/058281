4 dead in cholera outbreak at Burma 3-Pagoda
--------------------------------------------
4 villagers died as the result of a cholera outbreak at 3 Pagoda Township,
Mon State in southern Burma which started on 27 Apr 2005.
"The outbreak is affecting Kyunchaung, Kyeinchaung and Khepun Villages in
the northwest of 3 Pagodas," a local resident told DVB. "3 died at
Kyunchaung and 1 at Kyeinchaung."
A doctor who went to the villages told DVB that the outbreak was triggered
by [contaminated] water. At the same time, there has been an outbreak of
foot and mouth disease among the local cattle and some people believe it
could be connected to the cholera outbreak.

Over 100 pupils and a cook hospitalized for cholera
---------------------------------------------------
More than 100 pupils and a canteen cook in the Semporna district have been
admitted to the hospital after they showed signs of suffering from cholera.
Semporna Hospital authorities said they can cope with the high number of
admissions but urged the public to practice better hygiene. Residents in
the district have been advised to drink boiled water and eat home-cooked food.
The cholera outbreak was first detected on Fri, 6 May 2005 when a cook at
the SK Bubul II, who was suffering from fever, diarrhea, and vomiting was
rushed to the hospital. Since then, 106 pupils from the school and 7
students from the nearby SMK Kabongan II, had also be admitted. Health
authorities in the district have ordered the canteens in the 2 schools to
close.
The district office and the health office have sent a notice to all
residents in the Semporna district to observe cleanliness at home and
elsewhere to prevent cholera from spreading to more schools and kampungs.
Semporna assistant district officer Bianos Kuntong told The Star that the
health department confirmed the cholera outbreak in a report to their
office on Tue, 10 May 2005. They were now taking preventive measures
through public education.
Sabah Health Department deputy director Dr Yusof Ibrahim said a health team
from Tawau was sent to Semporna yesterday to help local health officials
investigate the cause as well as to help in the preventive measures.
Semporna hospital director Dr Norazam Kamaruzaman said they have admitted
the carriers and also those who were in contact with them, as part of an
effort to isolate them from further interaction with other people.
"We are taking rectal swabs and those who show no signs of infection after
3 checks will be discharged," he said, adding that though cholera was
endemic to Semporna the current outbreak was higher then the previous outbreak.
[With an infected food worker, this may well be a point-source outbreak.

[3] Cholera - Cameroon (Western Provinces)

Cholera outbreak on wane after 42 deaths
----------------------------------------
A cholera outbreak which has killed at least 42 people and infected almost
1400 since the beginning of 2005 in western Cameroon despite government
measures to contain the disease is finally receding, health officials told
IRIN on Mon 9 May 2005.
In the worst-hit area for example, in the coastal Littoral province, where
29 people have died and 1141 were infected, fatalities were sharply down in
May 2005, said Antoine Mouangue, who heads the province's hospital services.
"We are now in an endemic phase, having registered 3 to 11 cholera cases
per week over the last weeks," he said in a telephone interview from
Douala, the country's economic capital. "Previously, we had registered up
to 80 new cases a week," he said, referring to Littoral province during the
period between 27 Dec 2004 and 8 Mar 2005.
In the city of Douala, where there were more than 500 cases of cholera but
good medical facilities, there were only 3 deaths. Also badly affected by
the outbreak were 2 Cameroonian provinces bordering Nigeria, West province
and South-West province.
West province had registered 131 cases of cholera and 8 deaths since 28 Mar
2005, but no new cases had been detected in the last 4 days, the province's
public health delegate Hammadou Fopa told IRIN on Mon, 9 May 2005.
In South-West province 5 of the 85 people infected have died, the
province's public health delegate Martin Mafany told IRIN. But no new cases
had been recorded over the last 2 weeks.
Cholera is endemic in Cameroon, where it breaks out every year from
December through June if not properly tackled. In 2004 at least 6400 people
were infected nationwide and more than 130 people died of cholera across
the country, according to government figures. A majority of the victims
were found in the West and Littoral provinces.

[4] Cholera - Sao Tome and Principe

Sao Tome cholera outbreak spreads rapidly
-----------------------------------------
Health workers and UN agencies are concerned about the rapid spread of
cholera in Sao Tome and Principe. As of 9 May 2005, 130 cases and 3 deaths
have been officially reported. Most of the island's population of an
estimated 140 000 lives within 10 kilometres of the outbreak area. During
the first 2 weeks of the cholera outbreak, 74 acute cases were reported,
coming mainly from the Bairro de Hospital and Ferreiro Governo wards in
Agua Grande District, which hosts the nation's capital, according to the
UN's children fund, UNICEF. By now, however, 130 Sao Tomeans have caught
the deadly disease.
"We must not underestimate the extremely dangerous force of this disease,"
said UNICEF Representative Kristian Laubjerg, from Libreville in Gabon. "It
is extremely urgent that we get clean water and safe toilet and sanitary
facilities as quickly as possible to all affected communities to ensure
against the death of children, who are especially vulnerable," he added.
Cholera is spread through contaminated water and food, and severe, sudden
outbreaks are usually caused by water supplies that have been contaminated.
In the tiny and poor archipelago of Sao Tome and Principe, access to clean
water has become more scarce lately, due to privatization of the state
water utility and water price hikes. During a cholera outbreak, fatality
rates may be as high as 50 percent if the community is unprepared and if
treatment is given too late. Young children are particularly vulnerable to
cholera, which causes diarrhea that can lead to severe dehydration and death.
Sao Tome's Ministry of Health, in collaboration with UNICEF, the World
Health Organization, the UN's Development Program and district officials,
has mobilized community health teams to increase community awareness;
implement community-based needs assessment missions; detect and prevent the
spread of the outbreak and distribute potable water to affected
neighborhoods. According to UNICEF, a massive media and communication
campaign is also under way to scale up environmental sanitation efforts
that include community-based waste disposal and the building of toilets for
improved household sanitation.
Government authorities have worked rapidly and transparently, together with
city and town councils, to inform the nation of the outbreak and to take
measures to halt the spread. "We must contain this disease before it gets
out of control," said Mr Laubjerg.
Nearly 20 per cent of the population of Sao Tome have no access to safe
drinking water; only 9 per cent use safe toilet facilities. Diarrheal
diseases have long been the principal cause of mortality among children
under 5 years old, with an annual average of about 3600 cases.

Cholera in Senegal - update 4
-----------------------------
From the week 2-8 May 2005, the Ministry of Health in Senegal reported a

previous report: <http://www.who.int/csr/2005_04_20/en/>).

10 cases per day compared with an average of 33 cases reported per day 2
weeks ago.
The Ministry of Health has implemented several measures for prevention and
response, including dissemination of health messages, pre-positioning of
supplies and ensuring a safe and adequate water supply.
