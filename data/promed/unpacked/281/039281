Agencies Turn to Artemisinin in Treating Resistant Malaria
------------------------
After years of hesitation, world health agencies are racing to acquire 100
million doses of a Chinese herbal drug that has proven strikingly effective
against malaria, one of the leading killers of the poor.

Artemisinin is a compound based on qinghaosu, or sweet wormwood. 1st
isolated in 1965 by Chinese military researchers, it cut the death rate by
97 percent in a malaria epidemic in Viet Nam in the early 1990's. It is
rapidly replacing quinine derivatives and later drugs against which the
disease has evolved into resistant strains. To protect artemisinin from the
same fate, it will be given as part of multidrug cocktails. Until recently,
big donors like the United States and Britain had opposed its use on a
wide scale, saying it was too expensive, had not been tested enough on
children and was not needed in areas where other malaria drugs still worked.

Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, which procures drugs for the
world's poorest countries, opposed its use during an Ethiopian epidemic in
2003, saying that there was too little supply and that switching drugs in
mid-outbreak would cause confusion. But now almost all donors, Unicef and
the World Bank have embraced the drug. The new Global Fund for AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria has given 11 countries grants to buy artemisinin
and has instructed 34 others to drop requests for 2 older drugs --
chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine -- and switch to the new one.

"We want countries to move very rapidly to use it as a 1st-line treatment,"
said Dr. Vinand Nantulya, the fund's malaria adviser. The fund expects to
spend USD 450 million on the drug over the next 5 years, he said. The World
Health Organization estimates that 100 million doses will be needed by late
2005.

Malaria causes about 300 million illnesses a year, and at least 1 million
deaths, 90 percent of them in Africa and most of them children under 5.
Despite more than a century of eradication efforts, the disease is endemic
from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam to the Amazon Basin in Brazil, and is
particularly severe across central Africa, from the cane fields of
Mozambique to the oases of Somalia to the rubber plantations of Liberia.

Like many tropical disease drugs, artemisinin is a fruit of military
research. Chinese scientists first isolated it in 1965 while seeking a new
antimalarial treatment for Vietnamese troops fighting American forces,
said Dr. Nelson Tan, medical director of Holley Pharmaceuticals, which
makes the drug in Chongqing, China.

Another antimalarial drug still in use, mefloquine, was isolated at the
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in 1963 for American troops in the
same jungles. Under the name Lariam, it is still issued to troops and sold
to travelers.

Artemisinin, which has no significant side effects, quickly reduces fevers
and rapidly lowers blood-parasite levels, which can keep small outbreaks in
mosquito-infested areas from becoming epidemics. 2 years ago, Dr. Dennis
Carroll, a health adviser to the United States Agency for International
Development, said artemisinin was "not ready for prime time."

But on 30 Apr 2004 at a malaria conference at the Columbia University
School of Public Health, he led a session on ways to induce farmers to
plant more wormwood. Dr. Carroll said that more evidence had emerged that
the drug was safe and that older drugs were not working. Also, the creation
of the Global Fund expedited grants for it.

Dr. Stewart Tyson, a health expert with the British Department for
International Development, said his agency changed its opinion about the
drug after its experience in Uganda, where resistance to older drugs had
climbed to 31 percent in some areas in 2003 from 6 percent in 2000. The
price of artemisinin cocktails has fallen from $2 per treatment to 90 cents
or less as more companies in China, India and Viet Nam have begun making
them. (Older drugs cost only 20 cents.) Novartis, the Swiss drug giant,
sells its artemisinin-lumefantrine mix, Coartem, to poor countries for 10
cents less than it costs to make, a company official said. The same drug,
under the name Riamet, is sold to European travelers for about $20.

[Drug resistance to chloroquine has spread rapidly in tropical Africa over
the past 2 decades, and a few countries switched to
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) as 1st-line treatment during the past
5 years. However, resistance to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine develops more
rapidly than to chloroquine. It has therefore long been recognised that
alternatives to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine were urgently
needed, and the Artimisinin Combination Therapies or ACT's have been
discussed for several years. The main obstacle has been the price of these
drug combinations. It is most welcome that the price is now within reach of
users in Africa. Further information on resistance and the use of ACT can
be found in the WHO 2003 Africa Malaria Report, chapter 3:
