[C] Update 23 - Status of the main SARS outbreaks in different countries 7
Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_07/en/>
China
The Chinese Ministry of Health is now providing daily updates on numbers of
cases and deaths, nationwide by province. On 3 Apr 2003, a total of 17 new
cases, including 2 deaths, were reported. 2 previously reported cases were
excluded. 11 new cases and one death occurred in Guangdong Province. One
case was reported from Shanghai, 4 from Beijing, and one case (fatal) from
Sichuan Province.
On 4 Apr 2003, 12 new cases, with no deaths, were reported, 11 from
Guangdong and 1 from Shanxi. For 5 and 6 Apr 2003, 21 new cases and 2 new
deaths were reported. The breakdown by province is awaiting translation
from Chinese. This brings the total number of reported cases in China to
1268, with 53 deaths.
Chinese officials have announced that SARS is being made a high priority
for the government. A system of alert and response for early detection and
reporting of all emerging and epidemic-prone diseases is being put in
place. The government has also begun holding daily press conferences. WHO
welcomes this move, which is an important way to increase awareness of the
population and health care staff of the characteristic symptoms, the need
to seek prompt medical attention, and the need to manage patients according
to the principles of isolation and strict infection control.
The WHO office in China has reported considerable anxiety among the
international community following the death in Beijing on Sunday of a
53-year-old Finnish staff member of the International Labor Organization.
The ILO staff members was in Beijing to attend an international conference.
At present it is unclear how the staff member contracted SARS. He had
travelled to Beijing via Thailand, where no local transmission has been
reported.
Hong Kong
Hong Kong SAR continues to report the largest number of new cases, placing
some hospitals under considerable strain. Todays report from the
Department of Health indicates that the unusual outbreak among residents in
the Amoy Gardens estate, which has caused 268 cases, is coming to an end.
Investigation of environmental samples continues at a rapid pace with
support from several government departments. Evidence that the causative
agent is excreted in faeces has focused attention on the possibility of an
oral-faecal route of transmission, though no conclusions have been reached.
Good data from the investigations are expected by the end of the week. The
investigations have found no evidence of airborne spread.
Singapore
The Singapore Ministry of Health has reported an unusual cluster of 29
suspected SARS cases in hospital staff from 2 wards of a single hospital.
Of these 4 are probable SARS cases. The onset of the clustering is believed
to be 29 Mar 2003. Officials investigating the cause of the outbreak are
considering a possible point source in the environment, as it would be
unusual for so many cases to begin on the same day if caused by contact
with a patient
Viet Nam
The outbreak in Viet Nam began at a French hospital in Hanoi, where the
index case, a 48-year-old Chinese-American businessman who worked for an
import-export company in Hong Kong, was admitted on 26 Feb 2003. The number
of cases increased rapidly but then stabilized on 24 Mar 2003 at 58 cases
and remained stable for 10 consecutive days. As the maximum incubation
period for SARS is thought to be 10 days, the stable number of cases over
this period raised hope that Viet Nams outbreak had been brought under
control. However, on 3 Apr 2003 a probable SARS case was detected in a
provincial hospital. Though the case could be linked back to the French
hospital, the absence of isolation and rigorous infection control at the
provincial hospital suggests that many hospital staff, patients, and
visitors could have been exposed, thus possibly seeding further waves of
cases. An additional 3 probable cases have been reported over the past 2 days.
Canada
Health Canada has received reports of 217 probable or suspect cases of
SARS. There have been 9 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred
in persons who have travelled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the
household or in a health-care setting. The largest outbreak has occurred in
Ontario, where 87 probable and 92 suspect cases have been reported. British
Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 23 suspect cases, New Brunswick is
reporting 2 suspect cases, Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case,
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases, and Prince Edward Island is reporting
4 suspect cases.
These reports account for the 90 probable cases included in the WHO
cumulative table of cases and deaths for today.
Status of diagnostic tests
The development of a diagnostic test, which is being pursued around the
clock by the WHO collaborating network of 11 laboratories, has proved more
problematic than hoped. 3 diagnostic tests are now available and all have
limitations as tools for bringing the SARS outbreak quickly under control.
The ELISA detects antibodies reliably but only from about day 20 after the
onset of clinical symptoms. It therefore cannot be used to detect cases at
an early stage before they have a chance to spread the infection to others.
The second test, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), detects antibodies
reliably as of day 10 of infection, but is a demanding and comparatively
slow test that requires the growth of virus in cell culture. The presently
available PCR molecular test for detection of SARS virus genetic material
is useful in the early stages of infection but produces many
false-negatives, meaning that many persons who actually carry the virus may
not be detected, creating a dangerous sense of false security for a virus
that is known to spread easily in close person-to-person contact.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, have
been reported from 17 countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases
and 9 deaths compared with the last update of 5 Apr 2003. The deaths
occurred in Canada (2), China (4), and Hong Kong SAR (3).
The single case reported in Belgium has been removed from the list.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 7 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 3 PM 7 Apr 2003, an additional 41 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 7 healthcare
workers (2 from Princess Margaret Hospital, 4 from Alice Ho Miu Ling
Nethersole Hospital and one from Tuen Mun Hospital) and 10 patients from
Amoy Gardens. The remaining 24 were new patients and contacts of patients
with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 127 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 11 were discharged today.
Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses
to the new treatment protocol. 116 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care unit.
A 78-year-old female patient died in Queen Elizabeth Hospital last night,
bring to 23 the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Nature Cumulative No. cases/ Total No. of Discharged cases/ Total No. deaths *
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 208 (208)/ 69/ 23
Patients, family members & visitors 675 (675)/ 58/
Total 883 (883)/ 127
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who had a history of chronic
diseases or who sought treatment at a relatively late stage of infection.

SARS Update - 7 Apr 2003
As of 7 Apr 2003, 73 SARS patients have been discharged. 31 SARS patients
remain hospitalised.
There were 7 additional SARS cases reported today. All are nurses; 1 from
TTSH, 2 from SGH, 2 from CGH, 1 from a private nursing home and 1
radiographer from SGH.
Nurse from TTSH
A nurse from TTSH who had come into contact with a SARS patient before the
patient was diagnosed with SARS was admitted on 28 Mar 2003 as a suspected
SARS patient. She has since been upgraded to a probable SARS.
Nurses from CGH
2 nurses from CGH have been admitted to TTSH on 5 and 6 Apr 2003 as
probable SARS cases. One had close contact with a patient before she was
diagnosed with SARS and transferred to TTSH 21 Mar 2003. This SARS patient
was infected when she visited her sister in TTSH. At that time, a SARS
patient who had yet been diagnosed was in warded next to her sister at
TTSH. CGH had put the whole ward staff on voluntary quarantine and were
followed up closely. On 2 Apr [2003], the nurse who had attended to the
SARS patient was admitted to a single room at CGH as the clinical picture
then was suggestive of dengue fever. She was later diagnosed as a probable
SARS when her third chest x-ray showed changes. Her colleague who attended
to her when she admitted has now been diagnosed with SARS.
Private nursing home
A nurse from a private nursing home was admitted to CGH on 4 Apr 2003 for
pneumonia and transferred to TTSH on 6 Apr 2003 for probable SARS. He is
now in serious condition in intensive care.
His girlfriend, who is also a nurse at the same nursing home, was admitted
to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 as a suspected SARS. Her condition is stable.
Investigations have revealed that a resident of the nursing home was
admitted to CGH on 25 Mar 2003 and died of pneumonia on 30 Mar 2003. This
nursing home resident had been earlier discharged from TTSH on 23 Mar 2003
for non-SARS related condition. When the patient was in TTSH she was warded
next to a patient who was later diagnosed as a SARS case. The male nurse
from the nursing home had been attending to this resident.
Update on cluster of SGH staff
Arising from the transfer of staff and patients of SGH Wards 57 and 58, a
total of 29 have been admitted to the SARS wards. Of these, there are 4
probable SARS cases (a doctor and 2 nurses), 18 suspected SARS cases and 7
admitted for observation. They are all stable.
There were a total of 346 patients who were discharged from Wards 57 & 58
during the period 20 Mar 2003 - 5 Apr 2003. So far, 284 have been contacted
about their well being. All of them including their immediate family
members and friends who visited them when they were in SGH are well.
As an assurance, visitors who went to Wards 57 and 58 at SGH from 20 Mar
2003 to 5 Apr 2003 may call SGH hotline at 6321-3591 between 8.00 AM and
10.00 PM for free health checks to ensure their well-being. Investigations
are on-going to determine the source of infection for these hospital staff.
2 SARS patients in intensive care passed away today. One is the mother of
the first index case and the other a TTSH doctor who had attended to a SARS
patient before she had been diagnosed with SARS. This patient has since
passed away on 29 Mar 2003.
Today, 7 passengers from affected areas required further screening by the
nurses at the airport. None were referred to TTSH for further assessment.
No passenger vessels that had a travel history to SARS affected areas in
the last 10 days arrived today.
The Ministry would like to reiterate that we have taken steps to safeguard
our public transport system. There is thus no need for commuters to avoid
taxis, buses or the MRT in fear of contracting SARS.
Special arrangements have been made for 4 categories of persons with a
higher likelihood of getting SARS:
(a) Persons with Home Quarantine Order who would have come into direct
contact with a SARS patient
(b) Cases identified by General Practitioners and private dentists
(c) Incoming passengers from affected countries who received a Health Alert
Notice; and
(d) Cases identified during medical screening at Changi Airport and
Singapore Cruise Centre
People belonging to any of the above categories who develop SARS symptoms
should call the hotline number that they have been given. Upon receiving
such calls, MOH will arrange for a private ambulance to pick them up and
send them to TTSH directly for medical assessment. These people should not
take public transport or call relatives for transport arrangements.
Summary: to date, the total number of people diagnosed with SARS is 113.
Among these are 3 children below 18 years of age. Out of the 31 patients
still hospitalised, 12 are in intensive care. Since yesterday, there were 2
deaths and 1 new admission to intensive care who is the nurse from the
private nursing home.
Apart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have not
given rise to any SARS cases.
The number of suspect cases admitted is 73, including 3 children (below 18
years old). The number of people under Home Quarantine Orders is 133.

The majority SARS are imported, no community spread
As of 6 Apr 2003, with 3 new imported cases and one new probable case
infected by close contact with a Hong Kong case, a cumulative total of 19
probable cases have been identified in Taiwan. 5 of them have been
discharged, and the other 14 are still hospitalized.
The SARS outbreak in Taiwan is mainly sporadic and imported, with only 4
cases resulting from close contact (limited to primary transmission.) When
looking into the case data, 3 close contact with probable cases raised from
the 1st case; the 4th close contact case could have been avoided had his
brother not traveled while ill.
3 of the 4 newly identified probable cases are imported from various parts
of China. The flights taken were CX402 on 30 Mar 2003 and BR818 on 23 Mar
2003. One of the residents of Amoy Gardens, Hong Kong, flew to Taiwan to
visit his brother on 26 Mar 2003 (CX460, seat 35G). He stayed for 3 days
and returned to Hong Kong on 28 Mar 2003 (CX511, seat 42H). He was reported
to be symptomatic before 26 Mar 2003 and was hospitalized after returning
to Hong Kong, and his Taiwanese brother was also hospitalized on 3 Apr 2003
because of fever and pneumonia. The Center for Disease Control had the list
of all passengers sitting in the same seat row and within 3 rows in front
of or behind on the same flights (n=51). We have initiated follow-up for
the 25 Taiwanese passengers [in this possibly exposed group].

[A] China - from ABC news 7 Apr 2003
<http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Living/ap20030407_733.html>
Chinese officials had reported 43 SARS deaths in the southern province of
Guangdong, where experts suspect the illness originated, with fatalities
also coming in Beijing and the Guangxi region. On Monday, Chinese state
television reported that there were also one SARS death each in the
provinces of Shanxi in the north, Sichuan in the west, and Hunan in central
China, the first fatalities in those areas, and an indication the disease
was more widespread geographically than previously acknowledged.
[B] Vietnam - from an AFP newswire report
The 5 new cases, confirmed at Hanoi's Bach Mai hospital over the weekend
include a doctor who treated a 67-year-old man hospitalised last Wednesday
in serious condition and 4 members of his family. All the new patients come
from Ninh Binh province, 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Hanoi. The
67-year-old, whose son had undergone surgery in the SARS-hit French
hospital in Hanoi, apparently constitutes a new source of the
disease. Another man who came into close contact with him in Ninh Binh was
also hospitalized, on Thursday, bringing the province's suspected cases to
7. Local health workers in Ninh Binh province have quarantined about 50
people who had contact with the initial patient.

[According to the WHO statistics presented in [1][A], as of today, there is
a cumulative total of 2601 cases of SARS, with 98 deaths, reported from 17
countries. This represents an increase of 85 cases and 9 deaths compared
with the last WHO update of 5 Apr 2003. Hong Kong continues that have the
largest number of new cases on a daily basis with 41 cases reported in the
past 24 hours. The number of new cases associated with the Amoy Gardens
apartment block appears to be decreasing, but there continue to be other
new cases for which the transmission/contact level is not presented. We
await further information on the studies conducted on the apartment block
to shed light on possible route of transmission. While it had appeared that
transmission had been interrupted in Hanoi, Viet Nam, after 10 days with no
new cases reported (equal to approximately one incubation period) there now
seems to be a new generation of transmission, with a case occurring outside
of Hanoi, and several other cases in health care workers exposed to the
case. The newswire briefs mention the provinces involved with new reports
of cases in both China and Viet Nam. As mentioned in the newswire, in Viet
Nam, the new generation of cases is related to the original outbreak in Hanoi.
Further clarification of the numbers of secondary and more transmissions
that have occurred in the USA and Taiwan would be of interest. The reports
from both these regions suggest a few isolated incidences of secondary
transmission to close family contacts. We also await more technical
details on the etiology of this disease and the laboratory component of the
investigation. - Mod.MPP]
