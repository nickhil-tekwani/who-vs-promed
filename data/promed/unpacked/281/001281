An outbreak of _Clostridium difficile_ infection in Stoke Mandeville
hospital in south-east England (1) in 2004/2005 was primarily due to
a new and possibly more virulent strain known in the United Kingdom
(UK) as PCR [polymerase chain reaction] ribotype 027. Coinciding with
this outbreak, a surveillance programme of _C. difficile_ isolates
from symptomatic patients in England with additional results of
outbreak investigation requests to the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory
(ARL) in Cardiff has established the true extent of its spread
throughout British hospitals.
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) in England, through its network of
regional laboratories in collaboration with the ARL of the National
Public Health Service for Wales in Cardiff, obtained isolates of _C.
difficile_ from symptomatic patients in a structured but random
sampling scheme. In an allocated week, local hospitals within each of
the 9 HPA regions were asked to submit up to a maximum of 10 _C.
difficile_ toxin-positive stools to their local Regional HPA
laboratory to culture _C. difficile_. Isolates of putative _C.
difficile_ were then forwarded to the ARL for confirmation of
identity, susceptibility testing against antimicrobial agents and
typing by the PCR ribotyping method developed by the ARL (2). In
total, 1004 cultures of putative _C. difficile_ were submitted to the
ARL from the nine HPA regions, from which 881 isolates of _C.
difficile_ were obtained for study.
Figure 1 [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL] shows the
distribution of PCR ribotypes identified amongst the 881 isolates
typed during the study. It demonstrates that 3 strains, including
type 027, in roughly equal proportions, accounted for approximately
75 percent of _C. difficile_ infections that occurred during the
sampling period. Prior to the Stoke Mandeville outbreak, type 027 had
only been detected in 2 hospitals in England: 2 single isolates were
submitted in 1999 and 2002 from Preston and Birmingham, respectively,
where this ribotype apparently caused no notable problems. The 2
other most common strains comprised types 106 and 001, which had been
identified in the mid-1990s when the ARL typing service was set up.
Type 001 was by far the most common at that time, accounting for 55
percent of referrals in an audit of isolates referred up to 2003, and
by retrospective analysis of isolates, this strain is known to have
caused an outbreak in north Manchester in the winter of 1991-92. Type
106, which is currently the most common strain, appears to be a
peculiarly British strain, since other ARL collaborative studies with
several European countries and those further afield including the USA
and Canada, have not detected this strain.
Since these figures were compiled in May 2006, further referrals of
_C. difficile_ in the form of outbreak investigation requests to the
ARL have revealed the widespread dissemination of type 027 to 89
locations in England (Figure 2 [for figure, see original URL -
Mod.LL]). In addition, the ARL has detected type 027 in four
hospitals in Wales and, most recently, one in Scotland. In total, the
ARL has received 971 isolates of type 027 from UK sources. However, a
recent small survey of 60 isolates from various locations in Northern
Ireland yielded no isolates of type 027 in the province. Antibiotic
susceptibility testing of 230 isolates of type 027 has revealed
consistently that this strain was susceptible to metronidazole,
vancomycin, co-amoxyclavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam and
resistant to erythromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and imipenem.
Discussion:
This surveillance program which covered all the English health
regions has revealed the extent of the spread of type 027 around the
country, and although the mechanism of spread is unknown, it should
act as a warning to the rest of Europe. Colleagues in mainland Europe
have already detected this strain in the Netherlands, Belgium, France
and most recently in a British tourist in Austria (3). The European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is alert to this and
is supportive of surveillance initiatives along the lines of the one
undertaken in England. The surveillance has also delineated the
strains currently prevalent in England and identified type 106 as the
most common.

We report the first documentation of _C. difficile_ 027 in Ireland
from a patient with diarrhea who transferred from a hospital in the
United Kingdom (UK). In addition, we report 2 clusters of _C.
difficile_ ribotype 027 in 2 hospitals in Ireland. Outbreaks of
severe _Clostridium difficile_-associated disease (CDAD) in
connection with PCR ribotype 027 have been identified in Canada and
the USA since 2003 (1-3). Recent data from a random sampling scheme
in the UK in 2006 determined that 26 percent of isolates were strain
type 027 (4). This strain has been identified in healthcare
facilities in several other European countries, including the
Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and France (5-9).
The 1st case of 027 CDAD, Hospital A, May 2005:
In May 2005, an Irish-born male in his early seventies was admitted
to a Dublin teaching hospital (Hospital A), following transfer from a
district hospital in the UK, where he had been treated for several
weeks for cerebrovascular infarction. Upon transfer to Ireland, he
was receiving trimethoprim and metronidazole, the latter empirically
for diarrhea. No further antibiotic history was indicated on the
patient's transfer letter. On admission to Hospital A, the patient
had mild diarrhea, and a stool sample tested positive for _C.
difficile_ toxin 2 days afterwards.
Culture and PCR ribotyping identified the strain as _C. difficile_
027. At this time, the patient had no abdominal pain or fever, his
white blood cell count was elevated and his albumin level low. His
antibiotic regimen was changed to coamoxiclav [amoxicillin/clavulanic
acid - Mod.LL] and vancomycin and the diarrhea resolved promptly. The
patient was isolated after the laboratory results were available and
remained in isolation until he was symptom-free and had finished his
course of vancomycin. He had no further episodes of _C. difficile_
diarrhea during his hospital stay, and he was discharged in mid-Aug
2005.
There has been ongoing clinical surveillance of patients with
diarrhea and laboratory-based surveillance with molecular genotyping
of _C. difficile_ isolates from toxin-positive stool samples at this
hospital since 2003. The baseline rate of CDAD cases was 5 per 1000
patient admissions for 2005. No further cases of PCR ribotype 027
were recorded for the remainder of 2005. Only 3 sporadic cases of C.
difficile PCR ribotype 027 subsequently occurred at Hospital A in
2006, but were not linked in time and place to the 1st case described
above.
The 1st cluster of 027 CDAD, Hospital B, Jan-Apr 2006:
An increase in the incidence of _C. difficile_ was identified in
another Dublin hospital (Hospital B), where the number of new cases
rose from 6 to 15 per 1000 patient admissions in Jan 2006. Between
Jan and Apr 2006, there were 81 new cases of CDAD. There had been a
perceived increase in the number of severe cases as assessed by the
clinical microbiology team. _C. difficile_ isolates from 58 patients
were cultured during this time period, 12 (21 percent) of which were
ribotype 027. All _C. difficile_-positive patients were isolated, or
cohorted where isolation rooms were not available. There was
heightened awareness and enforcement of standard infection control
precautions, with particular emphasis on hand hygiene and the
presence of ribotype 027 within the hospital. Physicians were advised
to reduce use of quinolone antibiotics where possible as prescribing
of moxifloxacin was noted to have increased substantially over the
same time period. Incidence rates returned to baseline levels by May
2006.
Contact tracing indicated that the index patient was admitted
following transfer from a 3rd Dublin hospital (Hospital C) via a
nursing home on 17 Jan 2006. The 12 patients with _C. difficile_
ribotype 027 were located in 6 different hospital wards. 4 cases,
including the index case, were found in a single medical ward.
There had been ongoing laboratory surveillance with molecular
genotyping of _C. difficile_ isolates from toxin-positive stool
samples at this institution, and no C. difficile ribotype 027 cases
had been detected between 2004 and the initial case in Jan 2006.
The 2nd of 027 CDAD, Hospital C, Feb-Apr 2006:
_C. difficile_ molecular typing was initiated at Hospital C in late
Feb 2006 after it became clear that the index case at Hospital B had
originated from there. In a retrospective review of toxin-positive
cases, it was noted that the incidence rates at this institution had
tripled in that month, with 34 cases per 1000 patient admissions. A
total of 10 new cases of _C. difficile_ occurred between Mar and Apr
2007. In 7 out of 8 available fecal samples from these patients _C.
difficile_ ribotype 027 was found. Of these 7 cases, 4 were clustered
on one medical ward, while the remaining 3 were located on 2
additional medical wards. Clinical surveillance of patients with
diarrhea and heightened infection control measures, including patient
isolation and cohorting, were identical to those in Hospital B.
However, there were no changes to the antibiotic formulary in
Hospital C.
Microbiology:
The initial 027 strain isolated at Hospital A and 19 _C. difficile_
PCR 027 strains from the additional institutions had identical
ribotyping banding patterns when compared to _C. difficile_ ribotype
027 control strain. All were categorized as toxinotype III by
PCR-RFLP, were positive for binary toxin and had an 18 bp deletion in
tcdC the toxin regulator. Using E-tests, all isolates demonstrated
high-level resistance (greater than 32 mg/mL) to a number of
fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin,
levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. PCR was used to amplify
the QRDR regions of gyrA and gyrB and sequence analysis determined
that all 18 PCR-027 isolates had a single transition mutation (C to
T) resulting in the amino acid substitution Thr-82-Ile in gyrA (10).
Discussion:
In contrast to other studies, where _C. difficile_ 027 accounted for
greater than 50 percent of isolates contributing to outbreaks (1), we
found that, despite an overall increase in _C. difficile_ incidence
rates in Hospital B, only 21 percent of isolates were ribotype 027.
However, both Hospitals B and C initiated additional infection
control measures as described above, and the investigation is still
ongoing. This report highlights the potential of _C. difficile_ 027
to spread between healthcare institutions both locally, nationally
and internationally and links the first documented Irish case with
the transfer of a patient from the UK.
To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report of 027 in
Ireland. However, as there is no national reference facility in
Ireland and isolates are not routinely cultured or typed, there may
have been previous undiagnosed 027 cases. A nationwide
laboratory-based surveillance study is currently underway at the
Centre for Food Safety at UCD to investigate the presence of _C.
difficile_ 027 throughout the rest of Ireland. The Health Protection
Surveillance Centre in Dublin has recently set up a scientific
advisory committee to make recommendations for the surveillance and
typing of _C. difficile_ in Ireland.
