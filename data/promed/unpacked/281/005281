Europe on the brink of lifting beef ban
THE European Commission is ready to declare most British beef safe for
export, raising hopes that sales from all parts of the United Kingdom could
resume to world markets by the end of the year. A commission statement said
Brussels wanted to recommend in the next few weeks that beef and beef
products from animals born after Aug 1, 1996, should be cleared for export.
If the proposal, being drawn up by Franz Fischler, the farm commissioner,
is supported by enough EU countries, it would spell the end of a global
embargo imposed by the commission on March 26 1996 at the height of the
scare over mad cow disease.
A commission official said: "We will put the plan to vets from the member
states next month and then to ministers." But he cautioned that the
proposal would run into stiff opposition from other countries including
Germany and was unlikely to be agreed before late autumn at the earliest.
The latest sign of progress came as Brussels announced that exports of meat
from BSE-free herds in Northern Ireland could restart on Monday. These
exports will be the first to leave the UK legally since the ban 26 months
ago.
Agriculture ministers had agreed to ease the restrictions on Northern
Ireland in March, but said final inspection visits and reports on
slaughterhouses and meat plants had to be completed before a date could be
set. Northern Ireland was singled out because cattle records are kept on a
computerised tracking system which is not yet in place in the rest of the
UK. It has also had a very low incidence of BSE.
Mr. Cunningham [UK Minister Of Agriculture] will now try to persuade EU
member states to support Mr Fischler's plan to allow beef exports from
cattle born after Aug 1, 1996, in the whole of the UK. This was the date
when a ban on feeding meat and bone meal to livestock was first fully
effective in Britain. Commission officials said they were satisfied that
British beef was safe and that a "passport" system for cattle which allowed
their movements to be traced was working efficiently.
But there are many political hurdles to jump before farmers see the end of
their battle. The main opposition will come from Germany where consumers
remain nervous about BSE and the farming lobby is determined to protect its
markets. British diplomats are pessimistic about any progress before the
German general election on Sept 27. All the main parties will be courting
votes among the farming and health lobbies. One official said: "After then
it will be a different game."
Experts explained that because all animals over 30 months of age have to be
slaughtered under anti-BSE rules now in force in the UK, the Fischler plan
would cover almost all quality beef produced in Britain.
More than 20,000 jobs depend on beef production in Northern Ireland, where
the export trade was worth around Â£180 million a year before the ban. A
battle to recapture markets lost over the last 26 months will now begin.
Exports are expected to start slowly as producers, hampered by the strong
pound, attempt to win back market share abroad. Walter Elliott, president
of the Ulster Farmers' Union, said: "This whole ban has been a political
rather that scientific or commercial exercise."
