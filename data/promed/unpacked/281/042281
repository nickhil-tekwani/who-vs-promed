NBC Employee Tests Positive for Anthrax in New York
---------------------------------------------------
An NBC employee in New York City has tested positive for anthrax, the TV
network announced Friday. The anthrax is a cutaneous (skin) infection - not
the same respiratory anthrax that killed a Florida man, NBC News said in a
statement. The employee, an unidentified woman, is in no danger, is
responding well to treatment and should recover fully, the network said. A
source close to the investigation said the Centers for Disease Control has
received a possible report of anthrax, but that it is not confirmed.
CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds referred all calls to the New York City
Health Department, which is investigating.
NBC said it had received some suspicious mail and immediately contacted
the FBI, CDC and the New York Department of Health. "The mail was tested
by these organizations, and the employee was treated by several
physicians. All these tests came back negative," said the NBC statement.
"However, this morning, a later test on the employee came back positive
for traces of cutaneous anthrax." This is the fourth confirmed case of
the deadly microbe to surface in the last week.
