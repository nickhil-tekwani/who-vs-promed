According to the WAHID summary, since 17 Sep 2013 Turkey has reported 4 outbreaks (2 in K. Maras, 1 in Batman, and 1 in Hakkari). The total number of animals affected (cattle) is: 213 susceptible, 24 cases, 10 dead, 0 destroyed, and 0 slaughtered.

The above and additional data on this event can also be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary (Note: to view the information on lumpy skin disease, scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).

Since the distance between Buyukkizilcik (K Maras) and Uzumlu (Hakkari) is more than 600 km (373 mi), and given the locations of the 2 new infected provinces (Batman and Hakkari), which border Syria and Iraq, these new outbreaks may have been due to introductions of animals rather than actual spread of the disease. See the map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (Note: to view the information on lumpy skin disease, scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).

This latest follow-up report also indicates "vaccination in response to the outbreak" as "a measure to be applied." Details on the vaccine to be applied and information on the advance of vaccination activities will be welcome.

The location of the 1st outbreak reported on 17 Sep 2013 was reported as "Farm, K Maras" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000014106_20130917_121547.pdf). This has now been updated as having occurred in Catova, K Maras (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14106). - Mods.CRD/AS
