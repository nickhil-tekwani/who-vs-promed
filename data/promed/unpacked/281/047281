Egypt: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update
----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 6 Feb 2007, The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population
has announced a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
infection. The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public
Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3).

The 17-year-old female from Fayyoum Governorate developed symptoms on
Thu 25 Jan 2007 and was initially treated for seasonal influenza. She
was hospitalized on Thu 1 Feb 2007 with fever and breathing
difficulties, and died on Fri 2 Feb 2007. Initial investigations into
the source of her exposure indicate the presence of sick and dead
poultry at her home in the days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Of the 20 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 12 have been fatal.
