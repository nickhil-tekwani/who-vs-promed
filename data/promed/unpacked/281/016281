Mysterious 'crack disease' affects mangoes
------------------------------------------
Mangoes in Dinajpur [Rangpur Division] get cracked following black spots. The disease has affected many mango orchards in the district. Growers are now worried as the disease [has] never [been] seen in the area before. Most orchards [in the area] are infected.

The mysterious disease was first noticed about 10 days ago. The infected mango develops a black mark and the fruit cracks within 7 days. If the affected mango is not separated immediately, it affects another. Sudden spread of the disease dashed the hope of a bumper yield. Several growers said the disease could not be checked even after spraying pesticide.

"Incidents of cracks in mangoes are not new in the area but spread of such sudden 'crack disease' following appearance of black marks is mysterious," said the Department of Agriculture Extension.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide. It can be affected by a large number of diseases, many of which are due to fungal pathogens. No virus has been reported from mango so far.

A number of fungal diseases reported in the region include quick decline (_Lasiodiplodia theobromae_), powdery mildew (_Oidium mangiferae_), anthracnose (_Glomerella cingulata_ or _Colletotrichum acutatum_), as well as leaf and stem blights, diebacks, and root rots due to a range of different pathogens.

The symptoms described above are not typical of any of these. It is possible that a combination of a number of pathogens and external factors may cause the problems.

Effective disease control requires first a reliable pathogen diagnosis. Pesticides which are described above as ineffective in Dinajpur, may assist in reducing insect pests including potential disease vectors, but will not help with control of infectious pathogens.
