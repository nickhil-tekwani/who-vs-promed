The 6 cases of pertussis confirmed in Marquette county is cause for concern. The Marquette County Health Department [MCHS] said this bacterial illness, known as whooping cough, is preventable through vaccines. However officials said it is hard to contain because the illness is spread without knowing one has it. Symptoms include congestion and violent coughing. The illness is treatable through antibiotics making it less contagious, but the coughing can last for months.

Although whooping cough is mostly found in schools, the MCHS is warning the county to be aware of symptoms. "But the whole community needs to think about this because kids travel for sports events and those kinds of things so it's a good time to again double check to make sure your family is vaccinated," said Dr Terry Frankovich, the medical director.

Whooping cough has sickened a hand full of students at Foothill High School -- a reminder that the once rare respiratory disease in California has made a comeback in the past 8 years.

School officials confirmed this week that a "single digit" number of Foothill students are believed to have contracted the highly contagious respiratory disease, also called pertussis. The symptoms start out like a common cold but can transform in serious cases to fits of coughing and a whooping sound while gasping for air.

Pleasanton school officials said they are declining to disclose the exact number of cases because county health officials think doing so would make it easier for the public to identify the infected individuals. In all of Alameda county, there have been 98 pertussis cases so far this year [2017], and there were 77 cases in 2016, according to county and state public health departments.

On [14 Dec 2017], the Pleasanton school system finished emailing notices about whooping cough to families of students in the Foothill classes with a student suspected of being infected, said spokesman Patrick Gannon. The message told the families that students may have been exposed to the bacterial disease and should take steps to minimize the risk and monitor for symptoms, he said.

Protective measures include people getting vaccinations and covering noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spreading of droplets with the contagious bacteria, health officials said.

Whooping cough had been relatively rare in California until an outbreak in 2010, when there were more than 9447 cases with 10 deaths, the most in 65 years in the state. Other states also reported a surge that year. In California, the number of cases declined after 2010, but surged again to 11 203 cases in 2014 with 365 of them in Alameda county, state health officials reported. As of [3 Dec 2017], California has reported 2084 cases. Alameda county has had 98 cases so far this year, according to Alameda County Public Health Department.

Scientists and medical experts have suggested the increase in cases may be related to fewer parents vaccinating their children, and the effectiveness of the vaccines wearing off in youngsters as they reach their early teen years. Particularly vulnerable are high school students who have only received acellular pertussis vaccines even if they received a so-called Tdap booster before they were in the 7th grade, according to the state Department of Public Health.

Pertussis cases also appear to rise and drop in cycles that last from 3 to 5 years, health officials added.

According to Thursday's report [21 Dec 2017] from the health department, 56 cases have now been identified.

Cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, continue to climb in Henderson county. As school is out for the holidays and families get together to celebrate, health officials are keeping a close eye on the outbreak, now at 52 cases.

The outbreak, spread across a majority of county schools but also found in the community, has raised questions since the first cases appeared at the end of November [2017].

Kim Horton, communications specialist with the Henderson County Department of Public Health, says that one check in the win column is that there have been no cases resulting in death or patients entering the intensive care unit.

Students in Henderson county are required to take the vaccine to attend school, unless a religious or medical exemption is made, and again before entering the 7th grade. The majority of cases in the county have been found in people who have been vaccinated. Those who have had the vaccine can still get whooping cough, but will have milder symptoms.

Horton said the vaccine itself, modified to be less potent several years ago because of some severe side effects, is one of waning immunity. Pertussis is classified as a vaccine-modified disease instead of a vaccine-prevented disease.

Detection of a pertussis outbreak at an early stage allows prompt action including chemoprophylaxis and vaccination of close contacts, in order to limit spread and reduce further transmission to those who are most at risk of severe or complicated infection.

We inform you of an outbreak of _Bordetella pertussis_ in a kindergarten in Styria, Austria, in November 2017. 4 clinically suspected cases among a total of 27 kindergarten children were confirmed through detection of _B. pertussis_ DNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and notified to the public health authorities. 2 other cases were identified among siblings of the kindergarten children-cases.

Cases occurred between [4 and 25 Nov 2017]. The case-patients are aged between 3 and 8 years (male to female ratio 1:1), including 5 unvaccinated with pertussis containing vaccine and 1 patient with an unknown vaccination history.

Nasopharyngeal secretion, collected by swabs from 23 kindergarten children (17 vaccinated with at 2+1 doses schemata, 2 unvaccinated, 4 unknown) and 3 supervisors (all 3 vaccinated), defined as contact persons of the outbreak cases, were tested for _B. pertussis_ by PCR and routine culture technique. 3 children and 1 supervisor tested positive by pertussis-PCR and negative by culture. 3 of these 4 contact persons were vaccinated against pertussis. It is well known that is more difficult to recover the organism in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated children (Bamberger ES, Srugo I. What is new in pertussis? Eur J Pediatr 2008; 167(2): 133-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2151776/).

The public health authority offered antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to pertussis-PCR positive contact persons and vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine to the unvaccinated. 3 of the 4 pertussis positive contact persons accepted the prophylactic antibiotic treatment, the other decided to stay at home until the end of the maximum incubation period following latest contagious exposure.

No further cases have been reported since the onset of the last case on [25 Nov 2017].

This outbreak is occurring in the context of a continuously increasing trend of _B. pertussis_ infections in Austria (179 cases in 2009; 1291 cases in 2016). Based on a survey conducted in 2013 on vaccine uptake of birth cohorts, we assume that vaccine coverage in children and adolescents in Austria is below the recommended threshold of 90 per cent.

[A mother] is relieved her daughter is getting better after contracting whooping cough. Health officials warn people to watch out for the disease, after a rise in the number of people with it here and in other areas. Hauora Tairawhiti medical officer of health Margot McLean says New Zealand is in the early stages of a whooping cough epidemic. The best celebration [for the mother] this new year will be enjoying the good health of her baby daughter, who has spent 3 of her 8 weeks of life battling whooping cough. Before Christmas, she was admitted to Planet Sunshine at Gisborne Hospital, where the frightening coughing fits finally started to subside. [The baby] is her 1st child. "Watching my baby struggling to breathe, her lips blue and her face turning pink, then purple, is terrifying. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. "When she coughed she would choke. The nurses showed me how to sit her up and rub her back. If that didn't work, I would blow on her face. I couldn't leave her side and I was worried when I fell asleep."

[The mother an her baby] are not alone, says Margot McLean. New Zealand is in the early stages of a whooping cough epidemic and other areas have also seen a rise in cases. "In the past 2 weeks, 2 babies have been admitted to Gisborne Hospital with whooping cough."

Whooping cough causes prolonged bouts of coughing that can end in vomiting or breathlessness. "It can be very serious, especially for those under one." The best prevention is immunisation. "Pregnant mums should get their free immunisation between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Babies receive their 1st free immunisation at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months. Don't delay with vaccinations, as young babies are the most at risk and need to get their protection as soon as possible."

Dr McLean says [the mother] did the right thing. She was immunised while pregnant, giving [her baby] some protection through the shared bloodstream. This might have prevented [her baby] becoming more unwell when she contracted whooping cough at five weeks, just before her first vaccination.

Whooping cough spreads through coughing and sneezing. People with whooping cough are infectious from 6 days after exposure to the bacteria, when symptoms are like a normal cold, to 3 weeks after the ''whooping'' cough begins, unless treated with antibiotics. Dr McLean says many babies catch whooping cough from older siblings or parents, often before they are old enough to be vaccinated. "That is why staff from maternity, neonatal and Planet Sunshine teams at Gisborne Hospital are all immunised. If babies catch whooping cough, they might not be able to feed or breathe properly, become so ill they need to go to hospital, and could end up with complications such as pneumonia and brain damage."

Anyone with a cough that does not go away should avoid contact with babies and young children, and get advice from a health professional or from Healthline 0800 611 116.
