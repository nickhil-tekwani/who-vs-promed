[1] Netherlands (North Brabant): mink, further spread, control

In Gemert [North Brabant], the infection was officially established at the mink farm where SARS-CoV-2 had previously been suspected. The farm has 12 000 dams. The contamination has been revealed through the early warning monitoring system with which animals are tested weekly for the virus. Another farm was found infected a day earlier.

In total, 20 mink farms in the Netherlands have now been declared infected. All animals were culled at the 18 farms where SARS-CoV-2 has previously been established. The last 2 locations, the 19th and 20th companies, mentioned above, will follow today [6 Jul 2020].

The Cabinet has already taken measures for all fur animal farms in the Netherlands, such as a national ban on mink transport, a visitor ban in stables, and a strict hygiene protocol, to prevent further spread and to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from passing from mink to humans, which plausibly happened in 2 farms.

It is important to emphasize once again that employees with COVID-19 phenomena do not come into contact with minks, do not enter a mink stable, and have themselves tested.

The government is working on a stop scheme according to which mink companies can voluntarily terminate their business operations in the short term. In 2024, mink farms will stop their activities in accordance with the legal prohibition.

[The following additional information is derived from the Dutch daily Trouw, dated 7 Jul 2020, available at https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/alweer-nertsenfarm-besmet-hoe-kan-dat~bd15ebaa (in Dutch, translated).

"It is normal that there were still new infections in the 1st weeks. But I expected that it would have stopped by now," says Arjan Stegeman, an epidemiologist at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Utrecht University and vice-chairman of the Outbreak Management Team Zoonosis.

Apparently the measures taken do not work sufficiently. Or the companies do not closely adhere to the imposed rules. Stegeman: "I am not standing in the yard as an agent. But it is not likely that the virus will enter through the air. If it is therefore not possible to move manure and animals, it must come from people. This is a labor-intensive time on the mink farms. The young are now taken from the mothers and vaccinated against other diseases. Just like in mid-March [2020], when the minks were mated, this is a risk period. Mink farmers should be well aware of that."

The NVWA [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority] is charged with enforcing the imposed rules. It has only done so to a limited extent. That will change after the 20th outbreak, says a spokesman. "Compliance is the responsibility of the entrepreneurs, they must do what they have been told to do. But the new infections are reason for us to intensify supervision."

Research must show how the 3 latest infections occurred. In the 1st 17 infected farms, the virus in each had a different genetic code, which excludes the possibility that an animal from one affected company directly infected a mink from another company. Stegeman: "We did see connections. This is because companies sometimes have multiple locations and staff are in contact with each other."

The Chairman of the "Mens, Dier & Peel" [Mens, Dier & Peel" (Human, Animal, and Peel region] Foundation, Jan van Hoof, is fed up. "How far do we want to get it? 850 000 minks have already been culled. Many migrant workers work on the farms, who live close to each other in guest houses. All companies will soon be infected."

Having employees on mink farms obliged to wear protective clothing can help to combat further outbreaks, thinks virologist Wim van der Poel of Wageningen University.

Q. Despite the measures taken, contamination continues to emerge. Are you surprised?
A. "Somewhat. We had hoped that after the infections of the past weeks it would be done, especially now that the infections in humans are decreasing.

Q. How is it possible? There is a transport ban for animals and manure, a visitor ban and a hygiene protocol on the farms.
A. "Most likely, the virus comes from people. After all, previously affected companies have all been culled. Some materials may have been moved with virus particles, but that is not allowed either. We are now investigating whether a person has indeed transmitted the virus. This is done on the basis of virus sequences, the sequence of the building blocks of the genetic material. We can deduce from this whether the infections can be linked or whether there is an infected employee. We need at least a week to figure that out."

Q. How did the contamination affect previously affected companies?
A. "Sometimes by employees, but there are also companies that have it together. In the latter case, it is difficult to find out exactly why. It could be because of displaced materials or people who have transferred the virus from one company to another. Since 28 May [2020], there has been a ban on transportation and no other people are allowed to enter the farms, so infected workers are more likely to be responsible. Although we are never sure whether everyone fully adheres to the rules. We are not there."

Q. The sector is not doing well, from 2024 it is forbidden to breed minks. Can there be intentional play?
A. "I dare not say anything about that. The suggestion is raised more often. But in the contacts I have with the entrepreneurs, I get the feeling that they are honest people. Many labor migrants work on the companies, who often also live close together. As long as the coronavirus is present in the population, I have no reason to believe that the infections are the result of wrong things."

Q. Shouldn't there be more measures then?
A. "There is something to be said for that. Working with protective equipment is still done on the basis of advice. There is no obligation on farms where there are no sick animals, (but) one can consider having it become mandatory. On the one hand, this means protecting people. On the other hand, (it may protect) animals as well, because an employee with mild or incipient symptoms can very well infect a mink."

[2] Denmark (North Jutland): mink, control measures mitigated
Date: Tue 7 Jul 2020

Mink holdings infected with corona [SARS-CoV-2] are no longer culled in Denmark. That is the decision of the Agriculture Ministry in Copenhagen.

Based on a new strategy, a series of preventive measures are being pursued, such as the obligation to use protective equipment on farms and the promulgation of hygiene guidelines. A council's order will come into effect in the course of this month [July 2020].

Minister Mogens Jensen believes that the measures can keep the infection pressure at a minimum level and keep the minks alive. However, it is still thoroughly checked that no minks can escape from the farms. The mink farmers must count the animals regularly to demonstrate that no animals have taken the step.

All approximately 1200 companies are also tested for corona. So far, 3 companies have been found to be infected. [Following the initial events], 125 mink companies have been sampled; no contamination has been discovered, to the relief of the sector.

[The low incidence of COVID-19 among mink in Denmark, allowing for the reported published mitigation in the control measures, may be indicative of a lower infection rate among the attending personnel. Indeed Denmark's updated official morbidity rate, totaling 2225 cases per million according to "Worldometer" (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries, update of 8 Jul 2020), is lower than the Dutch rate as indicated in the same source (2958 cases per million). Is such a difference sufficient to explain the gap in mink morbidity? Attributing the spread of COVID-19 in the Dutch mink farms to infected personnel is in need of additional evidence. Several potential factors were discussed in the commentary to item 1 above; a possible role of feral cats is yet to be definitely excluded.

According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, the infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the criteria of an emerging disease ("animal" is defined as "a mammal, reptile, bird, or bee"). Therefore, any case of infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 should be reported to the OIE in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and include information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information. Though minks are farmed and may be traded internationally, the Code does not address specific mink diseases.

The OIE Technical factsheet "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals" (last updated 3 Jul 2020) is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/A_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2.pdf. - Mod.AS
