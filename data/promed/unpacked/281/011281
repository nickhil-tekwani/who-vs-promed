The country press was informed by an inter-institutional commission of the
Government established today, Tuesday, said that the phenomenon of fish
dying on the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua, was not due to problems with "red
tide". The Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources
(MARENA) said in the areas where they had encountered the dead fish, the
temperature levels of the water were tolerable and stable.
The acidity marked a uniform pH, the water was not observed to be dirty or
turbid by foreign elements and a low velocity of wind was observed,
indicated the source [MARENA official] upon reflecting on the results of
the investigations performed by the commission.
Also the presence of "red tide" was ruled out because there is no evidence
of massive mortality of the fish, a notable fact when this problem arises.
Red tide is caused by a microorganism, mentioned the official source
[MARENA].
Weighing all [the factors], MARENA indicated that this investigation is
waiting for the results of the analysis of the Center of Investigations of
Water Resources (CIRA).
But [MARENA] declared to the population that the fish which are presently
marketed in the different centers of storage of the Pacific do not present
any symptomatology or sample of being affected by any type of disease which
puts the health of the consumers at risk.
The commission, which was integrated by personnel of four institutions of
the Government, signaled that no evidence of contamination by release of
hydrocarbons was observed, nor was fetidness of the waters perceived.
The commission said that the fishermen of the zone attributed the deaths of
the fish to a phenomenon which occurs every year during the month of May,
due to the warming of the waters, which decreases the volume of the fish.
The Nicaraguan press was informed several days ago about the appearance of
the fish deaths and deaths of other types of marine fauna occurring in
places like Tupilpa, La Boquita, Casares, Heuheute and Masapa, in the
Pacific Coast.

[There are few inconsistencies. Warming of the water may cause fish death
because of an increase in temperature or because of less oxygen
availability. However, with fish and other marine fauna being involved it
sounds as if there is something going on. If someone in the area has more
information we would appreciate it. - Mod.TG]
