Today (9 Dec [2020]), the First News reporter learned from the Office of Health Care in Linwei District, Weinan City, that there have recently been more cases of hemorrhagic fever in the district, causing harm to people's production, life, and health. In order to reduce the incidence of hemorrhagic fever and effectively control the occurrence of rodent-borne diseases, the Patriotic Health Office will carry out concentrated rodent-control activities in many places in Linwei District.

Rodent control range.
Linwei District Gushi, Xiandian, Xiajun, Guandao Town, Xiangyang Office Chengjia, Zhannan Office Hanma, and the city north of 310 National Road. Take the village as the center, and spread out within 50 m [164 ft] as the area where rodent poison is applied.

Precautions.
The rodenticide is the slow-acting rodenticide bromadiolone in poison bait. The color is red or pink wheat grains. Please take care of your children and look after poultry and livestock during the administration period to avoid accidental ingestion. If you encounter poisoning by accident, please use Vk1 to detoxify. [Vitamin K1 (VK1) is an antidote for the rodenticide that is being used. - Mod.TY] The reporter learned that the eradication service station is currently preparing poison bait, which is expected to be officially released next week [week of Mon 14 Dec 2020].

At the end of November this year [2020], Shaanxi Disease Control issued a reminder: October to March of the following year is the season for hemorrhagic fever in the Guanzhong area of our province. The disease has a rapid onset, severe symptoms, rapid progress, high costs, and many deaths. Be especially careful in December [2020].

1. What is hemorrhagic fever?
The hemorrhagic fever prevalent in [China] is an infectious disease with fever, hemorrhage, and kidney damage caused by hantavirus. The scientific name is hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The onset of hemorrhagic fever is acute, the clinical symptoms are severe, the harm is great, and the mortality rate is high. The source of infection is mainly wild mice, and the spread in Shaanxi is mainly spread by _Apodemus agrarius_.

2. How does hemorrhagic fever virus spread?
Hantavirus usually is harbored in rodents, including rodents, bats, shrews, and moles. These animals act as a source of infection and excrete the virus out of the body through excreta and secretions that are inhaled and spread by humans in the form of aerosols. In addition, it is spread through tick bites, direct ingestion of food contaminated with poisonous mouse excrement, and direct contact with damaged skin.

3. Clinical manifestations after infection
The early symptoms are similar to colds and can easily be mistaken for them. The main clinical manifestations include fever; congestion and redness in the face, neck, and chest (referred to as 3 reds); headache, and pain in the waist and orbits (referred to as 3 pains); and oliguria [low urine output, less than 400 mL/24 hr].

Symptoms of systemic infection:
- After an incubation period of 7-46 days after infection, the initial symptoms of a severe cold appear, that is, fever (up to 40 deg C [104 deg F], lasting for one week), general weakness, soreness, loss of appetite, but rarely chills.
- Signs of hyperemia [increased blood in the vessels of an organ or tissue] and bleeding: Within 2 days of onset of typical hemorrhagic fever, the 3 reds can appear, that is, flushing of the face, neck, and upper chest, resembling drunkenness. Bleeding can occur within 3 days of onset, manifested as oral and conjunctival hemorrhage, skin spots, patches, flocculent bleeding, bruises at skin lesions or needle insertion points, and organ bleeding in severe cases.
- Exudation [oozing] manifestations [can occur] within one week of onset, due to increased vascular permeability, plasma extravasation [leakage of fluids from the vein into the surrounding tissue], [and] blood volume reduction, resulting in hypotension [low blood pressure] and even shock. Plasma extravasation leads to edema of the brain, kidney, and conjunctiva. The typical person has 3 pains, namely headache, orbital pain, and low back pain.
- Kidney injury: It is a prominent clinical manifestation of hemorrhagic fever, with back pain, percussion pain in the kidney area, oliguria [abnormally small amounts of urine.] or even anuria [low urine output, less than 100 mL/24 hr], proteinuria [increased levels of protein in the urine], and hematuria [presence of blood cells in urine].

4. Population prevention
- Anti-rodent: Vigorously rectify the sanitation of the village and clear the breeding habitat of rodents.
- Vaccination of hemorrhagic fever for people over 16 years old in hemorrhagic fever epidemic areas.
- For large-scale construction in the field of hemorrhagic fever epidemic areas, local disease control agencies should be asked to conduct risk assessment, guide rodent control camps, and organize hemorrhagic fever vaccination.

5. Individual prevention
- When harvesting in the field, personal protection should be used. Wear gloves, long boots, long-sleeved clothes, and a mask when placing straw on the ground.
- Renovate the courtyard environment, and do not pile firewood in the courtyard; block the mouse holes and place poisonous bait to prevent wild rats from entering the house.
- Don't dig out mouse holes, don't grab mice with bare hands, prevent rodents or rodent lice biting, and avoid direct contact with rodents and their excrement (urine, feces).
- Put your food away to prevent rodent contamination, and do not eat food contaminated by rodents.
- When visiting patients with hemorrhagic fever, wear a mask to avoid contact with their blood, excreta, and clothing contaminated by them.
- Once symptoms such as fever, muscle soreness, and skin bleeding occur, you should go to the hospital in time.

[The above report indicates that there have been more cases of hemorrhagic fever in the district recently but does not indicate exactly when, how many cases, nor specifically what the etiological agent is. Although hantaviruses are mentioned, both Hantaan and Seoul viruses are endemic in China. The striped field mouse, _Apodemus agrarius_, is mentioned. It is a reservoir host for Hantaan virus. The brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the host of Seoul virus, is not mentioned. Both of these viruses can cause HFRS clinically in infected humans. It is curious that transmission via tick bites is mentioned, suggesting possible involvement of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus that is not a hantavirus and is endemic in China also.

Images of _Apodemus agrarius_ and _Rattus norvegicus_ can be seen at http://www.hlasek.com/foto/apodemus_agrarius_11035.jpg and http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg, respectively.

The rodent poison mentioned in this report, bromadiolone, works by preventing the body from recycling vitamin K, which is needed to clot blood. Once animals run out of vitamin K, they can bleed to death. It can take several days for the body's stores of vitamin K to be exhausted. Exposed animals may take several days to eventually die. People who have eaten bromadiolone have experienced symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, bloody urine, black tarry stools, and bruising. Other less commonly reported symptoms include headaches, sore throat, muscle aches, shortness of breath, abnormally heavy periods, and bloody mucus. Skin contact with bromadiolone can cause slight irritation. If it gets in the eyes, it can cause eye redness, swelling, and irritation (see http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/bromadgen.html). - Mod.TY
