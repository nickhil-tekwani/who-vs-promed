E. COLI STRIKES 28 CHILDREN IN DAY CARE: HUNDREDS TESTED FOR DISEASE
Public health officials are, according to this story, battling the biggest
outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in Calgary for two years, which has infected up
to 28 children at a southeast day care.
Norm Carlson, manager of the environmental health program for the Calgary
Regional Health Authority, was cited as saying that hundreds of kids, their
families and friends are being contacted and tested for the disease, adding
that four cases have been confirmed and 24 more are being investigated.
The story says that the day care involved has 70 children and 17 staff.
Day-care director Pauline Evans was cited as saying the first two cases
discovered were babies with bloody diarrhea whose doctors failed to
correctly diagnose the problem before it spread, adding, "The feeling is
that it has been brought in from outside," adding that to prevent further
spread of the bacteria, children who may be infected are being segregated.
[This pathogen can be spread by human-human contact in the childcare
milieu, either indirectly by workers or from child-to-child. The low
infectious dose (approximately 100-1000 CFU with > 30,000 CFU/g in stools)
requires better than normal sanitation procedures. -- RAL]
Dr. Julian Midgley, pediatric kidney specialist at Alberta Children's
Hospital was cited as saying that hospital emergency departments throughout
the city have been alerted to watch for the disease. Symptoms are bloody
diarrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting.
Carlson added that the first child became infected Nov. 10, although public
health officials weren't contacted until eight days later and that as new
cases are still coming to light, the "major concern is that the outbreak
could spread to other day cares or work sites where food is prepared. We
are still hearing of new cases, so we believe there may still be some
transmission."
The origin of the outbreak is unknown.
The last comparable outbreak was in 1996 when 23 cases were confirmed at a
southwest Calgary day care.
Prior to this outbreak, there have been 48 isolated cases of E. coli
confirmed in Calgary this year.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said there are between 800 and 2,400
cases of E. coli each year in Canada, although actual cases may be 10 to 30
times that number because few people ever see a doctor for diarrhea or
other flu-like symptoms.
