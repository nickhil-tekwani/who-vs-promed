With 2 more patients of Japanese encephalitis (JE) detected at Keshoraipatan town in Bundi district recently, the number of patients suffering from the disease has reached 3 in the district this year [2017], officials said on Wednesday [6 Dec 2017].

A rural woman of Keshoraipatan, age 30, had died of Japanese encephalitis at the Government Maharao Bhim Singh Hospital in Kota on 31 Oct [2017] [see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (24): (RJ) 20171113.5441846].

Giving information about the 2 new cases, Dr Ravi Prakash Mathur, additional director, rural health, Rajasthan, said that following the Keshoraipatan resident's death, a health department team was sent in the 1st half of November [2017] from Jaipur to assess the situation in Keshoraipatan region.

The team had collected larvae samples of _Culex_ mosquitoes, besides collecting blood samples of 6 human beings. "The blood samples of an 80-year-old and 35-year-old individual, along with other samples, were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, last month. Their reports have arrived now, and the 2 people have been tested positive for JE," he said.

While one has recovered now, one person has been referred to the Government Medical College in Kota for further treatment," he added.

Meanwhile, another team of the medical and health department visited Keshoraipatan and Arnetha regions of Bundi district on Tuesday [5 Dec 2017] and took samples of 6 people, including 4 people of Keshoraipatan and 2 people of Arnetha. The team also collected several larvae samples.

Mathur said that Japanese encephalitis usually spreads in the areas where flood irrigation happens. "Since Keshoraipatan is known for rice cultivation in canal fed agricultural fields, so it could be the reason for emergence of the disease in the area," he said. He said guidelines for surveillance and diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis have been issued to the local health officials in Bundi.

Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which primarily affects children and also elderly people above 60 years whose immunity remains low. "Most JE infections are characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and others," he said.

Japanese encephalitis is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species (mainly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_). The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds. There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis and has only supportive treatment, but there is an effective vaccine available to prevent the disease, said the doctor.

One of the affected people, who suffered from Japanese encephalitis, had to spend hours for hospital admission at the New Government Medical Hospital in Kota. "When I showed my father in OPD, doctors initially prescribed medicines for him instead of admitting him, but finally admitted him," alleged the man's son.

When confronted with the patient's complaint, the government hospital physician, Dr Manoj Saluja, said, "The patient did not exhibit any symptoms of JE, so he was not admitted initially, but since he was referred for diagnosis and tested positive for JE, he was admitted for observation for a day," he said.

[As noted in the previous post, Rajasthan state in northwestern India is far away from the usual Japanese encephalitis (JE) endemic areas in the northeast of the country, making these 3 cases geographically unusual. However, these may not be the 1st cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Rajasthan. A child was referred to J K Lon hospital from the Bansur area, Alwar and died on 15 Oct 2012. It is suspected that the child was suffering from viral encephalitis. He, along with 6 other children, were admitted to J K Lon hospital and were clinically suspected cases of viral encephalitis. Reports of laboratory tests were not provided, so they remain suspected JE cases. The earlier fatality and the 2 new ones are the 1st confirmed JE cases in Rajasthan that ProMED-mail has posted.
