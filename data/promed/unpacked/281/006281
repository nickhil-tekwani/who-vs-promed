Health authorities in Los Santos province have confirmed 6 new cases of hantavirus [infection] in one week, bringing a total of 61 cases in the region so far in 2018.

The authorities assure the public that these are expected case numbers given the increase in the [transmission] cycle of the disease.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in Los Santos province. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. However, Dr. Jan Clemens recently commented that Seoul hantavirus could also be present in Panama causing human infections. Appropriate laboratory tests would be required to differentiate Choclo and Seoul viruses. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces and saliva, the source of human infections. - Mod.TY

The authorities of the Ministry of Health in Coclé province confirmed that the death of a woman was caused by [a] hantavirus [infection].

[Video in Spanish transcribed and translated by Mod.TY]:
The Ministry of Health confirmed the death of a 27-year-old woman from [a] hantavirus infection the 1st this year [2018] in Coclé.

The Ministry of Health carried out an investigation in the residence and in her workplace. Sadly, the young woman's funeral was yesterday afternoon [12 Aug 2018] in the community. The Ministry of Health is continuing its investigations, dealing with a virus that is the most lethal in the region. She was hospitalized in the intensive care unit where she was diagnosed by the symptoms that she presented, and later tests were done locally that were positive for hantaviruses.

In these cases, the tests are always corroborated by tests done in the Gorgas Memorial Institute for definitive results from the patient's [samples].

The Ministry of Health will look for additional infections in the residences and workplace of the young woman. However, the 1st infection may have occurred in the work area of the young woman in a company that met the [hygiene] requirements. The investigations are continuing to determine where she might have acquired the hantavirus infection. The woman left behind 7- and 9-year-old children.

[Coclé province is north and east of Los Santos province. The 2 provinces are separated by Herrera province.

Cases of hantavirus infections occur frequently in this general area. Readers may wish to view the video. Although the dialogue is in Spanish, there are scenes of the area around the residence and general area that may be of interest and provide an idea of the ecological situation related to this case.
