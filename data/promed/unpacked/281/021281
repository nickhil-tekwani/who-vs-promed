HEMORRHAGIC FEVER WITH RENAL SYNDROME - CROATIA: CORRECTION
***********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Correction: for _Addionomys glareolus_ read _Clethrionomys glareolus_
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the ProMED-mail post entitled "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome -
Croatia", concerning the various hantaviruses in the Balkans, an error
occurred in the transmission of the original message. A species named
_Addionomys glareolus_ was cited as the main vertebrate reservoir host for
hantaviruses in Croatia. This is incorrect. No such species exists.
The text (and commentary) should have read _Clethrionomys glareolus_. The
species _Clethrionomys glareolus_ is an important reservoir host for
hantaviruses in Europe.
