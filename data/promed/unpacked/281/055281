An age-old French sausage-making tradition looked set to change after the
government said it would ban cow intestines from food because of fears it
might transmit [the etiologic agent of mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy) to humans.
French Farm Minister Jean Glavany said the government had decided to accept
the opinion of French food safety agency AFSSA that cattle intestine posed
a risk of transmitting to humans the fatal brain-wasting disease known as
BSE. The decision would come nearly a year after AFSSA first recommended a
ban on cow intestines due to concerns over BSE.
Glavany said the ban would affect processed meat products using cow
intestine as an envelope. He cited andouillette, a traditional short, fat
sausage made from entrails, and large sausages as among those affected by
the ban.
The minister said it would be possible to continue to make these products
either by using synthetic intestine, by importing intestine from countries
not affected by BSE -- such as those in Latin America 足 or by using pig or
sheep intestine. This raised the issue of banning cow intestines from
countries having BSE.
The French charcuterie, or processed meats, federation said the ban would
affect some 70 companies producing 15 000 tons, or 1.5 billion French
francs' ($199.5 million) worth, of food each year using the targeted
ingredients.
Gerard Le Tyrant, the federation's head, said it would ask the government
to postpone the measure for several months while its members sought
solutions to the ban. While he admitted that pig intestine could replace
cow intestine in most products, he said 4 or 5 French companies may be put
out of business because they had no alternative to using cow intestine. He
explained these companies used veal intestine to produce delicacies such as
Lyon-style andouillette. "These traditions date back to the Middle Ages --
they're as old as France itself," Le Tyrant told Reuters. "Products that
are representative of French gastronomy are simply going to disappear."
The minister also said the ban was designed to protect consumer safety and
the government would revisit the issue depending on how France's own BSE
epidemic evolved. "It (BSE) is still with us and is growing steadily, and
we should take all the precautions scientists recommend until this epidemic
begins to drop," he said.
The farm ministry reported on Tuesday that the number of French cases of
BSE had more than doubled to 62 this year from 30 last year.
BSE is believed to spread to people by infected food products, emerging as
a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD). Around 70 people in
Britain and 2 in France have died from nvCJD.

French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany stressed his commitment to a ban
on British beef imports in order to prevent BSE from spreading. "The more
time passes, the more arguments support our decision" not to lift the ban,
Glavany said. The French food safety agency advised against ending the
embargo in October last year stating there could still be a risk of beef
carrying BSE.
As a result of the ban "French cattle is a thousand times less affected" by
BSE than their British counterparts, Glavany said, adding 90 other non
EU-countries held on to the embargo as well.
The European Commission ruled in August last year to lift the worldwide ban
in place since 1996, leading to compliance by all European Union member
states with the exception of France.
Earlier today the French government said it discovered 2 new cases of BSE
in the country, raising to 62 the number of infected animals found this year.
The cows were slaughtered and burned, along with 156 others from herds they
had been in contact with, in accordance with health regulations, the
Agriculture Ministry said.
The cows, born in 1995 and 1996, were probably infected by contaminated
animal-based feeds, according to a group formed to monitor BSE.
European Union countries introduced more stringent food measures in 1996 on
concern they contained the BSE agent, which may cause a fatal brain disease
in humans.

A total of 7 new cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease have been discovered in France, 5 of which were detected as part of
a test program launched in June involving the examination of cows that die
in strange circumstances.

A total of 9 new cases of BSE have been detected in western France, the
Agriculture Ministry said.
The new cases bring to 71 the number of cases of BSE detected in the
country since the beginning of the year. Some 31 cases were detected in
1999. The ailing animals and their herds were slaughtered in keeping with
French policy, the ministry said.
Officials have stepped up routine checks of herds throughout France as part
of a broadened plan to help root out the disease. New cases of the ailment
are expected to appear in France until 2002, 5 years after authorities took
stringent measures to prevent more outbreaks.
