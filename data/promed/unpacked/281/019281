Bangladesh authorities said on Sunday [19 Oct 2008] they have
detected fresh bird flu at a poultry farm 4 months after the deadly
virus was last reported in the country.

Livestock department spokesman Salahuddin Khan said at least 300
birds were destroyed in a farm in the northern Naogaon district last
week after the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza was detected.

"We have already taken extra surveillance measures across the
country," he said. "Farmers have been told to step up bio-security."

Mr Khan said the outbreak was the 1st in 4 months, with the virus
becoming dormant at the onset of the summer but now coming back ahead
of the cold season.

Officials said the outbreak was a warning for the country's USD 1.5
billion poultry industry.

Bangladesh was hit by bird flu in February 2007, and the virus made
another comeback in January this year [2008].

At the outbreak's peak, some 50 of the country's 64 districts were
affected, and more than a million birds were slaughtered.

Bangladesh's poultry industry is one of the world's largest,
producing 220 million chickens and 37 million ducks annually.

Industry officials said the bird flu outbreak at its peak early this
year [2008] led to closure of 40 per cent of the nation's poultry
farms and left half a million workers jobless.

The country also reported its 1st confirmed case of human bird flu in
May 2008, but the government said the 16-month-old baby who
contracted the virus had recovered.

[The HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Bangladesh started, reportedly, on 5 Feb
2007 and has been continuous since. The initial immediate
notification to the OIE was submitted on 30 Mar 2007. Since then, 286
outbreaks have been reported in the 7 follow-up reports, of which the
most recent was submitted on 11 Jun 2008. To see all reports, as well

Preliminary testing of a dead house crow found in Sham Shui Po has
indicated a suspected case of H5 avian influenza, a spokesman for the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said today
[17 Oct 2008], adding that further confirmatory tests were being conducted.

The carcass was found and collected on 15 Oct 2008 at the refuse
collection chamber in Sham Shui Po Park.

"In view of this case, the AFCD has phoned poultry farmers reminding
them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against
avian influenza. Letters have been issued to farmers, pet bird shop
owners, license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding
them that proper precautions must be taken," the spokesman said.

The spokesman said that the department would conduct frequent
inspections of poultry farms, the wholesale market and the Yuen Po
Street Bird Garden to ensure that proper precautions against avian
influenza had been implemented. The department would continue its
wild bird monitoring and surveillance.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to
be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry
stalls. It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.

The Department of Health will enhance health education and distribute
health advice leaflets.

The Leisure and Cultural Services Department has reminded all of its
park staff to remain vigilant and step up precautionary measures
including regular cleaning and disinfection.

AFCD, FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department and the Police will
strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong
Kong to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks brought by
imported poultry and birds that had not gone through inspection and quarantine.

The spokesman said the threat of avian influenza remained. The
relevant departments will remain vigilant and continue to take
preventive and control measures against avian influenza.

Members of the public are reminded to observe good personal hygiene.
They should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry
and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after
coming into contact with them. Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly
cooked before consumption.

[Hong Kong was the site of the very 1st case of human infection with
HPAI H5N1 in August 1997. Since then, the HK government has been
applying the following exemplary measures to reduce the risk of
infection spreading from poultry to humans:

(a) vaccination of chickens in local farms and imported chickens;
(b) regulation of local farms including tightened biosecurity
measures (for example, all farms should be [wild] birdproof);
(c) import control (for instance, imported chickens must come from
registered farms with health certificates);
(d) segregation policy (no waterfowl, which are natural carriers of
avian influenza viruses, can be sold in retail outlets);
(e) market rest days to break the virus cycle and reduce the viral load;
(f) hygiene requirements on wholesale market and retail outlets; and
(g) surveillance targeted at humans, poultry and wild birds to ensure
timely detection of the presence of any avian influenza viruses in
our environment.

The said measures and additional background information are described
in the document "Hong Kong's preparedness for influenza pandemic -
Prevention and Protection" updated July 2007, which is available at
