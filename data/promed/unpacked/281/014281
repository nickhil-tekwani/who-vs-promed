Alarming outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Guangxi
-------------------------------------------------------------
An especially virulent form of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), is
spreading quickly in Quanzhou County of Guangxi Autonomous Region, a local
official told Chinese Youth Daily. According to official data as of 15 Apr
2010, 13 small children have died of this disease, and 643 children have
been affected by it. Quanzhou County is the hardest-hit area in the region.

"A child can look perfectly healthy one minute and totally different the
next, and will begin to deteriorate faster than a 100-metre race. This
differs from our past experience with HFMD greatly," a medical worker from
the Quanzhou County People's Hospital told the Beijing News. It was
discovered that the virus mostly attacks small children under 3 years, and
kills them in half an hour to 7 hours.

According to China Youth Daily, in December 2009, a 21 month old child from
Kumatian Village of Jiaojiang Township in Quanzhou County suddenly
developed a rash on his body, followed by high fever a month later and
diarrhea that lasted a whole day. But the family did not take it too
seriously. On 25 Jan 2010, the toddler's face suddenly turned blue and a
rash appeared behind his knees as well as on his tongue. The family
immediately sent him to the Quanzhou County Maternal and Child Care Service
Center, but he died despite 3 hours of emergency treatment.

The Beijing News reported several cases of death of small children due to
the mutated virus. On 10 Mar 2010, a toddler boy from Daxijiang Township
died in the Quanzhou County People's Hospital with blood and some foam
coming out of his mouth. The outbreak of his symptoms had only begun 3 days
before. "Constant fever quickly resulted in failure of his vital organs,
such as his heart and lungs," recalled a doctor who had participated in the
emergency treatment. The child's death made every doctor in the hospital
wonder what virus could have claimed his life so quickly.

On 4 Mar 2010, a 7 month old boy died in the County Hospital with suspected
HFMD. On 6 Apr 2010, a toddler boy from Longyan Village of Quanzhou County
died of the same disease. It was not until the Guangxi Autonomous Region
Disease Control Center had sent an inspection report that people began to
realize the killer virus was EV71 [enterovirus 71], a mutated form of the
HFMD virus. [Enterovirus 71 is one of several types of enterovirus that may
be associated with outbreaks of HFMD. It is not a "mutated form". The
enterovirus principally associated with hand, foot and mouth diseases are
coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71; taxonomically viruses are members of
the same virus species _Human enterovirus A_. - Mod.CP]

On 10 Apr 2010, a 2 year old male toddler died in the Quanzhou County
People's Hospital. Prior to his death, he had a fever, blood, and foam
coming from his mouth, and fading breath.

Wang Qun, head of the outpatient department in the Affiliated Hospital of
Guilin Medical School, said, "EV71 attacks vital organs such as the heart
and lungs as soon as it enters the human body. The outbreak is fast, and
the death rate for critically ill patients can be as high as 80 per cent,"
according to a Beijing News report.

In the past, HFMD patients developed noticeable rashes on the hands, feet
and mouth areas. The symptoms were mild and the death rate was low.
Patients with EV71 infection hardly develop any rashes on the body, [this]
outbreak is acute, and the death rate is high. The head of Quanzhou County
Disease Control Center, Fang Tianxi, told The Beijing News, "EV 71 has
never been seen in Quanzhou Country before. It has caught the disease
control departments off guard."

A management [spokesperson] from the Quanzhou County Maternal and Child
Care Service Center told The Epoch Times that it is now the peak season for
HFMD, and things are much worse this year than in previous years. He said
the insidious virus is easily passed among children without being noticed.
Mild symptoms of this disease look a lot like those of a simple cold.
However, if a child develops a fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius (101.3 F) and
above, the child should be taken to see a doctor. At present, there is only
one hospital dedicated to treating HFMD in Quanzhou County.

[HFMD is caused by several different viruses classified in the genus _Human
enterovirus A_ of the family _Picornaviridae_. Coxsackievirus A16 has been
the most common cause of HFMD in the United States and some other
countries, but other coxsackieviruses and enteroviruses have been
associated with the illness. Recently, human enterovirus 71 has also been
associated with HFMD outbreaks in South East Asia.

Although most HFMD infections do not result in serious complications,
outbreaks caused by enterovirus 71 have been associated with a high rate of
neurological complications, including meningoencephalitis, pulmonary
complications, and possibly death. Haemorrhage as described above has been
rare. Transmission is usually by the fecal-oral or by the respiratory
route, when there is an associated respiratory illness. The virus may be
excreted in the stool for many weeks.

Transmission of enterovirus infections is increased by poor hygiene and
overcrowded living conditions. Improved sanitation and general hygiene are
important preventive measures. (For more information see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs174/en>). In the absence of
quantitative data it is difficult to know if Guangxi outbreak is more
severe than usual, or is compounded by co-infections.
