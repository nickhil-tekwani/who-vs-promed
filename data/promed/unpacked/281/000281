An investigation is under way to find the cause of a "disappointing" bovine TB outbreak in 3 herds at Mt Cargill, on the outskirts of Dunedin.

Earlier [in 2015], the number of infected cattle herds in Otago was officially zero, although there were 2 infected deer herds in Central Otago.

Yesterday [4 Dec 2015], Ospri South Island relationships manager Danny Templeman said all possible sources of the infectious disease were being explored and measures introduced to reduce the risk to cattle and deer herds in the area.

Slaughter and routine TB testing identified the 3 herds, which were understood to comprise both cattle and deer.

Possums and ferrets were the main carriers of the disease.

As well as investigating the source of the infection, Ospri was taking "immediate action" to manage and control the disease on the properties, Mr Templeman said.

An initial possum control operation was due to begin next week and the public were asked to heed warning signs if they were in the area. Possum carcasses would be recovered and autopsies performed to help determine the source of the disease. It was important to get the possum surveillance completed quickly to provide information to herd owners in the area.

Mr Templeman would not comment on the specific details of the herds. Further information on the herds was being gathered and on the disease status of wildlife surrounding the properties.

Since the disease hit high levels in the 1990s, a huge effort has been put into controlling it, with about USD 1.2 billion spent over the past 15 years.

In 1998, there were 306 infected herds in Otago and 1700 nationally. The national infected herds figure earlier [in 2015] was 41.

Mr Templeman said the potential for TB infection was not unexpected, although the latest confirmation of the disease was "certainly disappointing.".

Ospri's TBfree programme would be doing its best to control the outbreak and make sure infected herd numbers were reduced. It was probably a good reminder the disease was still present and everyone needed to remain vigilant, he said.

TBfree Otago committee chairman Ross Wilson, of Omakau, said an infected herd placed stress on the owner, with financial costs and disruptions to farm-management routines, often for a year or more while the disease was eliminated from the herd.

"It is never pleasant to find TB in your herd and this case is a reminder that the disease still poses a threat to farmed cattle and deer in the region," Mr Wilson said.

There was always the likelihood that it could be found and it was disappointing that it was in "one little area," he said.

Where the risk of TB infection was particularly high, movement-control areas were in place to ensure certain conditions, such as pre-movement testing, were met before stock is moved.

The latest infected herds were found just outside a movement-control area, he said.

[Indeed it is always sad for the owner, and even for those officials charged with regulating the disease.

The possum in New Zealand is a resident carrier of the disease, as is the badger in the UK.

Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a slow insidious disease that can have a nasty grip on a herd before it is ever located.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.

Although the disease (TB) is transmissible from animals to humans, the risk of infection is likely small. The responsible bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted by close contact with the animals. Practically speaking, the producer and family, the veterinarian, the cattle dealers and slaughterhouse workers are most at risk. A consumer can become infected just by drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in a process that the bacteria will not survive.

Also most places have a meat inspection process to prevent diseased or suspect diseased animals from entering the human food chain.

The investigation will likely involve tracing where animals have come from to be in the herd, or where animals may have gone if any have been sold, as well as testing the herd. This investigation likely has a wildlife component to it as well. Testing of the possums and the deer will also be involved. - Mod.TG
