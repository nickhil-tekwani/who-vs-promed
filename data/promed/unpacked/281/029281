Katsina health authorities have begun vaccinating 150 000 people in the council area of Danja in the wake of a recent outbreak of yellow fever. The campaign in reaction to the outbreak is expected to protect some 154 131 people, ages 9 months to 45 years.

Underway since last week [week of 6 Aug 2018], the campaign is expected to conclude by [Sat 18 Aug 2018]. It comes after the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy by 2026, launched in April [2018] by the World Health Organisation in Abuja.

Outbreaks of the viral fever, which causes bleeding, have been confirmed in 22 council areas across 11 states since September last year [2017]. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has reported some 2400 suspected cases of yellow fever, and 47 people have been peopled [?died].

"The campaign in Katsina is a reactive vaccination in response to a confirmed yellow fever case," said WHO country representative Wondimagegnehu Alemu. "With one single injection, we can provide lifelong immunity against this disease at a cost of approximately USD 1."

WHO pledged to donate 12 million yellow fever vaccines in 2018 and another 19 million next year [2019] to deal with challenges of sustaining supply to reach at-risk populations. Some of the 12 million will be used in Danja. Katsina brings to 10 the total number of states -- alongside camps for displaced people in Borno -- where campaigns have been on against yellow fever.

Mass vaccination campaigns get underway in early November [2018] in Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger, FCT, Plateau, and Borno states in a 2nd phase of the EYE strategy in efforts to vaccinate 25 million citizens by the end of 2018.

[Yellow fever has been active in Nigeria this year [2018], and a proactive vaccination effort would help to prevent a repeat of the outbreak. A yellow fever outbreak was active in Nigeria earlier in the year. A 3 Jun 2018 Nigeria CDC report indicated that confirmed cases were recorded in 10 states (Kwara, Kogi, Kano, Zamfara, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Niger, Katsina, Edo, and Ekiti) in 21 local government areas (LGAs). Of the 1724 samples collected, 108 (6.3 percent) tested positive for yellow fever (presumptive positives) with 16 (0.9 percent) inconclusive results in 6 Nigerian laboratories. The total number of deaths in all cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed cases) was 47 (see ProMED-mail Yellow fever - Africa (09): Nigeria 20180612.5853254).
