New Zealand scientists are hoping to get permission to unleash a new virus on rabbits which could reduce their numbers by 30 per cent. A new Korean strain of the lethal calicivirus called K5, which causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease, has been tested in Australia and is likely to be approved for use there later this year [2016]. Landcare Research scientists say they are hoping to get the go-ahead from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and the Environment Protection Authority for a New Zealand release in autumn 2017.

Rabbits are a major problem in New Zealand, causing damage to farmland and conservation areas. There are millions of them, and one female can have 45 babies a year. The Te Ara website says 10 rabbits eat as much feed as a 55 kilogram ewe. In 1880, the owner of Earnscleugh Station reckoned his run was infested with over 400 000 rabbits, equivalent to more than 66 000 sheep.

Calicivirus was 1st introduced into New Zealand in 1997 when South Island farmers illegally imported it from Australia. Frustrated that the government rejected introduction of the virus, they then used a novel method of spreading it faster. They collected the liver, heart and lungs from rabbits that had died from the virus, minced them in kitchen blenders, covered bait with the diluted slurry and spread it over their farms. Although it killed a huge proportion of the population initially, rabbits have largely become immune to it.

Landcare Research scientist Dr Janine Duckworth said that between 60 to 90 per cent of rabbits (depending on the region) died from the 1st introduction. However, now, again depending on the region, between 40 and 90 per cent of rabbits have gained immunity. She believes the 1st introduction may have been more successful if it had been more controlled and not used the "cocktail" method employed by the farmers.

She warned farmers against trying to import the new strain, as they did in 1997. "We don't want an illegal release of the K5 strain. We want to ensure that control agencies use a commercially-prepared product, free from any unwanted viruses and that the timing and method of release is managed to ensure the best possible rabbit control outcomes for farmers."

Duckworth cautioned that K5 was not a "silver bullet" to New Zealand's rabbit problem. "It's hard to imagine there will ever be a silver bullet to eradicate rabbits," she said. While K5 is expected to make a dent in rabbit numbers, Duckworth does not believe it would make as big an impact as RHD did when it was 1st introduced. The K5 strain will be a boost to rabbit control by killing some of the immune rabbits.

Rabbit numbers have surged this year [2016] because of the fine summer. The largest concentrations are in Canterbury and Otago, where the dry conditions suit them. They do not do as well in the wetter North Island or West Coast. A vaccine is available for owners of domestic rabbits to protect their pets from the virus.

[European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) are invasive animals, which -- as in New Zealand -- have also caused large scale economic and environmental damage in Australia. They have a wide range of impacts including competing with livestock for pasture and decimating food crops. The rabbit population is substantial in many areas of Tasmania, particularly in and around urban areas.

Biosecurity Tasmania uses rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), also known as rabbit calicivirus of the genus _Lagovirus_, that causes rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in adult European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) to undertake localized rabbit control where rabbit numbers are causing significant environmental impacts and the use of other control methods by landowners is not suitable.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a viral disease which only affects European rabbits. The virus probably originated from a less virulent form present in natural rabbit populations for many years. It was first reported in China in 1984 and soon after in other countries in Asia and Europe and in Mexico.

All pathogenic strains are classified within one single serotype, but 2 subtypes are recognized, RHDV and RHDVa. RHD causes high mortality in both domestic and wild adult animals, with individuals succumbing between 48-72 hours post-infection. No other species has been reported to be fatally susceptible to RHD. The disease is characterized by acute necrotizing hepatitis, but hemorrhages may also be found in other organs, in particular the lungs, heart, and kidneys due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Resistance to the disease might be explained in part by genetically determined absence or weak expression of attachment factors, but humoral immunity is also important.

The virus was introduced to Australia in 1995 and Tasmania in 1997. Since then it has since spread throughout most of the country, mainly by natural spread.

A new naturally occurring RHDV variant from Korea (RHDV K5) has recently been identified by researchers and is currently undergoing assessment by Australian regulators. There is no mention of RHDV K5 as having any relationship to the strain A mentioned above.

Biosecurity Tasmania, a branch of the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) intends to undertake the controlled release of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), also known as rabbit calicivirus, for population control of rabbits at numerous sites throughout Tasmania, starting from March 2016. The release program should be completed by the end of June 2016.

Specific sites for the release of the virus are currently being assessed, and when locations are confirmed details will be published on the Biosecurity Tasmania section of the DPIPWE web site.

The announcement of release dates for the new strain of the RHDV K5 has been delayed, pending final approvals for the use of the new strain in Australia and finalisation of the most optimal date of release to ensure maximum effectiveness of the new strain. This release date may vary between the different Australian state and territory jurisdictions based on a range of factors that will vary between the geographical locations and on the ground conditions.

It should be noted that there is no treatment for RHDV, and none for RHDV K5 either.
