Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced a new round of tight restrictions in a bid to stem a surge in coronavirus infections, extending curfews to weeknights and imposing a full lockdown during the weekend. After only reporting symptomatic cases for 4 months, Turkey last week [week of 23 Nov 2020] resumed reporting all positive COVID-19 cases that saw logged daily infections jump to about 30 000.

On Monday [30 Nov 2020], the number of daily new cases reached a record high of 31 219, while the COVID-19 death toll hit a record high for an 8th consecutive day, with 188 fatalities in the last 24 hours, according to figures from the health ministry.

Speaking after a cabinet meeting on Monday [30 Nov 2020], Erdogan said a curfew would be implemented on weekdays between 9pm and 5am. He also announced total weekend lockdowns from 9pm on Friday evenings to 5am on Monday. Grocery stores and food delivery services will be exempt from the lockdowns within certain hours.

In addition, people older than 65 or younger than 20 will no longer be permitted to use public transportation and shoppers would have to use a contact tracing code. Meanwhile, a maximum of 30 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals while New Year's Eve public celebrations will be cancelled.

The new measures are scheduled to begin starting from Tuesday [1 Dec 2020].

Weekend night-time curfews introduced on [20 Nov 2020] have done little to curb people's movements, with Turkish media showing packed public spaces.

The health ministry announced on Monday [30 Nov 2020] that the number of infections in the country of 83 million people had exceeded 500 000. The total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic stood at 13 746. The Turkish Medical Association (TTB) doubted the government's figures, however, and estimated that there must be at least 50 000 new cases daily. The association also warned on Monday [30 Nov 2020] that state hospitals are at capacity, contradicting government statements that 70 percent of intensive care beds are occupied.

[In recent days the reported number of cases from Turkey have increased markedly -- and additional 30 000 daily beginning 26 Nov 2020 (as per Worldometer data). Calculating the comparative 7-day averages as of 29 Nov 2020, there has been a 374% increase in reported cases... but remembering that the decision was made to count positive tests, thereby including pre-symptomatic cases as well as asymptomatic infections. The government has decided to impose stricter restrictions in response to increasing hospital occupancies combined with the increase in confirmed infections. A difficult decision, but an attempt to flatten the curve so hospitals aren't overwhelmed. These are difficult times. - Mod.MPP]

In a global analysis of where SARS-CoV-2 transmission takes place, households show the highest transmission rates.

The report, from the Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team in collaboration with multiple partners also revealed that:

- The chance of an asymptomatic infected person infecting a close contact was 3.5% (95% CI: 0.0%-6.4%), which was approximately a quarter of the 12.8% (95% CI: 8.9%-16.7%) chance for symptomatic infected person infecting a close contact.

- Households show the highest transmission rates among indoor settings compared to other settings such as social gatherings, travel, healthcare, workplace, and casual close contacts.

- Prolonged contact in households and in settings with familiar close contacts increases the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

- The chance of one household member infecting another is significantly higher when the duration of household exposure is more than 5 days compared to 5 days or less, according to the report.

- Chance of passing on infection in households (the secondary attack rate) estimated to be 21.1% (95% CI: 17.4%-24.8%).

- The average number of people one infected person will infect in the household (the reproduction number) estimated to be 0.96 (95% CI: 0.67-1.32)

The research team conducted a systematic review to estimate the secondary attack rate SAR (probability of onward infection from one infected individual among a defined group of close contacts such as a family group), and the observed reproduction number Robs (the observed average number of secondary cases per index case). The report identified 97 studies, 45 of which met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis.

Understanding where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 takes place is critical to effectively targeting interventions, but evidence of transmission rates in different settings remains limited.

After analysing data from a number of settings including households, social gatherings with friends and family, travel, healthcare, workplace, and casual close contacts (such as strangers during shopping at a supermarket), researchers found that households show the highest transmission rates with a 21.1% (95% CI: 17.4%-24.8%) pooled secondary attack rate and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.67-1.32) pooled observed reproduction number.

The team also find that the chance of one household member infecting another is significantly higher when the duration of household exposure is more than 5 days compared to 5 days or less.

The researchers also point out that the majority of studies included in the pooled analysis came from China, where strict control policies were implemented which could limit the generalisability of estimates.

Infection risk from friends and family
--------------------------------------
Secondary attack rates related to familiar and prolonged close contacts were higher (such as social events with family and friends, 5.9% (95% CI: 3.8%-8.1%) than those related to low-risk casual contacts (such as strangers, 1.2%, 95% CI: 0.3%-2.1%). In addition, where the initial case was asymptomatic, the secondary attack rate was estimated to be two thirds lower (3.5%, 95% CI: 0.0%-6.4%) than when the index case had symptoms (12.8%, 95% CI: 8.9%-16.7%, p = <0.001).

The research team looked for differences in transmission by age; there was moderate evidence of less transmission occurring both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, but insufficient data to determine whether this held in other settings. Prolonged contact in households and in settings with familiar close contacts increases the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by symptom status of index cases (that is, whether someone is symptomatic or asymptomatic) and the potential for differing transmissibility by age, has important implications for outbreak control strategies -- such as contact tracing, testing, and rapid isolation of cases.

Contact tracing and testing crucial
-----------------------------------
Researchers note there were limited data reporting transmission in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in these settings.

Hayley Thompson, report author from Imperial College London said:
"Until the widespread deployment of an efficacious SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, governments around the world are faced with the challenge of balancing the social and economic harms caused by restrictive lockdown policies against the resurgence of cases.

Our review examines differences in transmission potential by contact type, setting, and index case characteristics, to help inform how public health interventions can be better targeted in the coming months. With many countries continuing to recommend "stay-at-home" measures, the upcoming festive season and with cases isolating inside households, our results show it is likely that this location will continue to be important in sustaining transmission.

The differences we observed in transmissibility by symptom status of index cases and duration of exposure have important implications for outbreak control strategies, highlighting how contact tracing, testing, and rapid isolation of cases will be crucial. Notably the number of studies we identified from large scale contract tracing studies was limited and highlights the need for continued research into further understanding the locations and types of contact that facilitate transmission, especially in schools and workplaces."

Andria Mousa, report author from Imperial College London said:
"Understanding the conditions where transmission is more likely to occur is essential in guiding policy interventions to reduce transmission whilst balancing the economic impact. In our report we systematically explore factors that affect transmission, such as age, setting and duration of contact. Our results highlight the importance of targeting interventions in settings where close and prolonged contacts occur, as well as the need for further research to inform policies for reducing transmission in workplaces, schools and care-homes."

Professor Neil Ferguson, report author from Imperial College London added: "This analysis provides some of the 1st evidence that asymptomatic infections are substantially less infectious than symptomatic cases. It also reinforces growing evidence of the importance of household transmission, especially in the context where symptomatic cases are not isolated outside the home."

Summary
-------
"Since the end of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly across the world. Understanding the drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial for disease control policies but evidence of transmission rates in different settings remains limited. We conducted a systematic review to estimate the secondary attack rate (SAR) and observed reproduction number (Robs) in different settings and to explore differences by age, symptom status, duration of exposure and household size. A total of 97 studies were identified, 45 of which met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Households showed the highest transmission rates, with pooled SAR and Robs estimates of 21.1% (95% CI: 17.4%-24.8%) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.67-1.32), respectively. Household SAR estimates were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of 5 days or less. Attack rates related to familiar and prolonged close contacts, such as social events with family and friends were higher than those related to low-risk casual contacts, such as strangers (SAR of 5.9%, 95% CI: 3.8%-8.1% vs. 1.2%, 95% CI: 0.3%-2.1%). Estimates of SAR for asymptomatic index cases were approximately 2/3 of those for symptomatic index (3.5% vs. 12.8%, p less than 0.001). We find moderate evidence for less transmission both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, but this difference is less evident when examining all settings. Prolonged contact in households and in settings with familiar close contacts increases the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by symptom status of index cases and the potential for age-dependent effects has important implications for outbreak control strategies such as contact tracing, testing, and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to allow exploration of transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings."

As I was reading the study I was struck by the absence of focus on superspreading events that have been described as around 20% of cases are responsible for 80% of transmission. The authors do mention this in their discussion section: "Therefore, characterising this overdispersion, or the potential for 'super spreading events' will be critical for further informing where to direct contact tracing efforts moving forwards. Early evidence suggests that transmission is overdispersed with around 19% of cases resulting in 80% of transmission in Hong Kong [77] and modelling studies based on reported global cluster sizes which suggested that as few as 10% of cases could account for 80% of all SARS-CoV-2 transmission [78]. The large cluster outbreaks identified in this review tend to be reported in indoor social or workplace settings potentially highlighting these locations as facilitating super-spreading events [79]."

Further studies focused on the overdispersion seen with superspreading events seem indicated as a means of approaching contact tracing with limited resources. In COVID-19 update (422): obesity & severity, cluster busting, WHO, global 20201002.7830244 there a discussion on cluster busting strategy worth re-reading. The challenges of trying to contain a pathogen that doesn't follow the rules....

The authors conclude with: "In conclusion, early data suggest that transmission is highest in locations in which sustained and prolonged contacts are made -- including households, and other residential locations. However, substantial onward transmission also appears to occur in social interactions with sustained duration of contacts such as family meals, celebrations, and religious gatherings. Further research on transmission in these settings, as well as in schools and workplaces and age-dependent effects in all these settings, in which there are limited data to date, is urgently required to continue to inform transmission reduction strategies." Given the holiday season in the USA that began last Thursday (26 Nov 2020 -- Thanksgiving Day) and the upcoming holiday seasons in many countries of the world, the findings of this study and of the possibilities of overdispersion will be tested. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added).

Data by country, area, or territory for 30 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov30_1606767528.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 47.4% of daily case numbers and 38.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 26.4 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Panama, Chile, and Ecuador. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Dominican Republic, and Paraguay. Costa Rica did not report any newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 33.3% of daily case numbers and 41.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 18.6 million. Countries not reporting cases today (30 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden, Kazakhstan, and Norway, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Russia, Italy, UK, Poland, and Germany. There are 19 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.9% of daily case numbers and 9.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.08 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing highs above 10 000, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Iraq, Tunisia, Lebanon, UAE, and Libya. Sudan and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.79% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.50 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Uganda, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mali and Reunion. Algeria did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 0.77% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.88 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, China, Guam, and Mongolia.

- The South East Asia region reported 10.1% of the daily newly reported cases and 9.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.7 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours, even with reduced reports over the weekend. At the country level, Japan is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy and Russia are dominant in the European region. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (169 466), Turkey (31 219), India (31 179), and Russia (26 338) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8693 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (29-30 Nov 2020). Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Sweden and Bolivia among others.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include the USA, Turkey, India, Russia, Brazil (21 538), Spain (18 753), Italy (16 376), Germany (14 156), Iran (13 321), and UK (12 330). A total of 54 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 64 on Fri 27 Nov 2020); 27 of the 54 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days (581 660) and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 2.3%, while daily reported deaths (10 266) have increased by 3.0%. The USA has decreased both newly confirmed cases (-7.8%) and reported deaths (-3.5%) which may still be a function of the weekend decreased reporting. The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 163 242 and newly reported deaths is 1521.

Impression: The countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. - Mod.MPP]
