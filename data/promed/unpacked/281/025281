Because babies are not routinely screened for syphilis, health officials are asking OB-GYNs to test pregnant women for the disease. The births of 6 babies with syphilis this year [2014] signals a bigger problem in Franklin County [Ohio, USA] and a lost chance to treat infected pregnant women and save babies' lives, health officials say.

In a normal year, Columbus Public Health learns of a baby or 2 born with the bacterial infection, said Makeda Porter, prevention-services manager [Columbus is the county seat of Franklin County].

Syphilis is passed from mother to baby and can lead to stillbirth and prematurity. Babies born with an infection can have neurological problems and bone damage. If left untreated, children can lose their hearing and vision. "In the developing world, it's a major cause of fetal death. A fetus can develop a big liver and a big spleen, and most die in utero," said Dr. Pablo Sanchez, who specializes in infectious disease and neonatology at Nationwide Children's Hospital [a pediatric hospital in Columbus, Ohio].

There are 2 ways to make sure this doesn't happen to more babies here. On the front end, prevention is key, through use of condoms and testing to reduce the spread, said Dr. Mysheika Williams Roberts, the city's medical director. The 2nd line of defense -- and one Roberts and her colleagues are pushing hard -- is regular testing of pregnant women. In a place with a high rate of syphilis, such as Columbus, moms should be tested at their 1st prenatal visit, at 28 to 32 weeks into the pregnancy, and again at delivery, Roberts said.

Babies are not routinely screened for syphilis, making diagnosis in the mother doubly important. If a mom is treated with antibiotics at least 30 days before delivery, her baby won't be born with an infection, Porter said. And if the baby is born with a known infection, doctors can treat the child immediately rather than waiting until symptoms -- some potentially irreversible -- appear.

There was a time when there weren't any congenital cases in Franklin County, Porter said. But infections are up here, particularly in men who have sex with men. Some of those men also have wives and girlfriends, which contributes to infections in pregnant women and their babies.

From January through July [2014], Franklin County saw 157 new syphilis cases, an increase of 40 percent over the 112 reported during the same time last year [2013]. The increase in cases has been especially significant among black men: half of the men who learned they had syphilis in the 1st 7 months of this year are African-American, Porter said.

She said the babies born with infections are a clear sign that not enough is being done to detect and treat syphilis. In a couple of cases, her staff learned that the infants' moms had syphilis symptoms during their pregnancies, and their OB-GYNs did not diagnose or treat it. One of the moms had no prenatal care, Porter said. In addition to asking doctors to test for syphilis, Columbus Public Health has been posting "Get tested" messages on social media, including hook-up sites and apps.

"The No. 1 way to prevent this and any other (sexually transmitted infection) is to practice safe sex," Roberts said. Porter urged those who have an infection to tell their partners. "The symptoms can be missed or thought to be something else. They need to be informed and tested and treated."

[The above news report says that there is a rising incidence of syphilis in Franklin County, Ohio in men who have sex with men (MSM), some of whom also have wives and girlfriends, which has contributed to the concurrent rising incidence of congenital syphilis.

In many localities, the increased incidence of syphilis occurring among MSM has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection (see prior ProMED-mail posts in "see alsos" below). If this pattern is occurring in Franklin County, there may also be an increase in the incidence of congenital HIV infection. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete _Treponema pallidum_. Transmission from mother to fetus occurs via the bloodstream during maternal spirochetal infection. Transmission may also occur during delivery if maternal genital lesions are present. Late abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death may result from congenital infection in untreated pregnancies. Among survivors, manifestations that develop in the 1st 2 years of life are called "early" and are similar to adult secondary syphilis; manifestations that develop after age 2 years are called "late" and include tooth abnormalities (Hutchinson teeth), bone changes (saber shins), "Clutton's joints" (bilateral painless swelling of the knee joints), neurological involvement, blindness, and deafness.

Control of congenital syphilis is achieved by antenatal screening and treatment of mothers who are infected. Serologic testing for syphilis of the mother's serum is preferred rather than testing of the infant's serum because the serologic tests performed on infant serum can be nonreactive if the mother's serologic test result is of low titer or the mother was infected late in pregnancy (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis).

Routine serologic screening should be done at the 1st prenatal visit in all pregnant women, and, in communities and populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high, serologic testing and a sexual history also should be obtained at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery. Groups at high risk include uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex workers, illicit drug users, women diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases, and those living in communities with high syphilis morbidity (http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/syphilis/syphpgsum.htm).

For the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral benzathine penicillin G. Penicillin is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and for treating fetal infection. Pregnant women should be treated with the penicillin regimen appropriate for their stage of infection. Because evidence is limited regarding the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotics in pregnancy, women who report penicillin allergies should be evaluated and desensitized to penicillin if necessary. See http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis for other management considerations and follow-up.

No infant should leave the hospital without the maternal serologic status having been determined at least once during pregnancy; in communities and populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high, documentation should also occur at delivery. See http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis for evaluation and treatment of infants for congenital syphilis.

Franklin County, with a population of 1 212 263 in 2013, is located in the center of the U.S. state of Ohio; its county seat is Columbus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio). - Mod.ML
