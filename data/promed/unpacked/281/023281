The 2nd case of Vesicular stomatitis (VS) in the state has been confirmed in horses in Reeves County, near Orla, Texas (West Texas). This is the 1st case of VS in Reeves County in 2015. On 19 May 2015, the TAHC announced the State's 1st case of VS involving 3 horses in Pecos County.

The newly identified infected premises is currently under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses will be monitored by regulatory personnel until all lesions have healed and a decision is made to release the quarantine (a minimum of 14 days). There is no known exposure to other horses around the state, or at any equine events. It is believed that the virus overwinters in the sand and black fly population in northern Mexico and then moves northward in warmer weather.

Some states and other countries may restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for susceptible species moving from states with active cases of VS. It is important for shippers or haulers of livestock to contact states of destination well in advance of scheduled movements to determine their entry requirements. For international export information, the USDA Veterinary Services office in Austin, Texas should be contacted.

[Texas has had a wet spring. It will likely mean some rampant insects, especially mosquitoes. Diseases carried by insects are likely to be on the increase.

How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.

In people, the disease causes an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and malaise. To avoid exposure to this disease, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.
