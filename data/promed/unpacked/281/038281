A mysterious virus has infected 21 graduate students at Konkuk University's school of veterinary science in Seoul. Health authorities have placed all 21 in quarantine and closed off the school building. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015] said the victims started coming down with pneumonia last week, and a team of epidemiologists have been dispatched to the university.

According to the KCDC, those infected are master's and doctoral candidates who used the school's lab from [19 to 28 Oct 2015]. They are being treated in isolation at state-run hospitals.

The 1st 4 graduate students who showed symptoms were hospitalized at Konkuk University Medical Center and then transferred to the National Medical Center on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015]. All of them visited a cattle fair in Gyeonggi Province last week as well as an animal farm owned by the university in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province.

A university official said they may have contracted brucellosis, which infects cattle and can be transmitted to humans. But some experts suspect Q fever, caused by the _Coxiella burnetii_ bacteria found in the droppings of cattle, swine and sheep. It causes airborne infections among humans. Symptoms such as fever, headache and muscle aches appear after a 2-week gestation period. But Song Dae-sup at Korea University said, "Brucellosis and Q fever are not commonly found in Korea and are rarely passed on to humans. We need to look at the possibility of pneumonia caused by germs or other toxic agents."

Lee Jae-gap at Hallym University Medical Center said since only the 4 visited the animal farm, the infection could be mycoplasma pneumonia or whooping cough, which sometimes occur in schools or communities.

Konkuk University sealed off the veterinary school building and told the school's 850 staff and students to report any suspicious symptoms. The building was thoroughly disinfected on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015] morning as well, according to school officials.

10 more graduate students have come down with a mysterious pneumonia attack at Konkuk University's Seoul campus on Thursday [29 Oct 2015], bringing the total to 31.

21 people were diagnosed with the same symptoms earlier. But all have so far tested negative for a dozen well-known infectious diseases.

"We're still trying to figure out the cause," a spokesman for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC] said Thursday.

Students look at instructions in front of a makeshift clinic at Konkuk University in Seoul on Thursday [29 Oct 2015]. The school said all patients are graduate students at the school of veterinary science and most have mild symptoms.

23 are in isolation at state-run hospitals, while 8 with very mild symptoms are quarantined at home. All have tested negative for brucellosis, Q fever, and _Legionella_, which were among the prime suspects of the mysterious infection. They also tested negative for bacterial diseases like _Mycoplasma_ and _Chlamydia_ and viruses like Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] and flu.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that the SK Group conducted recruitment exams on the campus last Sunday [25 Oct 2015], when the outbreak was probably already underway. Authorities asked 500 people who took the exams to report to the KCDC if they have symptoms like high fever.

[The fact that a large group of veterinary graduate students became ill with pneumonia over a short period of time suggests a point source outbreak, i.e., they were all exposed to the same source over a brief time. The development of additional cases over time and geographic areas will be very useful in determining whether the cases are related to a point source.

We are not told exactly the severity of the illness, but almost 75 percent of cases were ill enough to require hospitalization. The fact that the illness seems at the present time to be limited to graduate veterinary students suggests a zoonosis. Brucellosis, Q fever, MERS, and influenza, as well as legionellosis, chlamydiosis, and _Mycoplasma_ infection were said to have been ruled out, but the report does not mention SARS. I don't know how legionellosis was ruled out, but Pontiac fever, a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis, occurs as a point source outbreak with high attack rates following exposure to aerosolized _Legionella_. Pontiac fever is diagnosed serologically; culture and legionella urinary antigen are usually negative. However, the severity of the Pontiac fever is so mild that it usually does require hospitalization. Other etiologies to be considered should include psittacosis (again I am unsure how a chlamydial infection was ruled out), tularemia, pneumonic plague, and anthrax. Histoplasmosis, although very rare in South Korea, can also cause a point source outbreak of an acute respiratory illness. More information is obviously needed from knowledgeable sources to develop a list of potential etiologies.

Konkuk University is a private university located in Seoul and Chungju. Gyeonggi Province surrounds Seoul. Chungju is a city in North Chungcheong Province, which is southeast of Seoul.
