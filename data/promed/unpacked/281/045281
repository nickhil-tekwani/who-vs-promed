[The pattern of this outbreak in the swine herd is exactly what we
would expect in a typical influenza incursion into a highly
susceptible, non-vaccinated swine herd. This picture of high
morbidity, very low mortality and low case fatality is not surprising.
Influenza in swine causes widespread disease but is of minor
importance because the pigs get sick and readily recover in most
cases. It is not as important a pathogen as those causing high
mortality disease.

What is critically important in this situation is good outbreak
investigation to develop a better understanding of how the pigs picked
up this virus. Hopefully, thorough outbreak investigation will help
determine potential exposures of the pigs and whether this is another
instance of the virus travelling from humans, in a reverse fashion,
over the zoonotic bridge to infect swine. - Mod.PC]
