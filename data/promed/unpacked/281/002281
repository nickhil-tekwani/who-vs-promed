[The following is a response to ProMED-mail's request for information on
the layout of the German long-term challenge trial and available
observations. (see BSE, oral challenge trial (02) 20040522.1376)]


Re: BSE, oral challenge trial
----------------------------------
The German BSE pathogenesis study is currently ongoing at the Institute for
Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases (INNT) at the Federal Research
Center for Virus Diseases of Animals on the island of Riems (a tiny island
in the Baltic sea).

In this study, begun in early 2003, 56 calves were orally challenged (100g
brain stem homogenate each, 1st group in Jan 2003, 2nd group in May 2003).
Another 18 calves serve as controls. We collect blood (serum, plasma etc.),
cerebrospinal fluid, and urine samples regularly (2 to 4 samples per
month), and selected animals are serially killed and autopsied. From each
animal, a panel of more than 120 tissue and bodily fluid samples are taken
and preserved in a number of ways (frozen, snap-frozen, formalin-fixed
etc.). All samples are taken under BSE-sterile conditions. Samples
considered to be important in terms of BSE pathogenesis, and consumer
safety, are used in a bioassay experiment utilizing bovine PrPC
over-expressing transgenic mice, which are lacking a species barrier for
cattle BSE infectivity. These mice have been developed in my group.

As of May 2004, more than 60 000 samples have been collected from the
animals of the German BSE pathogenesis study, and more than 200 000 samples
will have been taken by the end of the experiment in the year 2007. More
than 4000 samples have already been distributed to German TSE research
groups and commercial test developers. This experiment is a German
initiative within the framework of the German TSE research platform:
.

The distribution of the samples is regulated by the TSE-platform's advisory
board, which is composed of elected members -- German TSE researchers -- as
well as the heads of the German CJD and BSE archives. We are currently in
the process of opening the German BSE archive for 50 European research
groups participating in the Network of Excellence (NoE) within the 6th
framework program of the EU commission. I am serving as coordinator of the
activities of the European animal TSE tissue repositories participating in
this NoE (including the TSE archive at the VLA Weybridge). As has been
correctly pointed out before, the distribution of samples from the UK TSE
archive at the VLA is regulated by an independent archive advisory group
(IAAG). I am grateful for having been appointed as one of the scientific
members of IAAG. Other members are well known and respected colleagues from
France, Spain, the UK, and Germany.
