As someone who had started the National Leprosy Elimination Programme in
Papua New Guinea (PNG), I thought I would make a few comments on the status
of leprosy in the North Solomons Province of PNG. I should say leprosy
control in the rest of the country is a success story yet to be told to
most disease control people in the region.
With support from the Sasakawa Memorial Health Foundation, The Leprosy
Mission, and the World Health Organisation, the Department of Health has
succeeded in reducing the incidence and prevalence of leprosy in all the
provinces in PNG except the North Solomons Province. Updates of the
Programme can be sought from the National Department of Health in PNG.
The problems of the Province are not acute and therefore I find it
difficult to believe that it is an outbreak. The problem is lack of
multi-drug therapy treatment availability and case review and registration,
as had been done throughout the rest of the country. What is needed on the
island of Bougainville and North Solomons Province is re-establishment of a
well-coordinated disease surveillance and control section. I am afraid that
following the long absence of government services there is likely to be an
increase in prevalence of most chronic notable infectious diseases like
yaws and tuberculosis. I would not be surprised if one discovers a locally
circulating polio virus. At least this was one of our major concerns when
we had discussions regarding the classification of PNG as a polio free
country.
I therefore believe this should not be regarded as an outbreak but rather a
hyperendemic state of leprosy resulting from lack of government services
and accessibility to available treatment and control measures.
However, I do believe it should be treated like an epidemic.
