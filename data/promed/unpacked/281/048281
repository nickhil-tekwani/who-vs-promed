Ontario: Doctors Say Number of Fatalities in 2002 Underestimated
--------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus killed at least 8 Ontario residents during last year's
mosquito season, the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health has
reported, and 3 other fatalities may be linked to the virus. Most of those
deaths took place in the Greater Toronto Area, said Dr. Colin D'Cunha.
However, doctors with the Canadian Infectious Disease Society said the
provincial death toll is underestimated and they expect it to climb. They
predict there have been 11 deaths attributed to West Nile virus infection
in Greater Toronto Area hospitals alone. Doctors estimate the number of
suspected symptomatic cases of West Nile virus infection in Ontario last
year totalled nearly 1000, health experts heard yesterday during a Canadian
Infectious Disease Society teleconference.
The Society's numbers differ from those given out by D'Cunha because he is
reporting only cases confirmed through Canada's Federal Infectious Disease
Lab in Winnipeg. "There is a lag phase. Initially we can say yes, this is a
probable case, but they can't confirm until they hear from Winnipeg," said
Dr. Coleman Rotstein, a Hamilton infectious disease expert who is also
President of the Society. Confirmation from Winnipeg usually takes a couple
of months. "We just have to be aware of the patterns of spread and we've
got to take precautions for the future," Rotstein said. "We saw what
happened last summer and we don't want a repeat of it this summer."
Rotstein said he has written a letter to Ontario Health Minister Tony
Clement, outlining his Society's concerns for the coming season. "We have
to be prepared now. We have to have very good screening and diagnostic
ability, with a high index of suspicion." It's also essential to educate
people at risk. They include those whose immune systems are weakened, the
elderly, those who have received organ transplants, and babies drinking
breast milk, he added.
A 43-year-old Toronto woman first noticed symptoms during the second week
of September 2002. "I had a horrible rash over my belly and back. It
started to spread down my arms and legs. I had a bad headache and a stiff
neck," she recalled. "I was always exhausted. The headache must have lasted
one month." Her illness eventually was confirmed a couple days before
Christmas 2002. "It was frustrating that no one diagnosed it (earlier),"
she said.
The province currently is working on a plan with many health stakeholders,
including representatives of Canadian Blood Services, to handle any
outbreak next summer, Rotstein said. Southern Ontario residents shouldn't
be surprised by the number of West Nile cases, Rotstein added. "We have
prevailing winds that blow in our area. They come from the southwest.
Detroit had in the range of 500 cases last year," he said. In New York
state last year, there were only 78 cases. "In New York City, where the
first North American case were seen, the virus is being relatively
contained," he said.
