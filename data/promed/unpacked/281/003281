Notes:
As of 27 Jun 2003 the cumulative number of cases [in Canada] includes one
previously unreported case with date of onset before 12 Jun 2003. The date
of onset of the most recent probable SARS case in Canada was 12 Jun 2003,
the last date of isolation of a probable SARS case was also 12 Jun 2003.
The date of onset of the most recent probable SARS case in China was 3 Jun
2003. The date of isolation of this case was 6 Jun 2003.
[B] Update 91 SARS research: the effect of patents and patent applications
30 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_30/en/>
As no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world
since 15 Jun 2003, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a
research-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future
resurgence of SARS.
The world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better
understanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that
allowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect
humans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution
of the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.
The SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of
laboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the
virus genome followed almost immediately.
These breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of
diagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual
outbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than
320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to
link an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in
southern China in mid-November of last year [2002].
Further progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on
continued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional
network to expedite much-needed animal studies.
WHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications
on the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are
developed and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are
set for these technologies.
At the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting
of SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent
applications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific
collaboration on SARS.
The defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's
efforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely
available to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of
biomedical science.
In the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued
could have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public
health officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious
diseases.
WHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such
collaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any
intellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues
derived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that
legitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on
efforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.
As SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a
highly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious
repercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit
by the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong
motivation for continued international collaboration.

As of 30 Jun 2003 there are no new reports of either suspected or probable
cases in Canada. The cumulative number of probable and suspected cases
reported by Health Canada has not changed from the last ProMED-mail posting.
The most recent date of onset of illness for a probable case is 12 Jun
2003, and this person was quarantined on 4 Jun 2003. The most recent date
of isolation for a probable case is 12 Jun 2003, and this person had onset
of illness on 8 Jun 2003.

[A] China from Ta Kong Pao (Hong Kong)
<http://www.takungpao.com/news/2003-6-30/ZM-149805.htm>
Submitted and translated by Dan Silver <DSilver@intellibridge.com>
The status of SARS in the mainland, conveyed by the news office of the
Chinese Ministry of Health on the afternoon of 29 Jun 2003, showed that
from 28 Jun 28 2003 at 10:00 AM to 29 Jun 2003 at 10:00 AM, mainland
reports contained no new clinically-diagnosed cases of SARS and no
deaths. Guangdong Province reported one new suspected case of SARS and one
[earlier?] case treated and discharged from the hospital.
At the moment, there are 33 cases of clinically-diagnosed SARS being
treated in hospitals in mainland China. Of these, 30 are in Beijing and 3
in Guangdong.

There was a report of a death of a 51-year-old nurse today, the first death
attributable to SARS in a health care worker in Canada.

[Since the last SARS update, the cumulative total of cases has decreased by
3 to 8447. In today's report there is the official report of the new
probable case in Canada (reported in a prior ProMED-mail posting). Other
changes since the last report include the exclusion of 3 cases in Taiwan,
and the exclusion of one case in the United States. In addition, since the
last update there have been 2 new deaths reported in China. There was a
newswire report of the death of a health care worker in Canada. There are
still 15 patients listed in critical condition in Canada as of today, so
final outcomes are not resolved in these cases.
(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>)
No new suspected cases have been reported in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada --
the only new suspected case is from China and is from a newswire report,
but not an official report. - Mod.MPP]
