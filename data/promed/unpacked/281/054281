More than 130 people have died of cholera in Zambia since the disease
broke out in August 2005, the health minister revealed.
"So far, we have recorded 137 deaths and over 5000 have been treated
and discharged from the cholera centers," Sylvia Masebo said Wed, 22
Feb 2006. She said the government was struggling to contain the
deadly water-borne disease because of an increase in informal housing
and a lack of proper sanitation.
More than 100 people are currently being treated at centers set up to
deal with the disease.

Cholera, a disease associated with poor sanitation and access to
potable water has claimed 8 lives in a suburb of the Angolan capital,
Luanda. The WHO said that 40 cases of the highly contagious disease,
spread through contaminated water or food, were reported in the last
few days in the Boavista shantytown located to the north of the
capital.
The provincial government of Luanda and the Angolan Ministry of
Health were alerted after an increase in diarrhea cases was reported
at a local health center. Subsequent epidemiological surveys
confirmed the existence of cholera.
Boavista is renowned among Luandans for its appalling living
conditions. Mud huts and corrugated iron structures are perched
precariously on piles of rubbish. There is no supply of potable water
and few homes can boast a latrine. WHO has described the area as
"totally unhealthy."

The death toll from a suspected cholera outbreak in southern Sudan
has risen to 68 but the fatality rate of the epidemic is on the
decline, the UN's health agency said on Tue, 21 Feb 2006.
"As of 19 Feb 2006, a total of 2933 cases and 68 deaths (case
fatality rate 2.27 percent) of Acute Watery Diarrhea were reported in
Southern Sudan," the WHO said in a statement.
The outbreak has hit 2 major southern Sudanese towns, the
administrative capital Juba and Yei near the border with Uganda.
Cholera was confirmed in a number of deadly diarrhea cases.
The first case of Acute Watery Diarrhea was reported in Juba on 6 Feb 2006.
The Sudanese authorities and WHO have formed a joint task force to
combat the spread of the outbreak.
Health officials have warned of catastrophe if cholera spreads
through Juba, a city of about 250 000 people that relies almost
entirely on untreated water from the heavily-polluted Nile.

[4] Cholera - Sudan (Central Equatoria State)

>From 28 Jan to 21 Feb 2006, a total of 3793 cases and 77 deaths from
acute watery diarrhea, with an overall case fatality rate of 2.03
percent, was reported from 2 major towns in southern Sudan, Yei and
Juba. _Vibrio cholerae_, biotype Inaba has been laboratory-confirmed
in several stool samples by African Medical and Research Foundation
(AMREF) laboratories in Nairobi. While transmission seems to be
declining in Yei town, the outbreak in Juba town is expected to
increase in the coming days.
A task force under the Ministry of Health of the Government of Southern Sudan,
including the Federal Ministry of Health and WHO, has been established to
coordinate the overall public health response. Several control measures are
being implemented to contain the outbreak. These include strengthening the
surveillance and reporting system, standardizing case management and promoting
health education and hygiene, with the chlorination of public water supplies.
For more details about these measures, please see the web site of the
WHO Country Office in Sudan.

[5] Diarrhea - Botswana (northern districts)

Experts from American CDC are in Botswana to help carry out further
investigations on the diarrhea outbreak.
Francistown City Council (FCC) public health specialist Dr Refeletswe
Lobelonyane told a Francistown full council meeting that the health
ministry was forced to ask for outside intervention. She said on Tue,
21 Feb 2006, that CDC staff was already in Francistown to try to
establish the cause of the outbreak. They will send the stools for
further investigations in the US, where they have advanced
laboratories.
She said the outbreak has been reported in 10 districts mainly in the
northern part of the country with Serowe/Palapye being the worst-hit
in terms of morbidity and mortality. Lobelonyane said Francistown had
reported more cases but there were fewer deaths compared to other
districts.
Nyangabgwe referral hospitals pediatrics ward which has a 40-bed
capacity, had 93 patients, all on IV fluids. She told councillors
that several investigations have been carried out to determine the
cause of the outbreak. Investigations were carried out on water,
formula milk and Tsa bana [a weaning formula] which seem to be common
to infants but definitely the outbreak is not cholera.
