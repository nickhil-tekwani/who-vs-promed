A 10 year old previously well African-American boy was seen recently by our
facility after suffering a fall 2 days earlier. He complained of fever,
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 2 days, had some right hip pain and was
tachycardic. A chest and affected hip radiograph were unremarkable, and he
was discharged with diagnoses of hip contusion and viral gastroenteritis.
Two days later, he was seen again with the same symptoms as well as back
and leg pains. A chest radiograph now showed large left lower lobe and
small right upper pulmonary infiltrates. Over several hours, despite
cefuroxime, ampicillin, and azithromycin, he developed multisystem failure
and died.
A blood culture grew a methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA)
that was sensitive to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin.
Epidemiologically, this case was felt to represent a fatal septicemic
episode of community acquired MRSA necrotizing pneumonia (confirmed on
postmortem examination). The isolate is being examined for similarity to
other community acquired MRSA strains.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Landesman for reporting this case. We are aware of
clusters of community acquired MRSA in the New York metropolitan area in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Newark, New Jersey. These cases are primarily skin
and soft tissue foci. This case illustrates the potential severity of this
pathogen, not dissimilar to the North Dakota and Minnesota cases reported
in 1999 (ProMED posting: Staph. aureus, MRSA, community acquired - USA
19990822.1467).
As these cases grow in number, the empiric antimicrobial choices in severe
community acquired infections may certainly be forced away from regimens
containing beta-lactams. - Mod.LL]
