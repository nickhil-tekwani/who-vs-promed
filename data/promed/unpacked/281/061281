[We wrote to Prof. Titov asking about the final virology results from their
1997 outbreak - Mod.JW
In response to your message I can inform you that ECHO-30 was the cause of
the outbreak of aseptic meningitis in Gomel in 1997. ECHO-30 was isolated
from CSF (93.3%).
EV-71 was also isolated from feces, drinking and river water in different
mixtures with ECHO-30, ECHO-2, CVB-2 and EV-70. [CVB-2 = Coxsackievirus B
type 2 - Mod.JW
It is not improbable that EV-71 was the cause of other forms of enteroviral
infections such as herpangina, myalgia, acute respiratory infections,
enteritis, gastroenterocolitis, which were reported during the outbreak.

[In relation to the Taiwan & Malaysian epidemics, note that the main
outbreak in Belarus was aseptic meningitis due to ECHO-30, but there was a
lot of concurrent disease related to other enteroviruses, in which EV-71
appeared in mixtures - Mod.JW
