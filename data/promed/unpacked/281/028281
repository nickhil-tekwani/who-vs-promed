The Director of Food Science Omar Olivera, told the Voice that 59 people contracted trichinosis from eating infected pork meat, a product that was acquired in all cases from the same street vendor.

In this regard the [Tandil partido, Buenos Aires province] municipal official said the district legal counsel is considering whether to take legal action against the person who sold the pork sausages contaminated with trichinella.

The official also said that of the 59 persons affected, 46 consulted the Ramon Santamarina Municipal Hospital with symptoms of trichinellosis, while the other 13 sought treatment once they had gone through the 1st stage [of the disease].

Initially 10 cases had been reported. All those affected had eaten sausages sold door to door by a neighbor.

With data collected in a timely fashion, municipal [authorities] seized the sausages, about 250 kilos, ready to be sold.

Recommendations for consumers
-----------------------------
- Make sure that the meat of each slaughtered pig has been properly analyzed. A sample in good condition of the meaty part of the diaphragm should be forwarded to the laboratory for analysis.
- Fresh pork should be cooked until the inside is no longer pink (65C/149F).
- Homemade sausages should not be eaten unless it is confirmed that the meat had been officially inspected
- Purchased pork products should have a label shoeing the supplier.

Recommendations for pig farmers
-------------------------------
- Do not feed pigs waste from restaurants, grocery stores, slaughterhouses, or garbage.
- Maintain good hygiene and rodent control on the farm.
- Burn all pig carcasses so they cannot be eaten by rats or other pigs.
- Every breeder should have properly marked pigs so that suspect animals can be identified.

[_Trichinella_ in pork meat has been reported from several provinces in Argentina and appears to be a widespread and persistent problem. Pigs exposed to the environment may be infected by feeding them kitchen waste or eating infected rodents.

Pigs should be tested for _Trichinella_ before being used in local products either consumed within the family or sold at markets. - Mod.EP]
