Flies buzz everywhere, and the stench is overwhelming as biologist
Lyndsey Howell stops to analyze the remains of yet another endangered
sea turtle washed up from the Gulf of Mexico. "It's been on the beach
for a while," Howell says, flipping over the decomposing, dried-out shell.

More than 30 dead turtles have been found stranded on Galveston and
the Bolivar Peninsula south of Houston this month [April 2010], an
unusually high number that has puzzled researchers in part because
most are so decomposed that there are few clues left about why they died.

The number of strandings on these shores is double what scientists
and volunteers normally see as the turtles begin nesting in April,
says Howell, who patrols the beaches as part of her job with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Of the 35 turtles
found, all but 3 were dead. 33 were Kemp's ridleys, an endangered
species researchers have spent decades trying to rehabilitate.

Many of the turtles appear to have propeller wounds from boats or
have become entangled in fishing nets or lines, Howell says. Others
have parasites or are emaciated.

The increase in deaths comes as the turtles swim closer to shore to
nest and shrimping season gets into full swing along the upper Texas
coast, said Roger Zimmerman, lab director of the NOAA marine fishery
laboratory in Galveston.

"Historically, they increase about this time of year. ... This is a
few more than we would normally expect," Zimmerman said. "We are
concerned, and we'll keep an eye on it."

Researchers are also watching the massive oil spill off the coast of
Louisiana. If the oil were to begin moving in the direction of the
Texas Gulf, which isn't predicted at the moment, many Kemp's ridleys
swimming in to nest would be right in its path. In 1979, after an oil
spill off the coast of Mexico, Kemp's ridleys were airlifted to cleaner waters.

Shrimping has long been blamed for sea turtle deaths. Shrimpers are
required to install grid-like devices in their nets that are designed
to allow turtles to escape. Shrimpers caught without the turtle
excluder devices -- or TEDs -- may be fined thousands of dollars and
have their catch seized by federal regulators.

Still, some are reluctant to invest USD 800 on the TEDs or are angry
over the extra work they create aboard the shrimp boats, so they
gamble they won't be caught.

"When there are more shrimp, there are more turtle strandings,"
Zimmerman said. "That correlation has been well-documented."

Educating fishermen, the public and shrimpers about preserving Kemp's
ridleys is part of a new federal recovery plan expected to be
approved in the coming months. The goal is to upgrade the Kemp's
ridleys from endangered to threatened within 6 years, but that
depends on having 10 000 nesting females per season. Currently, there
are about 6000.

Nesting season begins in mid-April and lasts into July. Most Kemp's
ridleys nest on a beach in Mexico or at Padre Island in south Texas.
But increasing numbers have been seeking out the shores of Galveston
and Bolivar.

Howell and Zimmerman hope the deaths indicate the population has
increased and even more turtles are heading toward the Texas Gulf
Coast to nest. But there's no knowing for certain.

"This is a needle-in-a-haystack thing," said Andre Landry, a marine
biology professor at Texas A&M University in Galveston. "It's a
difficult situation, pinpointing a cause of death in an animal that
may be compromised by decomposition."

[These strandings and deaths are not good news for the Kemp's ridley
turtle coming off of the endangered list. The oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico at nesting time is not a good omen for the turtles either.

The other seafood industries are suffering from the oil spill as
well; the poor economy makes it harder to invest in the turtle
excluder devices, but it does not lessen the necessity of them.
