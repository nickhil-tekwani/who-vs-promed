The State Secretariat of Health of Minas Gerais confirmed this Friday
[30 Jan 2009] the death of a man in the city of Muriae in Zona da
Mata of Minas Gerais [state] who was a victim of yellow fever [YF].
According to the Secretariat, the man was 36 years old and lived in
rural areas of the city for the past 6 months. After coming back from
a trip to Rio Grande do Sul, on 31 Dec 2008 he developed a fever and
was hospitalized in the local hospital. A week later [7 Jan 2009], he died.

According to the Secretariat of Health, since [YF] was suspected,
necessary surveillance measures were taken, such as intensification
in combatting the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ in the neighborhood where the
victim lived. The services of municipal health were also instructed
to redouble the monitoring for suspected [YF] cases.

The state government also indicated that Muriae has the necessary
doses of vaccine needed to cover the whole population. Only people who
had never taken the vaccine or received it more than 10 years ago
should be immunized.

[This report does not indicate where in Rio Grande do Sul the man
might have been infected. This year (2009), there have been several
cases of sylvan (jungle) yellow fever virus infection in humans and
monkeys in Rio Grande do Sul, near the border of Argentina (see ProMED
archives listed below). The Secretariat is prudent in intensifying the
detection of possible YF human cases and _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito
breeding sites, to avoid initiation of an urban cycle of YF virus
transmission.
