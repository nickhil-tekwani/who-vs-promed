A total of 1 person has been referred to their health care provider after providing care to a raccoon that tested positive for rabies, according to the S.C.[South Carolina] Department of Health and Environmental Control.

The contact occurred near the city of Edgefield, after which the raccoon underwent testing at DHEC's laboratory where it was confirmed to have rabies on [Wed 2 May 2018].

"Rabies is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body of a person or animal," said David Vaughan, director of the DHEC Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

One of the easiest ways of avoiding rabies is keeping your pet's rabies vaccination up-to-date, reports DHEC.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space. If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator," Vaughan said.

DHEC also suggests washing the affected area immediately with soap and water if you think you have been affected by rabies, and calling your local DHEC office.

[Rabid raccoons might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor. They present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting and odd vocalization. It can be confused with distemper. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper.
