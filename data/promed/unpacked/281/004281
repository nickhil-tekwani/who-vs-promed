An epidemic of rabies that broke out in Pointe-Noire, [Republic of] Congo last August [2013] has killed 9 people, according to the country's Health and Population Ministry. The Ministry said the 435 people who were bitten by dogs include 250 [males] and 185 [females], some of them children less than 15 years old. One person was bitten by a cat.

Civil security agents have launched an operation to capture and vaccinate stray dogs and other animals in Pointe-Noire, [Rep. of] Congo's main economic centre, in a bid to fight the epidemic. However, the vaccines are reported to be out of stock. "We have only some 50 doses left when we need at least 3000," Dr Cyprien Ngouala, Civil Security director, said.

According to Dr Joseph Ngala, Principal Doctor in Pointe-Noire, rabies is a very dangerous disease caused by bites from infected animals like dogs, cats, and monkeys. The virus is transmitted by saliva.

[The Republic of Congo is located in Central Africa, bordered by Gabon, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pointe-Noire is the 2nd largest city in the Republic of Congo, after the capital of Brazzaville, and an autonomous department since 2004. Before this date, it was the capital of the Kouilou region (now a separate department). It is on a headland between Pointe-Noire Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Pointe-Noire is the main commercial centre of the country and has a population of 715 334 (2007), expanding to well over one million when the entire metropolitan area is taken into account.

It is presumed that the shortage of vaccine referred to above is of vaccine suitable for use in protection and post-exposure treatment of the human population and not a vaccine suitable for control of rabies in domestic animals and wildlife. The number of people dying as a result of rabies virus infection is alarming, particularly since rabies vaccine for the protection of humans was the earliest human vaccine to become generally available and one the highest achievements of French medical science. - Mod.CP
