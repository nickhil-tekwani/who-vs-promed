The father of a man in China who died this week of bird flu [see
ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (154): China (Jiangsu)
20071205.3920] has also tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the
disease, the country's health ministry reported on Friday [7 Dec 2007].

A statement on the ministry website said a 52-year-old man in eastern
Jiangsu province, has been confirmed with the virus, just days after
his 24-year-old son died on Sunday [2 Dec 2007]. The man developed a
fever and pneumonia symptoms on Monday [3 Dec 2007] while under
preventive medical observation following his son's death, the statement said.

It added that 2 days later, Jiangsu bird flu experts conducted tests
to determine whether he had the virus and confirmed the diagnosis on
Thursday [6 Dec 2007]. The ministry added that all people who had
been in contact with the 52-year-old man were under observation but
that no new cases had appeared.

The 52-year-old man's son was hospitalised 10 days ago [27 Nov 2007]
after being diagnosed with pneumonia, the Xinhua news agency reported
at the time, citing the Jiangsu provincial health department. His
condition deteriorated in hospital and he died on Sunday [2 Dec
2007], according to the report. Earlier this week, provincial health
authorities said they had not determined how the deceased man
contracted the virus, saying he was not known to have had contact
with dead poultry.

The ministry gave no further details on the medical condition of the
new patient, nor any information on whether human-to-human
transmission was to blame.

[This is the 27th human case of H5N1 avian influenza in China.

Notwithstanding the father-son relationship of these 2 cases in
Jiangsu province it is premature to consider this to be an instance
of human-to-human transmission in view of the lack of information on
the source of the virus, and the absence of onward transmission. - Mod.CP]
