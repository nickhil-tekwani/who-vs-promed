[1] Hawaii ex Philippines: airplane exposures

On 2 Feb 2014, an infant returned to Oahu [Hawaii]. He was on an airplane that landed at Honolulu International Airport, suffering from fever and a red rash. He had a case of measles.

"One of the biggest concerns for us is it was a pretty widespread exposure." state epidemiologist Dr Sarah Park said. "The child was infectious while he was traveling en route from the Philippines through Guam, all the way to Honolulu."

Park said the mother took her son to a couple of pediatric offices before taking him to the emergency room at Wahiawa General Hospital. But none of the doctors diagnosed the boy as having measles. Most people have been vaccinated so measles is rarely seen in our state. The last confirmed cases were 4 in 2010.

"We have a lot of healthcare providers who just aren't familiar with seeing measles. Even though the mom was suspecting measles, a lot of them thought it was heat rash, it was some other viral illness," Park said.

Measles is much more contagious than the flu. A blood test and examination at Kapiolani Medical Center confirmed the case. But about 9 days had elapsed between the child's arrival on Oahu and the measles notification to the Health Department. During that time the infant may have come into contact with many people.

"We are concerned because there are susceptible individuals out there, especially those infants who haven't yet been vaccinated. They are under 12 months. They are at risk for severe disease," Park said. She said her office is alerting hospitals and doctors to be on the lookout. The CDC is trying to reach passengers who were on the same flight.

"We don't want to see a case of encephalitis, a case of pneumonia, a case of hearing loss, of blindness or severe diarrhea in these infants or other susceptible individuals," Park said. She said the infant contracted the disease while he was in Manila despite his mother's best efforts to shield him.

If you're experiencing any of the symptoms of measles call your physician or an emergency room first. "They may want you to come in through a special entrance so you don't contaminate or expose other people," Park said.

[2] California ex Asia: university, rapid transit exposures

A measles scare is unfolding in the San Francisco Bay Area. Public health officials said Thu 13 Feb 2014, that an infected student from the University of California, Berkeley attended classes and rode the BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit] public transit system last week, potentially exposing thousands to measles.

The student had not been vaccinated, and likely contracted the disease while studying abroad in Asia. The student traveled between El Cerrito del Norte and Downtown Berkeley stations from 4-7 Feb 2014 between 8:00 am to 10:00 am, in addition to the afternoon and evening commute hours.

Measles spreads through infected droplets that are passed in the air when an infected person coughs of sneezes. Authorities warned passengers to seek medical attention if they develop symptoms. Symptoms of the highly contagious disease typically begin within 7 to 14 days of infection, and include a blotchy rash, fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat aches, tiny white spots found inside the mouth, and red, watery eyes. A person may start with flu-like symptoms, then within 2 days develop the white spots in their mouth. Later, a reddish-brown rash typically begins on the face then spreads throughout the body. About 30 percent of measles cases lead to serious complications including pneumonia, ear infections and diarrhea, the CDC notes.

"If this individual had been vaccinated and was exposed to measles abroad, they wouldn't have been infected and would not have brought the disease to the USA," Erika Jenssen of Contra Costa County Public Health, said to CBS San Francisco. "And all of this would not be happening."

In September 2013, a CDC report on confirmed USA measles cases over the past decade found most patients -- 82 percent -- had not been vaccinated. The CDC said "philosophical differences" such as anti-vaccination beliefs -- including a widely debunked link to autism -- may still be influencing some families. During the 2013 summer, an outbreak of measles occurred at a Texas megachurch where 21 people were infected, with officials saying the majority of those infected had not been vaccinated.

The CDC warned Americans in December [2013] that of the 175 measles cases reported in 2013, almost all the cases were linked to people who had traveled internationally. "A measles outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere," CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said at the time. "The steady arrival of measles in the USA is a constant reminder that deadly diseases are testing our health security every day."

[3] Texas (Dallas County): locally acquired

http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140214-dallas-county-confirms-rare-case-of-adult-measles-not-linked-to-travel.ece


A Dallas County resident has been confirmed with a rare case of adult measles, the county health department said Fri 14 Feb 2014. The infected person is recovering after hospitalization, said a statement from the county. The source of infection is unknown because the case did not involve recent international travel, and there is no known link to 2 pediatric measles cases reported by Collin County in January 2014.

A measles outbreak in the summer of 2013 in Tarrant and Denton counties placed the state on high alert for the infectious virus. All 20 measles cases were traced to a church in northwest Tarrant County, health officials said. The initial measles case in that outbreak involved an adult church member who had traveled to a part of the world where measles infections are common.

2 measles cases reported in Dallas County in 2014 were linked to foreign travel but did not spread.

The age of the infant [item 1] explains why it had not been immunized routinely but the vaccine has been given early, even as early as 6 months in an outbreak setting and some consideration could have been given to giving MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) prior to the trip to an endemic area such as the Philippines.

It is unclear why the student at University of California was not adequately immunized as colleges require evidence of immunity prior to matriculation and may have been born abroad and did not receive any measles vaccine.

In the 3rd case, it is probably the case that the man was not old enough to have been born before the age of routine immunization in the USA (or he would have already likely had measles as a child) and had received one immunization (perhaps he did not go to college where the 2nd dose was administered for some time) or born outside the USA and was never immunized.

As noted in the infant's case, the usual childhood exanthemas such as measles and rubella have become rare in the USA due to close-to-universal immunization. Because of their rarity, physicians, especially young physicians, may never have seen a case. As an infectious diseases clinician, every single one of the dozen cases of measles that I have diagnosed in the past 20 years had been misdiagnosed by at least one physician and several were already hospitalized. Even in the peak years of poliomyelitis, measles killed more children than polio did. As many as 1 in 1000 cases of "street" measles developed measles encephalitis with significant morbidity and mortality. - Mod.LL]
