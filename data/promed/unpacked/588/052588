This is a very wide range to be resistant to. One would surely only expect
such a spectrum to come from a hospital.

Again this is a rather wide range of animals. What information do we have
about the incidence of carrier status in the various species? Given the
rather unhygienic behaviour of dogs and their proximity (complete with
faeces) to humans and the widespread distribution of birds (seagulls and
pigeons to name but two) and their capacity to spread their faeces over a
very wide area one should perhaps raise ones eyes above food animals to a
wider range. I presume that meat is still sterile when alive and the
bacterium is found in the faeces.

Whilst this is always the first thing everybody says in this situation and
has resulted in severe tightening of the meat hygiene laws over the last
two decades this doesn't seem to have done anything except increase the
number of cases. The assumption is that it's always human food chain
hygiene that is responsible seems to me less and less plausible. Whilst
it's hard to sue a seagull (for example) and they are noteworthy for
ignoring laws and regulations this doesn't mean that they cannot be
primarily responsible for the spread. Indeed they seem to have an in-built
and very effective spread and distribution system.
Could it be that it's inconvenient to regularly sample dog faeces in public
parks and even more awkward to sample bird (particularly seagull) faeces
and so it's rarely if ever done? Even worse, we may find that some level of
contamination is inevitable from the environment we inhabit and then there
would be no-one to blame.
