>Africa's population is projected to quadruple from 0.7 billion in 1995 to
2.8 billion in 2150... If the fertility rate in Africa rises above the
predicted rate, its population could be as high as 6.9 billion by 2150.
Whilst agreeing wholeheartedly that the rate of population growth in Africa
is alarming (in the case of Zimbabwe, where I used to work, it has been
growing at around 2.5% since records were started at the beginning of this
century, so it is not a new phenomenon either), making predictions of
population 150 years (5 generations) from now is fraught with unknowns and
assumptions. There is already evidence of some fertility transitions
happening in Africa and it is to be hoped they become more widespread. But
even just a doubling from 0.7 billion to 1.4 billion, which is very likely
and not so far off, will be very difficult for Africa to deal with. So, the
situation is rather more urgent than 2150, and alarmist predictions about
population at this [far-off date may allow the real more pressing problem
to be taken less seriously.
>Oyewale Tomori, WHO's regional virologist in Zimbabwe, speaking at
SUNY/Stony Brook, suggested that "Africa is killing our children through
neglect". Tomori said that, for example, in Zimbabwe, 600,000 children
will have died by 2000 from HIV-related diseases...
I worked in Zimbabwe when the HIV tragedy was starting. A large factor was
the commonly seen government response of trying to hide the problem
(doctors were initially not allowed to give AIDS/HIV as the cause of death)
until it was too widespread to ignore any more. A second factor was a lack
of real concern from developed countries about the predictable consequences
of HIV/AIDS on population structures and the enormous stress it would put
on health services in sub-Saharan Africa. "A stitch in time saves nine"
applies to epidemiology as much as to sewing, but seems to be often
forgotten.
> "Instead of buying tablets", Tomori said, "Africa is buying grenades".
Indebtedness has been a real problem for all types of development in many
countries and needs to be addressed. However, just cancelling the debt
won't ensure that any extra funds will be utilised to buy more tablets and
fewer bullets. There are many governments by whom the extra resources may
be mis-used. Perhaps instead of simply cancelling debt (which in some cases
is just protecting lenders for the consequences of making ill considered
loans; shouldn't they take some of the loss too?) some mechanism should be
developed whereby the money released has to be channeled into specific
areas such as public health infrastructure in order for debt to be
cancelled? In this way real improvements might occur, although then the
trick is for the money to be spent wisely (but that is the same for all aid
projects of any kind, as I know only too well).
Africa's problems are enormous. In some ways it seems to be being abandoned
as a continent by donors as ... just too difficult and showing too few
results. This is a tragedy. But just cancelling debt is unlikely to help
poor people very much.

From: Dr.Ron Worley <rworley@texas.net>

Though superficially laudable, the idea of debt forgiveness for African
countries who seemingly have no concept of population control, economics,
sanitation, and civilized discourse is sadly misguided. It will simply
continue the cycle of taking aid and loans for necessary development and
spending it for weapons, palaces and planes for the thugs in power.
What lessons do you teach when irresponsibility is tacitly encouraged?
