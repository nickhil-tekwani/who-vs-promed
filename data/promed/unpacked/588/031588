Macau recorded 87 cases of scarlet fever up until yesterday [9 Sep
2011], a significant increase compared to the 16 cases last year
[2010], according to figures from the Health Bureau. Director of the
bureau Lei Chin Ion gave assurances at a press conference yesterday
that the situation is under control. "Cases are dropping, and there
was no significant increase after the re-opening of schools. No cases
of death were reported either," Lei said.

Scarlet fever is an illness potentially fatal among children. Hong
Kong declared an outbreak in June [2011], and 2 children died from
scarlet fever this year [2011] in the neighbouring territory. Unlike
Macau, the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] has
reported an increase after the new school year commenced last week.

The head of Hong Kong's Department of Health (DP), Lam Ping Yan, told
reporters there were more than 1100 cases this year [2011]. He pledged
that authorities will closely monitor the situation in schools and
continue to step [up] prevention.

In Guangdong province, there were 847 cases from January [2011] up to
now. Deputy Director of the Department of Health of Guangdong Province
Huang Fei said the situation in the mainland province [Guangdong
province] is similar to that recorded in both [Macau and Hong Kong]
SARs. "The peak season is in June, more or less the same in the 3
regions. We will continue to conduct studies on prevention and
monitoring," he said.

Hong Kong's DP director further explained that this year's [2011] high
number of cases affected the whole region and refused to talk about an
epidemic in Hong Kong.

"It can be explained by changes in the environment, or immunity was
lower, or germs were stronger. We were already expecting that the
number of cases would rise after the reopening of schools because it
is transmitted human-to-human," Lam said. "But that's not an epidemic;
if it were, we would notify other regions immediately."

[With the updated totals for scarlet fever so far this year (2011) of
87 cases in Macau, 1100 cases in Hong Kong, and 847 cases in
Guangdong, the incidence rate of scarlet fever for Macau, with a
population of about 544 000 in 2010
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau), is 15.9 per 100 000; that for
Hong Kong, with a population of 7 million in 2010
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong), is 15.7 per 100 000; and
that for Guangdong, with an estimated population of 110 million in
2010 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong), is 0.8 per 100 000.
For comparison, the annual incidence rates of scarlet fever reported
for Hong Kong in the past decade have been 2 to 3 per 100 000
(http://www.gideononline.com/tag/scarlet-fever/).

Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular methods,
such as multilocus sequence typing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
analysis, will aid identifying common outbreak strains. We await this
information.
