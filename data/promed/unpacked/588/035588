Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - the United Arab Emirates, update 8 Jan 2020
-------------------------------------------
On [29 Dec 2019], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported one laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to WHO.

The case is a 74-year-old male national who owns a camel farm located in Al Ain City, Abu Dhabi region, in UAE, where he is living. He developed fever, cough, and sore throat on [8 Dec 2019] and was admitted to hospital on [10 Dec 2019], then transferred to ICU on [16 Dec 2019]. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (UpE and Orf1a genes) on [16 Dec 2019] by the Shiekh Khalifa Medical Center laboratory. He has underlying comorbidities including hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy [kidney disease], heart disease, asthma, and hypertension. He has a history of close contact with dromedary camels and sheep at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He has no history of recent travel and has not been involved in slaughtering animals. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in intensive care unit isolation.

Since 2012, UAE has reported 89 cases of MERS-CoV (including this case) and 12 associated deaths. From 2012 through [29 Dec 2019], the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2494 with 858 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

Public health response
Upon identification of the patient, an incident report, case investigation, and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation is ongoing and includes screening of all close contacts, including occupational contacts in his farm, household contacts, and healthcare workers at the hospital where he sought care. All identified contacts of the confirmed case will be monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after the last exposure to the confirmed case.

A total of 88 contacts have been identified, including 70 healthcare contacts and 18 household contacts. All close contacts of the patient were tested negative for MERS-CoV.

The veterinary authorities have been notified, and investigations for MERS-CoV in animals are ongoing.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[The last case of MERS-CoV infection reported by the UAE was in May 2018 (see MERS-CoV (17): UAE (Abu Dhabi), WHO 20180528.5824390). According to the above report, this individual has multiple pre-existing co-morbidities including diabetes and renal disease, both associated with more severe illness when infected with the MERS-CoV. What is not mentioned is whether this individual is on dialysis, the hemodialysis unit being a known high risk location for MERS transmission in prior outbreaks in Saudi Arabia.

As stated above, "Since 2012, UAE has reported 89 cases of MERS-CoV . . . and 12 associated deaths."

The global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported globally to WHO as of 29 Dec 2019 is now 2494 with 858 associated deaths (case fatality ratio 35%).

[This post is a good reminder that MERS-CoV is still circulating in the Middle East, specifically on the Arabian Peninsula. In the past few weeks, there has been a WHO report of 3 cases of MERS-CoV infection in Qatar (one index case with no identified high-risk exposures and 2 contacts of the index case) and now, in this report, a case in the UAE in an individual with high-risk co-morbidities and exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

In Saudi Arabia, these newly confirmed cases are the 1st 2 cases to be reported this year (2020): one fatal and one still pending outcome. Coming from 2 different regions -- one in Riyadh and the other in Madinah -- both were classified as primary cases: one with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and the other with no known identifiable high-risk exposures (no contact with camels and no known contact with other confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection), a continuation of the previously observed endemic pattern.
