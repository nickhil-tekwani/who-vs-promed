On Newfoundland's south coast, 2 fish farms are dealing with viral outbreaks in their salmon.

One instance of infectious salmon anemia is at Cooke Aquaculture's site in Manuel's Arm, affecting 2 cages.

Another involves 21 cages at a Grey Aquaculture site in Pass My Can Island. The virus is not considered harmful to humans, but fish suspected of having the virus must be destroyed to prevent it from spreading.

Infectious salmon anemia is a highly contagious disease. It can be insidious with an initially low mortality rate; however, the cumulative mortality can sometimes exceed 90 per cent if the disease remains unchecked.

Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus is a member of the genus _Isavirus_ in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Hemorrhagic kidney syndrome is an old name for the disease in Atlantic salmon. In coho salmon, it has also been called icterus syndrome.

ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry.

The differential diagnoses for infectious salmon anemia include other causes of anemia and hemorrhages as well as winter ulcer and septicemias caused by _Moritella viscosa_.

Outbreaks of infectious salmon anemia can be diagnosed by virus isolation, the detection of antigens, and RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). A few isolates from sick salmon have been difficult to culture, even when viral nucleic acids can be found. The avirulent isolates carried subclinically in wild salmonids can usually be detected only by RT-PCR.

Infectious salmon anemia is an OIE-listed disease as well as a regulated aquatic animal disease in Canada under the Health of Animals Act and supporting regulations that are administered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
