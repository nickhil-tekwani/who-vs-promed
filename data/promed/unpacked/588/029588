TUNGA PENETRANS ­ UGANDA (02): COMMENT

Tungiasis in Uganda: Comment
----------------------------
Tunga penetrans are fleas (insects of the order
Siphonaptera), and are commonly referred to as
chigoe fleas and sometimes as jigger fleas. In
contrast, chiggers are mites. Adult chigoe fleas
do burrow into skin, but they most often invade the skin of the feet.

The MSNBC report seems considerably confused as
to the actual cause and extent of this
'epidemic.' These fleas neither invade beyond the
skin nor breed within a person. The lesions can
become secondarily infected and necrotic.

Whereas some of these cases may, indeed, be
burdened with an infestation of the chigoe flea,
some others may suffer from infestation by the
Congo floor maggot (_Auchmeromyia senegalensis_)
as well as diverse other causes.

[ProMED thanks Richard J. Pollack for his
comment. We agree that the original posting is
confusing and we still doubt that a large number
of death can be due to Tunga penetrans and indeed
that it can course an outbreak as described. ­ Mod. EP]
