Today [6 Sep 2013], the head of Food Science in the city [Arrecifes], who is looking into the incident, confirmed that a 30-year-old young man died as a victim of the disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] that is transmitted by rodents. He died 4 days after the [1st] symptoms appeared.

Mario Zacarias, a local reporter, stated that the man was admitted to the [Arrecifes] Municipal Hospital but was "misdiagnosed" and released. Some days later, the young man returned to the hospital where he was admitted. He died that same afternoon.

The day of his death, authorities of Community Health sent samples for testing to the Maiztegui Institute of Pergamino [Buenos Aires Province] where it was confirmed that the death was caused by [a] hantavirus [infection].

The Food Science [Agency] worked in the fields of the area in order to detect the focus where [hantavirus] infected rodents could be found. The young man worked in the Soychu cold storage plant in the city of Salto [Buenos Aires Province].

[As has been mentioned in previous moderator comments concerning hantavirus infections in Argentina, cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012) and again this year (2013), including this 2nd one from Buenos Aires province. The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). ProMED would be interested in receiving information about the specific virus involved when laboratory tests have been completed.

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems very unlikely in this case. This case may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
