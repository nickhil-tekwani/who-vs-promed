An outbreak of African swine fever has been recorded in the Leningrad
region. According to the News Agency, this was informed by the

According to the information, 8 out of 14 pigs in the farm of the
military unit 11115 of the Defense Ministry, located in the town of
Mga Kirov district, died some time ago from an unknown reason.

Tissue samples of the dead animals were sent for investigation to the
All-Russia Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology
in the city Vladimir [Federal Governmental Institute, Centre for
Animal Health, FGI-ARRIAH 600900 Vladimir, Yur'evets, Russia]. From
there, it is concluded that the pigs died of African swine fever.

[An official confirmation of the above media-derived information,
including its exact location, is urgently anticipated. The Kirov
oblast (province) is situated in the Volga Federal District (Number
50 in the map at
<http://www.russiasregions.com/volga_federal_district.html>, in the
north-east of the European part of Russia. Its population is around 1
589 000 people with 70 percent being urban citizens. The Leninsky
district is one of its 4 city districts (the others
being Oktyabrsky, Pervomaisky, and Novovyatsky).

If confirmed, this is a leap of ASF from Russia's Southern District
into a north-Eastern direction; Kirov will become Russia's 10th main
administrative region infected. - Mod.AS]
