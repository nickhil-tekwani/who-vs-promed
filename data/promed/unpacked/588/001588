In the Nile Delta, Bird Flu Preys on Ignorance and Poverty
-----------------------------------------------
Given the choice between the possibility her children would fall ill
from bird flu or the certainty they would go hungry if she got rid of
the ducks she raised in her home, Hamida Abdullah said there was
really no choice at all.
"You think we are going to fast?" Ms. Abdullah said as she pushed
open a door to expose a sad-looking, feces-covered pen where a dozen
muddy ducks chased one another.
It has been 2 months since Egypt confirmed that avian flu had arrived
in the Arab world's most populous country. Since then, 12 people have
developed the illness, and some have died. [A government news agency
said Thu 13 Apr 2006 that there had been a 4th human death, Reuters
reported.]
Egyptian authorities did not hide the flu's arrival, but government
officials did not seem prepared to deal with it. There was no clear
policy initially for trying to keep the disease from spreading. After
the government decided to vaccinate domestic poultry against the flu,
it was learned that there was not enough vaccine, people in the
poultry industry said.
The government then turned to culling birds, relying on Egyptian
security forces. Some poultry industry experts said this only
contributed to the spread of the disease.
As in many other developing countries, the Egyptian government was
faced not just with a medical and scientific battle, but also with a
serious social problem that threatened to undermine stability in vast
stretches of poor, rural communities.
Telling poor Egyptians in the countryside they cannot raise poultry
at home for food and extra income would be like prohibiting Russians
from growing vegetables at their dachas. It would cut off not only a
crucial source of nutrition, but also a lifestyle that has deep
cultural roots.
The government knew it was impossible to ban raising birds at home,
so it allowed people outside the city to keep their personal flocks,
so long as they were caged and healthy.
Bird flu has devastated Egypt's poultry industry, effectively
reducing a stock of an estimated 100 million broiler chickens at any
given time by 95 percent from both disease and culling. But the
tragedy of the disease is most evident in the Nile Delta region north
of Cairo, the nation's breadbasket and now an incubator of fear and
bird flu.
The human cases of the virus have shown up primarily in 3 Delta
governorates, including the location of this village, in Menufiyya,
where a 16-year-old girl died after coming in contact with infected
birds.
"Every house has chickens," said Elmurss Suliman Khamis, whose family
slaughtered their chickens and now supplements its meals with beans,
fried and boiled. "We can't live without chickens. We actually live
with chickens." Indeed, people here live with chickens, ducks and
pigeons in their homes.
Ms. Abdullah, 43, said she ran her household, which includes her
husband, 2 sons and 2 daughters, on the equivalent of about USD 35 a
month. A pound of meat costs about USD 2, far out of her price range
for everyday meals. Their 4-room home has concrete walls, concrete
floors covered by tattered rugs and a pen at the back where the birds
run free.
"Yes, we are eating them," she said dismissively when asked if she
worried about bird flu. "What should we do? Throw them in the street?"
Some villagers said they initially hid their birds from inspectors by
packing them up in crates and carrying them out into the fields. The
government offered to recompense owners the equivalent of about USD
1.00 per bird it killed, but the villagers either did not believe
they would get paid, or they felt their birds were worth more at
market.
When the birds started to die and people started to get sick, some
residents began killing their poultry, or, in the parlance of the
village, "rescue them" before they became ill. For a time, people
lived off them. But those stocks are beginning to run out.
Saida Suliman recently slaughtered dozens of birds she had raised in
a pen outside her front door. "May God help us so we can raise
chickens again," she said. She is anxious because she has no idea
what she will feed the guests at her son Muhammad's wedding in July.
Across the railroad tracks and a 4-lane highway that cuts through the
farmland, the village of Rateb sits on the bank of a canal. It is an
area thick with white feathers and rotting bird carcasses. The people
here said they had killed their flocks, but eventually some residents
conceded they had kept some birds, mostly ducks, after their chickens
began to die. They said they dumped the dead chickens in the canal.
Government officials have said that keeping ducks is more dangerous
than chickens, because they can carry the avian flu virus without
appearing sick. But the villagers here insisted their ducks were
healthy.
"I have chickens," said Sayed Abu Tahon, 24. "You want to see?" He
walked toward a green field, past 2 water buffaloes. He, his wife and
daughter share a 4-room home with his brother, his brother's wife and
their 3 children. He said he was a day laborer and, if he was lucky,
found work 10 days a month. "I depend more on my chickens than my
work," he said, opening a door onto a balcony loaded with baby
chicks. The floor was layered in bird droppings. Children in
open-toed sandals darted after the baby birds. "I think it's a
rumor," he said stoically, his wife by his side, when asked whether
he worried about bird flu. "I've not seen any infected birds."
Downstairs, on the side of the house, he opened a metal door, to show
maybe a dozen chickens. More children played in the dirt nearby.
"Most of the people who slaughtered their chickens did it because of
the rumor," he said. "They believed it. I didn't."

[Unfortunately, Egypt has become one of the most extensively infected
countries. According to the official Egyptian reports to the OIE,
H5N1 has already been recorded in 17 out of Egypt's 27 governorates
(muhafazat), the virus active along the Nile from Luxor in the south
to Alexandria in the north, incorporating the entire Delta area.
Combined with the demographic picture, as illustrated in the above
article, this becomes a bleak, very concerning situation for man and
animal.
The affected governorates are: Alexandria, Ismailia, Giza, Cairo,
Menia, Kalubia, Behera, Beni Suef, Dakahlia, Kafr el Sheikh, Qina,
Fayoum, Dommiata, Sharkia, Luxor, Monifia, Sohag. See map (and list)
at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Egypt>.
The affected population, as officially reported, includes backyard
poultry flocks (chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, breeders, broilers,
layers, pigeons and peacocks) and migratory birds. - Mod.AS]

Pakistanis find H5N1 bird flu on another farm
-----------------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus has been confirmed at another Pakistani
poultry farm, an Agriculture Ministry official said on Sunday [16 Apr
2006].
Authorities confirmed outbreaks of the H5N1 virus at 2 poultry farms
in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) in February 2006. The new
outbreak was discovered on a farm near the capital, Islamabad. "It
was an small farm, and we have already destroyed a total 3500
chickens there," Mohammad Afzal, the ministry's livestock
commissioner, told Reuters. Pakistan has had no human cases of the
disease.
The virus has spread across Asia into parts of the Middle East,
Africa and Europe since 2003.
Afzal said workers at the farm where the new outbreak was detected
would be tested. "We have informed the National Institute of Health
about the strain, and now they will carry out tests of the workers at
the farm," he said. All poultry on farms within 5 km (3 miles) of the
outbreak would be strictly monitored, he said.
The H5N1 virus has been found in Pakistan's neighbors, including
Afghanistan, India and Iran.

[The 1st 2 outbreaks in Pakistan, on 23 Feb 2006, affected a layer
farm and a breeder farm in the North West Frontier. This region is
northwest of Islamabad, map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/pakistan.pdf>.
According to Pakistan's follow-up report No. 1, sent to the OIE on 4
Apr 2006, no further outbreaks had occurred since February 2006,
while -- as a precautionary measure -- "the private sector has been
allowed to import 5 million doses of avian influenza vaccine to deal
with any eventual emergency." See
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_24.HTM#Sec12>.
Data on the vaccine used in Pakistan (probably H5N2) will be appreciated.
In addition to Pakistan, 7 other countries have already allowed -- or
prescribed -- vaccination of poultry against H5N1. 4 countries,
namely China, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Egypt, apply mass vaccinations,
while 3 -- France, the Netherlands and Israel -- have allowed limited
vaccination in specific target populations, including zoos, but none
in regular, commercial poultry flocks, which remain unvaccinated and
are required to be kept indoors to prevent exposure to wild birds.
This is done in line with the European Commission's Decision
2005/94/EC, dated 21 Oct 2005.
According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (APPENDIX 3.8.9.),
"In essence, no country can declare itself free from avian influenza
(AI) in wild birds". - Mod.AS]
