[Antibody to Nipah virus has been found in seven stray dogs kept at the
Ipoh Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA).
Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd
Nor said all the 20 dogs at the ISPCA would be put down tomorrow. "Although
the 13 dogs are only suspected to be infected, they have been classified as
positive," he said yesterday. Dr Mohd Nordin added that no cats [had been
shown to have antibody to Nipah virus.
Asked how the dogs could be infected when the ISPCA was located far away
from the Nipah high-risk areas, he said the dogs were strays and they might
have been sent to the ISPCA before the outbreak occurred.
The blood samples from the 20 dogs were out of the 92 blood samples of dogs
and cats taken by the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) last week. State
veterinary services department director Dr Abd Kadir Osman said the ISPCA
was under quarantine.
He said the VRI would take blood samples from all the other cats and dogs
which had been tested negative as a precautionary measure as the virus
might act late in some animals.
It is learnt that staff of the ISPCA would also be tested for the virus.
