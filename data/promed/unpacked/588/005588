2 rural laborers in the department of Durazno in the center of
Uruguay have been hospitalized with cutaneous anthrax, according to
the local authorities.

They say that the disease is enzootic in Uruguayan cattle and that a
dozen outbreaks are noted each year. Human cases follow from handling
hides from infected dead animals.

Durazno is some 180 km north of the capital, Montevideo.

[There is a report on Duraznodigital.com that confirms this AP report
but adds nothing of importance:
<http://www.duraznodigital.com.uy/web2/inicio/actualidad/693-dramatizan-casos-de-carbunco-en-durazno.html>.

Since 2005, anthrax has been reported in the departments of Artigas,
Cerro Largo, Durazno, Florida, Lavalleja, Paysandu, Rio Negro,
Rivera, Salto, Soriano, Tacuarembo, and Treinta y Tres. It is
essentially a bovine problem, with 7 to 17 outbreaks each year and
with occasional outbreaks in horses and swine. Human cases are not
infrequent: 2001 (1), 2002 (0), 2003 (8), 2004 (8), 2005 (4), 2006
(5), 2007 (6). The frequency of human cases suggests that the disease
is significantly under-diagnosed -- why else would a gaucho skin the
animal? -- and that vaccination is erratic. The true incidence could
well be twice the reported frequency because of being unsuspected
and thus under-diagnosed. - Mod.MHJ]
