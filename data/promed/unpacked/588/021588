APHIS confirms citrus greening in Texas
---------------------------------------
On January 13 2012, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of citrus greening in samples collected from a sweet orange tree located in a commercial citrus grove in the San Juan area of Hidalgo County. The sample was collected from a symptomatic tree during ongoing citrus surveys. Since 2009, APHIS has regulated the entire State of Texas for the Asian citrus psyllid, the insect vector responsible for transmitting citrus greening.

APHIS, in cooperation with the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) and the Texas citrus industry, is responding to this find with additional surveys, control, and regulatory activities.

TDA enacted a temporary emergency quarantine around the detection site in an effort to prevent the spread of citrus greening. This expires on 20 Jan 2012, when TDA intends to establish a revised intrastate quarantine based upon updated information. After the intrastate quarantine, APHIS is prepared to enact interstate quarantine.

APHIS will publish citrus greening quarantine areas at:

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus occurs throughout much of Asia. It is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector. 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus and their specific vectors exist in the respective areas. HLB has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel
and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

The pathogen was reported for the 1st time in the Americas from Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012). Asian citrus psyllids were discovered in Florida in 1998 and _Ca. L. asiaticus_ was found there in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683). In 2001, the Asian citrus psyllid was found in Texas and quarantine was established to prevent its spread (ProMED-mail post 20071212.4000).
