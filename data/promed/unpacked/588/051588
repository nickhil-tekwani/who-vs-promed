First case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome imported into the USA
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On 13 Mar 2002 a 29 year old American man was bitten by a long-tailed mouse
in Nahuelbuta Park, Chile, where he was trapping small animals and tracking
a near extinct species of fox. On 29 Mar 2002 he had fever and sweats.
During the next 2 days he developed muscle pains, chest tightness, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea. On 1 Apr 2002 he was admitted to the intensive care
unit of a hospital in Temuco, Chile. He was febrile and hypoxemic. His
platelet count was 119 000 [per cubic millimeter. - Mod.SH] and dropped to
64 000 within 2 days. Chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates. He
required supplemental oxygen but not intubation. Serology showed IgM but
not IgG antibody to hantavirus. His respiratory status improved rapidly; he
was discharged on 11 Apr 2002 and returned to the United States one week
later. On 29 Apr 2002, when seen at the Johns Hopkins University Travel
Clinic, he felt well except for easy fatigability and residual weakness.
Serum samples yielded both IgM and IgG antibodies to hantavirus.
During 5 years of global surveillance, this is the first report of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the GeoSentinel database. As far as I
know, it is the first case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome imported into
the USA. Earlier this year a traveler to Chile and Argentina was diagnosed
with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome after returning to France [see
ProMED-mail: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, imported - France
20020103.3152]. A botanist, he was probably infected in the Puerto Montt
area of southern Chile.
Taken together, these 2 cases suggest [that there is] a small risk to
travellers to southern Chile or Argentina whose activities might bring them
into contact with rodents or rodent excrement. While transmission of
hantavirus through animal bites has been reported, most infections probably
follow inhalation of dried excreta.
