An outbreak of trichinosis in Cordoba affects 51 people
------------------------------------------
Fifty one people living in Rio Segundo, Cordoba Capital, Pilar and Laguna Larga have been diagnosed with trichinellosis.

The infection has originated in salami made with clandestine slaughter meat. Cordoba Ministry of Health confirmed the existence of an outbreak of trichinosis in the province. The common factor was intake of salami made from raw meat from home slaughtered animals without veterinary inspection.

The health authorities have warned people about the dangers of using or buying pork and pork containing products without proof of health inspection. Suspicious products that had already been sold has been seized.

So far 51 cases have been confirmed, affecting people of Rio Segundo, the city of Cordoba, Pilar and Laguna Larga, according to the Department of Epidemiology of the health portfolio. Of these cases, 21 reside in Rio Segundo, 13 in the Capital [Cordoba] and the same amount in Pilar, and 4 in Laguna Larga. Most of those affected are over 17 years old, but there is an 8 year old child. Although there were no serious cases, 2 people required hospitalization in Rio Segundo.

Sausages consumed by the infected people were in all cases acquired in licensed shops, including supermarkets, butchers and other stores.

Trichinellosis is a disease transmitted by eating raw or undercooked pork contaminated with the parasite _Trichinella spiralis_. The infection may be asymptomatic or may induce flu-like symptoms which are highly variable. Fever, severe muscle pain, headache and pain and swelling around the eyes, along with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting are the most common manifestations.

To prevent trichinellosis, meat should not be consumed raw and all meat used in sausages especially home slaughtered pigs should be inspected for _Trichinella_. Consumers should check the processing tag or label on the pork products, which must have brand, the company responsible, number of national inspection authority, date of manufacture and expiry and a labeled with the content of the product.

[Outbreaks of trichinellosis from home slaughter of so called "back yard pigs" often fed kitchen waste and offal are a classical source of infections in humans. Had the rules of inspection of meat for _trichinella_ been adhered to, the outbreak would have been prevented. ProMED-mail has reported regularly on _trichinella_ in the Northern parts of Argentina. It is important to follow the advice provided here by the authorities to thoroughly check if the products have been inspected and are properly labeled, before purchase and consumption.
