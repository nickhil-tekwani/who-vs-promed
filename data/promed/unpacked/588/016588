First confirmed case of anthrax in 2008 detected near Del Rio
-------------------------------------------------------------
The anthrax season near Del Rio started a little early this year, with a
case confirmed on 31 March in a 5 year old male goat. The Texas Animal
Health Commission (TAHC) is advising owners in the area to vaccinate
livestock to prevent additional death losses.

"Usually we see cases of anthrax occurring in summer when the temperatures
rise, but this spring has been quite warm. Anthrax occurs worldwide, but in
Texas, cases are typically found in a triangle bounded by Uvalde, Ozona and
Eagle Pass, which takes in portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton,
Edwards, Kinney, Uvalde and Maverick counties," said Dr Bob Hillman, Texas'
state veterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health Commission, the
state's regulatory agency for livestock and poultry health.

[Dr Hillman goes on to strongly advise ranchers in these counties to get
their animals vaccinated against anthrax, which is wise. Cases this early
are unusual.

I have made some initial enquiries and spoke with the veterinarian who was
presented with 2 affected dead goats. Apparently this was the end stage of
an outbreak affecting 10 penned goats which all died over some 7 days.

Samples were sent to TVMDL, College Station, which confirmed that it was
anthrax. The goats were receiving hay, alfalfa hay, and goat pellets. They
were not grazing or browsing, and the owner claimed to have never seen
anthrax on his place before. The property is NW of Del Rio and possibly in
Terrell county and towards Dryden. This is a part of Texas that is usually
silent about its problems.

On the information available one must suspect that this might be part of a
larger problem and we may hear of other outbreaks in goats involving hay &
pellets. 20-50 years ago there were many outbreaks in Texas involving bone
meals but thanks to "mad-cow" disease it is strictly regulated now. A wild
speculation would be that the owner might have bought Mexican goat pellets.
On the other hand contaminated hay is not unknown; we hear of related
outbreaks in cattle every 5 years or so. - Mod.MHJ]
