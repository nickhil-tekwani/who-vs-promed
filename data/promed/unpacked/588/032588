A cholera outbreak in southwestern Tanzania's district of Kyela [Mbeya region] has killed one person and left 24 others hospitalized, officials said on Sun 26 Nov 2017. Kyela District Medical Officer, Mariam Gwere, confirmed the death, saying the 1st case was recorded on [17 Nov 2017] and immediately people were informed to take necessary precautions.

"We've banned gatherings and meetings in the district," the official said in an interview with Xinhua, adding that the outbreak can be attributed to a lack of personal hygiene, consumption of contaminated water and lack of adequate toilet facilities in the affected areas. Gwere said that the efforts to restrain further spread of the disease were ongoing as various public health officials have been deployed in the affected areas in the district.

Kyela District Council director Mussa Mgatta said that 3 special areas have been set up that will be used for the cholera patients.

Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya says 298 cases of cholera have been recorded in Lusaka, while 46 cases are under treatment and 4 people have died. Dr Chilufya says the cases are coming from Kanyama and Chipata compounds and Soweto market. The Minister said this after the ministerial taskforce on cholera comprising 4 ministries and the traders embarked on a cleaning exercise at Lusaka's new Soweto market.

Dr Chilufya said poor sanitation is fuelling the spread of cholera cases, and that the multi sectorial team is determined to address the issue of sanitation starting with the market and Ministry of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection Lloyd Kaziya has directed both the Lusaka city council and Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company to unblock drainages at the market.

Meanwhile, Lusaka province Minister Japhen Mwakalombe said there is need for communities to change their altitude towards the disposal of waste and Kanyama Member of Parliament Elizabeth Phiri, and the vendors Association of Zambia, and marketers also took part in the cleaning of the market.

15 members of the Migori County Assembly and some county staff were rushed to various private hospitals in Mombasa County on Sun 26 Nov 2017 after a cholera scare. They were suffering from diarrhea and vomiting. Other MCAs [Members of County Assembly] also rushed to hospital for vaccination against cholera due to an outbreak that has so far killed 4 people in Mombasa.

A doctor who treated the ward representatives said they were all treated for food poisoning. "Basically, this means that the food they ate was not cooked well that is why they suffered from food poisoning. We treated quite a number of them who thought it was cholera but we confirmed it is not," said the doctor who requested anonymity.

An affected MCA from Makerero Ward in Kuria West [Migori county], said they ate meat, chicken, fish, rice, and chapati at a hotel on Saturday night, 25 Nov 2017 and afterwards they began feeling unwell. "We were booked at a hotel in Mombasa for 3 days . We were 57 MCAs but only 15 MCAs were affected. I almost died due to diarrhea and vomiting. I was the most affected. The rest were afraid of me; they thought I had cholera," he said. He demanded his medical report to dispatch it to his private doctor in Nairobi. "I have booked a flight to Nairobi. I want to go for further medical examination," he added.

Masaba MCA William Abedi said general observation points to contaminated food. He said he was not sick as he did not eat at the hotel. "We used to do our meetings in this hotel and nobody had ever experienced such. Those who didn't take lunch or dinner at the hotel were not affected, that is how we are saved," said Mr Abedi. "As the assembly we are deeply disturbed by the incident. Family members are calling asking about our health status. This is an unfortunate incident. Samples were taken to laboratory." Mr Abedi said 4 of the MCAs are in critical condition and they will be airlifted for further treatment in Nairobi. "They are fatigued and dehydrated," he added.

[4] Cholera - South Sudan (Juba) new immunization campaign
Date: Mon 27 Nov 2017
Source: Gurtong [edited]
http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ID/21102/Default.aspx


The 3-day vaccination campaign which started on last week [week of 20 Nov 2017] targeted about 11 000 people. The vaccination campaign was conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and WHO. It targeted everyone older than 12 months in the new site and bongo area. The vaccinations were provided at Jodonki Primary School, Chaplin Church, 10 States Oak Tree, New Site Main Market, New Bongo area, and Dr John Garang Primary School [Juba]. About 6000 people were vaccinated on the 1st day.

Dr Makuir Mayaom Philip, of MSF said the Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) will be provided for all age groups except children less than 1 year to protect the area which has had new cholera cases admitted in Juba Teaching Hospital at the beginning of November 2017. He said the 1st week of November, about 15 suspected cases of cholera was reported in the New site area, attributing the new infections to poor sanitation and hygiene practices in the area. Dr Makuir said vaccination against cholera is the most reliable and concrete way to protect people of all ages from contracting cholera and avoid the spread of the disease.

The vaccination campaign in New site follows a mass cholera vaccination conducted in cholera hotspots in Juba by MSF 2 months ago. Dr Makuir said after the mass cholera vaccination campaign, 30 new cholera cases have been reported in neighborhoods that were not covered by the former campaign. "MSF vaccinated over 195 000 people in other Juba neighborhoods in September to October 2017 and no new cases have occurred in those areas since then," he said. He added that after taking two doses of the vaccines, a person will be protected against cholera for up to 5 years. Makuir cautioned the community to be on high alert even in the dry season by drinking clean water, using pit latrines, washing hands with soap, and boiling water.

Republic of South Sudan: Cholera situation and response updates, 17 Nov 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemic trends
- cholera transmission reported in 2 counties [Juba and Budi] in the last 4 weeks [21 Oct-17 Nov 2017].
- out of the 26 samples tested in the week, 16 (62 percent) were positive by culture. All positive samples were from New Bongo (a new focus of transmission in Juba).
- in the last 4 weeks, cholera cases have been reported from Juba and Budi (Fig. 1 and Table 1 [for all figures and tables, see source URL - Mod.LL]). During this period, a new focus of transmission emerged in New Bongo, Luri payam in Juba county (Fig. 2 and 3). The initial cases were reported from New Bongo on 10 Nov 2017. At least 40 cases including 16 confirmed cases have been reported from New Bongo (Fig. 3).
- 2 assessment missions to New Bongo were undertaken during the week. The affected population is using two shallow wells as drinking water source after the sole borehole in the area broke down. There are no improved sanitation facilities in the area and the population has no access to a primary health care facility. New Bongo and the surrounding areas have an estimated population of 11 000. Following the assessment missions, an oral rehydration point has been set up by HLSS [Health Link South Sudan]; bucket chlorination has been initiated; plans are underway to repair the borehole; a roadshow is planned in the area; and a reactive vaccination campaign using oral cholera vaccines will be implemented on 23 and 24 Nov 2017.
- in Budi, the cases have continued to decline with only sporadic transmission reported in Kimotong, Ngauro, and Lorema. A reactive oral cholera vaccination is already underway in the county.
- a cumulative of 850 cases including 82 deaths [CFR 9.65 percent] have been reported in Budi since week 29, 2017 (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Overall, males (54.6 percent) are more affected than females (43.9 percent) in Budi county. Male children and male young adults are more affected than their female counterparts of corresponding age (Fig. 5).
- the outbreak in Budi started on 28 Jul 2017 with the initial transmission occurring among gold-miners in Ngauro.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
