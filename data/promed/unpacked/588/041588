We encountered 2 cases of meliodosis acquired in Africa in Bangkok
during 1999. The cases were a female US Foreign Service officer and
her daughter on direct transfer from a central African country. The
mother (normal host) developed a right upper lobe pneumonia which was
1st thought to be TB but cultured _B. pseudomallei_. She had a very
high antibody titer to the organism and responded readily to therapy.

Her then asymptomatic daughter had experienced an acute severe
febrile illness in Africa prior to departure, which was treated with
a broad spectrum antibiotic, and had fully recovered. We collected
serum from her and also found a very high antibody titer to _B.
pseudomallei_ [Thummakul T, Wilde H, Tantawichien T. Military Med
1999;164: 658-62]. Our literature review at that time concluded that
melioidosis has been a well documented infection by veterinary
scientists in Africa for decades and was almost certainly
under-reported in humans.
