ANTHRAX - USA (NEW MEXICO)

The first case of anthrax in New Mexico since the mid-1980s has been
confirmed by laboratory tests, according to the state health department.
The disease infected and killed a cow on 5 Sep in the Lovington area. Those
who were exposed to the case during the necropsy were put on medication,
although no one showed any immediate signs of the illness.
[I am checking with those concerned. The outbreak was on a farm where an
oil company was drilling and there had been extensive earth working and
slush pit digging, and rain. Some "6-7 calves and 2-3 cows" died before the
rancher felt he had a case for "hydrocarbon poisoning". To fulfill the
legal requirements a recently-calved cow that had just died was trucked in
to the farm's veterinarian for necropsy. On presentation the bloated
carcass had some bleeding from the nose and vulva, but the latter was put
down to having only calved seven days before. The veterinarian then joined
the club of those who discover anthrax in the middle of a necropsy - a
companion group to those who while in the midst of treating a cow with
"choke" only then remember their student lectures on rabies. (I fear we all
eventually belong to one or the other club, sometimes both.) It took the
vet and her spouse three days to burn the carcass.
A staff veterinarian from the local USDA/APHIS office has visited the farm
and I have yet to find out what he found. The APHIS office was hit by
lightening over the weekend and their telephones are still "out". Mod --MHJ]
