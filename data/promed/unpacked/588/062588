Two people have died and 2 are admitted with swollen arms after skinning the carcass of a cow infected with anthrax. [A 49 year old male], died on [Tue 24 Mar 2015] at his home in Gaitheche village, Gatundu South [Kiambu county, former Central province]. [A 39 year old male], died at the Gatundu Level 4 Hospital. The 2 were among residents who last [Fri 20 Mar 2015] helped a neighbour skin a cow that had died from an unknown illness.

[A 50 year old male], told the press at the hospital he was going to look for fodder when he was approached by his neighbour, [who] asked him to help him skin the cow before burying the carcass. [This neighbor] said he met 6 other people and, after skinning the cow, they took some of the meat to their dogs. The dogs that ate the meat died immediately.

On Sunday afternoon [22 Mar 2015], [this 50 year old neighbor's] arms started swelling and he was taken to hospital, where he was admitted among 2 others before one died.

Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria visited [one of the affected fatalities'] home yesterday to console the family. The MP blamed the local administration for what he termed failure in surveillance. Kuria called for the immediate arrest of the cow's owner. He later visited those admitted in hospital and wished them quick recovery.

Gatundu deputy medical superintendent Anne Waiguru said the patients had contracted anthrax. Waiguru said the 2 patients are out of danger. She called on those who might have had contacted the carcass to report to the hospital for treatment.

Disease surveillance coordinator John Mwangi was present.

[Maybe this political interest will result in some action of strategic value. Anthrax in Kenya is erratically reported and with minimal government attention. But bovine outbreaks are seen consistently in the (former) Central province; for example in 2013 (3 outbreaks), 2012 (4), 2011 (4), 2010 (13), and 2009 (8). This should be enough disease activity presenting a human risk to get proactive action.
