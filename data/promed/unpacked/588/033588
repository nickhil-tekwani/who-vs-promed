The Thiruvananthapuram district health administration organised 3
medical camps on Friday [13 Jul 2007], following reports that viral
fever with more severe symptoms had surfaced in many parts of the
district. The camps, which included doctors from the Ayurveda and
homeo medicine systems, were held at Aanakudy, near Vamanapuram
panchayat [village council], Poovachal in Kattakkada panchayat, and
Thattathumala in Kesavapuram.
Though a total of 1412 persons attended these camps, the number of
fever cases was just 46. The camp at Aanakudy saw maximum attendance,
while the other 2 camps recorded fewer people.
Doctors who led the camp at Poovachal grama panchayat said most of
those who attended had had viral fever before and were already under
some kind of treatment.
The 1st confirmed case of chikungunya in the district had been
reported from Veeranakavu in the panchayat. Though fever cases had
been reported in large numbers from all 21 wards in the panchayat,
cases have come down drastically.
Nearly 30 medical camps, including those conducted by the army
medical teams, had been held at Poovachal since the outbreak of viral
fever. Fresh cases of fever were fewer now and though some people did
report mild skin lesions and mouth ulcers, these had been contained
quickly through medication, the panchayat authorities said. Almost
all of those who came to the medical camp were suffering from chronic
arthralgia, an after-effect of chikungunya, which could persist from
3-8 months.
A total of 2979 new viral fever cases were reported in the district
on Friday [13 Jul 2007]. Cases were reported in large numbers from
Palode, Vithura, Vellarada, Nedumangad, Attingal, Chirayinkeezh, and
Parassala. Though the number of viral fever cases continues to be
high, the number of suspected chikungunya cases has come down
drastically. A total of 15 suspected cases of chikungunya were
reported in the district on Friday [13 Jul 2007] from Perumkadavila,
Vellarada, and Attingal. [Of these febrile cases,] 2 cases of
chikungunya were confirmed at Aanakudy and Aryanad...[there were other
cases of dengue, leptospirosis & malaria].
The health officials said fogging and spraying activities had been
intensified in the Valiathura and Pozhiyoor areas so that the disease
did not spread. Medical camps would continue in the district on
Saturday [14 Jul 2007] also.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[In response to the ProMED-mail post of 12 Jul 2007 on the Kerala
chikungunya outbreak (archive no. 20070712.2235), Dr. T. Jacob John, a
noted virologist in India, commented that there is a continuing large
scale outbreak of fever in many districts in Kerala, affecting a wide
age range -- from young children to the elderly. He adds that this has
now continued for about 4 months, and from personal descriptions of
local doctors it is an unprecedented scale outbreak -- affecting
normal life in schools, police stations, banks, and other
institutions. However, the Government Health System continues to deny
any outbreak, and keeps announcing everything is under control. Dr.
John concludes
that truth is the casualty here, and added that to lend some
credibility to the allegation of a large outbreak, the central
(federal) government is sending a fact-finding team of infectious
diseases experts.
ProMED-mail would appreciate further information as it becomes
available, better defining what appears to be a large outbreak of
febrile disease of mixed etiology (chikungunya and dengue viruses,
leptospirosis and malaria).
