The Equine Disease Communication Center has confirmed 8 cases of a highly contagious disease in the state, including one in St Clair county [Michigan].

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed the case in an 8-year-old quarter horse mare in St Clair county [Fri 29 Jun 2018]. It also confirmed strangles cases were found in a 10-year-old quarter horse gelding in Clinton county and in a standardbred gelding from Washtenaw county.

"All horses developed nasal discharge and swollen glands in the neck. All horses are alive and under the care of a veterinarian. None of the horses were vaccinated against strangles. No quarantines were issued and these cases are not believed to be related to each other. This brings the total number of cases of strangles in Michigan for 2018 to 8," according to the Equine Disease Communication Center.

Strangles is a bacterial infection that is highly contagious in horses. It became a reportable disease in the Michigan this January [2018] and is monitored for disease trends.

Several horse shows in the area were cancelled or postponed following words of cases being found in the area in June [2018].

"Strangles is classified as a regulated disease," Jennifer Holton, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD] spokeswoman said in an email in June [2018]. "With strangles, MDARD's only action is notifying stakeholders and the public via the equine disease communication center. MDARD does not quarantine the affected premises and horse owners are advised to work with their local veterinarian."

[This is a very contagious disease capable of spreading quickly and easily. There is a vaccine for this disease and owners should be encouraged to vaccinate their horses.

One way to help ensure vaccination is for the shows to require proof of vaccination within a year or 6 months of the show before the animal can be unloaded at the show or fairgrounds.
