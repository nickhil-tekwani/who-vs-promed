In this update:
Cases in various countries: Nepal (national), Mexico (Tamaulipas),
Mexico (Sonora), Brazil (Amazonas)


- Nepal (national), 29 Nov 2010: the number of dengue cases has not
been determined. Some 888 persons from Dhangadi, Butwal, and
Bharatpur, where 5 died of dengue (virus infection), had their blood
tested for dengue virus
(<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/2010-11/29/c_13626906.htm>).

- Mexico (Tamaulipas), 3 Dec 2010: the head of the 4th Sanitary
District, Mario Salinas Alfonso Saenz said that with the increase in
the number of cases of dengue they are seeking to control the
epidemic that emerged in the wake of flooding and waterlogging
problems reported after the overflowing of the Rio Bravo [known as
the Rio Grande in the US]. He mentioned that in the municipalities
under this jurisdiction 194 cases of dengue have been recorded. In
the municipality of Rio Bravo, 145 positive cases were registered, of
which 102 are classical dengue fever and 43 were DHF. [This is a high
ratio of DHF cases to dengue fever cases, suggesting that there is
significant underreporting of classical dengue virus infections. - Mod.TY]
(<http://www.eldiariodevictoria.com.mx/?c=120&a=22190> in Spanish).

- Mexico (Sonora), 29 Nov 2010: State officials have discussed the
possibility of seeking to declare a dengue emergency in the state.
According to recent official reports, in Sonora, there have been more
than 2700 cases of dengue, of which close to 400 have been DHF, with
at least 3 deaths so far this year [2010]
(<http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=1392015> in Spanish).

- Brazil (Amazonas), 3 Dec 2010: from January-October 2010, the
number of dengue cases increased 120 percent in Amazonas and 72
percent in Manaus [the capital of the state], in relation to the same
period last year (2009). In the state there were 3200 cases and in
the capital 1012 cases were registered. The outbreak advances, with
dengue virus serotype 3 in urban areas in Amazonas and dengue virus
type 4 in Boa Vista, [in neighboring] Roraima state, with the threat
of entering Amazonas state via Highway 174
