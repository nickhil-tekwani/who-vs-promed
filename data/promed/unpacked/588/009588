Ref: van Straten M, Bardenstein S, Keningswald G, Banai M: _Brucella abortus_ S19 vaccine protects dairy cattle against natural infection with _Brucella melitensis_. Vaccine 2016; (in press, corrected proof; available online 19 Oct 2016)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that can cause severe illness in humans and considerable economic loss in the livestock industry. Although small ruminants are the preferential host for _Brucella melitensis_, this pathogen has emerged as a cause for _Brucella_ outbreaks in cattle. S19 vaccination is implemented in many countries where _B. abortus _is endemic but its effectiveness against _B. melitensis_ has not been validated. Here we show that vaccine effectiveness in preventing disease transmission between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, as determined by seroconversion, was 87.2 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 69.5-94.6 percent). Furthermore, vaccination was associated with a reduced risk for abortion. Together, our data emphasize the role S19 vaccination could play in preventing _B. melitensis_ outbreaks in areas where this pathogen is prevalent in small ruminant populations.

Conclusions
-----------
We demonstrate that the _B. abortus_ S19 vaccine was effective in preventing disease transmission and clinical symptoms such as abortion and reduced gestation length (data not shown) following natural challenge with _B. melitensis_. To the best of our knowledge, cross protection of a _B. abortus_ vaccine in dairy cattle naturally infected with _B. melitensis_ has not been demonstrated previously.

Our findings emphasize the possible role _B. abortus_ vaccines could play in programs aimed to control and prevent _B. melitensis_ outbreaks in dairy herds. Although the evidence for our findings was quite conclusive, it must be stressed that our study was not designed as a randomized, controlled trial. Therefore, the presence of a cohort effect cannot be excluded. Such an effect, if present, could introduce bias if the exposure to _B. melitensis_ was not of the same magnitude or varied over time between the vaccinated and unvaccinated heifers. We aimed to reduce the probability of a cohort effect by choosing the groups in such a way that the maximum age difference between 2 heifers from different cohorts was 6 months. This way the cohorts most likely shared pens or were housed in adjacent pens at the time of exposure.

[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and rarely by _B. suis_. The disease is manifested by abortion and excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Brucellosis is highly pathogenic for humans, _B. melitensis_ is regarded as more pathogenic for humans than _B. abortus_. B. melitensis is the main causative agent of caprine and ovine brucellosis; it appears to occur mainly in the Mediterranean regions, but infection occurs worldwide.

_B. abortus_ was eradicated in Israel in 1984. Its continued absence was monitored, during the following years, by compulsory surveillance of all farms, which included periodic bulk milk testing. In the event of a positive reaction, the test was repeated on bulk milk from groups of cows, and the cows of a suspected group underwent individual blood testing. Cows with positive test results were slaughtered with full state compensations, and their organs bacteriologically examined in the State Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis in the Kimron Veterinary Institute.

_B. melitensis_ infection in small ruminants, and the subsequent disease in humans, "undulant fever" ("Malta fever"), have been known in Israel since the early years of the 20th century. Occasionally, this pathogen was found to infect cattle as well. In one case (1977), the bacterium was introduced into a large dairy cattle operation by the feeding of raw unpasteurized whey, a by-product of sheep cheese, from a central dairy factory in the vicinity of the farm, with serious damages, including several clinical cases among the attending personnel.

After the final eradication of bovine brucellosis (_B. abortus_) in 1984, vaccinations of all dairy female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain 19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine were continued compulsorily for years. This, in view of the continued circulation of _B. melitensis_ in the sheep and goat herds, and despite the fact that no clear evidence for its cross-protection was available. In 1988, a dairy farm with 765 animals tested positive on the periodic milk-ring test and was found infected with _B. melitensis_. Circumstantial evidence implicated contaminated whey from sheep or goat milk as the most likely vehicle of infection but the final epidemiologic investigation was inconclusive. The dairy herd was put under quarantine, and test and slaughter policies applied, leading to the compulsory slaughter of 150 head (23 percent of the herd). During one of the later events, the entire population (about 500 head) of a dairy operation had to be culled.

Following a risk assessment, vaccination with "S19" vaccine was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014 (see archive no. 20151103.3762268). Subsequently, the routine, periodic performance of the bulk milk testing was discontinued in 2015.

When notified, it was stated that the said decisions "would be subject to evaluation/review every 2 years or when there is a new brucellosis outbreak on a dairy farm." (http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/A51D5662-DB7D-4D6D-AAD4-F1FA700DA379/0/mivhan__mrt.pdf; in Hebrew). Such evaluation/review, in case performed, will benefit from the findings and conclusions in the paper presented above.

During the current year (2016), the number of human brucellosis cases in Israel seems to be increasing again. According to the current data of the Ministry of health's department of epidemiology, the accumulated number since the start of 2016, as of 15 Oct 2016 (41st week of the year), is 386 officially registered human cases, compared to 362 during the same period in 2015. The number of non-registered cases is assumed to be significantly higher.

The Israeli experience may be of use and be taken into consideration by other countries suffering _B. melitensis_. - Mod.AS
