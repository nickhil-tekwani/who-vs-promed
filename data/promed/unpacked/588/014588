Andhra losing ground in mango production
----------------------------------------
Andhra Pradesh state, once famous for Banganapally and Totapuri varieties,
seems to be losing ground on mango production, which is going down even
during mango season. The production for this season is estimated to
be about 22-25 lakh tonne [2 400 000-2 700 500 tons], which is 20
percent less than the last season [2004]. Mango prices fetched about
INR 6 [USD 0.11] per kilo at the farm gates and INR 10-12 [USD
0.23-0.28] at the retail markets.
According to a department official, mango farmers are in a panic,
fearing sudden hailstorms or rains. Farmers continue to harvest the
entire crop at one time, causing price drops. The growers, however,
point out that there is no support from the marketing department,
which makes them sell at reduced prices after a long wait.
The weather seems to be harsh, and there are sudden changes affecting
the fruit-set, causing diseases, such as blossom blight.
The major mango-growing districts in the state are Krishna, East
Godavari, West Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam,
Chittoor, Khammam, Karimnagar and Adilabad. It is a tropical fruit.
High humidity and cloudy weather at flowering are not favorable, as
they affect pollination and fruit-set and encourage diseases. "For
the last few seasons, off-seasonal rains during flowering is becoming
detrimental to the crop," Horticulture Department officials point
out. Presently, a majority of the crop in this district is affected
by Blossom blight disease.
There are different varieties available in the state: table varieties
are Banganapally (Benishan) Totapari, Neelum, Dashehari, Langra,
Kesar; juice cultivars are Peddarasam, Chinnarasam, Cheukurasam,
Navaneetham and Panakalu; and pickle varieties are Jalal, 2C Amani,
Rajapuri, Royal Special, Bobbili Punasa, and Baramasi.

[Unfortunately the identity of the blossom blight fungus is unknown. There
is one reference indicating that _Botrytis cinerea_ causes the disease in
India. Another important disease of mango called blossom blight can be
responsible for up to 94 percent losses depending on the cultivar. This
disease is caused by a series of fungal pathogens. Although the
cultivars "Awase" and "Alfonse" were found to be moderately susceptible
and "Hendy Bezra" even less susceptible, specific fungicidal sprays are the
accepted and widespread method of control.
I have included 3 references about mango diseases, but they may not
be relevant to the Indian mango blossom disease.
