A moderator commented "Clinically, perhaps the best differential feature
between a viral gastroenteritis and staphylococcal food poisoning is the
consistent absence of fever with the staphylococcal disease."
References to consider:
MMWR Nov 21, 1986: "Staphylococcal Food Poisoning from Turkey at a County
Club Buffet" : 34 percent had fever
MMWR Dec 19, 1997: "Outbreak of Staphylococcal Food Poisoning Associated
with Precooked Ham -Florida, 1997" : 11 percent had fever

[ProMED thanks Dr. Thomas for his comments. Indeed, this moderator stands
corrected regarding fever in staphylococcal food poisoning. Perhaps it
might have been better put that in this illness fever occurs in a minority
of cases. - Mod.LL]
