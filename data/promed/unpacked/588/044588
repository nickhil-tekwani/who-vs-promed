Russia (Omsk): outbreak of measles in city of Saratovo
------------------------------------------------------
After an interval of 3 years, there has been a resurgence of measles in the
city of Saratovo. According to Elena Zozuli, the chief epidemiologist in
the city health department, 13 cases of measles were recorded during the
whole of 2003, but 40 cases of measles have been recorded during the first
3 months of 2004. Of those infected, 88 per cent are adults between the
ages of 20 and 40. None had suffered measles previously or had been
vaccinated. In 2004, mass immunization of adults up to 35 years of age is
planned. Immunization will be restricted to those who have never had
measles or to those who have not been vaccinated previously.
