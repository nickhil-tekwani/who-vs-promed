A new case of mad cow disease, the second this year and the 12th since the
disease first appeared, has been detected at a small farm in northwest
Belgium. The five year-old cow, whose symptoms of BSE disease were
confirmed by three laboratory tests.
It was killed and immediately incinerated.
The remaining 300 over cows from the farm will also be killed and
incinerated and the brains of all those older than one year will be analysed.
An inquiry is currently underway and its results will be important, because
the disease-ridden cow was born on July 21 1995, after the government
banned the feeding of cows with animal by-products.
