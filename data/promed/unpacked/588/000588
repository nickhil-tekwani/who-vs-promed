[1] Netherlands, 52nd mink farm infected

Contamination with SARS-CoV-2 has been established at a mink farm in Wilbertoord (municipality of Mill en Sint Hubert) with approximately 1250 mother animals. The infection came to light by reporting symptoms observed in the mink and has immediately been cleared. An infection has also been found at a mink farm in Overloon (municipality of Boxmeer) with approximately 7500 mother animals. This has come to light from the 'early warning', the monitoring system in which animals are tested for the virus every week. This company will also be cleared as soon as possible.

A total of 52 mink farms in the Netherlands have now been declared infected.

[Both new outbreaks are situated in the province North Brabant, similarly to most previous mink farms infected since late April 2020. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Netherlands' mink farms continues with unchanged pace, in spite of the tightening of control measures as described in ProMED post 20200902.7740793 (addressing the experts' publication "Jumping back and forth: anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms"). Out of Netherlands' 120 mink farms, 52 have already been found infected. The mechanism of the continued circulation of the virus in mink is yet to be explained.

The mentioned letter to the parliament from the ministers of Agriculture and of Health (dated 28 Aug 2020) was discussed in the commentary of 20200830.7730463. The letter, which followed an advisory report, received by the government from OMT-Z ("Outbreak Management Team for Zoonoses"), included (pages 2-3) a paragraph titled "Public Health". In view of its zoonotic significance, its translation follows:

"Public health
-------------
People in contact with infected mink on mink farms are at risk to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The risk of becoming infected within a mink farm is, according to OMT-Z, even higher than in the family situation. The OMT-Z notes that the risk for neighboring residents is negligible, as has been shown by the negative air samples outside the mink-house, as well as from epidemiological data recently obtained from COVID-19 patients living in the regions of the infected mink farms.

The OMT-Z concludes that the risk of infection from mink for humans living outside the mink farms is currently negligible relative to the risk of human-to-human infection in the population. The OMT-Z finds it worrying, however, that it is not possible to get a grip on the spread of the virus in mink farming. The continued spread of the virus to and from people is especially a risk for employees of the businesses. Although there is now no evidence of 2ary transmission on large scale, in the opinion of the OMT-Z it may occur on an individual level, between employees and their contacts.

Despite the as yet limited risk to public health, it remains, according to the OMT-Z, desired to stop the spread of the virus within the mink farming, also because much uncertainty remains about its transmission route and it is undesirable that the virus continues circulating in mink farms (reservoir formation), in view of the risk that, in the longer term, 2ary transmission through employees of mink farms to the general public can take place.

The OMT-Z confirms its earlier advice that if the infection pressure in the human population continues its decrease over time, human-to-human transmission becoming, relatively, less common, the importance of preventing mink-to-human infection increases. Since the COVID-19 preventive measures on mink farms have not delivered the desired results, OMT-Z maintains its earlier advice that mink farming be terminated in the Netherlands".

According to 'Dutch News' of 12 Sep 2020 (https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/09/at-least-66-people-linked-to-fur-farms-have-had-coronavirus-with-mink-a-likely-source/), the Dutch mink epizootic has already led to the cull of an estimated 2 million animals. - Mod.AS]

[2] Denmark, 6th mink farm infected.

Denmark is the world's largest producer of mink skins. Since July 2020, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) has monitored Denmark's 1200 mink farms for the presence of the coronavirus (COVID-19). As of this report, Danish authorities have identified 6 mink farms where COVID-19 has been detected. With a monitoring strategy and the stricter restrictions for infected mink farms, the DVFA and the Danish health authorities assess that it is justifiable to let infected herds live because the risk of spreading infection to humans is minimal. Henceforth, the DVFA will no longer issue press releases on individual findings of COVID-19 on Danish mink farms. Instead, herds with confirmed infections will be identified on the DVFA's website: https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk.

[Thus far, COVID-19 in minks has been reported from 4 countries: Netherlands, Spain, Denmark and USA.

In the previous COVID-19-in-mink posting (20200908.7759382), reference was made to (an old) paper addressing bats as prey for mink (Ref 1). Consulting ProMED-mail's Wildlife Moderator PMB on the issue, he kindly responded: "I've run a quick scan of papers on mink diets (from many parts of the world) and haven't found bats as a listed food item. Of course occasional episodes of mink preying on bats may exist. It is true, however, that local circumstances may drive minks to adapt to use new prey items if the usual is not available".

Information on the COVID-19 situation in farmed minks in China will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
