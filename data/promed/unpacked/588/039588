Update on Canine Influenza in Maryland
--------------------------------------
Canine influenza was reported in Montgomery County, Maryland, 21 Aug 2013, with an initial 6 cases reported and 2 fatalities. As of one week later, up to 20 total cases have been reported in the county.

The virus subtype is likely to be H3N8 as subtypes detected previously in the US have been H3N8; however, there is an H3N2 canine influenza of avian origin circulating in China and Korea currently, and further subtype testing is needed to determine the subtype of these Maryland cases. Subtyping of the current virus is still pending and will take up to 2 to 3 weeks, based on early reports from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory and Iowa State University conducting viral isolation on samples.

Whatever the subtype, strict isolation of dogs with influenza like signs and cleaning and disinfection of all canine influenza virus (CIV) contaminated areas are the most important steps to control the spread of CIV. CIV is very contagious. Dogs that have become infected with CIV are ones that have been in very close contact (kennels, doggy day care facilities, dog parks, and shows).
