The new strain of bird flu that arrived in Alaska with the spring migration has now been detected in a fox that died in the Aleutian Islands.

Wildlife officials say the red fox, as well as eagles, found dead in the Unalaska area [Aleutian Islands], were most likely feeding on birds that had died from the H5N1 avian influenza.

State veterinarian Dr Bob Gerlach says that's different from previous strains of bird flu.

"We generally don't see avian influenza causing problems in these species, but this is an unusual case," Gerlach said. "So between that and the significant number of mortalities among waterfowl, it's a concern and significant."

The H5N1 bird flu has caused the deaths of millions of poultry in the Lower 48 [48 adjoining US states and the District of Columbia], as well as wild birds and some foxes there.

In early May [2022], Alaska confirmed its 1st case of the virus. It was found in a non-commercial flock of chickens and ducks in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. But so far, wildlife officials say, it has not impacted domestic mammals in Alaska, and this strain and previous strains have not proven to be a significant health concern for humans or domesticated dogs and cats.

Those pets could still be susceptible, and Gerlach says there are plenty of other reasons to keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead birds.

"If there is a dead bird or dead animal there, we don't know what they died from," Gerlach said. "If it's not influenza that's transferred, it could be either bacteria or maybe another virus that is transferable, and the most common ones we see are salmonella and _E. coli_. And then obviously those can be transferred to people, too."

Alaskans harvesting birds or other wildlife for food are urged to use the usual safety precautions, like wearing gloves, thoroughly cooking meat, and not eating animals that appear to have been sick.

Cases of HPAI have been confirmed in 5 skunks in the Vegreville-Wainwright-Lloydminster area in east-central Alberta.

All 5 had the same symptoms -- blindness, seizures, and cloudy eyes. The detections in wild mammals are notable, raising concerns about the zoonotic potential of the circulating virus.

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, but red foxes have shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 previously in Europe and Japan. Other canids found infected by HPAI H5N1 in Japan are raccoon dogs. As canids, skunks belong in the Order Carnivora, but in a different family (Mephitidae). Skunks have been previously shown to be susceptible to influenza A viruses.

While the reports of wild carnivores infected by HPAI H5N1 in Eurasia have been sporadic, since April 2022 there have been several events in foxes (and now skunks) in Canada and USA. This might result from differential exposure (such as high quantity of infected birds used as food items by wild carnivores in the Americas compared to Eurasia), or due to mutations that render a viral lineage more capable of infecting carnivores. The fact that there is a high number of reports of HPAI H5N1 in birds of prey and scavengers suggests that predators/scavengers in general (both mammals and birds) are highly exposed. However, virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB]
