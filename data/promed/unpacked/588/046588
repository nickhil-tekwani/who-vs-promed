The US government [presumably the USDA] confirmed a case of [avian influenza] in Arkansas as the disease spreads into the southeast of the country, the heart of the domestic poultry industry.

Mexico, the top importer of US chicken and turkey, this week [week of 9 Mar 2015] expanded bans to restrict poultry shipments from other states with confirmed cases in commercial flocks: California, Missouri, and Minnesota, the top turkey producer. The H5N2 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed in commercial turkey flock in Boone County, Arkansas, a unit of the Department of Agriculture, said in a statement.

The European Union, Guatemala, Jordan, and more than a dozen other countries have also restricted some US shipments. The disease is spreading after this month [March 2015] entering the Mississippi flyway, a migratory route along the Mississippi River. Before now, this latest outbreak that started in mid-December [2014] had been contained in western states. China has banned all US poultry since January [2015].

"It seems to be spreading fast," Ron Plain, a livestock economist at the University of Missouri in Columbia, said in a telephone interview. "A lot of our foreign customers will stop purchases from impacted states. Usually, the poultry industry can work around that by re-sourcing from a different states. If it continues to spread into more states, it gets to be more of a challenge to be able to shift product around. I would expect you will see a decline in exports."

Shares of Tyson Foods, the largest US chicken producer, fell the most since June [2014] after Reuters earlier reported the suspected Arkansas case. No flocks grown for the company have been diagnosed with avian influenza, spokesman Worth Sparkman said in an e-mailed statement. Shares of Pilgrim's Pride, the 2nd-biggest US chicken producer, tumbled as much as 9 percent.

"This is a big problem, especially for our turkey industry," James Sumner, president of the Stone Mountain, Georgia-based USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, said in a telephone interview [Tue 10 Mar 2015]. "We were down in Mexico this week meeting with their government officials and trying to prevail upon them to treat this as we treat it. There's been no consumer reaction to this here in the US because people trust the system that our government oversees."

This outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza is the 1st in US commercial poultry since 2004. The disease is highly contagious among birds. None of the viruses have been identified in humans, and are not expected to pose a public health risk, a unit of the USDA said in a statement on its website on [10 Mar 2015].

"We're encouraging everybody in the industry to take heightened biosecurity measures," Sumner said. "At the same time, we recognize that if it's in the flyways and in the migratory birds, it's going to show up in these other states. It's just a matter of time. We're telling everybody to take extreme care in trying to prevent any contamination."

[Sadly this strain of avian influenza is moving very fast and is having a huge impact on both commercial producers and the small backyard or hobby producer.
