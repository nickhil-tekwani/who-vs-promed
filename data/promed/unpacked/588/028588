[3] Russia: cases versus deaths
A. Date: Sat 9 May 2020
Source: Moscow Times [edited]
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/08/russia-is-boasting-about-low-coronavirus-deaths-the-numbers-are-deceiving-a70220


Suspicions are growing that Russia is undercounting its coronavirus death toll. Although the country has the 2nd-fastest growing outbreak in the world after the United States, its mortality rate falls far below other countries. On Friday [8 May 2020], Russia reported 187 859 coronavirus cases to only 1723 deaths, putting it in 5th place globally for case numbers with a mortality rate of only 0.9%.

But the official coronavirus information page for the Urals region of Chelyabinsk presents 2 statistics -- the only Russian region to do so -- that help address the disparity. Taken together, they get to the heart of a debate beginning to rage over which country has handled the contagion best. COVID-19, the page reports, has so far killed 3 people in the region, while another 7 tested positive but died from another cause.

The 2nd figure would have boosted Chelyabinsk's coronavirus death toll by 233% but was not included in the state toll because Russia does not automatically list COVID-19 as the cause of death if the deceased tested positive for the coronavirus. According to one expert with knowledge of the Health Ministry's plans, the practice of publishing both sets of figures looks set to become the norm within weeks, indicating that Russia is becoming increasingly transparent about its classification process.

"When this all blows over, I believe mortality figures will be in 2 camps: deaths specifically from COVID-19 and deaths of people who had the virus but weren't killed by it," said Andrei Chernyayev, a pulmonologist who helped write the Moscow Health Department's rules for classifying coronavirus deaths. "I believe Russia is counting accurately while others like Italy, Belgium, and the United States are overcounting," he added.

Varying methods
---------------
While the World Health Organization has published complicated guidelines for classifying coronavirus deaths, experts complained that they arrived late in the pandemic -- on 16 Apr [2020] -- when many countries had already made their own decisions on categorization. Plus, experts said, some countries had by then already counted the bulk of their deaths.

Belgium adopted the most liberal method for classifying coronavirus deaths. To take one example, the country records coronavirus deaths in nursing homes even if the virus was only suspected in the deceased, not confirmed. Unsurprisingly, its coronavirus mortality rate is the highest in the world.

Meanwhile, Italy and the United States -- as well as many European countries -- automatically classify deaths as caused by the coronavirus if the deceased tested positive.

Russia falls on the more conservative end of the spectrum. The country has continued relying on its traditional method of determining the underlying cause of death that sees it carry out autopsies in up to 70% of deaths compared with about 10% in many European countries, said Sergei Timonin, a demographer with the Higher School of Economics. According to Health Ministry guidelines, "in the absence of clinical manifestations and pathological changes, especially in the lungs" as a result of the virus, COVID-19 is not listed as the cause of death. Put another way, if a person has a brain hemorrhage after earlier testing positive for the coronavirus, the cause of death will be classified as the hemorrhage, not COVID-19, Chernyayev explained.

In recent days, Russia has become increasingly transparent about this practice. "We can't put everything down to the coronavirus, otherwise we won't act correctly," the Health Ministry's head pathologist Georgiy Frank told the Ekho Moskvy radio station on Monday [4 May 2020]. "The numbers have to be objective. COVID is often the cause, but not always."

In addition to Chelyabinsk, the Moscow Times found 3 other regions that have announced statistics for deaths from coronavirus and deaths of patients who were coronavirus positive. Using the more liberal classification method in Sverdlovsk would have increased deaths by 233%, while numbers in Saratov would have risen by 200% and in Ryazan by 60%.

Russia is planning to make these figures available nationwide by publishing a database that will contain both sets of statistics for all regions "within several weeks," according to Timonin, who has seen the Health Ministry's preliminary data set. The Health Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Based on the Health Ministry data he has seen, Timonin said that for Moscow, the epicenter of Russia's coronavirus outbreak, the 956 coronavirus deaths that have been recorded account for only about 35% of all coronavirus-positive patient deaths in the Russian capital. "More than 1500 additional patients who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, but in those cases, pathologists decided the virus did not play a decisive role," Timonin said.

Some critics, however, worry that Russia's classification methodology gives officials the ability to pressure pathologists into undercounting coronavirus death totals or massage figures themselves. "I myself see that I have diagnosed more patients who died from the coronavirus in these past 2 weeks than I saw in official statistics," said a pathologist in St. Petersburg who asked to remain anonymous. The pathologist, however, also noted that because of Russia's intensive classification process, there can be a lag of about 2-3 weeks before coronavirus deaths make it into the official data.

Others have pointed to an unofficial tally by Russian doctors that lists over 100 medical workers who have died from the coronavirus and rivals Italy's count -- although the countries' death totals differ drastically -- as evidence of foul play. Spikes in cases of pneumonia in certain regions have also sparked suspicion.

And, despite Russia having reportedly carried out over 4 million coronavirus tests, officials themselves have said that the tests often give the wrong result. Without a positive test result, a pathologist will not register a death having been due to COVID-19.

Measuring the true toll
-----------------------
Experts who spoke with the Moscow Times said that Russia's method for counting deaths allows for some leeway in interpretation. But they added that, even if the country is undercounting, they haven't seen any signs that it is doing so on such a massive scale that would suggest its toll is anywhere close to some of the harder hit countries in the world. They also stressed that, at this point, there is no use in comparing mortality rates in various countries.

Instead, Vladimir Shkolnikov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and director of the Higher School of Economics' International Laboratory for Population and Health Research, believes, like many other experts around the world, that the most effective method for understanding the true toll of the coronavirus pandemic is counting excess mortality -- or all-cause mortality -- deaths during the period. "A death is a well-registered event," he said. "If we see that in a given week there were suddenly a lot more deaths than the same period in previous years, then we can say that there was some short-term factor. This is what we do for heat waves or flu epidemics."

Shkolnikov pointed to counts from the EuroMOMO European mortality monitoring project and newspapers like the Financial Times and the New York Times for countries where data is readily available. In all cases, even in countries counting coronavirus deaths liberally, excess deaths came in higher. At the moment, however, compiling an excess-deaths count for Russia is much trickier. For one, the federal statistics agency Rosstat will only release figures for April at the end of May or in early June [2020]. But even that is not enough for an accurate count, said Shkolnikov. "If the curve in coronavirus cases began growing in the middle of April [2020], the data for the 1st 2 weeks will skew our count," he explained. "We need to look week by week." Those numbers, however, usually come out by the fall of the following year -- or around September 2021 for the current period.

- Russia is fast becoming a coronavirus epicenter, with health workers still reporting PPE shortages. Putin is already thinking about reopening.
- Russia is quickly becoming a new hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 177 000 cases and 1600 deaths.
- On Thursday [7 May 2020], the country set a new one-day record for new cases, reporting 11 231 new cases.
- Inside Russia, healthcare workers are complaining about a lack of protective equipment and censured for voicing suspicions that deaths are being underreported.
- Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin has kept a low profile, left crisis management mostly to regional leadership, and is already eyeing a reopening.

While Russia for a time appeared to escape a serious coronavirus outbreak, the situation there has changed drastically in past weeks.

On Thursday [7 May 2020], the country reported its largest single-day increase in new cases -- of 11 231 -- passing Germany and France to become the 5th-most infected country in the world, according to the Moscow Times. Russia now has the fastest rate of new cases in Europe, and the 2nd-fastest rate of new cases in the world behind the US.

Questions about the numbers
---------------------------
It's possible that Russia's outbreak is even worse than what's being reported. The official numbers on cases and deaths don't seem to line up with coronavirus trends seen elsewhere. As of Thursday [7 May 2020], the country had reported more than 177 000 cases, but just 1625 deaths.

Most countries show a much higher fatality rate than what's being reported in Russia. France, which has reported around 174 000 cases as of Thursday [7 May 2020] -- less than Russia -- has recorded more than 25 000 deaths.

Shortages of protective equipment
---------------------------------
Doctors have been complaining about unsafe working conditions and a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), causing some to go so far as to resign in protest. Dmitry Seryogin, a Russian paramedic, told the Guardian on Tuesday [5 May 2020] that he and his colleagues weren't putting on full protective gear unless a patient specified that they had coronavirus, and that more than a dozen of his coworkers had now contracted the virus.

The outbreak appears to have hit the country's healthcare workers especially hard. In one St Petersburg hospital, 111 ambulance workers have been infected, according to the Guardian. A website has even been set up to honor the Russian doctors who have died in the crisis. As of Thursday [7 May 2020], this number has reached 113. "We're seeing mass infections among medical workers," Andrei Konoval, co-chairman of the independent medical workers' union Deystviye, told the Guardian. "From everything we have seen, hospitals seem to be one of the key vectors for the spread of the disease." In recent weeks, 3 doctors have fallen from hospital windows in bizarre circumstances. Two of them died.

Even as the country's coronavirus outbreak appears to peak, Putin appears to be looking to reopen. On Wednesday [6 May 2020], he ordered regional governors to come up with plans to gradually lift lockdown measures, the Financial Times reported. He also endorsed a plan for industrial and construction companies to resume on 12 May [2020]. Moscow, the hardest-hit city, is extending its own lockdown through 31 May [2020], but with some restrictions being lifted on 13 May [2020] on certain businesses.

"In some places, the tough, justified preventive measures need to stay in place and even be increased, and in some places, it is possible to plan a gradual softening," he said, according to the FT. "But I am saying this again: we cannot jump ahead of ourselves. Any carelessness or haste may cause a setback."

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 50 712 new cases (52.9% of the global newly reported cases), and 3963 deaths (62.0%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 59.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 19.5%, and Peru at 7.3%. Recognizing that USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, if newly confirmed cases from the USA are excluded, then Brazil reported 48.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 18.2%, Mexico at 9.7%, and Canada at 7.4%.

The European region reported 27 993 new cases (29.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 2054 deaths (32.2%). Russia reported 38.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 16.6%, Turkey 6.6%, Spain 5.0%, Italy 4.7% and Germany 4.5%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8699 new cases (9.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 140 deaths (2.2%). Saudi Arabia reported 19.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 18.8%, Iran at 17.9%, Qatar 15.1%, and Kuwait at 7.4%.

The African region reported 2851 new cases (3.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 47 deaths (0.74%). Ghana reported 32.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by South Africa at 23.3%, Nigeria at 13.5%, Algeria at 6.6%, Gabon at 4.1% and Benin at 3.6%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1076 new cases (1.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 55 deaths (0.86%). Singapore reported 71.4% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 11.1%, and Japan at 6.7%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 39.0%, Japan at 26.3%, Malaysia at 22.1%, and both Australia and South Korea at 5.8%.

The South East Asia region reported 4514 new cases (4.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 129 deaths (2.0%). India reported 73.5% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 15.7% and Indonesia at 7.4%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 59.4% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 28.1%, the Maldives at 8.0%, and Sri Lanka at 3.2%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 9 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend. Europe has not been rebounding as high at the end of the weekend, demonstrating decreasing newly confirmed cases. South East Asia has been gradually increasing as the cases continue increasing in India.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.UBA
