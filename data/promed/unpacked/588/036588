Another polio case was reported in Pakistan as health authorities diagnosed an 8 month old baby with poliovirus in North Waziristan on Friday [24 Jun 2022].

According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Health, the polio virus has been confirmed in an 8 month old child. The child belongs to Mirali Union Council No. 7, North Waziristan, bringing the total number of cases reported in Mirali to 8. All children confirmed with wild polio as of late June this year [2022] belong to North Waziristan.

Federal minister for health Abdul Qadir Patel has said that steps are being taken on an emergency basis to prevent the spread of the virus and cooperation is needed to eradicate polio. He said that all parents should ensure polio vaccinations for their children, adding that civil society, media and scholars should play an effective role in eradicating polio.

Earlier this year [2022], authorities celebrated going 12 months without a single case -- the first time that had occurred since eradication efforts began. Pakistan is one of 2 countries, alongside neighbouring Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic, although case numbers have dropped drastically in recent years.

Statement of the 32nd Polio IHR Emergency Committee
---------------------------------------------------

The 32nd meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO director-general on 15 Jun 2022 with committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of global eradication of WPV and cessation of outbreaks of cVDPV2 by end of 2023. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries and territories: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Israel, Malawi, the occupied Palestinian territory, and Pakistan, and written updates were provided by Eritrea and Yemen.

Wild poliovirus [WPV]
The committee was very concerned that a 2nd WPV1 had been detected in south eastern Africa, in Mozambique, close to the border with Malawi where the 1st case was detected. Furthermore, genetic sequencing analysis of the 2 wild polioviruses indicates a single importation event from Pakistan/Afghanistan into south eastern Africa; the importation event is estimated to have occurred between July 2019 (date of the common node between Pakistan viruses and Malawi/Mozambique viruses) and December 2020 (date of the common node between Malawi and Mozambique viruses). COVID-19-related severe movement restrictions implemented in March 2020 in Pakistan and Afghanistan means it is less likely exportation could have occurred between March and December 2020. The Malawi and Mozambique viruses independently evolved for about 0.9 and 1.2 years respectively until first detected and are both considered orphan viruses, and the absence of detection of circulating WPV1 viruses in Malawi and Mozambique between 2019 and 2021 suggests surveillance gaps in south eastern Africa. The original WPV1 cluster in south Asia has not been detected there since December 2020.

The committee noted that the certification of polio eradication African Region was not affected by the outbreak, as it is due to importation rather [than] endemic transmission. The committee also noted the importance of cross-border activities in the outbreak response.

A multicountry response to the WPV1 outbreak is continuing, with 4 immunization rounds being conducted in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia; Zimbabwe will join the response for rounds 3 and 4. In addition, retrospective case searching, surveillance strengthening and improving essential immunization are all ongoing. The committee noted that while administrative coverage was high, problems with population data made these coverage estimates unreliable. Monitoring coverage by Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) showed far lower coverage, and the committee noted that countries that have long been polio free needed assistance from GPEI partners in the implementation of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs).

The committee was concerned about the recent outbreak of WPV1 in the North Waziristan district of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province in Pakistan. Since the last Emergency Committee (EC) meeting in February 2022, Pakistan has reported 10 WPV1 [now 11] cases from North Waziristan and 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples from the neighboring district of Bannu. With the ongoing WPV1 circulation in South KP, the risks to the rest of Pakistan has escalated.

The key challenges which hampered progress in southern KP include the complex security situation, specifically in North and South Waziristan, which resulted in inadequate access, missed children and reduced quality of SIAs. Community resistance with refusals to vaccination (including vaccination boycotts and fake finger-marking without vaccination), lack of female frontline workers and high turnover of frontline workers, and weak health infrastructure and service delivery all pose challenges. The 10 WPV1 cases reported in 2022 are zero dose for routine immunization, zero dose or under-immunized in SIAs, and are from refusal families.

Another challenge in South KP is the suboptimal routine immunization (RI) and progress on strengthening RI in South KP is slow.

The committee commended the dedication of frontline health workers who continue to seek every child who needed vaccination and extended its sympathy to the families of the 17 health workers who were killed in February 2022 in Takhar and Kunduz in Afghanistan. It is encouraging that 2.6 million previously unreached children have been vaccinated, and the number of children not yet accessed by immunization teams was down to an estimated 700 000. Data provided to the committee clearly showed that where house-to-house polio campaigns are possible the vaccine coverage is far higher.

There has been continuous/steady progress in the rest of Pakistan with no WPV1 detection in last 11 months. Last WPV1 case and positive environmental sample outside of South KP were detected in January 2021 and July 2021 respectively.

Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV)
Eritrea has reported detection of cVDPV2 for the first time, and the virus is most closely linked to a virus found in Sudan in 2020, indicating that both new international spread and missed transmission has occurred. Furthermore, the detection of cVDPV2 in Ghana, Togo and CÃ´te d'Ivoire appears to have resulted from new spread from Nigeria. A new outbreak of cVDPV3 has been detected in Israel in a population sub-group who refuse vaccination. Environmental detection has also occurred in sites in the occupied Palestinian territory. High levels of transmission of cVDPV2 are occurring in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, and eastern DR Congo, which have reported 115 out of 127 cases to date in 2022. Because of the conflict, no immunization rounds have been conducted in northern Yemen.

Despite the ongoing decline in the number of cases and lineages circulating, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 remains high as evidenced by recent spread from Nigeria to West Africa. The large amount of transmission occurring in Nigeria along with chronically low immunization coverage is now resulting in spread to multiple countries, while the detection of cVDPV2 in Eritrea of an orphan virus means that missed transmission has occurred in the Horn of Africa also. The persistence of cVDPV2 in Somalia is another concern. The successful introduction of novel OPV2 and re-introduction of tOPV are expected to mitigate the risk of international spread of cVDPV2, particularly as supply issues are resolved in the 2nd half of 2022.

The committee noted that the roll out of wider use of novel OPV2 continues under Emergency Use Listing. The committee also noted the delays concerning the importance of timely, quality outbreak response with countries avoiding timely response with monovalent OPV2 or trivalent OPV, preferring to wait for novel OPV2 to become available. The committee noted that SAGE recommends that speed in the rollout of any of these 3 vaccines is of paramount importance and countries should avoid delays associated with waiting for novel OPV2.

The committee noted that the outbreak in Israel again shows that even countries with high immunization coverage can have pockets of high-risk children which can sustain an outbreak.

Conclusion
Although heartened by the apparent progress, the Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC and the importance of exploring alternative IHR measures in the future but concluded that there are still significant risks as exemplified by the importation of virus into Malawi and Mozambique. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:

Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:
Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 remains:
- the current outbreak of WPV1 in Pakistan where there have been 10 cases in just the last 3 month which must be contained;
- high-risk mobile populations in Pakistan such as migrants, nomads, displaced populations, particularly Afghan refugees represent a specific risk of international spread;
- the unpredictable situation in Afghanistan, with ongoing and deteriorating humanitarian crises including food insecurity and risk of financial collapse disrupting eradication activities;
- the detection of WPV1 in Malawi and Mozambique, particularly as the route from Pakistan to Africa remains unknown;
- the suboptimal immunization coverage obtained through recent rounds in southeastern Africa, meaning ongoing transmission could be occurring;
- complacency leading to inadequate surveillance means that such transmission could be missed;
- the large pool of unvaccinated "zero dose" children in Afghanistan in formerly inaccessible areas in many provinces, while decreasing, still represent a major risk of re-introduction of WPV1 in those communities;
- although COVID-19 cases are currently at low levels in Afghanistan and Pakistan, further waves of cases are possible, which may have unpredictable adverse impacts on polio surveillance and on immunization activities.

Ongoing risk of cVDPV2 international spread:
Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to remain high:
- the actual ongoing cross-border spread including into newly infected countries;
- the explosive outbreak of cVDPV2 in northern Yemen, and ongoing high transmission in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Nigeria, which have caused international spread to neighbouring countries;
- the lack of timely high quality responses in many countries;
- the ever-widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016 and consequently high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas, especially the 4 areas mentioned above;
- the same factors regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as mentioned above.

Other factors include:
- Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies including COVID-19, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.
- Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with cVDPV -- that is., Nigeria, Niger and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.

Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by affected countries, the director-general accepted the Committee's assessment and on 20 Jun 2022 determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The Director-General endorsed the Committee's recommendations for countries meeting the definition for "States infected with WPV1, cVDPV1 or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread," "States infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread" and for "States no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV" and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective 20 Jun 2022.

[I strongly suggest reading the report in its entirety. The "new" information we have been observing this year [2022] with importation of WPV1 into Africa and importation of the OPV2 virus into the UK -- both very sobering occurrences that highlight the decreasing vaccination coverages in many countries, including the wealthier countries. The polio eradication effort has been ongoing since 1985 in the Americas region and 1988 globally. Was the boat missed?.... Polio remains a PHEIC. - Mod.MPP
