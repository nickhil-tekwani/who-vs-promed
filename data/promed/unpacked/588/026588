Situation Information
---------------------
Since 2006, parts of Asia and the Indian Ocean have reported
chikungunya fever activity. Several countries have increased
surveillance for this disease, and cases continue to be reported
throughout this region.

Chikungunya fever is a disease caused by a virus that is spread to
people through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms can include
sudden fever, joint pain with or without swelling, chills, headache,
nausea, vomiting, lower back pain, and a rash. Chikungunya mainly
occurs in areas of Africa and Asia. In 2007, limited transmission of
chikungunya virus occurred in Italy.

The following examples highlight some recent chikungunya activity in
Asia and the Indian Ocean region:

Thailand
--------
As of 29 Sep 2009, a large outbreak of chikungunya fever has affected
the country, particularly the southern region including some tourist
destinations, such as Phuket. According to the Ministry of Public
Health in Thailand, more than 42 300 cases have been documented this
year in 50 provinces. Reports from Thailand show that chikungunya
virus continues to circulate throughout the country.

Malaysia
--------
As of 26 Sep 2009, the Ministry of Health in Malaysia has reported
more than 3185 cases of chikungunya fever. The most affected areas are
the northern provinces of Kedah, followed by Kelantan, Selangor,
Perak, and Sarawak.

Reunion
-------
As of 28 Aug 2009, the French government has reported 3 confirmed
cases of chikungunya fever on the island of Reunion. No deaths have
been reported. All cases occurred in the Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains area,
on the western side of the island. However, mosquito activity reports
show that the virus is circulating throughout Reunion.

Advice for Travelers
--------------------
No medications or vaccines are available to prevent a person from
getting sick with chikungunya fever. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people traveling to areas where
chikungunya fever has been reported take the following steps to
protect themselves from mosquito bites:

- When outdoors during the day or night, use insect repellent on exposed skin.
- Look for a repellent that contains one of the following active
ingredients: DEET, picaridin (KBR 3023), Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus/PMD,
or IR3535. Always follow the instructions on the label when you use
the repellent.

In general, repellents protect longer against mosquito bites when they
have a higher concentration (percent) of any of these active
ingredients. However, concentrations above 50 percent do not offer a
distinct increase in protection time. Products with less than 10
percent of an active ingredient may offer only limited protection,
often only 1­2 hours. The American Academy of Pediatrics approves the
use of repellents with up to 30 percent DEET on children over 2 months
of age.

If you get sick with a fever and think you may have chikungunya fever,
you should seek medical care. Although there is no specific treatment
for the disease, a doctor may be able to help treat your symptoms.
Avoid getting any other mosquito bites, because if you are sick and a
mosquito bites you, it can spread the disease to other people.

For more travel health information, see the destinations section and
search for the country you are planning to visit.

More Information
----------------
The incubation period for chikungunya (time from infection to illness)
is usually 3­7 days, but it can range from 2-12 days. Chikungunya
fever typically lasts a few days to 2 weeks, but some patients feel
fatigue lasting several weeks. Most patients report severe joint pain
or arthritis, which may last for weeks or months. The symptoms are
similar to those of dengue fever, but, unlike some types of dengue,
people who have chikungunya fever do not experience hemorrhage
(bleeding) or go into shock. People with chikungunya fever generally
get better on their own and rarely die from the disease.

Medical care for chikungunya fever is usually focused on treating the
symptoms of the disease. Bed rest, fluids, and mild pain medications
such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may
relieve symptoms of fever and aching, provided there are no medical
contraindications for using these medications. Most people are not
sick enough to need to stay in the hospital. All people who become
sick with chikungunya fever should be protected against additional
mosquito bites to reduce the risk of further transmission of the virus.
