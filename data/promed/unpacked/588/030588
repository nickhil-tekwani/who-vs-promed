A rare disease [virus] not seen in humans in South Australia [SA] for
35 years has been detected in Lower Murray region birds.

Health officials said the Murray Valley encephalitis virus was spread
by mosquitoes, with the last reported case in SA in 1974. The state's
chief medical officer, Paddy Phillips, yesterday [29 Mar 2011] said
the vast majority of people who became infected had no symptoms or
only mild symptoms. "In about one in 1000 cases, symptoms can worsen,
with increasing confusion, headaches, drowsiness, neck stiffness,
tremors and seizures," he said.

The disease has no specific treatment or vaccine.

[The appearance of MVE virus infection in birds in South Australia is
not surprising, but of concern. The recent unusually heavy rains and
flooding in the state have created breeding sites for mosquito
vectors.
