2004/055 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
-----------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance
for 2003 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2004/018) from
the following countries: France, Germany, Israel and Netherlands.
When a consignment has been re-exported, and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance
made because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications
of non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, and/or missing or
invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that
the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their notifications.

[Note that _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ was
found in tomato seed originating in China. Strategies for avoiding
the disease include pre-season sanitation of all equipment, pipes,
containers etc., use of certified seed and transplants, use of
available tolerant cultivars, use of seed that has been treated to
inactivate the pathogen, rogue out volunteer plants and solanaceous
weeds near production glasshouses, and crop rotation in tomato fields
(3 years of planting non-host crops). If disease occurs in
glasshouses, eradicate entire production. If disease is present in
fields, use appropriate bactericides, plow down the crop and
incorporate into soil for active decomposition.
