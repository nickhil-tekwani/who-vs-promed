Joint high-level mission on the current H5N1 situation in Egypt
-----
Egypt, 8-12 Mar 2015

Executive summary

Introduction
----
Between November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.

Summary of findings

Animal health (Please see in commentary below)

Human health
----
Concomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.

This upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.

Likewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.

Despite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:
1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;
2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;
3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;
4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.

Nevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.

The Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.

Genetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.

The Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality

The way forward
----
A successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.

The government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.

Within 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.

[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.

The updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths. This represents an increase in human cases over what has been observed in previous years in Egypt. Case fatality appears to be lower in Egypt compared with other countries, likely because children are more commonly infected in Egypt. The task of controlling spread of the virus represents a serious challenge to Egypt. While there is no evidence for other than occasional spread from human to human, the risk exists and must be closely monitored.

[The executive summary of the mission includes a section on the animal health aspects of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt. The following extracts deserve attention:

"A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use."

"The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force. Since 2007, through USAID-funded FAO projects, considerable investment has been made to improve the animal health surveillance system in Egypt, including the establishment of 230 epidemiological units covering almost all districts and governorate; 4 animal disease surveillance systems (passive reporting, community animal health outreach, targeted live bird market reporting, and active surveillance) are maintained by the Veterinary Services. Surveillance data are regularly shared between national stakeholders and with other relevant partners (OFFLU, EMPRES-i, etc.), including through publication in peer-reviewed journals". - Mod.AS]
