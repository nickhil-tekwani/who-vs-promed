The recent detection of the pandemic H1N1 virus in pets signals
another facet in the evolving dynamics of the 2009 influenza pandemic.
The robust animal health surveillance systems in place in the US and
awareness amongst stakeholders can take credit for the swift
recognition of H1N1 transmission to a cat and a ferret.

However, where such systems do not exist, rapid detection may not be
possible as awareness may be low or resources limited. Regarding the
current fears about hajj-related H1N1 transmission: firstly, in the
region, and despite the preferred WHO/CDC nomenclature of 'influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus', the misleading name 'swine flu' is used
more often than not. Joining the Arabic word for swine (transliterated
'alkhanaazeer') leaves an impression in a subset of the population
that, there being no local swine population, the risk of transmission
to animals is nil. It may, taking Mod.CP's cue, lead to disease
detectives taking a wrong detour.

Secondly, the "unusual" hosts of H1N1 are not scanty. Feral cats are
ubiquitous in the hajj ecology and intimately intermingle with the
human milieu. They are definitely a bio-security risk for
slaughterhouses and captive breeding operations. Camels are
susceptible to influenza A and B and other respiratory viruses
(Intisar et al 2009). In particular, fatal influenza outbreaks due to
another human H1N1 virus have been reported in camels in Mongolia
(Anchlan et al 1996; Yamnikova et al 1993). [The camels in Mongolia
are two-humped Bactrian, a different species from the one-humped
dromedaries of Arabia. - Mod.JW].

Hopefully, the Ministry of Health's measures will seriously minimize
human-to-human transmission. However, if transmission fears manifest,
homebound asymptomatic pilgrims may shed and transmit pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus to their animals in say Nigeria or Sudan, which may remain
undetected. A knowledge-based risk assessment of the complex ways in
which these and other animals that are part of the micro hajj ecology
interact with different pilgrim groups and their peculiarities may be
warranted. Such risk assessment dovetails into Mod.CP's earlier
suggestion for active surveillance that does not rely on chance and
permits better understanding of the distribution of pandemic H1N1.
This has been recommended by FAO/WHO. If you do not look, you don't
find.

[Dr Fagbo has made some interesting points regarding areas of
pilgrimage and a different strata between the animals and the people.
As we look at more animals, for example camels or dogs, we may find a
wide variety of animals susceptible to the virus, not because it is
supposedly unique, but because they are already susceptible to
influenza viruses and we have only now tuned in to look for this one.

It is indeed sad and inappropriate that the popular media persists in
an inappropriate label for this virus. It takes only a little more
effort to correctly identify the virus. - Mod.TG]
