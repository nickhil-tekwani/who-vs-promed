Precautionary measures have been put in place after a suspected
cholera outbreak on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, the provincial
health department said on Thursday [26 Jun 2008]. Spokesperson Chris
Maxon said cases of suspected cholera were reported in a hall where
victims of last week's floods were being sheltered.

Maxon said 1 of the cases was of an 1-month-old baby boy with
diarrhea. "A team of environmental officers are on site, and all
persons reporting with diarrhea will be treated," he said. "The
department will be distributing pre-treated water to all persons in
the hall and surrounding communities as part of the department's
response."

[2] Cholera - Uganda (southeast)

At least 31 people have died of cholera and over 290 infected in the
eastern districts of Butaleja, Mbale, Pallisa and Manafwa. The health
minister, Dr. Stephen Mallinga, attributed the infections to River
Manafwa, which he said was contaminated from Bugobero. The river
moves through the 4 districts and empties its waters in the swamps in
the low-lying rice-growing areas of Butaleja.

He added that the outbreak reported in the past 6 weeks followed the
April 2008 heavy rains. "Kachonga, Maizimasa and Butaleja
sub-counties have recorded 65 cases and 4 deaths," he said in a
statement to Parliament yesterday [24 Jun 2008]. Mallinga said they
had reactivated the district cholera task forces, provided supplies
and set up treatment centers. The Government, he explained, was
distributing jerrycans to the people to use instead of water pots.

Pallisa has reported 110 cases and 8 deaths and the most affected
sub-counties were Kasodo, Buseta.

An outbreak of cholera has been confirmed in the Kisumu municipality
in the western region, a senior health official has said.

"At least 13 out of 38 cases sampled for cholera have tested
positive," Shahnaaz Sharif, the senior deputy director of medical
services in Kenya's health ministry, said. Sharif said 34 people had
also been admitted to the Kisumu district hospital, with a total of
134 cases reported since the outbreak began on 6 Jun 2008. So far, he
said, no deaths had been registered.

The most affected areas included the slums of Manyatta, Nyalenda and
Obunga in the municipality, which lies in the district of Kisumu
East. "The new outbreak is attributable to the onset of recent rains
in the region that have resulted in the contamination of water wells
-- the main sources of water for the residents," he said.

At least 376 cases and 12 deaths have been reported in the Kisumu
East district since January 2008 when an outbreak of the disease was
reported in the rural areas. The outbreak, which also affected the
districts of Bondo, Homa Bay, Kisii South, Kisumu West, Migori,
Nyando, Rongo, Siayathe and Suba in the western region, led to the
deaths of 46 people with 832 cases being reported, according to a UN
World Health Organization (WHO) report on 19 Apr 2008.

3 northern provinces of Ninh Binh, Bac Ninh and Hai Phong have
received many cases of acute diarrhea in June 2008, reported the
Preventive Health Department on Tuesday [24 Jun 2008]. Among them,
several cases of the cholera bacterium were found, 30 of which were
discovered in Bac Ninh Province.

According to Bac Ninh Province's health department, 49 patients were
admitted in hospitals suffering from acute diarrhea including 27
cases inflicted with cholera. Most of the patients were residents of
Chan Lac Village, whose lake tested positive for the bacterium. The
department disinfected the lake and has warned the locals not to use
the water there.

Nguyen Van Luyen, director of infectious disease control and vaccine
bio-products department from the department of health said they spent
considerable efforts in educating people on the importance of
maintaining safe and hygienic living standards to prevent diseases.

After the ministry declared that the epidemic of acute diarrhea was
over at the end of 2007, it re-appeared in January 2008 and then
again in March 2008, said Nguyen Huy Nga, director of the Department
for Preventive Health and Environment.

While the number of patients has reduced, patients afflicted by the
disease are still streaming into hospitals. In May 2008, the Ministry
of Health recorded 1400 cases of acute diarrhea including 170 cases
positive for cholera. Since the beginning of 2008, Viet Nam has
recorded nearly 500 cholera cases.

[The serotype of _V. cholerae_ previously reported in Viet Nam has
been 01 Ogawa. As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V.
cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and therefore are of no
use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O
(somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_
into 139 known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V.
cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139)
strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has
been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C;
and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C). The latter serotype is relatively
rare.

The Rawalpindi General Hospital (RGH) received another 5 suspected
patients of cholera Tuesday [24 Jun 2008] taking the total number of
cases of the infectious disease so far registered at RGH to 40. The
RGH has received confirmatory reports of 23 suspects of the disease
from the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, within past 24

superintendent at RGH Dr Fiaz Ahmed Khan while talking to 'The News'

confirmation reports from NIH in 9 cases.

According to hospital administration, most of the suspected cases of
cholera were reported at the Accident and Emergency Department of the
hospital. All cases of cholera including suspected and confirmed ones
so far reached RGH are below the age of 13 years. At present 8
patients including suspected and confirmed ones of cholera are
undergoing treatment at the RGH.
