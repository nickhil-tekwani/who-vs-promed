Doctors issue disease warning as rate of measles cases doubles
--------------------------------------------------------------
A growing number of children and teenagers have been hospitalised following an upsurge in cases of measles, doctors said yesterday [Fri 1 Jun 2012]. Cases of the infectious illness have so far more than doubled nationally compared with the same period in 2011, affecting 51 children in the worst cluster in West Cork. Official figures for the week ending 19 May 2012 show 64 measles cases were reported nationally, up from 31 during the same period in 2011. More young people have been affected since.

Two teenagers, who have the disease in west Cork, have been hospitalised, "showing just how infectious measles is", said Dr Kevin Kelleher, head of health protection in the HSE [Health Service Executive]. The fear is that, as the school holidays get under way, the disease will spread further among young people who have not been vaccinated. "People will be travelling over the summer months, increasing the risk of coming into contact with measles," he said.

He revealed: "Most of the children infected in Cork are teenagers and 88 per cent of cases have never received any dose of MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine. "This large and rapidly spreading outbreak is a major concern. Vaccination with MMR is the only way to protect against measles. Failure to vaccinate leaves children exposed to a serious and potentially fatal disease," said Dr Kelleher. "It exposes other children, especially babies under one year of age, to this disease. Children under one are those most likely to be liable to severe complications and possibly death."

The [disease] starts with a rash in the mouth that looks similar to sugar granules. Then, a red raised rash starts at the hairline and travels down the body. Patients can have a high temperature, itchy eyes,conjunctivitis and a dry cough. Complications can include pneumonia and ear and eye infections. Around one in 1000 develop encephalitis -- swelling of the brain -- which can be fatal. It is transmitted when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes.

The MMR vaccine is provided at 12 months of age and again at preschool age, so babies under a year old are not protected. Children younger than 13 who missed out on the vaccine can still get it free from their general practitioner. Older children can get the vaccine free but may have to pay an administration fee. The vaccine takes effect within 6 to 10 days.

Measles outbreak spreads
------------------------
A major outbreak of measles in West Cork has prompted the HSE to urge parents to ensure their children are vaccinated. In an interview on RTE's "This Week" programme on Sunday, Dr Kevin Kelleher, the HSE's assistant national director of health protection, confirmed that more than 50 children have been affected, including 2 who have been hospitalised.

Dr Brian O'Connell, a GP who has worked in Schull for more than 20 years, was also interviewed on the programme and he said that both he and his colleague treated as many as 30 cases. The doctor described measles as "a very contagious illness" and said: "it seems to me that all the unvaccinated children seem to be getting infected by measles. 'Most of these have been in teenagers in the schools. We have seen some younger infants but very few, thank God, because they are the ones who are more affected by measles. They are more prone to complications." He said the high prevalence of the disease in West Cork might have something to do with the controversy about the MMR vaccine, particularly around 1998, when a lot of these children would, or could, have been vaccinated. Dr O'Connell said they are trying to address the situation by offering vaccinations to children between the ages of 6 months to one year old because they are the ones who are most at risk.

The doctor reported that they have put on special clinics in the last week and "thankfully, we have had a good turn-out for those. The message seems to be getting through that vaccination is the way forward with this. If you are vaccinated your chance of getting measles is very slim indeed." He also confirmed that it is not too late for those who are in their teens: "If you get an MMR vaccine now it might not offer protection immediately but the protection would take about 2 to 3 weeks to set in so it is not a waste of time." With teenagers facing into their end-of-year and state exams, Dr O'Connell said: "I hope this won't impact on them, but I do think all children should be vaccinated to protect them."

Although there have been no fatalities as a result of the West Cork outbreak, Dr Kevin Kelleher outlined the seriousness of the situation saying: "measles is one of the most infectious diseases there is. Historically, it is clear that if you are not vaccinated there is almost a 100 per cent chance of you getting measles if you come in contact with someone who has got measles, so it is highly contagious." Commenting on the infamous Lancet article about the vaccine, which was subsequently withdrawn, Dr Kelleher said: "measles is totally preventable. The vaccine works extremely well. But the difficulty is we are still seeing that legacy in the uptake levels for the routine vaccine for children aged one and 5."

The HSE has confirmed that most of the children infected in Cork are teenagers and 88 per cent of the cases have never received any dose of the MMR vaccine. Commenting on the statistic, a health authority spokesperson warned that this large and rapidly spreading outbreak "is a major concern not only for the people of West Cork but for the whole of Ireland." In a bid to try to increase the number of children nationally that are protected against measles, the HSE said it will be rolling out a national measles vaccination campaign that will be introduced in all schools from September, starting in secondary schools and then extending to primary schools.

Fresh cases of measles at Lewes school
--------------------------------------
Fresh cases of measles have been reported at a school. Priory School in Mountfield Road, Lewes, has issued a warning to parents that several more pupils have been diagnosed as having contracted the disease. Staff have written to parents warning them that measles spreads easily and poses a particular danger to young babies, pregnant women, and the vulnerable. The letter continues: "If your child has measles please keep them away from school and away from other people for 4 days after the day the rash starts. This is so they do not pass the disease to others."

Schools in Lewes, Brighton, Hove, Crawley, and Heathfield have all reported outbreaks of measles this year.

Massive rise of measles cases in Hackney
----------------------------------------
Shocking figures obtained by the Gazette have revealed the number of children contracting measles in Hackney has skyrocketed, with 36 youngsters coming down with the disease last month compared with just 7 in May last year. The spike in cases means the figures are 5 times higher than the same period in 2011 and health bosses fear the increase is due to parents failing to have their children vaccinated against the illness.

Measles is highly contagious, with victims suffering a fever, runny nose, red eyes, and a hacking cough as well as the distinctive itchy, spotty rash. The illness can be fatal if other complications arise. Experts say in order to protect the whole community, 95 per cent of people have to have the full course of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which involves a first dose being given to children after their first birthday, and a second dose when they're three. But in Hackney, just 85.7 per cent of children have the first dose, while only 77.4 per cent go on to have the second course -- well below the 95 per cent coverage needed.

It's believed the take-up of the free immunisation fell after false research purporting to show a link between the vaccination and development of the brain disorder autism. The findings were later completely discredited and withdrawn, and the doctor responsible for the report was found to be "dishonest and irresponsible" by the General Medical Council, and no longer has a license to practise medicine.

Dr Lesley Mountford, joint director of public health in the City and Hackney for NHS North East London and the City said it's never too late to get immunised, and added: "If your child has not had two doses of MMR they may be at risk. Measles is an unpleasant disease and one in every ten people who get the disease could end up in hospital with complications and sadly one in every thousand could die. Immunisation is the safest way to protect your child for life. To ensure that your child is protected please contact your GP practice or health visitor."

After years of calm, measles cases spike in northern Israel
-----------------------------------------------------------
There has been a significant increase in cases of measles in northern Israel, according to recent research carried out by Israel's Health Ministry. The study by the ministry's epidemiology department found 96 cases of measles by the end of May 2012, compared with only 4 cases of the disease in the same period in 2011, 14 in 2010, and 2 in 2009. Some 63 of the cases this year -- 65 per cent -- were reported in the north, while 20 per cent were in Tel Aviv -- some 20 per cent -- eight cases in the centre of the country, four in Haifa, one in Jerusalem, and one in southern Israel.

The reported increase comes after four years of calm. In contrast to the previous country-wide outbreak, the current spike is concentrated in northern Israeli towns where vaccination rates stand at less than 90 per cent, among refugees communities in Tel Aviv, and especially among babies who [are] not yet one year old -- the minimum vaccination age in Israel.

In light of the outbreak, the Health Ministry is now completing immunization programs among populations that refused to be vaccinated in the past, most of which are from small towns in the north. Family members of those suffering from measles are also eligible for preventative vaccination. A large part of those who refuse to be vaccinated do so on ideological grounds, also citing possible side effects and exposure to toxins.

The minimum vaccination age for measles will also be reduced to 6 months among refugee populations, to help curb the outbreak. Vaccinations will also be provided to family members of measles sufferers. "The Health Ministry also subsidizes vaccinations for refugees who are not covered by Israel's national health insurance law, and a vaccination program is being carried out in all day care centers of refugee children," the health ministry said.

According to the preliminary results of a new program which documents vaccination programs among babies in Israeli towns, less than 90 per cent of the population are vaccinated in a number of Israeli towns, which raises the risk of outbreak of infectious diseases, such as measles. Northern Israeli towns with vaccination rates of less than 90 per cent include Yodfat, Klil, Beit Keshet, Yesud HaMa'ala, Merom Galil, Harduf, Alonei Abba, Tivon, Binyamina, Pardes Hanna. Low vaccination rates were also found in 3 southern Bedouin towns -- Hura, Tarabin, and al-Atrash -- and in a number of mainly ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in Jerusalem.

Overall vaccination rates in Israel stand at 94 per cent. In 2010, the World Health Organization adopted a vaccination rate target of at least 90 per cent of the population in countries across the world, and a target of 80 per cent for initial vaccinations for children. The minimum age for initial vaccinations for children in Israel is one.

Somalia: steep increase in measles cases
----------------------------------------
Measles is a major killer in Somalia and it's easily preventable. Vaccination -- with high coverage and proper vaccine management -- is critical to saving lives in Somalia. MSF asks all authorities to support emergency vaccination programmes throughout Somalia.

A woman came to the Medecins Sans Frontieres supported hospital 2 days ago with 6 of her children. All 7 of them have measles. She says she knows the signs for measles but she didn't come in earlier because she lives too far away and transport is expensive. She first tried traditional medicine -- applying burns to various areas of the body -- and only came to the hospital when her youngest child, a one year old boy named Jakob, died. Left untreated, measles can be deadly, especially for young children. With in-patient medical care most patients survive, but the best gains are made in prevention through vaccination.

All over Somalia, measles has been flaring up, especially over the past 6 months. MSF has treated 4288 patients for measles since January, the vast majority of them children, in its health centers across Somalia. [Total number of patients treated for measles in 4 regions over Jan-May 2012 period (305; 467; 237; and 3222 cases) and in 1 region over Jan-Apr 2012 period (57 cases)]. Even in areas where medical authorities say vaccination campaigns are effective, MSF is still treating dozens of patients every day. In Burco, an area unaffected by conflict that routinely has vaccination campaigns, MSF has received 586 measles patients since the start of the year. Such prevalence could not be possible if there was adequate vaccination coverage.

Vaccination requires not only good coverage, which should reach over 90 per cent to stem the spread, but also requires that the vaccines are transported and stored at the right temperature. That could help explain outbreaks in areas declared vaccinated. Even more worrying, though, are areas where authorities refuse vaccination outright. In several locations MSF is denied permission to vaccinate with the explanation that higher up authorities simply won't allow it.

Measles has raged across Somalia for the past few months and many of MSF's wards have been full of infected children. A woman sits on a floor mat in MSF's makeshift measles ward surrounded by her 6 children waiting for them to be well enough to travel. Her family was hit, like most, by the drought last year. They lost about half their livestock but they were recovering until measles hit their village.

In October 2011, two MSF aid workers, Montserrat Serra and Blanca Thiebaut, were abducted in Dadaab refugee camp in Northern Kenya while carrying out emergency assistance for the Somali population. They remain in captivity, and MSF, while still responding to acute crisis requesting live saving interventions, has put on hold the opening of any non-emergency projects in Somalia until their release.

WHO reports 27 measles deaths in Sindh
--------------------------------------
Karachi: As the reports surfaced indicating 27 deaths this year so far under 5 year old children due to measles, Health minister Sindh Dr Sagheer Ahmed denied having any such information and said he would personally inquire into the matter.

Prof Iqbal Memon, president elect of Pakistan Pediatrics Association (PPA) Centre disclosed that a representative of Disease Early Warning System, WHO Sindh presented a report to the Sindh Health Department officials in a meeting held at Inspection and Import Depot (IID) office some days back that 27 children under 5 years of age had died of measles from January to May 2012. Talking to PPI, he said 2 meetings had already been held between concerned health department officials and foreign agencies to prevent the further spread of measles.

When contacted, health minister Dr Sagheer Ahmed said he had no knowledge about deaths occurred due to measles, adding he would collect information from the health department officials. He informed that Peoples Primary HealthCare Initiative (PPHI) and all EDOs had already been directed to control measles and prepare report about its cases, even though PPHI does not fall under the health department authority.

However, Memon said the disease can spread quickly when people are crowded together. Children living in congested conditions have to be immunized immediately to protect them from this dangerous illness. He said all district health offices must spread awareness about this disease and doctors should collect proper data and inform their officials.

Chief minister Sindh Syed Qaim Ali Shah has already formed a technical committee to control measles in Sindh. Focal person of the Technical Committee on Polio and Measles Ahmed Sheikh, talking to PPI, said the agencies involved in the committee include Expended Program on Immunization (EPI), World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the Pakistan Pediatrics Association (PPA), and Disease Early Warning System Sindh. He said an anti-measles campaign would be started through media from Monday.

Provincial coordinator of Disease Early Warning System (DEWS), WHO, Sindh chapter Dr Soomar Khoso said we have already collected data on measles in Sindh and provided it to EPI Sindh. He said measles is a killer diseases and highly contagious. It also causes diarrhea, pneumonia, eye infection, and many other serious ailments to children. Measles can be protected by vaccination, while children should get at least 2 doses of measles vaccine. The children should get their 1st dose at completion of one month age irrespective of their previous illness. They should get 2nd dose at the age of 15 months, or any time during the second year of life provided one month has passed since the first dose is given. He informed that measles vaccine is not being given door-to-door like polio vaccination. He requested parents to take their babies to the nearest health care facility for measles and other routine EPI vaccines.

In charge Expended Program on Immunization (EPI) Dr Mazhar Khamisani said hundreds of patients are reported with suspected measles. He said we have collected their samples and sent them to Islamabad for test, and it would be premature to comment on the issue before getting final reports from Islamabad.

Confirmed cases: children with measles may top 21 000 by year-end
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Islamabad: Officials voiced fears on Friday [8 Jun 2012] that as many as 21 000 children could contract measles by the year's end. Already, some 2143 confirmed cases of measles have been reported across the country. According to documents provided to The Express Tribune, the majority of confirmed cases were reported from Sindh.

A total of 737 were reported from Sindh, followed by 648 from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 582 cases from Punjab, 102 from Balochistan, 49 from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), and 14 cases from Islamabad. An official who requested anonymity told The Express Tribune, that he works closely with The Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). He said that these cases were reported to the EPI and samples were received at the National Institute of Health (NIH). The official added that it is estimated that the figure of confirmed cases is double what has been reported. Officials believe measles remains underreported by most provinces/districts.

"This underreporting, better known as hidden measles cases, usually results in an outbreak of the disease and claims many innocent lives. Unfortunately, many do not understand this," he said. However, the documents also showed that in the past, many districts reported very high coverage of measles vaccination and their coverage figures were blindly endorsed by the provincial offices. Subsequently, it was found that the reports provided by the provinces were exaggerated. It further stated that now, the Federal EPI ministry is ready to resume a measles follow-up campaign in the remaining districts. Considering the recent outbreaks and surveillance data, the agencies of Fata and districts of Balochistan have been prioritised. UNICEF has secured vaccines for these districts/agencies and WHO has agreed to provide the operational cost.

"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease and spreads very fast. If one child has the virus, he can infect others very easily. If cases are reported immediately then it becomes easy to control the spread of the virus. Measles accounts for one in every five childhood deaths among diseases preventable by vaccine," the official said. The official added that a major contributing factor to recent cases of measles were poor routine immunisation practices in the country. "If the routine immunisation went according to schedule then I bet there would be no need to run national measles campaigns," he said. "Officials who are supposed to ensure routine immunisation are not paying much attention to it and the vaccinators are underpaid."

Pakistan remains one of the most important countries worldwide for measles elimination activities. WHO estimates that every year about 2.1 million children are infected with measles in Pakistan. When contacted, programme manager of EPI Dr Zahid Larik said the federal government is providing an ample amount of logistical support and vaccination to all provinces. "It is their duty to ensure routine immunisation to each and every child in their region and to protect them from such a fatal disease," he said.

Alarming rise in measles cases
------------------------------
Last year, the US saw 222 measles cases -- the highest number since 1996 -- a statistic that public health officials are now using to remind kids and adults to get vaccinated. And because 200 of the identified cases were imported from abroad -- and from countries one might not immediately associate with the disease, including France and Italy -- the latest warning is especially important to those traveling.

Further analysis of the US measles cases revealed that 65 per cent of those infected had not been vaccinated -- and of those who were not immunized or were unaware of their vaccination status, 85 per cent were eligible to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The worst part is, those who avoid getting the vaccine are putting not only themselves at greater risk of measles and other diseases, but they are also jeopardizing the health of infants who are too young to get the shot and thus rely on herd immunity to stay protected.

Though measles seems like a long-forgotten disease for many Americans, it continues to kill 164 000 people globally each year. In 2011 alone, France reported over 15 000 measles cases, while another 5000-plus occurred in Italy. The infectious disease community is thus advising that all travelers get vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to their trip.

According to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, people of all ages should have the MMR vaccine. And though it is routinely given to children at one year of age and again in kindergarten in the US, parents in some states are allowed to get around the vaccine by way of so-called "philosophical" exemptions.

"These troubling data are not about cholera in Africa -- but measles in Europe! How tragic and unnecessary," Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health [ACSH] observes. "Unfortunately, vaccine fears spiked, especially in Europe, after Dr Andrew Wakefield's 'study' linking the shot to autism was published in 1998," says Dr Ross. "And while the study has since been thoroughly discredited, and Dr Wakefield has formally been accused of falsifying data, some parents are still wary of vaccines. They must be educated to realize that avoiding these shots is only putting their child and the entire community into that much more danger."

Queensland Health issues warning after a case of measles surfaces
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Measles is spread through respiration on contact with fluids from an infected person's nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission. It is highly contagious and 90 per cent of the people without immunity sharing living space with an infected person can catch it. There has been an alert issued by Queensland Health on measles. It has also urged the general population to be wary of the symptoms of the measles virus. An asymptomatic incubation period occurs 9 to 12 days from initial exposure and infectivity lasts from 2 to 4 days prior, until 2 to 5 days following the onset of the rash. Queensland Health has urged people to be alert for symptoms of the measles virus. According to Dr Brad McCall, there has been a confirmed case of measles, who visited a south west shopping centre and a cafe on 3 Jun 2012 and who also travelled on the Beenleigh-Ferny Grove rail service. Queensland Health is now urging the people who were at these places during that time to be alert for the symptoms of measles. It is highly likely that any person who was in close contact with the infected person might also have caught the virus.
