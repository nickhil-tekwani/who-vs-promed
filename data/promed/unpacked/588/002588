The recent upsurge in the spread of African swine fever (ASF) throughout several regions of the world poses a direct threat to the majority of pig populations worldwide. The 87th General Assembly of OIE National Delegates ['OIE General Session'] has called for the establishment of a global initiative to control the disease, in hope of eradicating it entirely, and to reduce its devastating economic impacts on the pig industry. This initiative will be coordinated by the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health, Organisation mondiale de la santé animale, Organización Mundial de Sanidad Animal) and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).

During the session, held from the [26 to 31 May 2019], a report on the global ASF situation was presented to the assembly. Throughout the 2nd semester of 2018, 25 countries across Europe, Africa and Asia informed the OIE of outbreaks of ASF on their territory. Watch the presentation of the report at the 87th General Assembly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saOwiuEkf6I&feature=youtu.be&t=12061+.

Given the gravity of the situation with no vaccine against the disease, and following the request of its member countries, the OIE is launching a global initiative for the control of ASF. It will use the GF-TADs (Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases) mechanism to develop, improve and harmonise partnerships and coordination at national, regional and international levels. The objective is to control the disease, strengthen countries' prevention and preparation efforts, and minimise the adverse effects on animal health, animal welfare and international trade.

Launched in 2004 by the OIE and FAO, GF-TADs aims to prevent, detect and control transboundary animal diseases, taking into account their regional dimensions. In Europe, regional groups of ASF experts have been in existence under the umbrella of this platform since 2014, and groups have recently been set up in Asia and the Americas.

In the upcoming months, the OIE will establish a work programme in collaboration with FAO, taking into consideration the regional initiatives that already exist.

In addition to the harmonised approach between countries, the transparency of new and evolving outbreaks is essential to a good understanding of the epidemiology of the disease and to its control and prevention. The OIE has reminded all its member countries of the importance of reporting the disease via the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), as this builds a complete picture of the disease situation. Between 26 April and 9 May 2019, 1322 outbreaks were ongoing and 157 new notifications of ASF were sent to the OIE via this platform.

Given the global socioeconomic repercussions of ASF, controlling the disease is a high priority for both affected countries and those free of the disease. It is for this reason that that the OIE calls on its member countries to ensure that they implement its standards and practices for the effective control of ASF, notably through the implementation of:

- programmes for prevention, early detection and intervention, and compensation policies;
- biosecurity measures;
- pig traceability and movement controls;
- effective official monitoring;
- management of wild pig populations;
- slaughter of animals in accordance with animal welfare rules, and the safe disposal of contaminated animal products;
- improvement in collaboration between stakeholders and between countries; and
- programmes of ongoing training and awareness raising.

Because of its complex epidemiology, it isn't possible to control ASF without a coordinated response from the different sectors involved. In addition to veterinary services, this includes customs and border control authorities, the pig production industry, universities, forestry management bodies, hunters' associations, tourist organisations and animal transport organisations. Clear and transparent communication is essential if all these actors are to fully understand their roles and responsibilities in the implementation of the measures required. To this end, and to offer support to its member countries, the OIE launched the awareness campaign 'ASF Kills Pigs' at the beginning of 2019.

Initially developed in 5 languages (French, English, Spanish, Mandarin and Russian), this campaign has been very successful and it can be adapted for use in other languages at the request of countries. (Consult the available translations at https://trello.com/b/GloiZoik/african-swine-fever-oie).

Meeting the complex global challenges of this disease in both affected and disease-free countries requires all actors to be vigilant and to take action. Although ASF poses no risk to human health, it is devastating for the economy of pig farms and for international trade, with repercussions for the livelihoods of farmers and for food safety. Controlling the disease at global level would therefore contribute to the achievement of some of the sustainable development goals, particularly goal 1 (no poverty) and goal 2 (zero hunger).

[Based on the gene encoding protein p72, African swine fever virus (ASFV) has been currently classified in 24 different genotypes. Only genotype I in Sardinia Italy and genotype II in Europe and Asia are known to be present outside Africa. The outbreaks in Georgia and southern parts of the Russian Federation, spreading westwards, northwards and eastwards, eventually reaching China, Mongolia, Vietnam and Cambodia in Asia, and Belgium in Europe, constitute some of the most evident long-distance transmission of the disease described in recent literature.

For a map presenting the cumulative presence of ASF at country level, globally, since 2005, please go to page 2 (out of 15) in the paper 'Strategic challenges to global control of African swine fever', presented during the Session as document 87 SG/10. Available (under subscription) at https://tinyurl.com/yxcsvpw9. A summary of the paper follows.

"The recent escalation of the African swine fever (ASF) epidemic around the world has placed the majority of the world's swine population under direct threat. To respond to this challenge, well-coordinated national, regional and global efforts will be required, not only by governments of the OIE member countries, national veterinary services and other public institutions, but also by a range of different stakeholders, including but not limited to the pig production industry, universities, research centres, forestry management bodies, hunters' associations, tourism and animal transportation organisations, civil society sector and international organisations. A holistic, inter-sectoral and trans-disciplinary collaborative approach, with effective and participative allocation and management of sufficient resources, will be of paramount importance to prevent further spread and to control ASF worldwide. On the ground level, member countries should ensure the correct implementation of relevant OIE international standards and best practices in order to effectively control ASF. These include, among others, the following measures: risk-based prevention and surveillance programmes, adequate biosecurity in pig production sectors and hunting grounds, pig traceability and movement control, effective official controls, wild pig management, safe culling and disposal of animals and their contaminated products, improved collaboration among the multiple sectors involved, and continued education and awareness raising programs for all relevant parties. The response to the global threat must involve coordinated actions by international organisations, research and scientific institutions, development partners, pig and meat producers, governmental agencies and other stakeholders to prevent further spread of this virus. It must ensure the well being of farmers and poverty reduction, protect animal welfare, prevent disastrous economic loses, and allow further contribution of the pig sector to global health, wealth, equity and sustainability. Development of effective and safe vaccines for domestic pigs and wild boar is more important than ever, given the current global ASF threat associated with the worsening epidemiological situation and the lack of a vaccine to contain ASF outbreaks. There is an urgent need for an international consensus to design an appropriate global strategical framework and to carry out adequate actions related to the reduction of the burden of ASF, promotion of economic prosperity, ensuring food security and facilitating safe trade of pig commodities. Regional and national ASF control strategies should be based on the best practices, appropriate enforcement of the legislation and close coordination with stakeholders. Member countries should increase their technical capacities and expertise, identify and use the relevant scientific knowledge, and engage in risk communication with relevant stakeholders. Integration of participatory approaches and stakeholder engagement, participation and ownership in the ASF response are as essential for the development of a global agenda for ASF control as they are for making technical recommendations for use by national veterinary services. Well-structured and properly implemented communication campaigns, targeted for establishing behavioural change and intersectoral collaboration should be an essential component of any ASF control programme.

"This article explores the global burden of the ASF situation, challenges for effective control and eradication, lessons learned and the key factors that need to be considered for a global coordinated response."

More than 12 years after the start of the ASF panzootic (initially, Georgia, April 2007), a huge international effort, by the infected countries and, not less, by those threatened, namely by all, will be required for the success of the proclaimed, commendable OIE/FAO initiative. - Mod.AS]
