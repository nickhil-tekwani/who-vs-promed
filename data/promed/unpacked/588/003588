Thailand: 7-year-old Boy Tests Negative for Avian Influenza
---------------------------------------------------
A 7-year-old boy suspected of having contracted avian Influenza [see:
Avian influenza, human - East Asia (29): Thailand, suspected - to be
archived] has been cleared by health authorities, Deputy Public
Health Minister Suchai Charoenrattanakul said yesterday. The boy,
who was kept under close watch at Phra Buddha Chinarat Hospital in
Phitsanulok province, tested negative for avian influenza, said Dr
Suchai. The boy was suspected of having bird flu when he fell ill
after touching dead chickens in his village in the northern
province's Phrom Phiram district.
Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng said yesterday the country
was ready to give vaccines to poultry if there was a new severe bird
flu outbreak, particularly in areas repeatedly plagued by the virus.
Mr Chaturon, who chairs the national anti-bird flu committee, said
the vaccine could be quickly imported from China and the Netherlands
when needed.
At present, Phitsanulok and Phichit provinces in the North and Suphan
Buri in the Central Region are classified as avian influenza-stricken
areas. Another 19 provinces are on the watch list.
Mr Chaturon said the question of when to use avian influenza vaccine
would be decided by experts on his committee. However, the situation
was still under control at the moment, he added. The government has
prepared a handbook on how to cope with a possible resurgence of
avian influenza. "We are now about 80 percent ready to deal with a
bird flu outbreak should it happen today," he said.
