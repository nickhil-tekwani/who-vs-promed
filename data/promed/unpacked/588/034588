Russia: Outbreak of HFRS in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region
-------------------------------------------------------
A press release from the Committee of the State Veterinary Commission
of the Nizhniy Novgorod Region states that in 2004 the largest number
of cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in 20 years
was registered. According to the press release, in 2003 the number
of HFRS cases increased almost 2-fold, and for the 1st 8 months of
2004, 13-fold.
The increased number of cases in 2004 was attributed to increased
migration of rodents into inhabited buildings. To remedy the
situation, a coordinated approach is called for. The State Veterinary
Service is expanding the range of veterinary services,
veterinary-sanitary surveillance, and containment of the rodent
populations that are the vectors of HFRS.

[The Nizhniy Novgorod Region is situated in Central Russia on the
Volga river. The total area of the region is 75 thousand sq km, and
the human population is about 3.7 million. A large industrial,
academic, and cultural city, Nizhni Novgorod (population 1.4 million)
is the seat of the Volga Federal District and Nizhegorodskaya Region
and the administrative center of the Volga and V'atka Economic Area.

[Although HFRS is endemic throughout Northern and Central Europe,
Central Asia, and the Far Eastern regions of Russia, ProMED-mail will
continue to post reports on HFRS because of its variable prevalence
and inherent interest. However, beginning in 2005 reports of HFRS
outbreaks will not be reported individually but instead will be
combined as periodic updates. Prevalence of HFRS in general is
determined predominantly by the size of the rodent vector population.
