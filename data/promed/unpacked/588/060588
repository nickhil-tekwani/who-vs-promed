A case of infectious equine anemia [EIA] was detected on 12 Jan 2018 in Lorgues (Var) in a horse at a private establishment, says the prefecture of Var. This case is epidemiologically linked to another case detected in late December 2017 in the Alpes-Maritimes in the town of Contes following a clinical suspicion.

Only these 2 horses were declared infected and both were euthanized.

An epidemiological survey is currently being conducted by the departments of Population Protection of the Var and of the Alpes-Maritimes to assess the health situation, to know the possible viral circulation, and to identify the equidae that may have been in contact with the infected horses.

The virus is transmitted mainly by biting insects.

Screening equidae that have been in prolonged contact with infected animals, identification and detection of equidae located in a surveillance zone of a radius of 2 km [1.24 miles] around the outbreak located in the municipality of Lorgues [are ongoing]. "Within this area, equine movements are limited until negative results," says the prefecture. Animal movements outside of the prescribed quarantine area are subject to authorization by the Departmental Directorate of Protection of the Var.

More broadly, in all the communes of Lorgues, Saint-Antonin-du-Var and Le Thoronet, all the equidae present will be inventoried. Nevertheless, beyond the surveillance zone, equine movements are free.
