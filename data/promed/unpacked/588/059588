[1] NEJM, Lancet retract articles on treatment studies
Date: Thu 4 Jun 2020

The Lancet, one of the world's top medical journals, on Thursday [4 Jun 2020] retracted an influential study that raised alarms about the safety of the experimental COVID-19 treatments chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine amid scrutiny of the data underlying the paper [ref 1 below].

Just over an hour later, The New England Journal of Medicine retracted a separate study, focused on blood pressure medications in COVID-19, that relied on data from the same company [ref 2 below].

The retractions came at the request of the authors of the studies, published last month [May 2020], who were not directly involved with the data collection and sources, the journals said. "We can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources," Mandeep Mehra of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Frank Ruschitzka of University Hospital Zurich, and Amit Patel of University of Utah said in a statement issued by The Lancet. "Due to this unfortunate development, the authors request that the paper be retracted."

The retraction of The Lancet paper is sure to add fuel to contentious arguments about the potential of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, 2 old malaria drugs, in COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. President Trump has touted them as valuable treatments, despite a lack of rigorous data showing they have a benefit.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday [3 Jun 2020], researchers reported the results of the 1st gold-standard clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19, concluding that it did not prevent infections any better than placebo. Other clinical trials, including some looking at the drugs as treatments, are ongoing [ref 3 below].

The Lancet study gained so much attention because it went further than other observational studies that had similarly found the drugs were not associated with improved outcomes for patients. The study, which was purportedly based on patient data from 671 hospitals on 6 continents, reported the drugs also corresponded to higher mortality.

The findings led to the pause of some global clinical trials studying hydroxychloroquine so researchers could check for any safety concerns. Outside experts, however, quickly raised concerns after noticing inconsistencies in the data. They asked the company that compiled and analyzed the data, Surgisphere, to explain how it sourced its data.

As scrutiny grew, the authors on the paper not affiliated with Surgisphere called for an independent audit. In their Lancet statement Thursday [4 Jun 2020], they said that Surgisphere was not cooperating with the independent reviewers and would not provide the data.

"As such, our reviewers were not able to conduct an independent and private peer review and therefore notified us of their withdrawal from the peer-review process," the researchers wrote.

Outside experts raised similar concerns about the New England Journal study, which found that the blood pressure medications were safe to take for people with COVID-19. It was also based on data from Surgisphere.

In the New England Journal retraction statement, the study authors wrote, "Because all the authors were not granted access to the raw data and the raw data could not be made available to a 3rd-party auditor, we are unable to validate the primary data sources underlying our article." They apologized "for the difficulties that this has caused."

Concerns about the health risks of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were based on evidence beyond The Lancet paper. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration warned the drugs should not be used in COVID-19 outside a clinical trial or beyond hospitalized patients because of the risks to heart health. The drugs are safe for people to take for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, for whom they are shown to have benefits, experts stress.

[The rapid release of articles and study results both in peer review journals and in pre-peer review websites has flooded the environment with studies of conflicting and not always replicable data, leading to potentially mistaken conclusions and recommendations. This has been referred to as the infodemics of this outbreak, with basically TMI (too much information) rushed out to the public and the medical community. This is a new organism and just when folks think they've figured it out, it proceeds to throw another curve ball and send everyone back to the drawing board to figure out what happened and start working on how to prevent it. The plethora of patients is showing more and more some of the less frequent effects of this infection as time marches on.

Takeaway: Read all articles with a magnifying glass and perform your own peer review, even if the article has gone through a peer review process before publication. - Mod.MPP

[2] Yemen
Date: Thu 4 Jun 2020

There are no daily news conferences about COVID-19 in Yemen, no charts or maps or deluge of data. There are barely any tests. But there are bodies. Silently but steadily the virus has taken root in the Arab world's poorest country. Its spread can be glimpsed in anecdotes from doctors and snippets on social media. In one city, aid agencies say gravediggers work overtime to keep up with the dead, most of them middle-aged men. In another city, doctors who talk about the pandemic are threatened with arrest or worse.

If you judge by the official numbers, Yemen has largely been spared. It has reported just 419 coronavirus infections and 95 deaths. But no one believes those numbers. Ravaged by years of war, the healthcare system has all but collapsed. Authorities lack the ability to track the outbreak -- and in parts of the country, they do not want to.

Yemen was singularly ill prepared for a pandemic. Even now, after shipments of extra supplies, it has just 675 intensive care beds and 309 ventilators, says the UN. Hospitals and clinics have been bombed throughout a 5-year war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, a Shia militant group. Medical staff have fled the country, leaving 1 in 6 of Yemen's 333 districts without any doctors. Millions of people cannot properly wash their hands because they lack clean water. A cholera outbreak has infected more than 2 million people and killed 4000 since 2016.

The country has been split in 2 since the coalition invaded in 2015, a campaign meant to topple the Houthis, who had seized the capital months earlier. The south is formally controlled by Saudi allies loyal to the president, Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi (see map [at source URL]). In April [2020], though, secessionists seized the port city of Aden and declared the region autonomous. The 2 camps have spent weeks fighting for control; the health ministry, split along the same lines, was paralysed as the virus approached.

Doctors say more than 500 people have died recently in Aden alone, many with respiratory symptoms that look a lot like COVID-19. They cannot know for sure: tests are scarce. As of [30 May 2020] Yemen had screened just 2678 people for the virus, from a population of 28 million. Some clinics have closed rather than treat people who may be infected. Cases go unnoticed because symptoms can resemble mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, already endemic in south Yemen and now spreading rapidly after floods that inundated Aden in April [2020].

The Houthis, who control the north, claim the situation is far better in their fief. They reported their 1st case of COVID-19 on [5 May 2020], perhaps 2 months after the virus reached Yemen. At the end of May [2020] they claimed, absurdly, a total of 4 infections in Sana'a (one of them fatal) and none in outlying provinces. There have been isolated closures, but the Houthis have refused to impose a full lockdown. Doctors keep quiet for fear of reprisals.

On social media, though, Yemenis post stories of death: at least a dozen in the capital, dozens more in outlying provinces. Some families have been unable to bury their relatives, their bodies trapped in morgues by the Houthis. The UN has pulled about half of its foreign staff out of Sana'a.

Aid agencies have offered help. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and other groups are shipping hundreds of ventilators, thousands of tests and other kit. But cash is short. Earlier this year [2020] America cut USD 73 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen, noting (accurately enough) that the Houthis profit from it. Some agencies have been forced to trim services. The World Food Programme halved the rations it provides to 8.5 million people in the north. The WHO stopped payments to doctors and nurses, many of whom have not received government salaries for years. A Saudi-led donors' conference on [2 Jun 2020], meant to raise money for a COVID-19 response and other aid programmes, netted USD 1.4 billion, well below its target of USD 2.4 billion. Yemenis in all parts of the country struggle to afford protective gear. Disposable face masks, if replaced daily, would eat up about half the monthly income of a typical family of 4. The better N95 masks cost about USD 8 each, several days' pay even for doctors, who often must supply their own gear. Residents of Sana'a cannot find hand sanitiser and other necessities.

All of this comes as the war itself seemed to be winding down. The United Arab Emirates, which led the fighting in the south, withdrew most of its troops last summer [2019]. The Saudis want to find a face-saving escape from a costly war that seems unwinnable. But they would leave behind a country bitterly divided, between north and south and between Mr. Hadi and the separatists. Even if the bombs stop, disease and hunger will take their own toll.

[I don't think we'll ever be able to closely approximate the toll this virus (SARS-CoV-2) is taking on Yemen and other countries with active zones of civil unrest, lack of access to supplies and clean water to permit the simplest of preventive measures. In the case of Yemen, the entire country is involved with the civil unrest; in other countries there are zones of unrest, but the impact is the same: uncontrolled transmission of this virus with lack of access to health infrastructure to treat the more serious cases. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 5 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- At the media briefing on COVID-19 today [5 Jun 2020], WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros announced updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19. This guidance is based on evolving evidence and provides updated advice on who should wear a mask, when it should be worn and of what it should be made. There is further guidance for the public available here.

- WHO has published interim guidance on considerations, opportunities and challenges of integrating digital tools into contact tracing methods.

- WHO has published interim guidance for the poliomyelitis (polio) surveillance network in the context of COVID-19. One of its aims is to highlight the decision-making framework to guide the level of polio surveillance activities at country level in the context of the ongoing pandemic.

- Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, air passenger and cargo services have been severely disrupted. To address the impact of the pandemic, the International Civil Aviation Organization has published "Take-off: Guidance for Air Travel through the COVID-19 Public Health Crisis." For more information, see "Subject in Focus" (at the source URL above).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 52.1% of the global newly reported cases and 86.8% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 46.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA 23.6%, Chile 7.6%, Peru 6.5%, and Mexico 6.3%.

The European region reported 16.5% of the global newly reported cases and -3.3% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period (Spain reported a decrease of 807 deaths in the past 24 hours for which I am unable to find an explanation on the Spain COVID-19 website). Russia reported 44.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 9.2%, Sweden 5.6%, Turkey 5.1%, and Belarus 4.4%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 14.3% of the global newly reported cases and 6.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 23.4% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 21.0%, Saudi Arabia 11.6%, Qatar 9.3%, Egypt 6.8%, and Afghanistan 6.3%.

The African region reported 4.6% of the global newly reported cases and 2.3% of newly reported fatalities (almost doubling of proportion of cases and deaths reported over the past 48 hours). South Africa reported 59.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 6.4%, Ghana 6.2%, Cote d'Ivoire 2.8%, Congo DR and Ethiopia 2.7% each, and Kenya 2.3%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.33% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 41.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed Singapore at 33.6%, Malaysia 18.0%, Japan 3.0%, and South Korea 2.5%.

The South East Asia region reported 11.2% of the global newly reported cases and 7.7% of global fatalities. India reported 74.3% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 18.2%, Indonesia 4.4%, and Nepal 2.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 5 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, who are both approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region greatly outnumbers all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]
