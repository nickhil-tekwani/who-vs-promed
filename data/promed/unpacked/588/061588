Health officials are battling a mumps epidemic in the Midwest that
has infected at least 515 individuals in Iowa, mostly young adults,
and spread from Iowa to a number of other states. At least 100 cases
of mumps have also been recorded in nearby Nebraska, Kansas,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, and Illinois.
Investigators are following leads to the United Kingdom, which
because of relatively low vaccine uptake rates due to fears over
links to autism has been battling mumps outbreaks for years; the
mumps strain seen in Iowa is the same as the one in the United
Kingdom.
The number of cases experienced in the epidemic this year, the
largest since a 1988 outbreak in Kansas, far outpaces the 200 to 300
typically experienced in the United States annually. Health officials
are responding with vaccine campaigns and investigating the
possibility that the protection afforded by the vaccine being used
wanes over time, or is simply not as strong as thought. Nearly 70
percent of the infected individuals had received the 2 recommended
doses of the mumps vaccine as part of routine childhood immunization
schedules. The vaccine is believed to be 95 percent effective.

[Mumps infection occurs worldwide, and humans are the only natural
host for the virus. The virus is essentially monotypic, although
there may some mismatch between individual strains and vaccines.
Despite the monotypic nature of mumps virus, different genetic
lineages of mumps virus exist and co-circulate globally. Genotypes A
to J have been defined on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the
most variable gene, the SH gene. Previously state health officials
have stated that they are concerned that a rare genotype of mumps
virus may be responsible for this unusually large outbreak of mumps
in midwestern states. The strain of mumps virus implicated in this
outbreak is a genotype G strain, a genotype that has been seen
infrequently in the United States. It has been suggested that the
virus may have been imported from the United Kingdom or Ireland where
there have been extensive outbreaks of mumps in recent years.
However, a similar strain has been isolated also in New Jersey,
and the Centers for Disease Control have yet to make a pronouncement
on the suspected origin of the epidemic strain. - Mod.CP]
