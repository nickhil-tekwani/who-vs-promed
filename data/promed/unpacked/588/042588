Girl hospitalized for suspected case of bird flu
------------------------------------------------
A 17-year-old girl was admitted Friday [31 Jul 2009] to the Wahidin
Sudirohusodo Hospital in Makassar, South Sulawesi, with what is
suspected to be an H5N1 infection. Hospital spokesman, Khalid Saleh,
said the teenager displayed symptoms of avian flu, including fever,
cough, nausea, and suffocation. She became sick after a number of
chickens around her home suddenly died. A doctor who treated her said
her temperature exceeded 39 deg C [102.2 deg F] for 3 days and that
she displayed other symptoms of avian flu, Khalid said. The teenager
is now receiving treatment in an isolation room, under the close
watch of medical workers.

Head of the husbandry unit at the Makassar Agriculture and Maritime
Agency, Yulistiawati, said a government team had been assigned to
conduct surveillance in the girl's neighborhood in the Sudiang
subdistrict in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.

Avian flu has claimed the lives of over 100 [115 - Mod.CP] people in
Indonesia, compared to just one H1N1 death.
