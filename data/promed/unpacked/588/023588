Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 17
----------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 6 Jun 2006, for the past 4 days, Indonesian health authorities
and WHO have been monitoring cases of influenza-like illness in 4 nurses
who were involved in the care of confirmed H5N1 patients. Test results have
now convincingly ruled out H5N1 infection in all 4 nurses.
Two of the nurses cared for siblings, a 10-year-old girl and her
18-year-old brother, who were hospitalized in Bandung, West Java, on 22 May
and died the following day. Test results for both nurses are negative for
H5N1 infection. One nurse was shown to be infected with a seasonal
influenza A (H1N1) virus, which is now circulating widely throughout
Indonesia. The 2nd nurse experienced only mild and transient symptoms, but
was tested urgently as a precautionary measure. Her test results were also
negative for H5N1 infection.
The 2 additional nurses, who work at a hospital in Medan, North Sumatra,
were involved in the care of confirmed H5N1 cases among members of an
extended family from the village of Kubu Simbelang in Karo District. One of
the nurses, a 34-year-old woman, experienced only mild symptoms and has
subsequently tested negative for H5N1 infection. The 2nd nurse, a
42-year-old woman, developed influenza-like illness on 1 June. Test results
received today are also negative for H5N1 infection.
The speed and thoroughness with which influenza-like illness in these
nurses was investigated are indicative of the heightened concern among
Indonesian health authorities. The negative test results for all 4 nurses
provide reassuring evidence that the virus is not spreading efficiently or
sustainably among humans at present.

[Person-to-person transition of H5N1 virus infection remains confined to
blood relatives in close family groups. As noted in the ECDC Revised Risk
Assessment (see: Avian influenza, human (80) - Indonesia, ECDC
20060605.1564 and <http://www.ecdc.eu.int>) human-to-human transmission
remains uncommon and there has been no increase in cluster size where human
cases have occurred. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 18
----------------------------------------------------
As of 6 Jun 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the
country's 49th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case occurred in a 15-year-old boy from Tasikmalaya District, West Java
Province. He developed symptoms on 24 May, was hospitalized on 26 May, and
died on 30 May.
An investigation conducted by provincial health authorities found a history
of contact with sick and dying chickens in the boy's household in the week
before the onset of his symptoms. Monitoring of family members and close
contacts has detected no cases of influenza-like illness. Of the 49 cases
confirmed to date in Indonesia, 37 have been fatal.
The H5N1 virus is considered firmly entrenched in poultry throughout much
of Indonesia. Unless this situation is urgently and comprehensively
addressed, sporadic human cases will continue to occur.
The newly confirmed case is one of several where exposure occurred despite
a clear signal of a high-risk situation arising from poultry deaths.
Pending better control of the disease in animals, WHO and officials in the
Ministry of Health see an urgent need to improve public awareness of this
disease, the risk factors for infection, and the behaviours that should be
avoided.
