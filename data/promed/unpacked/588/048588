An outbreak of anthrax has been registered in the village of Gachiani in the
Eastern Georgian Gardabansky district, a spokesman for the local health
protection department said on Wednesday.
According to him, epidemiologists registered 8 cases of anthrax in the
district last month, 4 of them in Gachiani. All the diseased were taken
to the infectious [disease hospital in the city of Rustavi. Specialists
believe
that bacilli of anthrax are located in the soil and spread the disease all
over the village.
Two of the infected were working at the water-line in the town of Gardaban,
Nana Gelesh, doctor of the Rustavi hospital, said. Another patient, Akhmed
Mamedov, is in grave condition, as he has numerous ulcers on his left arm.
He is a resident of Gachiani and was hospitalised on 26 Aug she said.
Due to aggravation of the epidemiological situation, Professor Teimuraz
Kukhalashvili was invited to the village on Tuesday to examine its
residents. According to preliminary information, more than half the
residents of Gachiani are infected, and most of them try to cure the disease
on their own, which can cause grave consequences.

[Human cutaneous lesions from contaminated soil are extremely unlikely -- in
fact I know of no confirmed instance. It is much more likely than they have
a cattle outbreak and have been slaughtering & butchering sick animals.
Horse flies (tabanids), with mouthparts contaminated from feeding on
moribund and dead animals, have been known to infect humans not directly
involved with the cattle. There is a nice 1836 paper in the New Orleans
Journal of Medicine describing such a case of a man developing a face lesion
following such a bite while in his pony cart passing a farm where the farmer
was butchering a bull that had died of anthrax. We look forward to further
reports on this outbreak. - MHJ
