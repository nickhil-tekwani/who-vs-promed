The Philippines has been experiencing an extensive measles outbreak and is now taking action.

In Davao City, located in the southern Philippines, Abdullah B. Dumama, Jr. MD, who is the Assistant Secretary of Health for Mindanao and Regional Director, announced a mandatory measles vaccination program.

This means, regardless of your previous measles immunization status, the government is administering an additional dose.

The Philippines government is conducting house-to-house measles immunization in the affected areas around Davao City, where 13 deaths have occurred. As of 23 Jan 2018, 40 959 children were already given a measles vaccination.

This mandatory immunization program will end on 7 Feb 2018.

According to the Philippine Health Ministry's press release-see below-all children ages 6 months-59 months, regardless of their previous vaccination status, will be given 1 dose of Measles-Containing Vaccine (MCV).

A total of 317 suspected cases of measles were recorded by the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU) of DOH Regional Office XI from 1 Jan 2017-19 Jan 2018. It is alarming to note that of these data, 14 were recorded as suspected measles-related deaths, still needing confirmation of whether the cause is directly related to the complications of measles or co-incidental. 13 of these deaths are from Davao City and one from Davao del Norte. Of these suspected cases, 49 are from 1-19 Jan 2018. Most of the cases in the year 2017 spiked in the months of November and December 2017.

To immediately address the ongoing transmission and control the occurrence of wider measles outbreaks, an Outbreak Response Immunization (ORI) is being conducted in the affected localities in the region. All children ages 6 months-59 months, regardless of their vaccination status is given 1 dose of Measles Containing Vaccine (MCV).

House-to-house measles immunization is currently being conducted in affected areas of Davao City. Last 5-29 Dec 2017, a total of 10 127 children were given MCV. Based on the evaluation, there was a recommendation to continue the house-to-house measles immunization, thus, it was agreed to carry on the activity which started last 17 Jan 2018 and will end on 7 Feb 2018.

As of 23 Jan, 40 959 children were already given MCV. This weekend, Regional Office staff composed of 25 teams will be deployed to Barangay 23-C to augment the activity and ensure that no child is left unprotected from measles.

In the regular routine immunization, 2-dose of MCV is given to children. The 1st dose is given at the age of 9 months, and the 2nd dose is given at the age of 12 months. However, in the Outbreak Response Immunization, all children aged 6-8 months old shall be given 1 dose of MCV and be recorded as zero dose. Then the 1st dose must be given at 9 months old or at least a 1-month interval from the last dose, then the 2nd dose shall be given at 12 months old.

We would like to ensure the public that MCV has been used for generations already and is proven safe and very effective. Availability of logistics such as vaccines and syringes are also ensured.

We appeal to our Local Government Officials, volunteers, other stakeholders and partners to help us in the endeavor. Let us stand together to protect our children from threats to their health. These ongoing measles outbreaks can be prevented. Help us inform the public that measles can be prevented through vaccination, and they can visit their nearest health centers for the vaccines or for any concerns.

Let us do this together and let us leave no child unprotected from Measles.

Abdullah B. Dumama, JR. MD, MPA, CESO III
Assistant Secretary of Health for Mindanao and Regional Director

Four children in Davao City reportedly died of measles.

Some 224 others were suspected to be infected with the virus that causes the disease, according to Davao City Councilor Mary Joselle Villafuerte.

Of the 224 suspected cases, 16 have been confirmed. 32 barangays, out of 182, have been reported to have measles cases with Barangay 23-C having the most number with 60 cases.

The Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit of the Department of Health recorded 299 measles cases from January to December last year [2017]. Like dengue, most of those infected with the virus, of which 21 strains have been identified by scientists so far, were children.

"About 17 percent of the cases belong to the bracket of children 0-5 months old, 16 percent of cases belong to children 6-18 months old. About 31 percent were children 9-12 years old, 18 percent were 15-59 months old and 19 percent were children 5 years old and above," the state-owned Philippine Information Agency reported.

Although there is already a safe and cost-effective vaccine available, measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO).

In fact, measles outbreaks happen from time to time. An outbreak, explained a health official, means "there have been cases of a disease either suspected or confirmed in a community or a locality where in the past there was none."

"Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics that cause many deaths, especially among young, malnourished children," the WHO pointed out. "In countries where measles has been largely eliminated, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection."

Measles, locally known as tigdas or tipdas, is a very contagious illness caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family [which also causes mumps, German measles and chicken pox]. "The measles virus normally grows in the cells that line the back of the throat and lungs," the WHO said. "Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals.

"The highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions," the WHO explained. "The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person from 4 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts."

Measles is considered an endemic disease, meaning it is continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance.

Outbreaks happen when there is low vaccination coverage among the population. Such was the recent case in Davao City. Angie Saveron, EDGE Davao's roving reporter, quoted Villafuerte as saying: "One factor behind the outbreak of measles in the city is the victims' lack of immunization, the reason being the mothers were too busy to have their children immunized."

Of the 224 suspected measles cases, 80 percent were not vaccinated, while the remaining 20 percent were immunized but have a weak immunity.

Another reason cited was the influx of transient residents in the city. A bulk of people come to the city starting on the month of September until December, the height of the holiday season.

In some parts of the world, there are parents who do not allow their children to be vaccinated for fear that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, can cause autism. However, large studies of thousands of children have found no connection between this vaccine and autism.

"Not vaccinating children can lead to outbreaks of measles, mumps and rubella, all of which are potentially serious diseases of childhood," said Dr. Neil K. Kaneshiro, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

The WHO also said: "Measles outbreaks can be particularly deadly in countries experiencing natural disaster or conflict. Damage to health infrastructure and health services interrupts routine immunization, and overcrowding in residential camps greatly increases the risk of infection."

According to Dr. Enrique Tayag, a person infected with measles can infect up to 12-13 more people.

Medical News Today says complications from measles are fairly common. Some, however, can be serious. Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease. Complications are more common in children under the age of 5, or adults over the age of 20.

Complications can include: diarrhea, vomiting, eye infection, respiratory tract infections (such as laryngitis and bronchitis), difficulty breathing, ear infections (which lead to permanent hearing loss) and febrile seizures.

"As high as 10 percent of measles cases result in death among populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care," the WHO said. "Women infected while pregnant are also at risk of severe complications and the pregnancy may end in miscarriage or preterm delivery."

One good thing: People who recover from measles are immune for the rest of their lives.

Among those who are at risk of being infected with measles are unvaccinated young children; they are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death. Unvaccinated pregnant women are also at risk. Any nonimmune person (who has not been vaccinated or was vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected.

Until now, no specific antiviral treatment exists for measles virus. Severe complications from measles can be avoided, though supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration with WHO-recommended oral rehydration solution. This solution replaces fluids and other essential elements that are lost through diarrhea or vomiting. Antibiotics are prescribed to treat eye and ear infections, and pneumonia.

Although measles is a highly contagious disease, it can be prevented through vaccination. Data from the health department showed that only 40 percent to 45 percent of infants who are given measles vaccines at 9 months receive booster shots when they are 12-15 months old.

According to the WHO, routine measles-vaccination program for children together with mass immunization campaigns are the key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for over 40 years. It is safe, effective and inexpensive.

Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every 2-3 years and measles caused 2.6 million deaths each year.

Between 2000 and 2016, measles vaccination resulted in a 84-percent drop in measles deaths worldwide, the WHO reported. In those span of years, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths.

This is the reason the health department urged parents of children ages 6 months-59 months to have their children vaccinated against measles. Vaccinations are available at health centers.

https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2018/01/29/health-ministry-issues-advisory-on-measles-situation-in-central-america-and-caribbean/


The Ministry of Health reported today [29 Jan 2018] that it was recently alerted to a positive case of measles in Guatemala, imported from Germany.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease but is also a vaccine-preventable disease that has not been reported in Belize since 1991.

The number of cases of measles in the region of the Americas has increased from 92 to 271 in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and the Caribbean is reporting highly suspicious cases imported from the United Kingdom (UK).

The public is hereby advised to urgently report to your nearest health facility if you show signs or observe someone with the following symptoms:

- Any person with history of fever of 4 days, rash that started on the neck and face and scattered on the body thereafter, and any one of the 3 C's (Cough, Coryza or a runny nose, or Conjunctivitis) OR

- Any person with fever and any one of the 3 C's (Cough, Coryza or a runny nose, or Conjunctivitis), even before the onset of rash, with history of travel to and from the UK in the previous 30 days.

Suspicious cases need to be isolated and investigated to avoid spread to susceptible individuals.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that every eligible child receive 2 doses of the measles-containing vaccine.

WHO also encourages adults who are not fully immunized, or who are not sure of their immunity status, to get vaccinated.

In response to this alert, the Ministry convened a meeting with all its public health nurses last week to share the information and activate an immediate heightened surveillance to follow up on any presentation of symptoms that can possibly lead to a positive Measles case.

Alberta Health services [AHS] has issued a warning to customers and staff of a Real Canadian Superstore in southwest Calgary and passengers of a recent flight from London to Calgary following a confirmed case of measles.

"We had reported to us a confirmed case of measles in an unimmunized child who had history of travel to India," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, Medical Officer of Health-AHS Calgary Zone. "It's likely, although we don't know for sure, that the child was exposed during travel from India back to Calgary on 9 or 10 Jan 2018."

According to AHS, members of the public may have been exposed to measles at locations where the child had been at the specified times [see URL above for specific locations and times].

Dr. MacDonald says the girl's parents have indicated the Real Canadian Superstore was the only public location she visited while infectious. The girl would not have been infectious on the flight, but she may have contracted the disease on the aircraft.

"We've shared the information about the flight with the public health agency of Canada, and it would be up to them to decide if there needs to be further notification or follow-up with the passengers."

The last confirmed case of measles in Calgary occurred in April of 2017.

"Measles is a very infectious disease but it's easy to protect yourself and others against measles," said Dr. MacDonald. "The most important thing is to have vaccine, MMR vaccine, and we recommend 2 doses of measles mumps rubella vaccine for anyone that was born in 1970 or later."

The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) released a statement on 19 Jan 2018 alerting families in Ellis County, TX of a measles outbreak after 6 cases were confirmed. All 6 patients who contracted the measles are between 8 months and 27 years old and were not vaccinated previously.

The press release specifically urged anyone who attended the ShowBiz Cinemas in Waxahachie on 9 Jan 2018 to check for symptoms since a customer who was sick with the measles saw a movie that day. Five more cases have been reported since the press release, and the Texas Department of State Health Services is encouraging parents to get families vaccinated against the disease

Measles is no joke and can be totally avoided-as long as you get your kids vaccinated. According to the World Health Organization, measles vaccinations resulted in an 84 percent drop in measles-related deaths between 2000 and 2016 worldwide.

But unfortunately for Texans, they're particularly more prone to measles outbreaks, likely because it's one of the 19 states that allow parents to opt out of the public school vaccination requirements for personal or moral reasons, as opposed to medical needs.

"None of them have been vaccinated, and that's the biggest risk factor," said Chris Van Deusen, the Department of State Health Services spokesperson, in an interview with CBS. "Those are the people we're most worried about."

If you think you have the measles, call your doctor ASAP and stay home to minimize the risk of infecting anyone else.

There have been 21 cases of measles reported in the West Midlands in January [2018], compared to just 3 in the same period last year [2017].

In the 4 weeks to 28 Jan 2018, 21 suspected cases of measles have been reported to Public Health England (PHE) in the metropolitan area.

While not all the cases will turn out to be measles, the number of reports is much higher than in the same period in the previous 2 years, the 4 weeks to Week 04 of PHE reports, when 3 cases were reported in 2016/17 and 9 in 2015/16.

The area is one of 5 where PHE have confirmed measles outbreaks.

The cases reported include 8 in Birmingham, 6 in Solihull and 3 in Coventry.

Among these was a [mother] who praised Heartlands Hospital for quickly treating a rare case of measles that left her daughter so poorly she initially feared she would die.

[She] drove [her daughter] to A & E [emergency department] after her temperature soared to 39 C [102 F] in what they later discovered was a rare case of the highly infectious illness.

[She] claims her local GPs' surgery in Harborne twice misdiagnosed [her daughter's] symptoms as chicken pox after she began to fall ill early.

Measles cases have reached their highest level for 18 years.

Across England and Wales during the 1st 4 weeks of January 2018, 183 suspected cases of measles have been reported to PHE.

This is much higher than in the same period in the previous 2 years, when 86 cases were reported in 2016/17 and 98 in 2015/16.

The number of reported measles cases across England and Wales is at its highest level for this time of year since 325 cases were reported in the 1st 4 weeks of 2013, when there were major measles outbreak in England and Wales between November 2012 and July 2013, primarily concentrated in Wales but with high numbers of cases in the north of England.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, said: "This serves as an important reminder for parents to take up the offer of MMR vaccination for their children at one year of age and as a pre-school booster at 3 years and 4 months of age. Children and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure whether they had 2 doses should contact their GP practice to catch-up.

"We'd also encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks.

"The UK recently achieved WHO measles elimination status and so the overall risk of measles to the UK population is low, however due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, we will continue to see cases in unimmunised individuals, and limited onward spread can occur in communities with low MMR coverage and in age groups with very close mixing."

People are infectious from their 1st symptoms to 4 days after the rash appears. Symptoms start around 1-2 weeks after exposure to an infectious case.

Those who catch measles are generally very unwell and frequently admitted to hospital. Complications from measles, including pneumonia, are common, and the death rate is approximately one in 5000 cases in the UK.

The MMR vaccine is available to adults and children who are not up to date with their 2 doses. Routinely, the 1st dose of MMR is given between 12 and 13 months of age and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age, before starting school.
