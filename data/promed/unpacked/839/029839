The National Park Service says the fungus that causes a deadly disease in bats has been discovered in North Dakota.

The Bismarck Tribune reports the fungus was discovered after swab testing of a bat that was captured [6 May 2019] at Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site near Stanton.

The fungus causes white-nose syndrome, which can lead to dehydration or other conditions that kill bats.

To date, 33 states have confirmed the disease since it was found in 2006 in New York. US Fish and Wildlife Service wildlife refuge specialist Catherine Hibbard says 4 states, including North Dakota, have discovered only the fungus.

South Dakota identified the fungus and disease for the 1st time last year [2018].

Humans can transmit the fungus but aren't affected by it. It is spread easily among bats.

[In this case, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ (Pd), the fungal pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome (WNS), was detected in the absence of clinical disease. Further research should assess the impact it is having on bats hibernating there. Updated spread, geographical distribution, and information of WNS can be accessed at https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/. - Mod.PMB
