2002. Accepted for publication 3 Oct 2002.
PLMVd has previously been reported in Brazil (3), but to our knowledge, this
is the first report of PLMVd in Uruguay.
Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) (2) is widely distributed, causing
yellow, chlorotic mosaics and delayed foliation, flowering, and ripening.
Infected fruits display a cracked suture and are often dented, misshapen,
frequently flattened, and discolored. Under greenhouse conditions, naturally
occurring PLMVd isolates can be classified as severe or latent strains
depending on whether they induce leaf symptoms on seedlings of the peach
indicator host GF-305.
PLMVd was detected in 2001 during a survey in 3 locations in the Canelones
Department, the main peach-producing area in Uruguay. 50 samples were tested
for the presence of 3 bromoviruses [Prunus necrotic ringspot (PNRSV), Prune
dwarf (PDV), American plum line pattern (APLPV)] and Plum pox potyvirus
(PPV) and Apple chlorotic leaf spot trichovirus (ACLSV); samples were also
tested for Hop stunt (HSVd) and PLMVd viroids that also infect stone fruits.
The analyses were completed with molecular hybridization using specific
non-isotopic riboprobes for each virus (4).
PLMVd, undescribed in Uruguay, was detected in 9 of 50 samples in 3 peach
cultivars, Scarlet Pearl, EarliGrande, and Barcelo. The PLMVd-positive
sample for 'Scarlet Pearl' showed mild mosaic symptoms on leaves, whereas
the 2 PLMVd-positives of 'EarliGrande' showed clear calico type symptoms.
The remaining PLMVd-positive samples belonged to 'Barcelo' and showed no
symptoms. The first 2 cultivars were imported from USA, a source with a high
percentage of PLMVd infections in peach germ plasm (1). In 5 of 9
PLMVd-positive samples, the viroid occurred with PNRSV and in 1 with PDV and
PNRSV.
These results reveal the importance of following strict sanitary practices
with plant material used for propagation. Molecular tools are available to
pre-screen scion and rootstock sources for PLMVd.

[Based on RT-PCR tests, PLMVd is known to be present in peach from Europe,
Asia, North America, and South America. The viroid is a threat to production
in peach worldwide. PLMVd is readily transmitted by use of pruning tools. -
