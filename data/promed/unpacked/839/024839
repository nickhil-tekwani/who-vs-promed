1st rust found in South Carolina commercial field; furthest north yet
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust [ASR] has been confirmed in the southern part of South
Carolina in a Hampton County commercial soybean field. This is the 1st
confirmed ASR outbreak in the state and becomes the northern-most county
infected with ASR in the country, just north of Effingham County across the
border in Georgia.
Hampton County extension agent Tommy Walker collected the sample last week
[2nd week August 2005], and it was allowed to incubate before being
examined on Saturday [13 Aug 2005]. John Mueller, Extension soybean
pathologist with Clemson University, pegged it as ASR and sent it to the
Plant Problem Clinic for confirmation early Monday morning [15 Aug 2005].
In Mueller's commentary [edited], he said ASR in the Hampton County field
is at a low level and is doing very little damage to that field, while also
not producing enough spores to immediately threaten nearby fields.
"However, it is evident that ASR spores, most likely from Georgia or
Florida, are being deposited in South Carolina fields," Mueller said.
South Carolina state commentary, 15 Aug 2005:
Observations:
15 Aug 2005: ASR was confirmed today in a sample collected last week [2nd
week August 2005] from a commercial soybean field (R3/4) in Hampton County,
SC by Tommy Walker, Hampton County Agricultural Agent. A 2nd sample from a
commercial field (R4) in Dorchester County, collected by County
Agricultural Agents Joe Varn and Marion Barnes, strongly resembled the
pustules from the Hampton County site; however, positive identification was
not possible at this time, since sporulation was not observed. Further
analysis is being performed.
11 other fields in the Lower Savannah Valley were collected and examined
last week [2nd week August 2005]. 2 of these fields were within 100 yards
of the affected field in Hampton County. No sign of rust was detected in
any of those fields. 30 leaves were examined from each of the fields. Only
one ASR-infected soybean leaf was found from either of the fields. Less
than 5 pustules were observed on either leaf.
Growth Stages:
Much of the full-season soybean crop in South Carolina is past flowering,
and pods are developing rapidly. Early planted maturity group 3 and 4
soybeans are near maturity. Soybeans planted behind wheat are still at the
vegetative stage.
Disease Management:
Many growers in the Lower Savannah River Valley have recently sprayed
protecting fungicides for control of leaf, stem, and pod diseases. They
should wait until their spray interval has expired, or rust in neighboring
fields becomes severe, to apply a 2nd spray. Application of a 2nd spray
will be dependent upon the development of ASR in surrounding fields. At the
low level of ASR detected in Hampton County, it should be at least 10 to 14
days before ASR could develop to a stage where damage is likely. Growers
north of Santee and West of Barnwell County should continue to spray beans
with high yield potentials as needed for leaf, stem and pod diseases. It
should be 10 to 14 days before they need to start focusing their sprays on ASR.

[ASR is slowly spreading but should start tapering off in the next week or
so. The most recent infection marks the furthest north that ASR has been
reported, and we can only wait to see how it plays out. Dr. Chris Hurt,
Agricultural Economist at Purdue, said that after 20 Aug 2005, growers will
not need to worry about ASR, because even if ASR did show late in August
2005, it would take nearly 2 weeks to develop to the point of defoliating
plants. Asked to make a prediction for next year (2006), Hurt thinks that
many growers will have invested in costly fungicides to such an extent that
many will be less inclined to make substantial investments in fungicides in
the future.
