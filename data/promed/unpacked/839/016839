Bangladesh fever that killed 20 identified as encephalitis
----------------------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease which claimed 20 lives in Bangladesh has been proven
to be viral encephalitis and not the bird flu, a top official said on Sunday.
"There is no evidence of any one afflicted by bird flu disease in
Bangladesh," Sarwar Kamal, Secretary, Ministry of Health, told reporters in
Dhaka. A laboratory in the United States detected the Nipah virus which
caused the viral encephalitis, he said.
20 people, mostly children, died in the last 2 weeks in 3 districts of the
mysterious disease. The test results on samples taken from patients were
received from the US today, Kamal said.
But it still remained a mystery how is the disease spread and so far
attacked 66 people, he said adding a delegation from the World Health
Organization is expected here on 5 Feb 2004 to study the outbreak.
Meanwhile, poultry associations across the country are seeking to dispel
fears about bird flu, which was affecting the sale of their products.

Mystery illness is encephalitis
-------------------------------
Experts said today a disease that has killed 10 people in Bangladesh was
viral encephalitis, which could have been transmitted from pigs or bats.
"The illness was caused by a virus closely related to Nipah and Hendra
viruses, which were the cause of 2 previous outbreaks of fatal encephalitis
in Bangladesh in 2001 and 2003," Health Secretary Sarwar Kamal told
reporters after receiving test findings from the United States of samples
from patients. He added categorically: "This has no link to the bird flu and
there is no evidence that any of the patients in question were infected with
the avian influenza."
Robert F Breiman, head of the infectious diseases unit of the Dhaka-based
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease and Research, said further
tests would be carried out by World Health Organisation and government
experts in coming weeks to detect the precise strain of the virus.
The health experts said the Nipah or Hendra viruses could be linked to pigs
and bats -- some cases in Malaysia and Singapore pinpointed pigs, while bats
appeared to be a "reservoir" for the viruses.
The government's health directorate said 10 people -- 9 children and a
teenager aged 18 -- had died and 66 were hit by the disease in western
Goalundo area. The disease first came to light in mid-January 2004.

[The Bangladeshi authorities are to be commended for the rapid dissemination
of information on this outbreak. The newswire refers to 2 prior outbreaks of
Nipah-like virus-associated encephalitis in Bangladesh, the first in 2001 was
covered extensively by ProMED-mail. At that time, official information on
the etiology of the outbreak was not known for over a year following the
outbreak. The above newswire mentions another outbreak in 2003. If there is
any information on that one from authoritative sources, ProMED-mail would
appreciate receiving it, as this is the first notification of this.
Geographically, the affected area -- Rajbari District -- is in the southwest
of Dhaka Division, bordering with both Kulna and Barisal Divisions. The
district is 2 districts to the east of Meherpur (less than 50 miles) where
the outbreak of encephalitis due to a Nipah-like virus occurred in 2001.
Nipah virus is a newly discovered paramyxovirus responsible for a viral
encephalitis outbreak in Malaysia in 1998/1999, which resulted in around 300
confirmed infections and a mortality in hospitalised cases of about 35
percent.
Genetic analysis revealed that Nipah virus is closely related to Hendra
virus, another recently discovered paramyxovirus, associated with disease
in horses and humans in Australia and also maintained in _Pteropus_ fruit
bats. Bengal & Bangladesh are within the distribution range of _Pteropus_
fruit bats.
ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information from authoritative
sources on the results of investigations (both epidemiologic as well as
laboratory) of this current outbreak of Nipah-like virus in Bangladesh. -
