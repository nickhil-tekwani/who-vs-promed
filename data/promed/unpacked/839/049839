The 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, was reported in Suffolk, Virginia, in a Saddlebred mare.

EEE is a deadly virus spread by mosquitoes. The death rate of the virus is 80 to 90 percent [in equine animals]. On Thursday [7 Jul 2016], WHSV spoke with local horse veterinarian John Wise of Westover Animal Hospital. He advised dumping out any water in buckets or tires around your horses, especially after all of the rain we have seen recently. Standing water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which carry the disease.

"Preventive medicine is the best way to go, because sometime after the horse is out of the barn, it's hard to get him back in," said John Wise. "But, if you do this ahead of time, a lot of time, you can prevent a lot of disaster and heartache to a horse."

Although he recommends vaccinating in the spring, it is still not too late to get your horse the vaccine for protection against EEE.

[EEE virus is endemic in the USA east of the Mississippi River. Equine EEE cases occur with some frequency along the Gulf of Mexico coast and along the eastern seaboard to New England. Human cases occur less frequently. Unfortunately, this is another equine case of a disease preventable by vaccination. The vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. It is best for owners to vaccinate in the spring, just before the transmission season begins. Because immunity to EEE is short and wanes within about 3-4 months, owners are encouraged to vaccinate every 3 to 4 months.

The EEE case fatality rate in equine animals is quite high, and those that survive may have neurological sequelae as severe as to require euthanasia.
