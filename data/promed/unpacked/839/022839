Investigation update
--------------------
On 11 Sep 2015, Custom Produce Sales voluntarily recalled all cucumbers sold under the Fat Boy label starting 1 Aug 2015 because they may be contaminated with _Salmonella_. These cucumbers were sent to Custom Produce Sales from Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce. Fat Boy label cucumbers were produced in Baja California, Mexico and distributed in the states of California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas. Unlabeled cucumbers packed into a black reusable plastic container, and sold in Nevada as of 1 Aug 2015, are also covered by this recall. The type of cucumber is often referred to as a "slicer" or "American" cucumber. It is dark green in color and typical length is 7 to 10 inches [18-25 cm]. In retail locations, it is typically sold in a bulk display without any individual packaging or plastic wrapping. These cucumbers are shipped in a black, green, and red cardboard box which reads "Fat Boy Fresh Produce."

Several state health and agriculture departments are collecting and testing cucumbers from retail locations for the presence of Salmonella. Since the last update on 9 Sep 2015, the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services isolated one of the outbreak strains of _S._ Poona from cucumbers collected from retail locations. Preliminary information indicates that these cucumbers were distributed by Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce. The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency isolated one of the outbreak strains of _S._ Poona from cucumbers collected from the Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce facility.

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a US public health surveillance system that tracks antimicrobial resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is a partnership among the CDC, the FDA, USDA, and state and local health departments.

The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ and other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories. CDC's NARMS laboratory conducted antibiotic resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from 3 ill people infected with one of the outbreak strains. Of the 3 isolates tested, all (100 percent) were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested on the NARMS panel. CDC's NARMS laboratory continues to conduct antimicrobial resistance testing on additional clinical isolates collected from ill persons infected with the outbreak strains. Results will be reported when they become available.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the scope of this substantial and still growing multistate outbreak. Since cucumbers, like cantaloupes that have been associated with _S._ Poona infections, grow on ground vines, they are even more susceptible to contamination by pathogen-containing irrigation water. The exact method of contamination related to this outbreak, however, is unclear. - Mod.LL
