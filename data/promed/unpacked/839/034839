[An] unknown disease attacks potato farms in Plateau [and] farmers in some parts of [the] state have raised the alarm that [it is] leading to low yield. Most of the problems were linked to planting, germination, [and] general production. One of the farmers said [the potatoes] will begin to grow well and bring out fresh leaves, but after a while, the leaves will wither and that affects the potatoes in the ground.

Dr Tony Onoja, Agricultural Policy Research Network (APRNet), said that their problem might have emanated from a viral disease. [He] said some diseases are airborne, thereby affecting many farms. Floods also transfer the organism.

Dr Onoja advised the farmers to consult experts to scientifically verify the cause of the problem and thereafter proffer the necessary solution. Potato has become the most cultivated crop in Plateau State.

[A considerable number of potato diseases due to fungi and other pathogens are known to occur in the region. In particular, late blight (PLB; caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_) was reported from Nigeria's Plateau State previously (ProMED-mail post 20140611.2533396). While the symptoms described above may be consistent with PLB, the advice given to farmers to seek a scientific diagnosis is utterly sound. Reliable diagnosis is essential before effective management strategies can be designed for the affected areas.

Late blight of potato (and tomato) can cause 100 per cent crop losses. It is considered an increasing problem worldwide, with more virulent strains emerging frequently. Farm saved seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. (For more information on PLB see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives and links below.)
