The cases of hemorrhagic pneumonia, reported from 10 May 2006 onwards in
the northeastern Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Norte, were considered
initially as a distinct, possibly new, disease entity. [See Archive
Hemorrhagic pneumonia - Brazil (RN) 20060604.1561].
Tests were negative for hantavirus, leptospirosis and dengue in the 1st few
cases. The state department of health together with the Ministry of Health
initiated an investigation.
After extensive epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and pathology
work-up, the conclusion was that the hemorrhagic pneumonia was in fact
severe cases of different respiratory diseases. The state was suffering 2
simultaneous outbreaks of respiratory disease, one of respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) and another of influenza A, as well as outbreaks of dengue and
rotavirus diarrhea. The combination of these outbreaks had the expected
results: persons with risk factors, like malnutrition, pregnancy, sickle
cell anemia and old age, suffered severe, sometimes fatal cases of
pneumonia with hemorrhage.
The hemorrhage was solely in the lungs with no evidence of hemorrhage
elsewhere, except in the dengue cases.
Although the outbreak caused great anxiety in the population and in local
health authorities, the situation is calm at the moment, and, as the RSV
and influenza outbreaks have waned, no more cases of severe pneumonia have
occurred, although surveillance has been enhanced.
