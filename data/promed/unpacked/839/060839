Bird flu outbreak at egg farm in eastern Connecticut confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials have confirmed a bird flu outbreak at a major egg
farm in Connecticut, which last week had prompted Japan to impose a
temporary ban on all U.S. poultry imports. Some chickens at the egg farm
have tested positive for a mild form of avian influenza, US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) spokesman Ed Curlett said Wednesday.
About 4.7 million birds have been under quarantine since officials began
investigating a possible outbreak of the disease at the farm earlier this
month.
Curlett said Japan has lifted its ban on US poultry imports after US
officials had proved that proper measures had been taken to contain the
disease, Curlett said. A ban on Connecticut poultry remains in effect.
The egg farm, which has operations in the towns of Bozrah and Lebanon [both
in Connecticut], controls more than 90 percent of the state's egg market.
Federal officials learned of the first positive results Monday evening,
Curlett said. Officials hope to decide by early next week what to do to
eradicate the disease, which may require killing all or some of the birds
at the facility.
Avian flu is highly contagious among birds and has spread to people in a
few isolated cases.
A 2-week outbreak in the Netherlands has shown signs of spreading. Hundreds
of thousands of chickens have been slaughtered to contain the outbreak.
