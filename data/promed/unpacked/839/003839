Nearly 5000 Pollsmoor Prison [in the Western Cape, South Africa] inmates are being moved to other prisons in the Western Cape following an outbreak of a highly infectious disease that has killed 2 prisoners. The inmates died 2 weeks ago from a disease carried by rodents. It's believed a rat infestation at the facility is to blame for the outbreak.

Earlier in September 2015, Constitutional Court Judge Edwin Cameron released a damning report about what he called inhumane conditions at the prison. The Department of Correctional Services' Simphiwe Xako said, "We are to contain the outbreak of leptospirosis and we are moving the offenders to various facilities around the province." The evacuation is expected to take 6-8 weeks.
