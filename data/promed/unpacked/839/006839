Pet Shop Worker Dies of Rat Disease
-----------------------------------
A pet shop worker died of a severe heart ailment caused by rat bite fever,
a rare infection that he contracted by cutting his finger on a rat cage,
doctors said.
[The patient, a] 24 [year old male], died Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles.
Federal health officials said only a few cases of rat bite fever are
reported each year.
"If the source is cutting yourself on a dirty cage, and it is not
diagnosed quickly, it can become very serious," said Dr. Christian
Newcomer, director of the Veterinary Resource Program of the National
Institutes of Health.
[The patient] reportedly scratched his finger in mid-July at the pet shop
where he worked. The infection he contracted attacked his heart, forcing
him to undergo 2 operations. The bacteria destroyed one of his heart
valves and damaged another.
Doctors said bacteria from a rat's saliva apparently entered [his]
bloodstream through the cut. The bacteria are present in the saliva of all
rats but not all bite victims contract rat bite fever. Most cases of the
infection can be treated with antibiotics.
Newcomer said an animal's mouth can be a "garden of infectious diseases."

[Rat-bite fever (RBF) is caused by 2 different organisms. One is caused by
_Streptobacillis moniliformis_, has an incubation period of 3-10 days,
associated with a rapidly healing point of inoculation (i.e., the rat
bite), and an abrupt onset of irregularly relapsing fever, shaking chills,
vomiting, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and regional lymphadenopathy.
Shortly after onset, a maculopapular rash appears on the extremities.
Anemia, endocarditis, and myocarditis have also been reported with this
form. The second is caused by _Spirillum minus_, and has a longer
incubation period (1-3 weeks), and the wound may reappear at the time of
onset of systemic illness. The case-fatality rate for RBF may approach 10
percent
for untreated cases.
According to the CDC MMWR case report, RBF is considered a rare disease in
the United States, but since it is not a reportable disease, it is
recognized there are no reliable data on its incidence. Most cases of RBF,
including those acquired in the laboratory, follow rat bites; however,
exposure to other domestic and wild animals has also resulted in disease.
Infection has also followed consumption of contaminated raw milk. The rate
of nasopharyngeal carriage of _S. moniliformis_ by healthy laboratory rats
has been reported to vary between 10 percent and 100 percent.
The _Streptobaccillis moniliformis_ is found world-wide. A review of the
literature reveals a predominance of individual case reports, with the
occasional report of an outbreak due to contaminated milk. The _Spirillum
minus_ more common in Japan and Asia.
More information on the causative organism would be very much appreciated.
