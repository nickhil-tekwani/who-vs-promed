OAU RECOGNIZES TDR'S ACHIEVEMENTS


The International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis Research
and Control (ISCTRC) of the Organization of African Unity
congratulates the Special Programme on its 20th Anniversary. The
ISCTRC at its 23rd Meeting held in Banjul, The Gambia from 11 - 15
September 1995 passed the following resolution:

CONSCIOUS of the catalytic role that the UNDP/World Bank/WHO
Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases
(TDR) has played since its inception;

CONCERNED about the worsening situation regarding the availability
of trypanocidal drugs;

NOTING that endemic countries are unable to afford eflornithine,
the recently developed drug,
which besides costs has other limitations;

NOTING further that melarsoprol, the only other drug available for
central nervous system stage (late stage disease), may not be
available in the near future;

1. CONGRATULATES TDR on its achievements in the development of
suitable and cost effective tools for the control of tropical
diseases and wishes it success for the future,

2. REQUESTS continued support for research and training in
African trypanosomiasis, which is assuming epidemic proportions in
many countries as reported in the recent report of
the WHO Regional Office for Africa (1995).

3. FURTHER REQUESTS WHO/TDR to use its good offices to ensure the
availability of drugs for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis
and to support research necessary to develop new drugs.

In a reply sent to the OAU Secretariat, Dr Ralph Henderson,
Assistant Director-General, WHO, confirmed TDR's interest in
pursuing vigorously its objective of finding an effective,
safe and affordable drugs for the treatment of African
trypanosomiasis. He reported that a pilot production of
eflornithine has been commissioned in India, which could reduce
the current cost of eflornithine by half. Furthermore, he
explained that a comparative study of a 14 day and 7 day durations
of treatment with eflornithine is in progress with the aim of
reducing the duration of treatment, and consequently the cost of
treatment with eflornithine. With regard to the availability of
trypanocidal drugs, he stated that WHO is in liaison with the
pharmaceutical companies which produce trypanocidal drugs to
ensure a regular supply of drugs for the treatment of African
trypanosomiasis. He added that research is continuing with TDR
support in many laboratories looking for new molecules which could
be developed into drugs.
