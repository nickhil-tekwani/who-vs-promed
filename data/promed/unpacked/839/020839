As of 29 Sep 2006, WHO received reports of a suspected pneumonic
plague outbreak in 4 health zones in Haut-Uele district, Orientale
province in the northeastern part of Congo DR. The local authorities
have now [11 Nov 2006] reported 1174 suspected cases, including 50
deaths. More than 50 samples have been collected and analyzed;
however, the diagnosis of plague has not been finally laboratory confirmed.
A 5-person team from WHO and the Ministry of Health will return to
the field to re-assess the situation with the local medical staff and
international non-governmental organizations working in the affected areas.

[In the previous post on 15 Oct 2006 -- see belwo -- some of the
cases had been apparently been confirmed as plague, but it was noted
that the case fatality rate seemed to be too low for all cases to be
due to pneumonic plague, a disease with a much higher mortality rate.

Oriental or Eastern) province, where Haut-Uele district is located,
