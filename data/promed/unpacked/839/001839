On 20 May 1999 a 33 year old female was admitted to our Infectious and
Tropical Disease Unit Hospital.
The previous day she had been flown from Nigeria, having been employed
there on a Protection Project with Drill monkeys, This was without any
laboratory facility. There is NOT a history of ill monkeys.
There is a one week history of feeling unwell, described by her as a 'pre
malaria feeling'. This she self treated with Halofantrine. During the week
prior to this she experienced facial tingling and weakness of (L) arm and
(L) leg and a 2-3 day period of neck stiffness and frontal headache.
Immediately prior to her repatriation, this being the reason for it, she
complained of being confused and having short term memory loss, as was
noticed also by her colleagues.
On admission to hospital short term memory loss persists. There is
Eosinophilia ++, Mild hepatomegaly and thrombocytopaenia.
So far, screening for malaria, schistosomiasis, filaria and strongyloides
are
negative.Trypanosomiasis is being investigated. Electrocardiograph
appears normal. An MRI scan, Echocardiograph and liver ultrasound
have been arranged. Lumbar Puncture results are awaited.
Meanwhile, the patient is stable though not classified as recovering.
We are open to any suggestions lest we miss anything.

rear ends.
