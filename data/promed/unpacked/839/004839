Environmental protection officials this week reminded the public to
take precautions against possible outbreaks of dengue fever, a
sometimes fatal mosquito-borne disease, with the onset of the
nation's hot and wet summer, the breeding season of the dengue
virus-carrying mosquitoes. The Environmental Protection
Administration said that eliminating the breeding areas of the
mosquito is the only way to prevent the disease. According to
official statistics, 24 cases of dengue fever contracted overseas
have been recorded since the beginning of this year [2006], with 3
reported last week. Warm, rainy weather creates a perfect environment
for the mosquito to reproduce, the administration said, as long as
the temperature is at least 30 C and the larvae's living environment
-- stagnant water -- is not disturbed.

People suffering from dengue fever have been identified in the Ampur
Mae Sareang, with 6 total patients hospitalized. The Mae Sareang
Hospital in association with the local public health office and
school administrators of the Mae Hong Sorn province have opened a
campaign aimed at preventing the spread of dengue fever among
children, after discovering 6 incidents of dengue fever both in
adults and children in the province.
Mrs. Arounong Khamthai, head of the public health office of Ampur Mae
Sareang, revealed that a rising trend of class 4 dengue fever has
been found in the Mae Hong Sorn province. Currently, public health

Local health officials in Zamboanga City have employed the assistance
of residents in a cleanliness drive as part of the city government's
dengue-prevention program.
Local health officials also focused their campaign on the destruction
of breeding grounds of mosquito larvae to prevent mass production of
the mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus.
The task to eliminate the dengue carrier adult mosquitoes, which a
local health official said could be easily killed through fogging,
are left to 4 fumigator teams of the health office.
Dr. Marbella Jamela, dengue coordinator of the local health office,
said each dengue-carrier mosquito lays eggs in 4 batches at 400 eggs
in each batch, which is the reason there is a need to focus on
breeding ground destruction.
City health officer Rodel Agbulos disclosed that there were a total
of 125 dengue cases registered in his office, with 2 deaths recorded
since January this year [2006]. "We reviewed our cases of dengue
fever in the past months; it still exists. There was never a time it
reached zero," Agbulos disclosed. However, he said it has not yet
reached alarming levels compared to last year [2005], when almost 80
cases a week were registered in local hospitals. He said they have
readied a schedule to fumigate all the schools in this city on or
before the opening of classes for the protection of the thousands of
students who are expected to troop to different schoolrooms in the
city on Monday [5 Jun 2006].

Three persons dead because of dengue in Santiago de Cuba
-----------------------------------------------
Though authorities [have not given] official data and information,
this situation has been confirmed by health care workers. We learned
that 3 people died in this current dengue fever epidemic; however,
since we do not have more precise information, we cannot rule out
that more deaths may have occurred.
The problem is more serious than it may seem, since it is related to
infrastructure. It has been more than 10 years since we've had the
presence of dengue fever in Santiago de Cuba, and we currently have
many health facilities that have been rehabilitated in order to take
care of the more severely affected cases, since most of the sick
people are isolated within their own homes, where they have to stay
under a bed net all the time in order to avoid becoming a source of
transmission for their relatives and neighbors. All additional
hospital admissions are suspended; only extremely urgent surgical
procedures are being performed.
Health authorities are doing their best at mobilizing support
personnel from neighboring municipalities for the fumigation
campaign, and more personnel from Matanzas province are awaited to
work in Santiago de Cuba city, where more cases have been reported.

A dengue fever outbreak is affecting Chulucanas citizens, according
to the Epidemiology Director
-----------------------------------------------
A classic dengue fever outbreak has affected 180 persons in
Chulucanas city during the past 2 months, Head of the Epidemiology
Office from the Piura (Department) Regional Health Direction Dr. Ciro
Garcia said yesterday [28 May 2006].
Dr. Garcia explained that these are cases that have been registered
since last March [2006] because of a greater presence of the mosquito
vector (_Aedes aegypti_) coming from Central America.
"All cases were controlled in time, and no deaths have occurred,
since no dengue hemorrhagic fever cases have been reported," declared
Dr. Garcia to Andina press agency.
Chulucanas, capital city of Morropon Province, has 34 000
inhabitants, and most of them work in manufacturing handcrafts,
particularly pottery.
In 2001, the last dengue epidemics occurred in this city, leading to
800 persons affected and 100 deaths [accounting for a very high
fatality rate of 12.5 percent].
Dr. Garcia pointed out that facing the current situation, household
fumigation and an information campaign have been implemented in order
to prevent conditions that may lead to an increased presence of the
mosquito vector.
"In coordination with healthcare networks, the regional government
and NGOs, advertising spots are requesting the population to be
careful about water containers so they do not become mosquito
breeding sites," he said.
Dr. Garcia added that a medical office exclusive for dengue fever
cases has been established in Chulucanas health center, and this
office is open every day. "The situation begins to improve as long as
the population participates in control measures and seeks help as
soon as the very 1st symptoms appear. We hope that no epidemics will
occur."
Dengue fever's initial symptoms include an increase in body
temperature, joint pain and severe muscle ache, and the hemorrhagic
form may lead to death.
