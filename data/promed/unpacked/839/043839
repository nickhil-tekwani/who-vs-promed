Dear Colleagues,
I am writing to you from Bangkok, where I am attending the 15th International Congress on Infectious Diseases (ICID). When I attend meetings like this, I am reminded of how small a community those of us who work on infectious diseases comprise and how great are the challenges we face.

Last week, we heard speakers from South Africa, China, Switzerland, Australia, France, and the US address tuberculosis, hepatitis B, HIV, dengue, cholera, shigellosis, and typhoid. Over the next few days we'll hear presentations on many other topics from every corner of the globe.

ICID has drawn more than 2500 doctors, nurses, researchers, and public health experts from 120 countries who share a common goal: reducing the toll and relieving the suffering caused by infectious disease all over the world. This is, of course, the same goal ProMED strives for.

As a community, it is important to get together every few years at conferences like ICID to exchange ideas, stories, new approaches, accomplishments, and lessons learned. But you and I also do this every day through the community which reading and contributing to ProMED creates. Each ProMED-mail post reaches over 60 000 people with similar interests dedicated to the same goal. Each post we read confirms our participation in a community which spans the globe. Being part of this community is meaningful to me, which is why I contribute every year. Is it also important to you?

Please make a donation to support ProMED-mail at http://www.isid.org/donate/PMM_donate.shtml

Since I wrote to you earlier this month, 120 additional people have given to support ProMED. Over the past year, about 1400 individuals and institutions have demonstrated their commitment to reducing the toll and relieving the suffering caused by infectious disease by helping to nurture the ProMED community. But their generosity is not enough. We have raised not quite one third of the amount needed to maintain a worldwide staff of 35 infectious disease experts who do the research, vetting, writing, and editing needed to publish ProMED-mail every day, 365 days each year. We also need your help!

Many people stretch to the limit of what they can afford because ProMED is that important to them. I am not asking you to do that. If every reader were to donate a modest amount, ProMED-mail's future would be assured. Only you can decide what you can afford to give, only you can decide what being part of the ProMED community is worth to you. Perhaps a fraction of what you spend each year on mobile connectivity? Or maybe coffee (or beer) money for a week?

We all benefit from the commitment and selflessness of those who give most generously; please join me in saying thank you! to them by following their lead: http://www.isid.org/donate/PMM_donate.shtml. Please give something today.
