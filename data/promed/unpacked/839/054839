The Ministry of Agriculture has launched an investigation into the conduct of the previous vaccination campaign [against FMD] and blamed veterinarians for its failure. FMD outbreaks [have been] registered in the provinces of El Bayadh, Saida, El Oued, Ghardaia, and Sidi Bel Abbes.

The minister of agriculture, Abdelwahab Nouri, ordered, in writing, to the governors of the Republic to undertake a new vaccination campaign against FMD, which reappeared in several provinces despite considerable efforts in the past year [2014] to overcome the epizootic and concerns that it had raised. The minister has also asked the governors to enforce all necessary measures for the preparedness to a possible new emergency recognizing that the epidemiological situation of the disease was becoming alarming, despite the availability of vaccines to fight against this new epizootic.

Vaccination should be repeated in all the provinces of the country except Adrar, Illizi, and Tindouf; it must cover all sheep, goats and cattle aged 3 months or more, even if they had been vaccinated before.

In addition, municipal authorities must be involved in field operations and security forces must be in charge of the control of vaccination certificates and certificates issued by veterinarians to allow movement of animals.

Veterinary Services recorded 12 FMD outbreaks in the province of El Bayadh. The 1st outbreak, which occurred in sheep, was detected in Bougtob; it was followed by 30 new cases in the region of Rogassa and 10 other outbreaks in the same province. These occurrences have led to the decision to close the livestock markets, to impose quarantine and to control the transport of animals. The Ministry of Agriculture has reported a single case of FMD in sheep in the province of Saida, another case in a bull in the province of El Oued, and 15 cases in sheep in the province of Sidi Bel Abbes. Also, 2 cases were suspected in the province of Ghardaia, specifically one in each of the municipalities of Addaya Ben Dahoa and Al Grara.

The Ministry of Agriculture has opened a detailed investigation into the conduct of the previous vaccination campaign after the discovery of the new cases, and the results of the survey showed many shortcomings in the implementation of the previous vaccination program in a number of provinces.

[Taking into account that small ruminants (sheep and goats) were not covered by FMD vaccination during the 2014 epizootic, and livestock markets were reopened on the occasion of Eid-Al Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice) when the epidemic was not yet under control, it is not surprising to see the disease appear or reappear in a number of Algerian provinces, namely the 5 mentioned in this article plus Tiaret and perhaps Tissemsilt where the disease was once suspected (see ProMED-MENA archive no 20150323.3247770).

Small ruminants may have served as asymptomatic virus carriers when the disease evolved mainly in cattle and at the occasion of the ongoing transhumance season, clinical outbreaks occurred in sheep due to the stress caused by malnutrition and displacement.

The province of El Bayadh where the highest number of FMD outbreaks was reported had not been part of the 2014 vaccination campaign. - Mod.AB

Subscribers are also referred to ProMED-MENA posting "Undiagnosed die-off, livestock - Algeria: (Naama) RFI", archive no. 20150419.3307537. The posting, published on 19 Apr 2015, was translated, edited, and moderated by Mod.AB; it included media-derived information on "A climate of anxiety (which) prevails in Naama province following an outbreak of a disease of unknown cause in small ruminants and some cattle". See at http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/articles/240257.html. The cases, reportedly including some mortalities, were described by the local newspaper in general terms and with insufficient epidemiological and clinical detail. They were reported from 3 communities, namely Ben Ammar, Mecheria, and Ain Safra. Several animals died; vaccination was mentioned but no details given.

The ProMED-MENA published RFI is being repeated; it will be appreciated if the said information could be confirmed or otherwise by official agencies, in particular (hopefully) excluding FMD and establishing the etiology. The Naama province -- a steppe, sheep grazing region -- is situated on Algeria's western border, between the recently FMD-infected province El Bayadh and Morocco's territory. -Mod.AS
