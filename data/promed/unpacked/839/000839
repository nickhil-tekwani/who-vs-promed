Oilseed rape is now starting to flower in all but the later-sown or
backward crops. Walking through a few crops last week, I was surprised to
find that the incidence of light leaf spot had risen to alarming levels
compared to a relatively clean crop a couple of weeks ago.

The symptoms from the disease look a little like fertiliser damage and,
where the infection is particularly bad on the leaf, it will take on quite
a curled up look. Immediate action is needed where the disease reaches this
level. Research has shown that, where 25 per cent or more of plants are
affected, control is economically viable, with an application of a fungicide.

The spring survey of commercially grown winter oilseed rape is currently
underway, and most of the crops have now been assessed for disease.
Provisional results show that light leaf spot levels and severity are
higher than in recent years. 65 per cent of crops assessed were affected.
The highest incidence has been found in samples from the north and the
south west.

[Light leaf spot (LLS) in _Brassica_ spp. is caused by the fungus
_Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. In the UK, it has been reported to cause yield
losses of oilseed rape of up to 1.5 t/ha, at an estimated cost of more than
GBP 30 million (USD about 59.4 million). It is rarely very damaging on
other brassicas. Leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain
symptomless until pale green or water soaked lesions which are brittle and
crack easily, appear on older leaves. LLS can cause severe damage if it
attacks the flower buds before stem extension and can cause the buds to
rot. Developing pods are often infected, leading to premature ripening of
seed pods and pod shatter.

LLS is a polycyclic disease. The fungus survives the summer on debris from
the previous crop and to a lesser extent on volunteer and vegetable
brassicas. Crop infection is initiated by wind-blown sexual spores in the
autumn and develops through subsequent cycles caused by rain-splashed
asexual spores resulting in characteristic patches of disease by spring. It
is thought that a 2nd sexual cycle takes place on decaying plant material
releasing a 2nd flush of spores. Disease management includes use of
varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility to LLS, disease
monitoring, and timely applications of fungicides.
