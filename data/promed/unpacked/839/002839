Poultry producers in Dufferin County [Ontario] are being warned after a flock of chickens tested positive for an infectious disease near Shelburne.

Earlier this month [April 2017], the Feather Board Command Centre (FBCC), a partner of the Chicken Farmers of Ontario, issued an infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) disease advisory to all poultry producers within a 10-kilometre [6.2 mi] zone southwest of Shelburne.

The advisory was released after Ontario's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) confirmed birds from a small backyard dual-purpose chicken flock near Shelburne tested positive for ILT.

"Please reinforce your biosecurity protocols if working with flocks or travelling through this part of Dufferin County," the FBCC's advisory warned poultry producers. "Suspend all non-essential visits. For essential visits, apply the following recommended biosecurity measures: wearing boots, protective suits, hats and gloves/hand washing."

ILT is an acute herpes viral respiratory tract infection of chickens and pheasants that can result in severe production losses due to excessive mortality, decreased growth rates and decreased egg production.

[Signs] in birds can include increased mortality, noisy breathing, head-shaking, off feed, decreased egg production, inactivity, ruffled feathers, and conjunctivitis.

ILT is usually considered to be a backyard flock problem. However, this disease continues to plague the poultry industry with sporadic episodes across the province of Ontario. Due to the persistent, latent, infectious nature of the virus, it can perpetuate itself, even after vaccination.

ILT is not transmittable to humans. Since cooking will destroy any virus present, it is also safe for humans to eat meat and eggs from birds with ILT.

The positive Shelburne area lab submission came through the small flock surveillance project administered by the OMAFRA and the University of Guelph.

Ministry staff have provided advice to the owner of the small flock and his veterinarian to ensure proper biosecurity and disease control measures are implemented.

The OMAFRA reports ILT may affect 5 to 80 per cent of an exposed flock, taking 2 to 4 weeks to go through an entire flock. Infected birds usually die but can recover within 7 to 10 days. Mortality can climb as high as 20 per cent in an infected flock.

"It should be emphasized that it is always recommended producers work with their poultry veterinarian for diagnosis and to develop treatment and prevention/vaccination strategies," the OMAFRA reports.

"Mixing of birds should only be done when a complete history of the birds is available, and it is absolutely certain that a potential ILT 'carrier' is not present," the ministry adds. "Sanitation procedures, which include disinfection of equipment, boots and clothing and proper disposal of litter and carcasses, are essential components of ILT control."

[Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute, highly contagious herpesvirus infection of chickens and pheasants characterized by severe dyspnea, coughing, and rales. It can also be a subacute disease with nasal and ocular discharge, tracheitis, conjunctivitis, and mild rales. The disease is caused by _Gallid herpesvirus 1_, commonly known as infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV).

There are a number of different tests capable of confirming this disease, including virus isolation and histology; and a rapid test is PCR, just to mention a few.

Vaccination is done with live attenuated vaccines and viral vector recombinant vaccines. - Mod.TG
