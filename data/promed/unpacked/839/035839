Infant Botulism - New York City, 2001-2002
------------------------------------------------
Infant botulism results from germination of swallowed spores of botulinum
toxin-producing clostridia that colonize the large intestine temporarily. 4
cases of type B infant botulism in one New York City (NYC) borough were
diagnosed within 12-months in 2001 and 2002. All 4 patients resided in
Staten Island (2000 population: 443 728). The annual incidence of infant
botulism in the United States is 2 cases per 100 000 live births; incidence
in NYC is 4 cases per 100 000 live births. Staten Island recorded 5899 live
births in 2000; the incidence of infant botulism during this 12 month
period was 68 cases per 100 000 live births. This report summarizes the
investigation of these 4 cases; as expected with infant botulism, a common
source of exposure was not identified. All 4 patients recovered after
treatment and were discharged from local hospitals. State and local health
departments should be notified promptly when infant botulism is suspected
to arrange diagnostic testing.
Infant botulism is a reportable disease in NYC, and the NYC Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) investigates all suspected cases.
Botulism should be suspected in an infant aged <12 months with symptoms
including constipation, lethargy, poor feeding, weak cry, bulbar palsies,
and failure to thrive. These symptoms may be followed by progressive
weakness, impaired respiration, and sometimes death.
Laboratory diagnosis of clinically suspect cases requires detection of
botulinum toxin in stool or serum by using the mouse neutralization assay
or the isolation of toxigenic _Clostridium botulinum_ (or related toxigenic
clostridia) in the feces by using enrichment culture techniques (1). When
botulism is suspected, clinical specimens are forwarded to the DOHMH Public
Health Laboratory for toxin detection. Parents or caregivers are
interviewed by using a standardized questionnaire on clinical symptoms and
risk factors, and the physician is interviewed or charts are abstracted for
information on signs and symptoms.
Case Reports
Case 1. In June 2001, a previously healthy breast-fed infant aged 7 weeks
with fever of 105 deg F (41 deg C), constipation, listlessness, poor
feeding, and weak head control for one day was admitted to a New Jersey
hospital. The infant was irritable and had sluggishly reactive pupils,
altered cry, somnolence, respiratory weakness, and upper airway obstruction
that necessitated mechanical ventilation for 13 days. Botulinum toxin type
B was identified 8 days after the onset of illness in stool samples at the
New Jersey Public Health and Environmental Laboratories. The patient was
discharged after 26 days without sequelae and recovered fully.
Case 2. In December 2001, a formula-fed infant aged 10 weeks with a history
of constipation in the first month of life was admitted to a hospital after
having difficulty in sucking and swallowing for 2 days. Mechanical
ventilation was required for 10 days because of respiratory failure. The
infant was irritable and had loss of facial expression, generalized muscle
weakness, and constipation. Infant botulism was diagnosed 29 days after
onset of symptoms by detection of toxin type B in stool enrichment
cultures. The patient was treated with Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous
(human) (BIG-IV) and discharged after 20 days; the infant recovered fully.
Case 3. In May 2002, a previously healthy breast-fed infant aged 18 weeks
had somnolence and difficulty swallowing for 1 day. The infant was admitted
to a hospital and subsequently had altered cry, loss of facial expression,
respiratory muscle weakness, and upper airway obstruction that required
mechanical ventilation for 8 days. The patient also had an intussusception
without a recognizable lead point (2). A diagnosis of botulism was
established 19 days after onset of symptoms by detection of toxin type B in
stool enrichment cultures. The infant was treated with BIG-IV, was
discharged after 16 days, and recovered fully.
Case 4. In June 2002, a previously healthy infant aged 3 weeks who was both
breast- and formula-fed had constipation, lethargy, and decreased appetite
for 2 days; the infant was brought to a hospital for evaluation and was
admitted the following day. The infant was irritable and had sluggish
pupillary reflexes, difficulty swallowing, altered cry, weak sucking, and
peripheral weakness. Botulism was diagnosed 8 days after onset of symptoms
by detection of toxin type B in stool samples. The patient was treated with
BIG-IV and discharged after 10 days; the infant recovered fully.
Summary of Cases
All 4 patients received antibiotics during hospitalization. None had
ingested honey or had parents employed in occupations that might increase
exposure to _C. botulinum_ spores in soil and dust (for example,
construction, plumbing, and farming) (3). All patients had uncomplicated
gestational histories and vaginal deliveries. All lived within a 6 mile
radius of each other. All parents reported recent construction in their
neighborhoods during the period (range: 1-31 days) before illness onset. In
the fourth case, the infant's home had been remodeled since the infant was
born.
On 30 May 2002, after 3 cases had been identified by routine passive
surveillance, DOHMH alerted local physicians by broadcast facsimile and
email about the increased rate of infant botulism in Staten Island.
Physicians were reminded to consider the diagnosis and to report suspected
cases to DOHMH to request assistance with diagnostic testing. Physicians
were directed to contact the California Department of Health Services
(CDHS) Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program about possible
treatment with BIG-IV under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
protocol (4). All parents of patients in Staten Island were reinterviewed
by using an expanded questionnaire and visited in their homes and
neighborhoods to assess for possible common sources of exposure; no such
source was identified.

Editorial Note:
Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the United
States (1); about 100 cases are reported among infants in the United States
annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults
(2,5,6). Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial
production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _C.
botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been
proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source
of some causative spores (4). A common source of exposure generally is not
identified; apparent clusters such as the 4 Staten Island cases are rare
and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete (7). In a
cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic
region of the United States, no common source of exposure was identified (8).
Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged <12 months
who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or
crying; hypotonia; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness.
About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during
hospitalization (9). Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield
normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid
weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health
departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing.
The primary therapy for infant botulism is intensive care with mechanically
assisted ventilation when necessary. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of
infant botulism with BIG-IV might reduce the length of time needed for
recovery. In a placebo-controlled trial of BIG-IV, the mean hospital stay
of patients with infant botulism was reduced from 5.6 to 2.6 weeks (4).
Therapy is guided by clinical diagnosis; to avoid delay in treatment,
BIG-IV should be requested and administered without awaiting laboratory
confirmation. BIG-IV can be obtained from the CDHS Infant Botulism
Treatment and Prevention Program, telephone 510-540-2646. Use of BIG-IV
under the FDA-approved Treatment Investigational New Drug open-label
protocol requires informed parental consent and coordination with the
hospital's institutional review board (IRB). The license application for
BIG-IV was filed with FDA in 2001; should it be licensed, IRB approval
would no longer be required. Infant botulism is notifiable at the national
level, and physicians should report all cases promptly to state and local
health departments.

[I was the Infectious Diseases consulting physician for case 3, and the
response to BIG-IV was quite impressive. It is important to realize that
the disease can occur in totally breast-fed babies as this infant was. Â­
